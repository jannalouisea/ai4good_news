The RCMP in Sicamous and Salmon Arm say they responded Wednesday evening to the crash involving two semi-tractor trailers, an SUV and three pick-up trucks.

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

RCMP Sgt. Murray McNeil says it's lucky no one was killed considering the extensive damage to each vehicle and the length the semi travelled before coming to a stop.",[]

Early on, many long-term care and assisted living facilities were impacted, but most new cases now are in the broader community. The increase in new cases in recent days made provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix “concerned.”

“No one wants to get sick with COVID-19, nor do we want to inadvertently pass it onto others,” said Henry. “While the symptoms can be mild, it is a complex illness that has serious consequences.

Dix and Henry also announced 21 new cases today, including two epi-linked cases, for a total of 3,149 in British Columbia. ‘Epi-linked’ means that public health investigations have shown that cases meet the case definition for COVID-19 but may not have been tested for a number of reasons.

There were no new related deaths, healthcare facility outbreaks or community outbreaks.

2,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7776/alberta-mountie-gets-probation-for-in-custody-assault-on-indigenous-man,Alberta Mountie gets probation for in-custody assault on Indigenous man,[],,"HIGH PRAIRIE, Alta. — A Mountie has been given 15 months probation for assaulting an Indigenous man shortly after his arrest in northern Alberta.

A judge convicted Const. Licio Soares, an eight-year RCMP veteran, in May of assaulting 32-year-old Vernon Laboucan at the Slave Lake RCMP detachment in September 2017.

As part of his probation, Soares is required to complete 150 hours of community service as well as an education course on the historical harm the RCMP has had on Indigenous communities.

The assault came shortly after an intoxicated Laboucan was arrested for mischief.

Video shown in court showed the officer taking Laboucan to the ground headfirst, and landing several blows to his head and back after Laboucan tossed his sweater at Soares.

Alberta's agency that investigates police actions said Laboucan, who has a criminal record, was not seriously hurt.

""This is a serious crime because of the breach of trust by an on-duty officer involving a vulnerable prisoner,"" Judge Robert Marceau said Wednesday during a phone hearing in High Prairie provincial court.

""After throwing him to the ground, the officer had ample opportunity to step back and reassess the situation.""

The soundless video was entered into court as an exhibit during Laboucan's mischief prosecution and was obtained first by CTV News.

The mischief charge was later stayed.

Prosecutor Jason Neustaeter had argued that Soares should receive a conditional sentence of up to 90 days, as well as probation.

""(Laboucan) was brought to the detachment for his own protection,"" said Neustaeter, who noted that the man was unable to stand at the time of the video. ""Const. Soares was in a position of trust.""

""Mr. Laboucan was a person who was vulnerable in those circumstances.""

Defence lawyer James McLeod wanted a conditional discharge. He argued that Soares was already been subject to internal RCMP discipline that resulted in a $3,300 fine.

He added that the officer faces ""significant work limitations"" stemming from that discipline, including being forbidden from arresting, detaining or investigating civilians.

McLeod said Soares misinterpreted Laboucan's actions.

""This was not an offence motivated by frustration or anger. In Const. Soares's mind, he was reacting to the situation in front of him.""

The Mountie has undergone counselling, McLeod added.

Laboucan said he has no memory of what happened. In his victim impact statement, read by the judge, he said he felt ""hurt and disgusted"" after seeing the video.

""I thought, 'How can someone do that to me when I was so out of it? Why pick on a native on the street that was so highly intoxicated?'

“After the assault, when I was on the street, I felt unsafe. I felt like the cops are always out to get me.""

The RCMP said Soares has transferred out of the Slave Lake detachment to a Calgary-based federal intelligence unit.

The officer addressed court Wednesday and apologized for his actions.

""I’m sorry for what I have done. I take full responsibility,"" he said. ""I thought I was acting appropriately. I recognize now that I was not.""

Cpl. Laurel Scott wrote in an email to CTV News that it was anticipated the Mountie's duty status would be reviewed after the sentencing.

The RCMP said he had no previous disciplinary issues.

The first lemon was found June 22 tied with twine to a branch in Gates Park and a complaint was made to the city of Port Coquitlam.

Police say the second lemon was found July 14 on a trail near the Coquitlam River.

That discovery was reported in an email to the community police station, which was closed, and by the time police received the email, the evidence had been thrown away and an investigation was impossible.

Photos of the lemons show they were cut in half, the rinds skewered with long sewing needles, and each was tied to tree limbs.

David Sidoo, who played professional football for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and B.C. Lions, lowered his head into his hands and cried as U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton chided him for his actions. Sidoo told the judge he's “deeply ashamed.""

“I make no excuses. I broke the law. I pled guilty to a crime and now I must pay for my actions,” Sidoo said.

Earlier Wednesday, Karen Littlefair of Newport Beach, California, asked U.S District Judge Allison Burroughs for leniency before being sentenced to more than a month in prison for the online course scam. Littlefair said she was “truly sorry” and called the experience a “nightmare” for her family.

“I acted out of love for my son but I ended up hurting my son greatly,” said Littlefair, 57.

Court heard she paid $9,000 to have online classes taken on her son’s behalf.

Both Sidoo and Littlefair appeared before the Boston federal court judges via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.

They are among more than 50 people charged in the college cheating scheme involving wealthy parents and athletic coaches at elite universities across the country. Authorities say the parents worked with the admissions consultant at the centre of the scam, Rick Singer, to have someone cheat on their kids’ exams or get them admitted to selective schools with fake athletic credentials.

Sidoo was CEO of mining firm Advantage Lithium Corp. when he was arrested last year. He was also a founding shareholder of an oil and gas company that was sold in 2010 for more than $600 million.

The Vancouver businessman paid Singer $200,000 to have someone pose as his sons using a fake ID to secure higher scores on their SATs, prosecutors said. Sidoo also worked with Singer to craft an admission essay for his son with a bogus story about the teen being held at gunpoint by Los Angeles gang members and saved by a rival gang member named “Nugget,” prosecutors said.

Last month, the B.C. government said Sidoo has been stripped of his membership in the Order of British Columbia, a process that began after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud on March 13.

Sidoo is also known for his philanthropic causes in British Columbia.

After Littlefair’s son was put on academic probation by Georgetown University, she hired Singer’s company to take four online classes on his behalf so he could graduate in 2018, prosecutors said. Three of the courses were taken through Georgetown, prosecutors said, while one was taken online at Arizona State University and then transferred to Georgetown.

Littlefair demanded a discount on the cheating after the person earned a C in one of the courses, authorities said.

“Kind of thought there would have been a discount on that one. The grade was a C and the experience was a nightmare,” she told Singer’s accountant in an email, according to court documents.

Burroughs told Littlefair she taught her son “it’s OK to cheat, it’s OK to take shortcuts.”

“You’re supposed to get more by earning it and working for it and I think that’s a lesson your son needs to learn and sadly he’s going to learn it the hard way here,” the judge said.

Nearly 30 parents have pleaded guilty in the case.

Others include “Full House” actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who admitted to paying half a million dollars to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake crew recruits.

They are scheduled to be sentenced next month. If the judge accepts their plea deals, Loughlin will be sentenced to two months in prison and Giannulli will be sentenced to five months.

The proposed changes will also enhance WorkSafeBC’s ability to investigate workplace incidents, while keeping premiums low. Changes include:

• R aising the maximum annual salary amount on which workers’ compensation benefits are based

• A uthorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before a claim is accepted

• G iving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants that are appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions;

• Giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

This legislation will fast-track the effective date of presumptions if established by WorkSafeBC’s board of directors for occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens. The presumption would simplify the process for workers who make a workers’ compensation claim if they contract viruses on the job. This would ensure that people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to access benefits more quickly.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, WorkSafeBC is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. As well, WorkSafeBC is waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for the duration of the program.",[]

The decision was made by city council at Monday night’s meeting after a recommendation from Coun. Michael Wolfe. Moncton Street will be closed between No. 1 Road and Third Avenue, and Bayview Street will be one-way westbound between No. 1 Road and Third Avenue.

The same restrictions on Canada Day—which staff said cost $13,350 in total—have led city council to continue to discuss the possibility of future street closures.

“Changes need to happen in Steveston, especially right now with so many cyclists and people walking—but it’s always busy on the weekends,” said Coun. Carol Day. “I think the time has come to really look at what our options are.”

Both Day and Coun. Harold Steves expressed support for a one-way model on some streets. This would allow for widening of pedestrian walkways in addition to parking for those in need.

“This is a pandemic, not a traffic decision,” said Coun. Kelly Greene. She pointed to other cities and neighbourhoods that have become pedestrianized as a response to the pandemic, indicating that Steveston should do the same at least on a Friday to Sunday basis through the summer.

Coun. Chak Au added it’s important Steveston merchants know city council is still discussing future plans for closures, and has not yet made a permanent decision—so input is still being welcomed.

“The door is not closed,” he said.

Councillors debated closing the same streets for all of August, but this was defeated by a narrow margin. Cost was a large factor in the discussion.",[]

The new information comes from the BC farm cash receipts—which track revenues from sale of agricultural commodities, program payments from government agencies and payments from private crop and livestock insurance programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for farmers, but last year the sector grew with a record $3.9 billion in sales. This represents an increase of more than 13 per cent, or $462 million more, from 2018.

“COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the importance of our province’s self-sufficiency,” said Agriculture Minister Lana Popham. “I urge everyone to continue to show their appreciation for our farmers and support our local food system by making a special effort to Buy BC.”

Areas of growth included a close to $300-million increase in cannabis sales, along with a $47-million increase in dairy sales, a $25-million increase in beef sales and a $17.5-million increase in field vegetable sales.

More BC farm workers are needed to ensure BC’s agriculture sector remains strong and well positioned to provide the fresh, local food that people need, through a healthy, robust food system. In every region, farmers and producers play a crucial role in contributing to both the local economy and the overall provincial economy.

“Connecting more British Columbians to agriculture jobs and careers is more important than ever as we work to restart the economy and keep this momentum going,” Popham said. “We are working together with industry as we focus on restarting our farming sector.”

COVID-19 symptoms can be mild, making it very easy to spread the virus to those around us. That is why foundational rules for safe social interactions are so important.

“While the provincial health officer’s order is for no more than 50 people at any gathering, fewer faces and bigger spaces is our guide to move forward. This is important to remember when attending private parties, which tend to be indoors, gathering people from a variety of places,” said Henry.

15,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7772/huawei-hopeful-it-can-provide-5g-to-canada-despite-trump-five-eyes-pressure,"Huawei hopeful it can provide 5G to Canada despite, Trump, Five Eyes pressure",[],,"OTTAWA — Huawei Canada says it is collateral damage in the Trump administration's trade war with China and remains hopeful that it might still be able to sell next-generation internet equipment to Canada.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

The existing Vista mine, which is owned by the U.S. coal giant Cline Group, began shipping coal in May 2019 and the company is now looking to double, or possibly even triple, its output.

Fraser Thomson is a lawyer for Ecojustice, one of 47 environment, Indigenous, health and faith-based organizations that this week wrote to Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson asking him to take a second look at the expansion.

Wilkinson declined in December to order a federal impact assessment of the project in Hinton, Alta., saying the potential risks to the environment and Indigenous rights would be dealt with by a provincial approval process.

Thomson says the mine produces coal solely for export to make electricity in Asia, which he says flies in the face of Canada's international project to convince the world to stop using coal as a power source.

Canada is phasing out its coal-power plants by the end of this decade but Thomson says continuing to export thermal coal for foreign power plants undermines Canada's efforts.",[]

Vogrig said he and his father Brian were catching sockeye at Alberni Inlet as part of their stock-assessment work for Fisheries and Oceans Canada when they hauled in the barracuda.

""We couldn't believe it,"" he said from his home in Vancouver. ""The fish was docile because it was being chased by some seals and one of the seals actually nipped it on its tail so it had a little gash on it.""

The duo placed the weak, predatory fish in a tank to recover for about 30 minutes and contacted Fisheries and Oceans.

They snapped some photos of the fish, which he believed weighed about five kilograms, before releasing it.

Now, they have quite a tale to tell about an adventure earlier this month aboard their purse seiner, the Nita Maria.

""It's just really cool and there's just no chance I'll ever forget that,"" Vogrig said.

His father has been fishing for 40 years and had never seen a barracuda in British Columbia waters, he said.

Jackie King, a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, said the presence of Pacific barracuda in British Columbia waters is rare.

""But we have had some recorded in our commercial fisheries as far back as 1987 and then huge gaps between when they're appearing again,"" King said, adding a barracuda was spotted in British Columbia in 2016 and 2019.

The fish are normally found in Baja California in Mexico, bordering the state of California, but have also recently been seen as far north as Washington state neighbouring B.C., likely due to warming waters at home, she said.

The project, which covers an entire block of the Gay Village neighbourhood, was inspired by those in other cities but has taken on a distinctive Montreal flair.

Organizer Carla Beauvais said in order to get support from the city, the group agreed to paint the phrase in French, with a smaller English translation underneath.

She said she sees the decision as a positive one, however, because it highlights the diversity of the movement fighting racism and inequality.

Following George Floyd's death in police custody in May 2020, protesters took to the streets around the world to denounce anti-Black racism and police violence. The project in Montreal an initiative of Fondation Dynastie, which celebrates the contributions Black and racialized Montrealers, and the Never Was Average artists' collective.

On Wednesday, curious onlookers stopped to take photos and chat with the paint-splattered artists, who created colourful patterns in the letters that had been laid on the street the previous day by community groups.

Beauvais said the goal of the project is to let the artists express what they're feeling.

""We usually hear a lot of activist people when we talk about Black Lives Matter, rarely do we see what the artists are feeling,"" she said at the site.

Awa Banmana, a 24-year-old artist and student, was filling in a large yellow letter 'M' with emblems she said reminded her of her identity as a Franco-Senegalese immigrant to Canada. That included her signature, a tribute to other artists, and images of Black women's faces.

""As an Afro-feminist, it's important to see black women represented in the public space, and not just those that are light-skinned,"" she said.

While she said most onlookers were supportive or curious, she said she'd run into a few critics, including some who used the ""All Lives Matter"" phrase that has come to be seen as an insult to the Black Lives Matter movement.

She said she wants people to know Black Lives Matter isn't uniquely about Black people. Rather, she said, it's about ""a bigger critique and conversation on the system and our society,"" led by Black people in solidarity with other groups who face oppression including those who are Indigenous, LGBTQ+, poor or disabled.

Another artist, who give his name as Simo, chose to paint Erzulie Freda, ""the voodoo goddess of love and health and beauty,"" in order to introduce Montrealers to a culture they might not be familiar with.

He admitted he'd been nervous about taking on such an ambitious design, but described the experience of painting on one of Montreal's most important streets as ""cathartic.""

""It's very empowering because I know most of these artists, and it feels like we're occupying the space,"" he said.

Beauvais said while the painting wasn't likely to please everyone, she hoped it would start a conversation about racism in both Canada and the United States.

While the situation in the two countries isn't the same, she said, ""we're not in a competition to be the least worst.""

""We're facing some disparities, there's stuff that needs to be changed, there's stuff that needs to be improved,"" Beauvais said. ""If we don't talk about them, it's not going to improve.""

Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante also expressed her support for the art piece, which is expected to remain until October.

21,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7754/pandemic-complicates-liberal-leadership-contest-that-will-elect-14th-nl-premier,Pandemic complicates Liberal leadership contest that will elect 14th N.L. premier,[],,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. — Newfoundland and Labrador will have a new premier in August as a Liberal leadership race disrupted by COVID-19 barrels ahead amid heightened scrutiny.

The contenders are Andrew Furey, a prominent surgeon and charity founder with family connections in Ottawa, and John Abbott, a former civil servant who has served in deputy minister roles.

Both have run physically distant campaigns in recent weeks, holding video-call town halls and maintaining a safe two-metre distance when out in public.

""It's a lot of looking at the green dot and engaging people through Zoom or other platforms,"" Furey said in a recent telephone interview.

Neither man has held elected office, and the governing Liberal caucus and cabinet have thrown their support behind Furey. The son of Sen. George Furey declared his candidacy shortly after Premier Dwight Ball announced his intention to resign in February, saying he would stay until his party chose a new leader.

Ball's commitment took on a new meaning as COVID-19 forced a public health state of emergency in March.

The Liberal race that had been set to pick a new leader in May was put on hold after people questioned the party's initial determination to forge ahead despite the pandemic.

Kelly Blidook, a political science professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland, calls the convergence of events ""a perfect storm of things going poorly"" for governing the oil-reliant, financially troubled province.

Now, with the first wave of the pandemic under control, voting is set to take place remotely between July 28 and Aug. 3.

The heightened stakes of choosing a premier not elected by popular vote, in the middle of a global crisis, have focused attention on party decisions that in other circumstances might have attracted little scrutiny.

""The moderation role of the committee overseeing everything has kind of been politicized,"" Blidook said. ""It's been front and centre in a way that we don't usually see to the same extent.""

Last month, Furey's campaign took issue with Abbott's advertisements declaring ""everyone can vote"" for a new leader when, Furey's camp argued, the vote is limited to party members and supporters.

In a decision reported by the online news outlet The Independent, the election committee did not find fault with Abbott's ads. But it did decide to robocall newly registered party supporters to gauge their true allegiances.

The review process led to about 1,000 people being found ineligible to vote for various reasons, though they were able to appeal the decision. Of those, 300 people — a small fraction of the 33,500 eligible voters — were knocked out over their perceived lack of support for the party's objectives. Some who considered themselves lifelong Liberal voters took issue with a process they saw as undemocratic.

Blidook says the party's approach to reviewing supporters was logical and fair, but the move may not have been worth the public blowback.

""I would have still advised them not to do it,"" Blidook said. ""To go through the optics to purge that tiny proportion of people, I think it probably hurts the party more than it helps.""

Furey defended the complaint about Abbott's ads, saying it was an issue of the integrity of the process, while noting the campaigns played no role in vetting supporters.

He also rejected the idea floated by some observers that the race is a ""coronation"" in which he is the clear front-runner backed by the party establishment.

""This is a full race, and I'm fighting to be successful,"" Furey said.

Furey said he'll continue to work with Ottawa on solutions for the province's financial woes and proposed the new role of a ""chief economic recovery officer"" to help his government ""perform damage control on the ship here.""

Abbott, who has campaigned on taking a tougher negotiating stance with Ottawa on financial matters, said the party could have done more to encourage voters to sign up. But now that the vetting issue has been mostly resolved, he said he's pleased to see more than 33,000 voters are engaged.

""That speaks volumes to me about the interest,"" Abbott said.

He acknowledged that as a candidate who has not held office before, he needs to win voters' trust. Abbott said his policy-focused campaign and experience with government has captured people's attention, even though the Liberal caucus supports his opponent.

""We'll see what happens, and we'll know that literally in three weeks,"" he said.

Investigators say they consider Martin Carpentier, 44, the key to understanding what happened to sisters Norah and Romy Carpentier, who were the subject of an Amber Alert last week before their bodies were discovered.

As the operation stretched into its seventh day Wednesday, Quebec provincial police scaled back their communications effort surrounding the manhunt. Late Tuesday, they took to social media to say they would no longer provide updates unless there was new information.

Earlier this week, Sgt. Anne Mathieu told The Canadian Press the search would continue as long as they had evidence to guide it.

""The day we won't have any further elements, then probably it will be the time to suspend what is going on here, but as long as we have the elements to pursue, we will be there,"" Mathieu said.

The search has been concentrated on a 50-square-kilometre area around the Quebec City suburb of St-Apollinaire, where the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located Saturday.

Police have said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a serious car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire one week ago, but there was nobody inside the vehicle when they arrived on scene.

An Amber Alert was launched Thursday but lifted two days later when the girls were found dead.

Provincial police said they found ""pertinent elements"" in the search area Sunday but as of Tuesday, they said it's unclear whether the suspect is alive or dead.

Autopsies were performed on the two girls, but police have declined to reveal the cause of death as long as Carpentier isn't found.

A funeral will be held for the sisters next Monday afternoon in Levis, Que., the girls' hometown.

On Wednesday, police combed the park where a memorial had been set up for the sisters following a tip about a sighting that proved unfounded.",[]

The face-covering mandates, lockdowns, health checks and quarantine orders underscored the reality that the number of infections is continuing to tick upward in parts of the world and that a return to normalcy may be farther off than many leaders had envisioned just weeks ago.

Alabama will begin requiring face masks after the state reported a pandemic-high of 40 deaths in a single day. In Texas, which again set a record Wednesday for confirmed new cases with nearly 10,800, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has increasingly emphasized face coverings as the state's way out of avoiding another lockdown, which he has not ruled out.

Among the sternest measures were in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo added to a list totalling 22 states whose visitors will be required to quarantine for 14 days if they visit the tri-state region. Out-of-state travellers arriving in New York airports from those states face a $2,000 fine and a mandatory quarantine order if they fail to fill out a tracing form.

The broad reach of the virus has brought scrutiny to governors' decisions. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a first-term Republican governor who has backed one of the country's most aggressive reopening plans, became the first U.S. governor to announce that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He plans to quarantine at home.

Stitt, who has resisted any statewide mandate on masks and rarely wears one himself, attended President Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa last month, which health experts have said likely contributed to a surge in coronavirus cases there, though Stitt said he’s confident he didn’t contract the virus at the gathering.

“As far as where he became infected, it’s really unknown,” Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye said.

Florida broke the 300,000 barrier on confirmed cases Wednesday, reporting 10,181 new ones as its daily average death rate continues to rise. Major cities in Florida have imposed mask rules, but Gov. Ron DeSantis has declined to issue a state-wide order, arguing those are best decided on and enforced locally.

Still, on Tuesday the governor wore a mask while speaking publicly for the first time — at a round-table news conference with Miami-Dade County mayors.

“We have broken single-day records several times this week and there’s nothing about it that says we’re turning the corner, or seeing light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t see that in the numbers,"" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, chief of trauma and surgical critical care at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

He said diminishing bed capacity is creating problems at the Miami medical centre . “We’re getting to the point where it’s going to be full. We have gridlock and we won’t be able to take patients and they’ll just be stacked in the ERs,” Namias said.

In Washington, a divided approach to the pandemic response spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion, with trade adviser Peter Navarro panning Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. Fauci called the criticism “nonsense” and “a bit bizarre.” Trump stepped in to referee, saying “we’re all on the same team.”

Businesses imposed their own restrictions, too, with Walmart becoming the largest U.S. retailer to require customers to wear face coverings at all of its Sam’s Club and namesake stores.

Recreation and entertainment destinations were confronting how and when to return to business.

Organizers cancelled the 2021 Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, because of the pandemic's impact on long-range planning for the New Year’s tradition, the Tournament of Roses Association said Wednesday. But Disney World went ahead with the rolling opening of its Florida theme parks that started last weekend, welcoming back visitors to Epcot and Hollywood Studios — despite the surge of cases in the state.

States around the country reported alarming spikes in cases, even as officials in some of the states simultaneously pushed forward with plans to reopen schools in the fall. Kansas and Missouri each reported about 900 new cases in a trend that the head of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment described as “awful.” Montana also reported a record number of new confirmed cases.

At least three dozen high school students in northern Illinois tested positive for the coronavirus after some attending summer sports camps showed symptoms of the illness.

Other countries imposed lockdowns and implemented new health checks at their borders.

All travellers arriving in Greece from a land border with Bulgaria were required to carry negative coronavirus test results issued in the previous 72 hours. The new rules, which follow an increase in tourism-related COVID-19 cases, triggered an immediate drop in arrivals compared to recent days.

Traffic at the crossing fell by about half, authorities said, but a line of cars and trucks was over 500 metres (yards) long as the number of tests carried out by medical teams at the border were increased.

Gergana Chaprazova, 51, from Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria, planned to visit the Greek seaside town of Kavala with her husband, and complained that she was being tested again.

“I have to wait for a test but I (already) have a test from Bulgaria. I don’t understand why I must have a test here,” she told The Associated Press.

The developments came as more than than 13 million coronavirus cases were confirmed worldwide, with over 578,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons including limited testing.

Romania, citing the rising number of infections, announced a 30-day extension of a nationwide state of alert. And residents of Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, were warned Wednesday to comply with lockdown regulations or face tougher restrictions. Melbourne’s 5 million people and part of the city’s semi-rural surroundings are a week into a new, six-week lockdown to contain a new outbreak there.

“The time for warnings, the time for cutting people slack, is over,” Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said. “Where we are is in a very serious and deadly position.”

After a surge in daily infections beginning last month, Israel moved last week to reimpose restrictions, closing events spaces, live show venues, bars and clubs. It has imposed lockdowns on areas with high infection rates, which in some cases sparked protests from residents.

Officials warned that if case numbers don’t come down in the coming days, Israel will have no choice but to lock the entire country down again, as it did in the spring.

South Africa is already showing signs of being overwhelmed by the pandemic — an ominous outlook for the rest of the continent of 1.3 billion people.

A ban on alcohol sales and a night curfew were reimposed this week to reduce the volume of trauma patients to hospitals that are struggling to cope with an influx of COVID-19 patients.

One result was more economic pain in a country which already has a high unemployment rate of 30 per cent.

“This return to the booze ban is causing havoc to the restaurant business, and it’s causing people to lose jobs,” said Gerald Elliot, owner of a popular Johannesburg restaurant, Ba Pita, which he said closed as a result of the restrictions, with a loss of 28 jobs.

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that U.S. industrial production rose 5.4 per cent in June, the second straight monthly gain after a 1.4 per cent uptick in May. But it was still 10.9 per cent below the level in February before the economy virtually shut down in the face of the coroanavirus.

The June performance was better than economists had forecasts and reflected the reopening of many parts of the U.S. economy after lockdowns in the spring.

Despite the gains in May and June, industrial production dropped at a 42.6 per cent annual rate in the second quarter, worst since the American economy demobilized in the aftermath of World War II. Industrial production had plunged a record 12.7 per cent in April.

Factory production jumped 7.2 per cent in June. Production of cars and auto parts surged 105 per cent. Still, auto industry output remains nearly 25% below February levels.

Production at utilities climbed 4.2 per cent last month as a rebounding economy drove up demand for power. But mining output sank 2.9 per cent, the fifth straight drop, pulled down by plummeting oil and gas production.

The rebound in industrial production may not last. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases is forcing governors in the South and West to pause or reverse the economic reopening.

“The road to a full recovery will be much slower compared to the initial strong bounce of the past two months that was prompted by the relaxation of social distancing measures,"" Oren Klachkin and Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note. “The virus’ resurgence in many states in recent weeks has already led to the re-imposition of social distancing measures that will drag on the recovery and bolster already significant headwinds facing the industrial sector.""

Renewed restrictions also took effect in Hong Kong, with public gatherings limited to four people, restaurants restricted to takeout after 6 p.m., and a one-week closure for gyms, karaoke bars, and selected other businesses. Masks were mandated on public transit for the first time, with the non-compliant being fined.

After a surge in daily infections beginning last month, Israel moved last week to reimpose restrictions, closing events spaces, live show venues, bars and clubs. It has imposed lockdowns on areas with high infection rates, which in some cases sparked protests from residents.

Officials warned that if case numbers don’t come down in the coming days, Israel will have no choice but to lock the entire country down again, as it did in the spring.

“I don’t see what other tools we have aside from a lockdown,” Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told the Israeli news site Ynet. “Unless there is a miracle.”

South Africa is already showing signs of being overwhelmed by the pandemic — an ominous outlook for the rest of the continent of 1.3 billion people.

A ban on alcohol sales and a night curfew were reimposed this week to reduce the volume of trauma patients to hospitals that are struggling to cope with an influx of COVID-19 patients.

One result was more economic pain in a country which already has a high unemployment rate of 30%.

“This return to the booze ban is causing havoc to the restaurant business, and it’s causing people to lose jobs,” said Gerald Elliot, owner of a popular Johannesburg restaurant, Ba Pita, which he said closed as a result of the restrictions, with a loss of 28 jobs.

“You can look down our street and see several restaurants that are shut. It looks like they are closed permanently.”

29,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7763/autopsy-confirms-naya-riveras-death-was-accidental-drowning,Autopsy confirms Naya Rivera's death was accidental drowning,[],,"LOS ANGELES — An autopsy confirmed Tuesday that “Glee"" star Naya Rivera died from accidental drowning, officials said, while her family released a statement honouring her ”everlasting legacy and magnetic spirit.""

The examination, performed the day after the 33-year-old's body was found in a Southern California lake, showed no signs of traumatic injury or disease that might have contributed to the drowning, and gave no initial indication that drugs or alcohol may have played a role in her death, the Ventura County Medical Examiner said in a statement.

Dental records were used to confirm Rivera's identity, and routine toxicology tests will be performed for the presence of drugs and alcohol, the statement said.

Rivera was found in Lake Piru on Monday, five days after she disappeared while boating with her 4-year-old son, who was found asleep and alone on the boat hours later. The autopsy's findings were all consistent with the expectations of the Sheriff's Office, which conducted the search and investigation.

Rivera's family members released their first public statement Tuesday since her disappearance, saying they are “so grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers for Naya, Josey and our family over the past week. While we grieve the loss of our beautiful legend, we are blessed to honour her everlasting legacy and magnetic spirit.”

The statement said Rivera was “an amazing talent, but was an even greater person, mother, daughter and sister ... Heaven gained our sassy angel.""

The family thanked the search teams for their “commitment and unwavering effort to find Naya.”

The creators of “Glee” also released a statement in tribute to Rivera Tuesday, announcing that they would be creating a college fund for her son and remembering her as a joyful and immensely talented performer.

“Naya was more than just an actor on our show — she was our friend,” Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan said in a statement Tuesday.

“Our hearts go out to her family, especially her mom, Yolanda, who was a big part of the ‘Glee’ family, and her son Josey,” the three producers said, referring to the child as “the beautiful son Naya loved most of all.”

Josey is Rivera’s son with her former husband, actor Ryan Dorsey. She called the boy “my greatest success, and I will never do any better than him.”

While she wasn’t initially hired as a “Glee” cast member, it “didn’t take more than an episode or two for us to realize that we had lucked into finding one of the most talented, special stars we would ever have the pleasure of working with,” the producers said.

Rivera could act, sing, dance and “nail a joke as well as she could crush you with an emotional scene. ... She was a joy to write for, a joy to direct and a joy to be around,” they said.

In portraying a high school student in an openly lesbian relationship on “Glee,” Rivera ensured that her character's love for her partner was “expressed with dignity, strength and with pure intentions,” the producers said.

The supermodel, actor and businesswoman who co-created “America’s Next Top Model” will replace longtime host Tom Bergeron and take on the role of executive producer, ABC said late Tuesday.

In a statement, Banks said she’s a fan of the contest's approach of “fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances ... it’s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk.”

Banks lauded Bergeron, host of the show since its 2005 debut, as having set “a powerful stage” and said she’s excited to continue the legacy.

Co-host Erin Andrews also is leaving the series, which is getting a “creative refresh” while honouring America’s affection for it, ABC said. Andrews was not expected to be replaced.

When the show will get to unveil its new approach in season No. 29 remains clouded by the pandemic-caused production halt affecting the return of most TV series.

The announcement that Banks is joining the show followed word Monday of Bergeron and Andrews’ exits. In a Twitter post, Bergeron called working on “Dancing With the Stars” an “incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career.”

Last year, Bergeron drew attention when he expressed concern over the show’s decision to include former White House press secretary Sean Spicer among the contestants for last fall's season.

Bergeron tweeted then that he had suggested to producers the new season be a “joyful respite from our exhausting political climate” and urged them to avoid “divisive bookings.”

ABC thanked the departing Bergeron for his ""trademark wit and charm” that helped the show succeed and Andrews for her sense of humour .

Andrews originally competed as a contestant back in 2010 and returned as co-host in 2014.

Satellite photos showed the vessel in Iranian waters on Tuesday and two of its sailors remained in the Iranian capital.

It wasn't immediately clear what happened aboard the Dominica-flagged MT Gulf Sky, though its reported hijacking comes after months of tensions between Iran and the U.S.

David Hammond, the CEO of the United Kingdom-based group Human Rights at Sea, said he took a witness statement from the captain of the MT Gulf Sky, confirming the ship had been hijacked.

Hammond said that 26 of the Indian sailors on board had made it back to India, while two remained in Tehran, without elaborating.

“We are delighted to hear that the crew are safe and well, which has been our fundamental concern from the outset,"" Hammond told The Associated Press.

Hammond said that he had no other details on the vessel.

TankerTrackers.com, a website tracking the oil trade at sea, said it saw the vessel in satellite photos on Tuesday in Iranian waters off Hormuz Island. Hormuz Island, near the port city of Bandar Abbas, is some 190 kilometres (120 miles) north of Khorfakkan, a city on the eastern coast of the United Arab Emirates where the vessel had been for months.

The Emirati government, the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet did not respond to requests for comment. Iranian state media did not immediately report on the vessel and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In May, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against two Iranians, accusing them of trying to launder some $12 million to purchase the tanker, then named the MT Nautica, through a series of front companies. The vessel then took on Iranian oil from Kharg Island to sell abroad, the U.S. government said.

Court documents allege the scheme involved the Quds Force of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which is its elite expeditionary unit, as well as Iran's national oil and tanker companies. The two men charged, one of whom also has an Iraqi passport, remain at large.

“Because a U.S. bank froze the funds related to the sale of the vessel, the seller never received payment,” the Justice Department said. “As a result, the seller instituted a civil action in the UAE to recover the vessel.”

That civil action was believed to still be pending, raising questions of how the tanker sailed away from the Emirates after being seized by authorities there.

Data from the MT Gulf Sky's Automatic Identification System tracker shows it had been turned off around 4:30 a.m. July 5, according to ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com. Ships are supposed to keep their AIS trackers on, but Iranian vessels routinely turn theirs off to mask their movements.

Meanwhile, the 28 Indian sailors on board the vessel found themselves stuck on board without pay for months, according to the International Labor Organization. It filed a report saying the vessel and its sailors had been abandoned by its owners since March off Khorfakkan. The ILO did not respond to a request for comment.

As tensions between Iran and the U.S. heated up last year, tankers plying the waters of the Mideast became targets, particularly near the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf's narrow mouth through which 20% of all oil passes. Suspected limpet mine attacks the U.S. blamed on Iran targeted several tankers. Iran denied being involved, though it did seize several tankers.

32,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7760/apple-wins-big-eu-court-case-over-15-billion-in-taxes,Apple wins big EU court case over $15 billion in taxes,[],,"BRUSSELS — A European Union court on Wednesday delivered a hammer blow to the bloc’s attempts to rein in multinationals' ability to strike special tax deals with individual EU countries when it ruled that Apple does not have to pay 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.

The EU Commission had claimed in 2016 that Apple had struck an illegal tax deal with Irish authorities that allowed it to pay extremely low rates. But the EU's General Court said Wednesday that ""the Commission did not succeed in showing to the requisite legal standard that there was an advantage.""

""The Commission was wrong to declare"" that Apple ""had been granted a selective economic advantage and, by extension, state aid,"" said the Luxembourg-based court, which is the second-highest in the EU.

The EU Commission had ordered Apple to pay for gross underpayment of tax on profits across the European bloc from 2003 to 2014. The commission said Apple used two shell companies in Ireland to report its Europe-wide profits at effective rates well under 1 per cent.

In many cases, multinationals can pay taxes on the bulk of their revenue across the EU's 27 countries in the one EU country where they have their regional headquarters. For Apple and many other big tech companies, that is Ireland. For small EU countries like Ireland, that helps attract international business and even a small amount of tax revenue is helpful for them. The net result, however, is that the companies often end up paying very low tax.

The ruling can only be appealed on points of law and the Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said she will ""reflect on possible next steps.""

The Irish government welcomed the ruling, saying ""there was no special treatment provided"" to the U.S. company. Apple likewise said it was pleased by the decision, arguing that the case is not about how much tax it pays, but in what country. Apple CEO Tim Cook had earlier called the EU demand for back taxes “total political crap.”

The ruling is an especially stinging defeat for Vestager, who has campaigned for years to root out special tax deals and better regulate the power of the big U.S. tech companies, including Google, Amazon and Facebook. Trump has referred to her as the “tax lady” who “really hates the U.S.”

Despite the setback, she vowed to carry on the fight. “The Commission will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules to assess whether they result in illegal state aid,"" she said.

Besides the tax case, Vestager has recently opened two antitrust investigations into Apple's mobile app store and its payments operations. Under her leadership, the EU has also investigated and fined tech giants like Google for billions of dollars for abusing their dominant market position. Some EU countries are looking to impose a tax on major digital businesses.

The European Network on Debt and Development, a group that seeks to make the financial system fairer, said that Wednesday's court ruling showed how tough any tax policy remains. ""If we had a proper corporate tax system, we wouldn’t need long court cases to find out whether it is legal for multinational corporations to pay less than 1 per cent in taxes,” said Tove Maria Ryding, a policy manager at the group.

Even though taxation remains under the authority of its member countries, the EU is seeking to create a level playing field among the 27 nations by making sure special deals — including ultra-low tax rates with multinationals - are weeded out.

Wednesday's ruling will hurt that.

EU Greens legislator Sven Giegold said the verdict “is a huge setback in the fight against tax dumping in Europe."" He said EU rules ""are clearly totally insufficient to tackle the problem. This must be a wakeup call.""

The ruling comes at a time when tax income for EU nations is taking a hit because of the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. With households under financial pressure, the EU wants to make sure multinationals making profits on the continent pay their fair share, too.

“In times like these, when we are passing multibillion-euro economic stimulus packages, we cannot afford to waste a single cent in tax revenue,"" said EU legislator Markus Ferber of the Christian Democrat EPP Group.

33,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7759/ethiopia-denies-reports-government-has-started-filling-dam,Ethiopia denies reports government has started filling dam,[],,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Ethiopia’s water minister denied reports Wednesday that the government had begun filling a massive hydroelectric dam that has caused severe tensions with Egypt and led some to fear military conflict.

Media outlets reported the government had begun filling after Minister Sileshi Bekele confirmed to the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation that satellite images from recent days showed the dam’s reservoir swelling.

The minister told The Associated Press, however, that the images reflected heavy rains, saying that inflow was greater than the outflow. He later tweeted saying it created “natural pooling.”

On Tuesday, International Crisis Group analyst William Davison told the AP that images of the swelling reservoir captured on July 9 by a European Space Agency satellite likely show a “natural backing-up of water behind the dam.”

Ethiopia’s latest round of talks with Egypt and Sudan on an agreement over the operation of the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam failed early this week.

Ethiopia has said it would begin filling the dam's reservoir this month even without a deal as the rainy season floods the Blue Nile.

Ethiopia says the colossal dam offers a critical opportunity to pull millions of its nearly 110 million citizens out of poverty and become a major power exporter. Downstream Egypt, which depends on the Nile to supply its farmers and booming population of 100 million with fresh water, asserts that the dam poses an existential threat.

Years of talks with a variety of mediators, including the Trump administration, have failed to produce a solution. Last week’s round, mediated by the African Union and observed by U.S. and European officials, proved no different.

Sudanese Irrigation Minister Yasser Abbas on Monday said the parties were “keen to find a solution,” but technical and legal disagreements persist over its filling and operation.

Most important, he said, are the questions about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs and how the countries will resolve any future disputes.

Kevin Wheeler, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, told the AP that the escalating rhetoric is more due to changing power dynamics in the region. Fears of any immediate water shortage “are not justified at this stage at all.

“If there were a drought over the next several years, that certainly could become a risk,” he said.

Starting Wednesday, all travellers arriving in Greece from a land border with Bulgaria were required to carry negative coronavirus test results issued in the previous 72 hours. The new rules, which follow an increase in tourism-related COVID-19 cases, triggered an immediate drop in arrivals compared to recent days.

In the U.S., some state governments and businesses imposed their own new restrictions or sanctions.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo added to a list now totalling 22 states whose visitors will be required to quarantine for 14 days if they visit the tri-state region. Out-of-state travellers arriving in New York airports from those states face a $2,000 fine and a mandatory quarantine order if they fail to fill out a tracing form.

And Walmart became the largest U.S. retailer to require customers to wear face coverings at all of its Sam's Club and namesake stores.

Meanwhile, the first U.S. governor to announce he had tested positive for COVID-19, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, said he would be quarantining at home. The first-term Republican governor has backed one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, has resisted any statewide mandate on masks and rarely wears one himself.

Stitt attended President Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa last month, which health experts have said likely contributed to a surge in coronavirus cases there.

Florida, meanwhile, has now reported more than 300,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as its daily average death rate continues to rise.

The developments come with more than 13 million cases of coronavirus cases confirmed worldwide, and with over 578,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons including limited testing.

After the border restrictions Greece imposed Wednesday, traffic at the crossing fell by about half, authorities said, but waiting times were still lengthy and a line of cars and trucks was over 500 metres (yards) long as the number of tests carried out by medical teams at the border were increased.

Gergana Chaprazova, 51, from Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria, plans to visit the Greek seaside town of Kavala with her husband, and complained that she was being tested again.

“I have to wait for a test but I (already) have test from Bulgaria. I don’t understand why must have a test here,” she told the AP.

Romania, citing the rising number of infections, announced a 30-day extension for a nationwide state of alert. Measures include mandatory face masks on public transportation and in shops, while restaurants may only serve customers in outdoor locations. The country set a record for new infections on Saturday.

Residents of Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, were warned on Wednesday to comply with lockdown regulations or face tougher restrictions. Melbourne’s 5 million people and part of the city’s semi-rural surroundings are a week into a new, six-week lockdown to contain a new outbreak there.

“The time for warnings, the time for cutting people slack, is over,” Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said. “Where we are is in a very serious and deadly position.”

In Serbia, which has been hit hard by a spike in infections and anti-government protests, a government crisis team expanded a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people from Belgrade to encompass the entire country. Masks were also made mandatory in public spaces where there is no opportunity for 1.5 metres (around five feet) of distancing, such as in lines to enter shops and bus stations.

Renewed restrictions also took effect in Hong Kong, with public gatherings limited to four people, restaurants restricted to takeout after 6 p.m., and a one-week closure for gyms, karaoke bars, and selected other businesses. Masks were mandated on public transit for the first time, with the non-compliant being fined.

“I don’t see what other tools we have aside from a lockdown,” Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told the Israeli news site Ynet. “Unless there is a miracle.”

South Africa, Africa’s most developed country, is already showing signs of being overwhelmed by the pandemic — an ominous outlook for the rest of the continent of 1.3 billion people.

A ban on alcohol sales and a night curfew were reimposed this week to reduce the volume of trauma patients to hospitals that are struggling to cope with an influx of COVID-19 patients.

One result was more economic pain in a country which already has a high unemployment rate of 30%.

“This return to the booze ban is causing havoc to the restaurant business, and it’s causing people to lose jobs,” said Gerald Elliot, owner of a popular Johannesburg restaurant, Ba Pita, which he said closed as a result of the restrictions, with a loss of 28 jobs. “You can look down our street and see several restaurants that are shut. It looks like they are closed permanently.”

Concerns exist even in locations that have not experienced outbreaks. A World Health Organization delegation visiting Turkmenistan, a country that has not reported any coronavirus infections, recommended that the country take stronger actions.

In Spain, authorities in the northeastern Catalonia region made fresh attempts to stem the spread of new coronavirus outbreaks as health experts warned that more and better contact tracing is needed.

Since midnight Tuesday, 160,000 residents in and around the city of Lleida were forbidden to leave their homes unless it’s properly justified. The area was closed off, with police checkpoints outside every municipality.

Authorities in the English town of Blackburn also imposed new restrictions on social mingling amid what they say is a “rising tide” of new coronavirus cases. Director of Public Health Dominic Harrison said that if infection numbers didn't fall by July 27, officials would begin to reimpose lockdown measures such as the closing of shops and other businesses.

And in Tokyo, Gov. Yuriko Koike said Wednesday that the spread of the infections in the Japanese capital have escalated to levels tantamount to “issuing an alarm” and requested that residents and business owners step up their preventive measures.

Kevin Stitt announced Wednesday that he’s the first governor in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus and that he is isolating at home.

Stitt, 48, said he mostly feels fine, although he started feeling “a little achy” on Tuesday and sought a test. He said his wife and children were also tested Tuesday and that none of them have tested positive.

Stitt has backed one of the country’s most aggressive reopening plans, resisted any statewide mandate on masks and rarely wears one himself.

“We respect people’s rights ... to not wear a mask,"" Stitt said during Wednesday's news conference, which was held virtually. “You just open up a big can of worms.

“A lot of businesses are requiring it, and that’s fine. I’m just hesitant to mandate something that I think is problematic to enforce,"" he said.

Stitt attended President Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa last month, which health experts have said likely contributed to a surge in coronavirus cases there.

Stitt said he’s confident he didn’t contract the virus at the rally.

“As far as where he became infected, it’s really unknown,"" Oklahoma Health Commissioner Lance Frye said. ""It wasn’t so far back as the rally,” which took place nearly a month ago.

Stitt’s announcement came as Oklahoma reported a second consecutive day of record-high numbers of confirmed virus cases, with 1,075 new cases, bringing the statewide total to more than 22,000. The previous daily high was 993 confirmed cases on Tuesday. Health officials also confirmed four additional COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday, bringing the statewide death toll to 432.

Coronavirus-related hospitalizations also are surging in Oklahoma, increasing from 458 last week to 561 on Wednesday, although Frye said there is still plenty of hospital capacity.

Stitt came under fire early in the pandemic after he tweeted a photo of himself and his children eating at a crowded restaurant.

One of Stitt’s cabinet members, David Ostrowe, tested positive for the coronavirus in March.

36,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7755/trump-looks-to-scale-back-environmental-reviews-for-projects,Trump looks to scale back environmental reviews for projects,[],,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is ready to roll back a foundational Nixon-era environmental law that he says stifles major infrastructure projects, but that environmentalists say has served for decades as a safeguard for low-income and minority communities.

Trump was travelling to Atlanta on Wednesday to formally announce changes to the National Environmental Policy Act's regulations for conducting environmental reviews, making it easier to build highways, pipelines, chemical plants and other projects. When Trump first announced the effort in January, the administration set a two-year deadline for completing full environmental impact reviews while less comprehensive assessments would have to be completed within one year. The White House said the final rule will promote the rebuilding of America.

Critics call the Republican president's efforts a cynical attempt to limit the public’s ability to review, comment on and influence proposed projects under one of the country’s bedrock environmental protection laws.

“This may be the single biggest giveaway to polluters in the past 40 years,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that works to save endangered species.

Trump has made slashing government regulation a hallmark of his presidency and held it out as a way to boost jobs. Environmental groups say the regulatory rollbacks threaten public health and make it harder to curb global warming. With Congress and the administration divided over how to increase infrastructure investment, the president is relying on his deregulation push to demonstrate progress.

“The United States can’t compete and prosper if a bureaucratic system holds us back from building what we need,” Trump said when first announcing the rollback of National Environmental Policy Act rules.

Opponents say the change will have an inordinate impact on predominantly minority communities. More than 1 million African Americans live within a half-mile of natural gas facilities and face a cancer risk above the Environmental Protection Agency's level of concern from toxins emitted by those facilities, according to a 2017 study by the Clean Air Task Force and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

“Donald Trump is taking away the last lines of defence for front-line communities, and continues to demonstrate a total disregard for our environment and for those demanding racial and environmental justice,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

For his announcement, Trump chose Georgia, a swing state in the general election. Trump won the Republican-leaning state by 5 percentage points in 2016, but some polls show him trailing former Vice-President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. This will be Trump’s ninth trip to Georgia and his sixth visit to Atlanta during his presidency.

The president's trip also comes as the state has seen coronavirus cases surge and now has tallied more than 12,000 confirmed cases and more than 3,000 deaths.

Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who is running against incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue, said Trump’s decision to come to Georgia to discuss infrastructure as the state's coronavirus crisis worsens demonstrates that the president is “in denial and out of control.”

“Coming here for a routine photo-op is, frankly, bizarre, surreal against this unprecedented health and economic crisis,” Ossoff said.

Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said that if Ossoff views a major policy announcement to expedite critical infrastructure projects as anything other than about job growth and economic expansion, then it might explain why he lost a congressional race in 2017.

The White House said the administration’s efforts will expedite the expansion of Interstate 75 near Atlanta, an important freight route where traffic can often slow to a crawl. The state will create two interstate lanes designed solely for commercial trucks. The state announced last fall, before the White House unveiled its proposed rule, that it was moving up the deadline for substantially completing the project to 2028.

Thousands of Americans on both sides of the new federal rule wrote to the Council on Environmental Quality to voice their opinions.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce cited a North Carolina bridge in its letter as an example of unreasonable delays, saying the bridge that connected Hatteras Island to Bodie Island took 25 years to complete, but only three years to build. “The failure to secure timely approval for projects and land management decisions is also hampering economic growth,” the business group wrote.

The Natural Resources Defence Council said that when Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act 50 years ago, it did so with the understanding that environmental well-being is compatible with economic well-being. The proposed rule, it said, would lead federal agencies to make decisions with significant environmental impacts without ever considering those impacts in advance.

“At the end of the day, it would lead to poor decision, increased litigation and less transparency,” said Sharon Buccino, a senior director at the environmental group.

Trump's trip to Georgia comes one day after Biden announced an infrastructure plan that places a heavy emphasis on improving energy efficiency in buildings and housing as well as promoting conservation efforts in the agriculture industry. In the plan, Biden pledges to spend $2 trillion over four years to promote his energy proposals.

South Africa now has the world’s eighth-highest number of cases at 298,292, which represents nearly half of all the confirmed cases on the African continent. That's according to a Health Ministry statement and data compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers, which showed the U.K. with 292,931 confirmed cases.

The pandemic is now spreading swiftly in parts of the African continent of 1.3 billion people as the world's most poorly funded health systems begin to face what experts have warned all along: They would be rapidly overwhelmed.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week said many more virus infections have gone undetected despite the country conducting more than 2.2 million tests, by far the most of any African nation.

A strict lockdown had delayed South Africa's surge in cases but it has been loosened under economic pressure. Now, what the president calls the “storm” has arrived, and it is already “stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits.”

Shortages of medical oxygen have been reported as the number of COVID-19 patients seeking help in breathing grows. Public hospital beds across the country could fill up within the month.

South Africa grapples with the pandemic in the dead of winter, with temperatures in the outbreak epicenter, Gauteng province and Johannesburg, forecast to drop below freezing overnight. That makes ventilation a challenge especially in small, crowded homes for the poor.

While public health officials in the United States and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere warn that fall and winter could be a severe test, South Africa is already demonstrating some of the dangers to come.

Luxury fashion is adapting to the coronavirus pandemic by moving runway shows onto digital platforms. It was that, or cancel the season, a tough choice for an industry that in Italy alone is expected to suffer a 20-30 per cent drop in revenues this year, from 67 billion euros ($76 billion) last year. So the job now is to stanch losses and maintain ties with consumers, and a spotlight on digital displays given the necessity to maintain social distance.

Prada told its story through five video chapters by international artists, featuring glimpses of the collection against the backdrop of the Fondazione Prada’s exhibition space in Milan.

“We are used to doing fashion shows,’’ Miuccia Prada said in notes emailed to journalists. ""But the moment you can’t do a physical show, you have to invent another work.’’

Through the filmmakers' eyes, the focus shifts from silhouette to detail, often with deliberately blurred transitions. A floral coat contrasted against a lineup of Prada black and white vinyl creations with boxy long coats over slim trousers or leggings. The emphasis was more on film style— befitting the Fondazione Prada’s support of contemporary art — than the looks themselves.

As stylist Ovidiu Buta put it on Instagram: ""Great video. But where are the clothes. Where is Prada?’’ The answer, for anyone looking, is on the fashion chamber’s website , where all the 30 looks were posted one by one. But still, the buzz and energy created by a live show — restricted as they are to invited guests only — was notably absent on social media.

Massimo Giorgetti’s MSGM digital presentation presented a pre-pandemic vision of youthful exuberance, with a couple embracing on the edge of a lake in two-tone jean shorts for him and a pink dress for her. Elsewhere, young people played basketball and ran through a theme park, the guys dressed in summer layers, the girls in casual ruffles.

Moschino’s polka-dotted, pop art-inspired looks showed a flash of Italian pride — the tri-colour green, white and red showed up in a sweatshirt for him and a skirt suit for her. Philipp Plein was his own model, showing off a series of sporty looks, including 24 karat gold-plated footwear and matching eagle -encrusted jacket that takes a week to create.

""Today, I am at a point where I have to rethink what is going to happen in the future,’’ Plein told his video audience. ""I still believe in my dreams. Nobody can stop this, not even the virus.’’

Only two fashion houses are hosting live shows this week in Milan: Dolce&Gabbana and Etro. In addition to 40 digital presentations over four days, the fashion chamber’s website is hosting 10 international brands in a fashion hub market and launching 11 young brands.

Nine buyers have been brought to Milan from France, Britain and Russia by the Italian Trade & Investment agency for the events, which the agency’s president, Carlo Maria Ferro, called ""a sign that Milan is back to business.’’

Last week in Paris, the entirety of the couture and menswear collections were presented on video platforms, with the lively exception of Balmain, which sent a boat down the Seine River to the delight of Parisians watching from the banks and bridges.

In Milan, big screens displaying the digital shows at locations throughout the city appeared to gain little notice on Day 1, with no sounds to indicate they were anything more than advertisements. And were they? More people passed the images flashed on the side of the Duomo and on a screen in the Navigli than stopped to watch.

The success of these stop-gap presentations at maintaining consumer interest remains to be seen, as do still-uncertain plans for the September round of runway shows that normally focus on the higher profile womenswear lines.

The coronavirus struck Europe during the February round of womenswear shows; the first domestically spread case in Italy was confirmed just an hour from Milan, Italy's fashion capital. Giorgio Armani, who is sitting out the digital round, was the first to sound a note of caution, streaming his closing day runway show from an empty theatre as the number of reported cases steadily rose.

‘’We have to look for a new normality, a different normality,’’ Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said in opening remarks for Digital Fashion Week.

The Altagamma association of high-end Italian producers of everything from fashion and food to wine and cars drafted recommendations to boost the sector that generates nearly 7 per cent of Italy’s GDP, employing some 400,000 workers. In Europe, the high-end industry is worth 4 per cent of GDP or 800 billion euros, with 2 million workers.

The recommendations include investing in training, promoting luxury travel, investing in innovation, focusing on sustainability and promoting a single market as an engine for relaunching the European Union and Italian economies.

‘’The strategic importance of the high-end industry has not yet been fully appreciated by Italian and European institutions,’’ Altagamma President Matteo Lunelli said last week, citing also the sector’s cultural significance representing the best of artisanal production.

39,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7456/new-richmond-hospital-gets-green-light,New Richmond Hospital gets green light,[],,"Richmond received some long-awaited good news today. A new state-of-the-art emergency department and intensive care unit for the community is on the way.



“People have been calling for a new tower at Richmond Hospital and our government took decisive action to make it happen,” says Premier John Horgan. “We’re proud to give the green light for a bigger, bolder plan for Richmond Hospital that will bring the facility into the 21st century and deliver the care Richmond needs.”

Horgan says there’s an added economic benefit, as the project will create thousands of jobs.

Detailed planning, currently underway, is expected to be completed in September. The project will then proceed to procurement and construction.

The province originally announced its commitment to replace the patient care tower in March 2018. At that time an eager crowd packed into the hospital atrium was told a business plan was expected to be completed in 12 to 18 months.

Richmond Hospital Foundation president and CEO Natalie Meixner has lobbied tirelessly for the upgrades. In welcoming today’s news, she paid particular homage to the many who have supported the initiative.

“Our community of philanthropic leaders will be ecstatic to learn about the additional services that will be included in the new acute care tower, and the opportunity for innovation that an expanded project scope will bring to Richmond,” she says. “People across our vibrant and diverse community have made commitments to help us reach 88 per cent of our $50 million goal, and we look forward to even greater philanthropic support and involvement from our donors in the future.”

Replacing the aging hospital follows years of angst.

Opened in 1966, Richmond Hospital’s operating rooms are only half the size of today’s standard and at risk in a flood or tsunami. And a structural assessment of the original tower deemed it to be at a high risk of widespread damage or structural failure after an earthquake.

As the structure continues to age, so too does a growing list of associated challenges. Elevators in its acute care tower suddenly stopped working one day a few years ago, forcing administrators to think quickly. Fortunately, they were able to call on a unique source for help: the movie industry was able to supply suitable cables until the elevators could be permanently repaired.

During the 42 years the hospital has been open, Richmond’s population has also more than quadrupled to over 200,000 residents. The hospital also serves South Vancouver, Delta, Vancouver International Airport and BC Ferries.

The replacement of the so-called north tower also addresses other deficiencies including outdated patient care delivery areas.

Richmond Hospital currently has 240 beds, with 108 in the original six-storey north tower which houses surgical suites, in-patient units, a mammography clinic, cancer care, medical imaging and administrative, academic and support services.

The new emergency department and intensive care unit will bring more services and better care. Double the existing floor space, the nine-floor tower will include a fully-equipped medical imaging department, intensive care unit, and pharmacy. The new concept also includes renovating the south tower to create new in-patient psychiatry and psychiatric units.

“The renewed and expanded concept plan reflects our government’s ongoing commitment to the people who live and work (in Richmond), ensuring that timely, quality public healthcare will be there for them now and in the future,” said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

Dr. Penny Ballem, board chair of Vancouver Coastal Health, says taking bold steps now to increase and expand services “will allow to better service Richmond patients and clients for years to come.”

In 2017, the Richmond Hospital Foundation commissioned an independent public opinion poll to better understand what citizens of Richmond felt were the most important publicity-funded infrastructure needs. Eighty-five per cent placed a new hospital tower among the top two projects, and 52 per cent rated it as the No. 1 need.",[]

It wasn’t enough to simply be a good soccer player. Or to be a high achiever in the classroom. As reflected by the award recipients, being well-rounded was a necessity.

“Definitely all five bring a high level of commitment to soccer, and have spent an extended amount of time as part of the club,” committee member Fred Well says. “And all five have been very involved in their schools and community—but in different ways.”

They’re also different players, bringing their own set of talents to the patch. Some even participated a different levels. All, however, were key contributors to their teams—some as vocal leaders, others quietly making a difference.

Their efforts at school and in the community were carried out similarly.

“They’re all the kind of kids who are always there, who you can always depend on,” says Well, who besides coaching an under-17 boys’ team also teaches grades 6 and 7.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Richmond FC felt it was particularly essential to maintain the awards.

“It’s really important to recognize these individuals for all they’ve contributed over the past years,” explains Well. “It also reflects on us seeing ourselves as more than just a soccer club, but an organization that strives to be involved in the community.”

During the pandemic, the club has hosted fundraisers in support of the Richmond Food Bank.

Well says it’s been difficult for players to have to spend so much time indoors, away from teammates and friends.

“Soccer, by its nature, provides an opportunity for people to come together,” he says. “I know with my under-17 team we tried to stay in contact after games were cancelled. Even now as we’re just getting back on the field in the first stages of re-entry, we’re still only able to work on individual skills but everybody is so excited to just kick the ball and see teammates. I think the time off makes you appreciate things more.”

Richmond FC board chair Rein Weber says this year, as much as ever, the five graduating players being recognized with scholarships are exceptional people.

“We are very proud to recognize these five individuals who have worked incredibly hard at school (despite losing the last term) and, at the same time, made a commitment to our community in various different volunteer roles,” he says, noting they embody what the club is trying to promote.

“As a club it is important for us to engage the community—to make sure that if there is a need, we do our part and our players help lift others up and lend a hand. That’s when we all become stronger.”

Judge Andrew Nicol said “in my view it would not be just to strike out the claim.”

The ruling means the two celebrities and their large legal teams will square off next week at the High Court in London.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. They divorced in 2017.

Depp is suing The Sun's publisher, News Group Newspapers, and Executive Editor Dan Wootton over a 2018 article claiming the actor was violent and abusive to Heard. He strongly denies the allegations.

The Sun’s lawyers applied for the case to be dismissed on the grounds that Depp failed to disclose text messages he exchanged with an assistant showing that he tried to buy “MDMA and other narcotics” while he was in Australia with Heard in 2015.

The newspaper’s lawyer, Adam Wolanski, said withholding the texts was a breach of a previous court order requiring Depp to provide all documents from separate libel proceedings against Heard in the United States. He said the lapse endangered the defendants’ ability to get a fair trial.

The judge ruled that Depp had breached the disclosure order, but granted him “relief from sanctions,” meaning the case can proceed.

He also rejected an attempt by Depp to force Heard to disclose evidence including communications with actor James Franco and Space-X founder Elon Musk, with whom she allegedly had affairs while involved with Depp.

“The central issue for the defence of truth is whether Mr. Depp assaulted Ms. Heard,” the judge said. “Even if she had been unfaithful to him, that would be irrelevant on that central issue. I am not therefore persuaded that these categories of documents are necessary for the fair disposal of the litigation.”

Depp and Heard are both expected to give evidence in person at the London trial, which was postponed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The socially distanced trial is scheduled to last for three weeks. Witnesses are likely to include Depp’s ex-partners Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder, who have both submitted statements supporting the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star.

47,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7453/fbi-arrests-epstein-pal-accused-of-enabling-abuse-of-girls,"FBI arrests Epstein pal, accused of enabling abuse of girls",[],,"British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested Thursday on charges she helped recruit three girls — one as young as 14 — to be sexually abused by financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of assaulting dozens of girls and women over many years.

According to the indictment, Maxwell, who lived for years with Epstein and was his frequent companion on trips around the world, facilitated his crimes by ""helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse"" girls.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in a federal detention centre in New York last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell has, for years, been accused by many women of recruiting them to give Epstein massages, during which they were pressured into sex. Those accusations, until now, never resulted in criminal charges. The 58-year-old was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire, where the FBI said it had been keeping tabs on her.

“More recently we learned she had slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire, continuing to live a life of privilege while her victims live with the trauma inflicted upon them years ago,” William Sweeney, head of the FBI’s New York office, told a news conference Thursday.

The indictment, which was unsealed Thursday, included counts of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and perjury.

“Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,” Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said.

She called the charges against Maxwell a “prequel” to charges prosecutors brought against Epstein a year ago.

Messages were sent Thursday to several of Maxwell’s attorneys seeking comment. She has previously repeatedly denied wrongdoing and called some claims against her “absolute rubbish.""

Among the most sensational accusations was a claim by Virginia Roberts Giuffre that Maxwell arranged for her to have sex with Britain's Prince Andrew at her London townhouse. Giuffre bolstered her allegations with a picture of her, Andrew and Maxwell that she said was taken at the time.

Andrew denied her story and Maxwell said in a deposition that Giuffre was “totally lying.""

He was not mentioned by name in the indictment, and the charges covered Maxwell's dealings with Epstein only from 1994 through 1997, a period well before his alleged encounters with Giuffre in 2001.

Strauss said she would “welcome Prince Andrew coming in to talk with us,” but did not answer further questions pertaining to these charges and Andrew.

Brad Edwards, an attorney representing Giuffre and several other Epstein victims said his clients were relieved by the charges. “Today is a very good day,"" he said.

The indictment focused on Epstein's alleged abuse of three specific girls at his Manhattan mansion and other residences in Palm Beach, Florida; Santa Fe, New Mexico, and London. Their names were not revealed in court filings.

The allegations in the indictment mirrored many claims from civil lawsuits against Maxwell, saying she would “entice and groom” minor girls by asking them about their lives, their schools and their families.

“Through this process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In some instances, Maxwell was present for and participated in the sexual abuse of minor victims,” according to the indictment.

Maxwell repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, it went on. She was accused of committing perjury in 2016 in a deposition in a civil lawsuit, in part by denying knowledge of Epstein's scheme to recruit underage girls.

At the time the alleged crimes, Maxwell was in an intimate relationship with Epstein and also was paid by him to manage his various properties, according to the indictment, which included a photograph of Epstein with his arm around Maxwell and his head nuzzling hers. Strauss, at the news conference, stood silent, pointing at the picture as film crews and photographers captured the moment.

Strauss promised the investigation was continuing and urged other victims to come forward. She said prosecutors would seek the detention of Maxwell.

Epstein was initially investigated in Florida and pleaded guilty to state charges in 2008 that allowed him to avoid a lengthy prison sentence. He was free a little after a year in prison.

At the time, a federal prosecutor in Florida signed off on an agreement, initially filed in secret, that barred the federal government from charging “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Alexander Acosta, President Donald Trump's former labour secretary, resigned last year after coming under fire for overseeing that deal when he was U.S. attorney in Miami.

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan until he was fired last month, argued that federal prosecutors in New York were not bound by that agreement and brought a sweeping indictment against Epstein. Berman vowed to continue seeking justice for Epstein's victims even after the financier's death.

Maxwell's indictment was celebrated by lawyers for some Epstein accusers.

Jennifer Araoz, a woman who says Epstein raped her in his New York mansion in 2002 when she was 15, said she feared the financier’s ring of conspirators for years.

“Now that the ring has been taken down, I know that I can’t be hurt anymore,” Araoz, now 33, said in a statement. “Day after day, I have waited for the news that Maxwell would be arrested and held accountable for her actions. Her arrest is a step in that direction, and it truly means that the justice system didn’t forget about us.”

Spencer T. Kuvin, who represents some of the women, said Maxwell was “hopefully ... the first of many co-conspirators to face the consequences of this horrific crimes.”

Maxwell was described in a lawsuit by another Epstein victim, Sarah Ransome, as the “highest-ranking employee” of Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking enterprise. She oversaw and trained recruiters, developed recruiting plans and helped conceal the activity from law enforcement, the lawsuit alleged.

48,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7455/justices-keep-hold-on-secret-russia-investigation-material,Justices keep hold on secret Russia investigation material,[],,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is denying Congress access to secret grand jury testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation through the November election.

The justices agreed on Thursday to hear the Trump administration’s appeal of a lower court order for the material to be turned over to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The high court’s action will keep the documents out of congressional hands at least until the case is resolved, which is not likely to happen before 2021.

Arguments themselves might not even take place before Americans decide whether to give President Donald Trump a second term.

The delay is a victory for Trump, who also is mounting a Supreme Court fight against congressional efforts to obtain his banking and other financial records. Those cases are expected to be decided in the coming days or weeks.

The court’s action also could mean the justices never have to reach a definitive ruling in a sensitive dispute between the executive and legislative branches of government, if either Trump loses reelection or Republicans regain control of the House next year. It’s hard to imagine an administration of Democrat Joe Biden would object to turning over the Mueller documents or House Republicans would continue to press for them.

The House wants previously undisclosed details from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called the court's decision disappointing.

“Unfortunately, President Trump and Attorney General (William) Barr are continuing to try to run out the clock on any and all accountability. While I am confident their legal arguments will fail, it is now all the more important for the American people to hold the President accountable at the ballot box in November,” Nadler said in a statement.

The federal appeals court in Washington ruled in March that the documents should be turned over because the House Judiciary Committee’s need for the material in its investigation of Trump outweighed the Justice Department’s interests in keeping the testimony secret.

Mueller’s 448-page report, issued in April 2019, “stopped short” of reaching conclusions about Trump’s conduct, including whether he obstructed justice, to avoid stepping on the House’s impeachment power, the appeals court said.

The committee was able to persuasively argue that it needed access to the underlying grand jury material to make its own determinations about the president’s actions, the court said.

The materials initially were sought last summer, but by the time the appeals court ruled in March, Trump had been impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate.

The Justice Department said in its Supreme Court filings that the court’s action was needed in part because the House hasn’t given any indication it “urgently needs these materials for any ongoing impeachment investigation.”

The House had opposed the delay on the grounds that its investigation of Trump was continuing and that time is of the essence because of the approaching election. The current session of the House will end Jan. 3, and lawmakers elected in November will take their seats.

Democrats have suggested that the grand jury materials could reveal new misconduct that could potentially form the basis of new articles of impeachment, but such a course would have been unlikely so close to the 2020 election even if the court had allowed the material to be turned over immediately.

The House impeached Trump for his efforts to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, but the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted the president in February.

It is also unclear how many new, or incendiary, revelations might be contained in the grand jury transcripts. Mueller’s report, though redacted in parts, revealed more than a year ago significant information about the president’s efforts to choke off the investigation and raised substantial questions about whether he had committed obstruction of justice.

Besides, many of the witnesses closest to Trump appeared voluntarily before Mueller’s team of prosecutors, and the Justice Department in recent months has released written — albeit redacted — summaries of those interviews. That means the public already has insight into the accounts of key Trump associates, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and advisers like Steve Bannon and Hope Hicks.

“COVID-19 has created many uncertainties and fear, but we have built a path forward that will keep all of us safe in the weeks and months ahead,” said Henry.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix also provided case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods. From July 3 to July 4 there were nine new cases; from July 4 to July 5 there were 15 new cases and in the last 24 hours there were seven new cases.

In total, there have been 31 new cases since Friday’s update. There were no new healthcare facility outbreaks, with active outbreaks continuing at three long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility.

On April 2, BC announced a three-month exemption of all federal employment insurance benefits, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, for people already receiving income or disability assistance at that time. This exemption was put in place to ensure current clients whose employment may have been impacted by COVID-19 did not face any additional barriers and could fully benefit from federal emergency response programs.

This exemption, which now includes the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (effective May 1), has been extended for the duration of these federal emergency support programs so that eligible people will continue to fully benefit without any reductions to their monthly income or disability assistance payments.

For those who are not eligible for the federal benefits, the Province’s temporary COVID-19 crisis supplement—provided since April—will be extended an additional two months. This supplement will continue to be provided to low-income seniors receiving the BC Senior’s Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities. No action is required from recipients. The temporary $300 crisis supplement will continue to be automatically applied to cheques distributed July 22 and Aug. 26.

Anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and 29 should monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19, limit contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop.

“It is important to remember that the more people you see and the more places you go, the higher the likelihood is that you’ll come into contact with someone with COVID-19,” health authorities said in a statement.

The best ways to protect yourself are to keep the number of people you see to a minimum and, as much as possible, maintain a safe distance from others. Use a mask when that is challenging.

These rules for safe social interactions also support important contact tracing efforts, allowing public health teams to quickly identify those who may be at risk, put additional precautions in place and contain further transmission.

Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix also announced 12 new cases, including one epidemiologically (epi) linked case in their statement today, for a total of 2,990 cases in British Columbia.

‘Epi-linked’ means that public health investigations have shown that cases meet the case definition for COVID-19 but may not have been tested for a number of reasons. In future reports, new tested and epi-linked cases will be included as one number.

There were no new COVID-19 related deaths, healthcare facility outbreaks or community outbreaks.

Corey Hurren, a 46-year-old member of the military and businessman, made his first court appearance by teleconference Friday afternoon, about 30 hours after he was arrested by RCMP less than 200 metres from the front door of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's current residence.

The RCMP said Friday Hurren had several weapons on him, including at least one gun. They said he was loose on the grounds of Rideau Hall for 13 minutes early Thursday morning before police saw him. The Mounties then spoke with him for more than an hour and a half before he was arrested.

Hurren faces 22 charges, including one for uttering threats. The rest are all weapons charges, including two counts for possession of a restricted or prohibited gun, four counts for careless use, storage or handling of a firearm and four counts for possessing a firearm for a dangerous purpose.

At the brief court appearance, which happened by phone due to limited in-person court proceedings during the COVID-19 pandemic, Hurren sounded calm as he said his full name and date of birth. He also confirmed to the judge he understood the proceedings.

His lawyer, Michael Davies, asked for the case to be adjourned until July 17. Assistant Crown Attorney Meaghan Cunningham said the Crown opposes releasing Hurren and agreed to the adjournment.

Neither Trudeau nor his family were at their Rideau Cottage home when the incident occurred. Gov. Gen. Julie Payette, whose residence is usually at Rideau Hall, was also not there at the time.

Trudeau said Friday this is the kind of event nobody wants to happen, but was thankful it was resolved without anybody getting hurt.

Deputy RCMP Commissioner Mike Duheme said the incident led to immediate security changes at Rideau Hall, but noted the RCMP never discuss the security that protects either the Governor General or the prime minister.

""I am very proud of all our people and our partners who moved fast and acted decisively to contain this threat,"" Duheme said.

He said as far as the Mounties know, Hurren was acting alone, had ""several weapons"" on him including a gun Duheme later described as a rifle, and was not known to the RCMP before the incident.

Duheme wouldn't go into a motive, what brought the man to the national capital, or what he did just before smashing through the public entrance to the sprawling property. That's all part of the ongoing investigation, Duheme said.

He did provide a minute-by-minute account of the incident, that began at 6:29 a.m. local time Thursday, when Hurren allegedly drove his truck through the Thomas Gate — a secondary entrance near the main gate to the grounds, wide enough to admit a vehicle, but typically used by pedestrians. The truck got about 120 metres along a footpath before it became disabled.

The man ran up the path, carrying what looked like a rifle, to Rideau Hall's rose garden, hiding there for three minutes before making his way to the greenhouses that are attached to the back of the Governor General's residence.

A short path leads from the back of the greenhouses through a stand of trees to Rideau Cottage, which is where Trudeau and his family have lived since his election in 2015 while the government decides what to do with 24 Sussex Drive. That has been the official residence of past prime ministers but is now in need of major repairs.

Staff from the National Capital Commission, which manages the property, noticed the abandoned vehicle shortly after it was left there, and notified the commissionaires providing site security.

Around 6:40 a.m., commissionaires allegedly spotted the man on the path, gun in hand. The man was then spotted separately by RCMP security detail on the grounds. At that time a lockdown of the entire site was ordered.

RCMP confirmed they had visual contact of the suspect at 6:43 a.m., and after officers took cover for their own safety, they began speaking to him. The suspect did not respond for eight minutes, when he finally gave the officers his name and a conversation began.

That conversation continued for an hour and 42 minutes before the man was taken into custody at 8:29 a.m.

Duheme said when Mounties first saw the man they could have easily rushed up to him, but instead looked for a safe spot to speak with him. The conversation went well, he said, meaning there was no need to do something more dramatic.

""I cannot emphasize enough how effective our members were in being vigilant, reacting quickly and using successful de-escalation techniques to resolve this highly volatile incident swiftly and without injury to anyone,"" Duheme said.

These options make it easier to access online government services during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future.

“We’re using innovation, technology and mobile options to improve the way we deliver services and programs to British Columbians,” said Citizens’ Services Minister Anne Kang. “Our new Send Video feature within the mobile BC Services Card gives people the choices and tools they need to connect with government supports and services quickly, safely and securely.”

During the COVID-19 pandemic, more people need online and telephone access to crucial government services. This is resulting in high call volumes to Service BC and an increased demand for alternative ways to verify a person’s identity in order to activate a mobile BC Services Card. To address this demand, the province has launched Send Video, a remote identity-verification option for British Columbians.

People can use Send Video within the BC Services Card app from their iPhone, iPad, Android phone or tablet to send Service BC a photo and a short video of themselves at any time, day or night. A Service BC representative reviews and verifies the person’s identity and activates their mobile BC Services Card for online use within just a few hours. This service eliminates the need to visit a Service BC Centre for in-person identity verification.

Seventeen government services are available online with plans underway to bring more on board. British Columbians, including health professionals, businesses, government employees and students can use their BC Services Card to access these services.

One of the most popular services is StudentAid BC. As students begin to apply for StudentAid for the fall semester, they will be able to take advantage of this new service to begin and track their applications.

The BC Services Card Verify by Video service, which launched in June 2019, allows people to use the service to launch a live video call with a Service BC representative within the BC Services Card mobile app. During the call, the representative verifies their identity and then activates their mobile BC Services Card. Send Video adds another identity verification option to the Verify by Video service.

British Columbia is the first jurisdiction in North America to use an identity-verification solution using video.

The Verify by Video service is available through the BC Services Card mobile app. More information is available online:

The 33-year-old completed a 3,400-kilometre journey on horseback from Alaska to Calgary on Friday, the same day the Calgary Stampede was supposed to begin.

Although the annual event and parade to kick it off were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Masetti Leite was crowned this year's parade marshal.

The usual parade pomp was replaced with a small group of supporters that included girlfriend Clara Davel, Stampede president Dana Peers and two uniformed police officers as Masetti Leite plodded through the city toward the Stampede grounds.

He later received a white hat from Calgary's mayor — the equivalent of a key to the city.

Masetti Leite thanked many people who made his journeys possible and lauded the encouragement he received from those at the Calgary Stampede.

""What this rodeo means, not only to Canada but to the world, thank you boys and girls,"" he said as he stood on the stage at the rodeo grandstand.

""I'm a cowboy and the older I get I fear our world ending and I value it so much because the greatest lessons in my life were taught from a man who wears a cowboy hat and spurs and I would not have finished this journey if I weren't a cowboy.""

When he arrived in Calgary, Masetti Leite was given an award for being the parade's fan favourite, along with a marshal badge, which he proudly tacked to his shirt.

""Wow! This is beautiful. It's got my name on it. I'm not going to take it off,"" he said.

""What kind of perks can I get in Calgary with this?""

Masetti Leite moved with his family from Brazil to Calgary when he was nine and later grew up in Toronto.

He said he was inspired to become a long rider by Aime Tschiffely, a Swiss school teacher who rode 16,000 kilometres alone from Buenos Aires to New York City in 1925 and wrote about his experiences.

Masetti Leite covered about 16,000 kilometres riding from Calgary to his parents' home of Espirito Santo do Pinhal, Sao Paulo, between 2012 and 2014. In 2016, he rode 7,350 kilometres from Brazil to Patagonia.

He documented his travels and wrote the book ""Long Ride Home: Guts and Guns and Grizzlies, 800 Days Through the Americas in a Saddle.''

His journey from Alaska to Calgary had its challenges, he said, but he focused on the destination.

""In those tough moments, when those grizzlies are following us, when we're crossing the mountains in the middle of three feet of snow and the cold and the wind and the mosquitoes trying to pick me up and carry me away, I was here. My mind was here. My heart was here,"" he said.

Peers said he's been fascinated with Masetti Leite's journey, because it epitomizes the cowboy way of life.

""I thought, you know, he'll make a terrific parade marshal,"" he said. ""Considering everything that's gone on in the past four months, I feel very fortunate that we're able to enjoy the day, able to welcome him to Calgary.

""We had incredible plans and unfortunately those weren't possible, but you learn to adapt and find a way to make it work.""

Masetti Leite said he intends to spend the next couple of days sleeping and taking about a dozen showers.

He also plans to retire from long riding so he can focus on new challenges.

He intends to write another book about his travels and work on a movie about his Calgary-Brazil trip. He wants to be ""the next Anthony Bourdain with a cowboy hat"" and tell stories from countries around the world.

Those who participate “in the destruction of the nation cannot be considered guardians of the nation,” Abiy Ahmed said.

Police earlier this week told the state broadcaster more than 80 people were killed following the shooting death on Monday of Hachalu Hundessa, a prominent voice in anti-government protests that led to Abiy coming to power in 2018. The military has been deployed, and hundreds of cars this week were burned or damaged in the tense capital, Addis Ababa.

The new unrest poses the prime minister’s greatest domestic test since he took office. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for dramatic reforms, including welcoming home once-banned exile groups, but the more open political space has seen some Ethiopians air ethnic and other grievances. At times it has led to deadly violence, and human rights groups have accused security forces of abuses.

Ethiopia’s internet service has been cut again this week, making it difficult for rights monitor and others to track the scores of killings.

“It’s a moment when people need to pause and de-escalate,” said Murithi Mutiga, project director for the Horn of Africa with the International Crisis Group. He cited a series of challenges in Ethiopia including an armed insurgency in parts of the country and tension over the timing of the next election. The government recently delayed the vote, citing the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is not the first but one in a long line of grave provocations by an actor not yet identified,” Mutiga said, adding that the “wiser course of action is to strive to create an atmosphere of reconciliation and dialogue.”

Ethiopia's prime minister on Thursday hinted there could be links between this unrest and the killing of the army chief last year as well as the grenade thrown at one of his own rallies in 2018.

Police late Wednesday said three people had been arrested in the death of the singer, who was buried Thursday in a ceremony shown on national television.

The past few days appear to be the most serious challenge yet to Ethiopia’s transition to multifaceted democracy, Mutiga said. “Thankfully, the situation seems to have calmed down in Addis and parts of Oromia but the scale of the violence, the degree of grievance witnessed on the streets and the danger of instability was quite high.”

Abiy in comments after meeting with officials on Friday said those behind the unrest should “rethink their motives,” and those responsible for destructive actions will be held accountable. He added that those opposed to the government should contest power through “ideas and policy options.”

Arrests this week included that of a well-known Oromo activist, Jawar Mohammed, and more than 30 supporters. It is not clear what charges they might face. The Oromo make up Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group but had never held the country’s top post until they helped bring Abiy to power.

The arrest of opposition figures “could make a volatile situation even worse,” Human Rights Watch has said.

But they ultimately approved a staff proposal (Option 2) that enables all residents on agricultural land reserve (ALR) property to keep backyard chickens—regardless of their property’s size. Those who reside outside the ALR, in detached single family homes in residential zones, can also keep chickens—provided their property covers at least 2,000 square metres.

“I am completely opposed to Option 2,” said Coun. Michael Wolfe. “It does not include the residential backyard chicken program, which is where the education, support and guidance is.”

Coun. Kelly Greene agreed, saying that Option 2 does not provide “comprehensive backyard chicken regulations.” Risks associated with backyard chickens could be mitigated through bylaw and regulation, she added—which is not part of the current proposal.

An alternative proposal (Option 3) calls for the creation of a residential backyard chicken program for single detached family residential zones, along with a bylaw and licensing requirement. Councillors Wolfe, Greene, and Harold Steves voiced support for this option.

“When we have a residential backyard chicken program, as proposed in Option 3, when we can have these things in bylaw and regulation, then we’re going to have a much better program where we’re not going to have residents angry and upset because their neighbours have chickens,” said Coun. Greene.

Currently, backyard chickens can only be kept in Richmond on properties of at least 2,000 square metres (21,529 square feet). Several options were explored by city staff following a referral last summer that directed city staff to study the viability of chickens in backyards on properties both within and outside the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR).

While current animal control bylaws don’t limit the number of chickens allowed on a property, the motion was amended to include a limit of two to eight chickens per property.

The motion to approve Option 2 was passed, with councillors Wolfe, Greene, Steves and Day opposed. The issue will come before council at a later date.",[]
58,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7471/texas-governor-issues-mask-order-to-fight-coronavirus,Texas governor issues mask order to fight coronavirus,[],,"AUSTIN, Texas — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered that face coverings must be worn in public across most of the state, a dramatic ramp-up of the Republican's efforts to control spiking numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases and hospitalizations.

Abbott, who had pushed Texas' aggressive reopening of the state economy in May, had previously said the government could not order individuals to wear masks. His prior virus-related orders had undercut efforts by local governments to enforce mask requirements.

But faced with dramatically rising numbers of both newly confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus and the number of patients so sick they needed to be hospitalized, Abbott changed course with Thursday's mask order. It requires “all Texans to wear a face covering over the nose and mouth in public spaces in counties with 20 or more positive COVID-19 cases, with few exceptions,"" the governor's office said.

“We are now at a point where the virus is spreading so fast, there is little margin for error,” Abbott said.

Texas reported 7,915 newly confirmed cases, a slight dip after zooming past the 8,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday. The 7,382 hospitalizations means the state has more than quadrupled its numbers in that category since the end of May.

The true number of cases is likely much higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest that people can be infected and not feel sick.

Abbott’s action comes as Texans approach the Fourth of July weekend, a time usually marked by gatherings and parties. Along the coast, local officials have said that access to many beaches will be restricted. And a l akeside concert by 1990s rapper Vanilla Ice that was set to take place outside of Austin on Friday was postponed after being criticized for planning to gather hundreds of fans in one of the nation’s coronavirus hot spots.

The mask order takes effect Friday and the minimum case count would cover most of the state's 254 counties and most of the population. Counties with fewer than 20 cases cover mostly rural areas and will be allowed to apply with the governor's office for an exemption.

The order also applies to the Texas GOP Convention in Houston in two weeks — which is still pressing forward after party leaders late Thursday voted against switching to a virtual gathering. The convention typically draws thousands of attendees, and some party activists criticized Abbott's mandate while backing a three-day, in-person event starting July 16.

Mask order violators can be fined up to $250. There are exceptions for people who have a medical condition or disability, who are exercising outdoors, or who are participating in a religious service or voting. Texas this week began its monthlong early voting period for its primary elections.

Abbott also gave mayors and county authorities the ability to ban outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people.

In his order and a statement, Abbott said wearing a mask is a proven method to slowing down the virus' spread and said if Texans comply “more extreme measures may be avoided.”

Abbott has said he doesn't want to roll back his previous orders to reopen the economy. But last week he moved to reclose bars and limit dine-in capacity in restaurants to 50%.

“We have the ability to keep businesses open and move our economy forward so that Texans can continue to earn a paycheque , but it requires each of us to do our part to protect one another — and that means wearing a face covering in public spaces,” Abbott said.

Abbott has been under extreme pressure from both Democrats and Republicans on his reopening plans.

Democrats, most notably the leadership of the state's largest cities, have complained Abbott reopened Texas too quickly and have pointed to the record numbers of confirmed new cases and hospitalizations.

Conservative lawmakers battered Abbott's early moves to combat the virus, including business, school and child-care closures and a stay-at-home order that expired in May.

In April, Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called attempts by local governments in the Houston area to enforce mask orders with fines the “ultimate government overreach.”

“The move to mandate facemasks comes far too little, far too late for Governor Abbott,"" Texas Democratic Party Communications Director Abhi Rahman said. “Texans are still getting sick. Families are still suffering ... All of this could have been prevented if Governor Abbott had listened to experts and medical professionals in the first place.""

The Texas Medical Association applauded the mask order.

“There is no question about it, face masks reduce the spread of COVID-19. They help protect the people wearing masks, and they help protect the people around them,” said the association's president, Dr. Diana L. Fite.

Actors had reportedly been rehearsing remotely for the film produced by Michael Bay and directed by Adam Mason.

The film’s pre-production listing on IMDbPro.com says its stars include Demi Moore, Peter Stormare and Craig Robinson, and gives the description, “In a post-pandemic world, an even more serious virus continues to mutate.”

But the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Actors issued a do-not-work order to its members, saying the production company “has failed to complete the signatory process,” and working on the film could result in disciplinary action.

“The producers have not been transparent about their safety protocols and that is something we obviously take very seriously,"" a SAG-AFTRA spokesperson said in a statement. ""Also, as noted in the Do Not Work order, the producers have not yet become signatory to our agreement. We have no further comment.”

The small film was among the first to attempt to resume production after the long closure. California Gov. Gavin Newsom gave film and television productions the green light to resume shooting in the state starting June 12, so long as strict coronavirus restrictions were in place.

Messages seeking comment from the film's production companies and representatives for Bay and Mason were not immediately returned.

60,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7470/review-a-master-class-by-catherine-deneuve-in-the-truth,Review: A master class by Catherine Deneuve in 'The Truth',[],,"Family may be the great subject of Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda, but he doesn't draw straightforward portraits. In Kore-eda's hands, family is more malleable. He tends to shift roles around like he's rearranging furniture, subtly remaking familiar dynamics until he has, without you knowing it, undone everything.

In his delicate, devastating and deeply humane films, family works like a prism, a way to see things often obscured in Japanese society. In “Like Father, Like Son,” a switched-at-birth tale (usually the stuff of melodrama) is used to delicately render class divisions. In “Nobody Knows,” four children of different fathers and one mother for a moment find harmony together. In his Palme d'Or-winning “Shoplifters,” a makeshift and impoverished clan are a truer family than most that are bound by DNA.

For Kore-eda, family is a choice. And in his latest and first French-language film, “The Truth,” it's a choice that his central character — a celebrated French actor played by Catherine Deneuve — has seemingly abdicated. “I prefer to have been a bad mother, a bad friend and a good actress,” she says without regret.

Kore-eda has shifted from Japan to Paris. Fabienne (Deneuve) is a grand dame of French cinema not so unlike Deneuve, herself, who is visited by what she calls the ""little family” of her daughter, Lumin (Juliette Binoche) from New York. With Lumin are her actor husband Hank (Ethan Hawke) and daughter Charlotte (Clémentine Grenier). They arrive just as Fabienne's not entirely factual memoir, titled “The Truth,” is being published. “My memories, my book,” she says.

The visit takes place while Fabienne is filming a science-fiction film as an ageless, space- travelling mother — another layer of fiction in “The Truth” that serves as a part authentic, part false refraction of who Fabienne is as a mother. She can act the part, but can she actually be it?

Lumin certainly doesn't think so. She carries with her plenty of childhood baggage from Fabienne's less than caring upbringing, including the time Fabienne locked her in the basement as punishment and then forgot to let her out. “I was shooting,” she says matter-of-factly, like her priorities were squarely in order.

But “The Truth” steadily chips away at some of those old grievances, causing Lumin to question her recollections and soften under Fabienne’s indomitable will. (""You can't trust memories,"" her mother tells her. “Memories come and go.”)

The conflicts, including Hank’s drinking problem, are a little familiar and the film’s sensibility at times verges on the territory of countless other French dramas. Kore-eda shot the film with a French crew, directing through a translator, and an element of his gentle brilliance doesn't come through quite as clearly in translation.

But “The Truth” is still often masterful in delicately balancing conflicting ideas at once. And, besides, Deneuve. The once and always belle du jour doesn’t overwhelm the film with winks to her own storied past; she simply commands it by her own formidable presence. Her Fabienne — cruelly cutting, wholly remorseless, sensationally talented — is too alive for mere homage. She wouldn’t stand it for it, besides.

There are moments when she and Binoche share the screen that are almost overwhelming for how simply good — in vastly different ways — both actors are. And then there are notes of grace like when the whole shambling clan stumbles into the night from a restaurant and begins dancing arm in arm to a street musician’s music. All family life is a performance. And Kore-eda has somehow done it again.

""The Truth,” an IFC Films release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for thematic and suggestive elements, and for smoking and brief language. Running time: 106 minutes. Three stars out of four.

“With heavy but hopeful hearts we wanted to put our own thoughts into the air about what’s happening. These kinds of announcements are always met with scrutiny and speculation and we want to stop that before it even starts.

At the 2019 Grammys, the superstar's critically acclaimed pop-leaning country album, “Golden Hour,” won all four awards it was nominated for, including the coveted top prize, album of the year.

At the show, she thanked Kelly in her acceptance speech: “I really believe I wouldn’t have this album if I hadn’t met you and you didn’t open my heart like you did, so thank you so much.”

Musgraves and Kelly have worked together musically. In 2018 they appeared on the song “To June This Morning” from the album “Johnny Cash: Forever Words,” a compilation project created from Cash’s unknown poetry, lyrics and letters set to music. Musgraves also sang background vocals on Kelly’s 2018 full-length debut album, “Dying Star.”

Kelly will release a new album, “Shape & Destroy,” on Aug. 28, and it will include background vocals by Musgraves. Kelly’s father and sister are also featured on the album.

Kelly has also written songs for other artists, including Tim McGraw, Hayes Carll, Lucie Silvas and Josh Abbott Band. Musgraves co-wrote Miranda Lambert’s 2013 country hit, “Mama’s Broken Heart,” earning herself a Grammy nomination as a songwriter.

Hatice Cengiz spoke at the opening of the trial in absentia of two former aides of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and 18 other Saudi nationals who were charged in Turkey for Khashoggi’s grisly slaying. The journalist's 2018 killing at the consulate sparked international condemnation and cast a cloud of suspicion over the prince.

The 20 Saudi defendants all left Turkey, and Saudi Arabia rejected Turkish demands for their extradition. Some of the men were put on trial in Riyadh behind closed doors. The proceedings were widely criticized as a whitewash. Khashoggi’s family members later announced they had forgiven his killers.

The trial in Turkey is being closely watched for possible new information or evidence from the killing, including the whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains.

Khashoggi, who was a United States resident, had walked into his country’s consulate on Oct. 2, 2018, for an appointment to pick up documents that would allow him to marry his Turkish fiancee. He never walked out.

“He was called (to the consulate) with great betrayal and deception,” the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Cengiz as testifying.

“I am making a complaint about everyone who knew about the incident and about everyone who gave the order,"" said Cengiz, who waited for Khashoggi outside the Istanbul consulate when he went there to obtain the documents and alerted authorities when he failed to come out.

Yasin Aktay, a prominent politician from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party and a friend of Khashoggi's, told the court that the slain journalist felt safe in Turkey despite reports of “operations by Saudis against dissidents abroad.”

Aktay also testified that he alerted Turkey's intelligence chief, among other officials, after Khashoggi failed to emerge from the consulate after five hours. He said the intelligence chief responded, “I wish he hadn't gone in,"" according to Anadolu.

The court also heard testimony from six local Turkish employees of the Saudi Consulate. Five of them said they did not see Khashoggi,. One said he had a brief conversation with the journalist when Khashoggi first entered the building but did not see him again after that.

The trial was adjourned until Nov. 24 to await several actions, including an Interpol response to correspondence concerning Turkish requests for the suspects' arrests, Anadolu reported.

Turkish prosecutors have demanded that the defendants be sentenced to life terms in prison, if convicted.

The Turkish prosecutors have charged the prince’s former advisers, Saud al-Qahtani and Ahmed al-Asiri, with “instigating a premeditated murder with the intent of (causing) torment through fiendish instinct.”

Prosecutors are also seeking life prison sentences for 18 other Saudi nationals charged with carrying out “a premeditated murder with the intent of (causing) torment through fiendish instincts.”

A team of 15 Saudi agents had flown to Turkey to meet Khashoggi inside the consulate. They included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office.

Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw. Turkey, a rival of Saudi Arabia, apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and has shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.

Prior to his killing, Khashoggi had written critically of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince in columns for the Washington Post.

Saudi Arabia had initially offered shifting accounts about Khashoggi’s disappearance. As international pressure mounted because of the Turkish leaks, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl.

Turkish prosecutors say the suspects “acted in consensus from the beginning in line with the decision of taking the victim back to Saudi Arabia and of killing him if he did not agree.”

Riyadh had insisted that the kingdom’s courts are the correct place for the suspects to be tried and put 11 people on trial over the killing. In December, five people were sentenced to death while three others were found guilty of covering up the crime and were sentenced to a combined 24 years in prison.

During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in May, Khashoggi’s son announced that the family pardoned the killers, giving legal reprieve to the five government agents who were sentenced to death.

Tyler Shandro said in a statement Friday that a piece of rope tied into a noose was found taped to the door of an operating room at the Grande Prairie Hospital in 2016.

""In August of 2019, I was first made aware of this incident and was reassured by senior officials that the matter was being dealt with appropriately,"" he said.

Shandro added, however, that he recently heard about it again and there are questions about how Alberta Health Services handled the matter in 2016.

""I share their concerns and I am not satisfied that this matter was handled appropriately,"" he said.

""Racism and bigotry have no place in our health-care system.""

The Opposition NDP's deputy leader and former health minister, Sarah Hoffman, said she hadn't been told about the racism at the time.

""I am shocked and disgusted to learn of the violent, racist incident that occurred at the Grande Prairie Hospital in 2016,"" she said in a statement Friday. ""If I had been informed, I would have taken swift action.

""My record on confronting racism is clear. In 2017, when two AHS employees used a racial slur against an Indigenous woman, we moved swiftly to dismiss them.""

Hoffman added she's concerned that Shandro has known about the incident for nearly a year but has not raised it publicly or acted.

Shandro said in his statement that the initial investigation may have been limited by medical staff bylaws that govern how the health region responds to complaints and disciplines staff.

""These bylaws have not been updated in more than a decade,"" he said. ""Consequently, I have issued a directive requiring AHS to revise their bylaws within 60 days.""

He said he would be introducing legislation next week that would increase the number of public representatives on college councils, hearing tribunals and complaint review committees, which will increase the public's oversight of health professions.

""These initial steps are only the beginning,"" said Shandro.

""The review, which will be made public, will undoubtedly bring further required changes to our attention.""",[]

Instead, public servants will administer the pandemic-related grants, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.

Since the charity founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger was announced as the manager of the program last week, the sole-sourced deal has been criticized because of Trudeau's close relationship with the group. He, his wife and his mother have all been involved in WE events and activities.

Charity experts have also questioned whether WE is equipped for the fine-grained management of such a big government-funded program.

Trudeau repeated Friday morning that his consciousness of his close relationship with WE meant it was left to the public service to decide how to manage the program, and to carry out what he called a ""transparent and open"" process to ultimately go with WE.

Speaking to reporters, Trudeau lamented what he called the ""unfortunate"" unfolding of events over the last few days. He said the government supported the organization's decision.

He said there may be things that federal officials won't be as well placed to do, such as actively recruiting students — there have already been 35,000 applicants for the program by WE's count, exceeding early expectations of 20,000 — and supporting small groups with onboarding and training volunteers.

""One of the things that ends up happening with this is that young people won't maybe have the same kind of access to programs that they ... would have,"" Trudeau said.

""We will continue to work very hard and we need to reflect carefully on what exactly went wrong and how we can make sure that we're doing a better job of supporting young people in the coming months and years.""

The volunteer program is to pay up to $5,000 for schooling costs for participants who volunteer the maximum 500 hours, and is aimed at students who can't find work this summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger said in a statement that volunteers who have already signed up shouldn't be adversely affected, and WE Charity will pay back money it's already received from the federal government.

The Liberals had set aside about $19 million for the organization to administer the program, but the final amount was dependent on how many young people joined it.

The charity did not say how much it had received or repaid when asked, pointing to a statement that ""reflects all that we have to say on this matter.""

In the statement, WE pointed to the ongoing controversy around its involvement in the program as the source of its decision, even though ""the government has provided explanations"" to all questions.

The statement went on to say that the organization was concerned that an ongoing affiliation would mean ""the program itself will begin to suffer — and as a consequence, opportunities for students might be negatively affected.""

The controversy over the charity's involvement only grew as the days wore on, including with revelations of a recording, obtained by The Canadian Press and others, in which Marc Kielburger told youth leaders last month that Trudeau's office reached out one day after the grant was announced on April 22 to get the charity on board. Kielburger later retracted, saying he misspoke. A public servant had called, he said.

Trudeau didn't say whether his office had reached out to WE or the Kielburgers when asked Friday about the recording.

Opposition parties have asked the multiple federal watchdogs to take a closer look at the deal, including a request from the New Democrats on Friday to the ethics commissioner.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said in a tweet nothing clears up why and how the decision was made in the first place, adding that Trudeau ""still needs to answer for this scandal.""

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the Liberals need to back up Trudeau's comments that the public service ran a transparent, open and rigorous process.

""Canadians deserve answers,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""All agreements and communications related to this sole-sourced outsourcing agreement must be audited and examined.""

But there were no new healthcare facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has been declared over, with active outbreaks continuing at two long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility.

Health officials also confirmed a community exposure event at the No. 5 Orange nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on July 1.

If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop. Successful contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires everyone’s involvement.

Public alerts and the temporary closure of businesses are some of the ways public heath teams are working to effectively manage COVID-19 in our communities. To support contact tracing activities, people should complete their own personal risk assessment when deciding where to go and who to see.

Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments and need to be avoided at this time.

The report released today by the Royal Society of Canada found the pandemic was a ""shock wave"" that exposed many long-standing deficiencies in the system.

The group's COVID-19 task force of scientists and researchers said the causes of the failure are complex but are rooted in what they call systemic and deeply institutionalized attitudes about age and gender.

It found that 81 per cent of Canada's COVID-19 deaths have come in long-term care homes, far higher than what is reported in comparable countries, including a 31 per cent figure in the United States and 66 per cent in Spain.

The authors say Canadian homes have allowed staff-to-patient ratios to drop and have increasingly shifted to an unregulated workforce in recent years, even as patients are living longer with diseases that require increasingly complex care.

Their recommendations include implementing national standards for care homes, better data collection and infection-control standards, as well as higher pay, more full-time positions and better benefits for workers, including sick leave and mental health support.",[]

Canada will also treat sensitive goods being exported to Hong Kong as if they were being sent to mainland China.

""Effective immediately, Canada will not permit the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong,"" Trudeau said in a news conference.

China imposed strict new controls on Hong Kong this week, meant to give Beijing more power to police anti-government protests and other activities it considers the work of hostile foreign powers.

Trudeau suggested the new law is a threat to the ""one country, two systems"" philosophy that was supposed to last 50 years after Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.

Canada's relationship with Hong Kong, including freer trade and travel than is allowed between Canada and mainland China, depends on that principle, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said in a separate statement.

""We will continue to support the many connections between Canada and Hong Kong while also standing up for its people,"" Trudeau said.

Canada's moves follow measures taken by the United States earlier this week to tighten trade with Hong Kong and stop selling it military equipment.

Britain announced that up to 2.6 million Hong Kong residents will be able to move to the United Kingdom for up to five years and ultimately seek citizenship. Those are holders of special overseas British passports that have had much more limited rights attached to them until now.

Trudeau hinted that something similar might be in the works in Canada.

""In the days and weeks to come, we're also looking at additional measures, including around immigration,"" he said.

COVID-19 Women’s Initiative is overseeing the drive to help women in challenging circumstances that are further heightened by the pandemic. Supplies from the drive will be donated to local women’s shelters and transition homes.

The resurfacing includes 10,000 square metres (107,639 square feet) of field and will slightly affect the use of the surrounding Minoru track during construction. The resurfacing will be complete this September.

The first step is site preparations and construction fencing. For the duration of the work, a plywood bridge surface will be installed across the eight track lanes next to the grandstand to allow heavy equipment to enter and exit the work zone from the east side of the track.

The plywood bridge surface will prevent walkers and runners from being able to walk around the entire track, and the remaining track surface will be divided into a one-way course. People will proceed in a counter clockwise direction in four lanes, then the course turns around (at the plywood bridge near the grandstand) to proceed in four lanes in a clockwise direction.

Signage, fencing and directional arrows have been added to ensure people are able to continue to use the track surface while maintaining physical distancing. Signs have been posted around the track and field showing the one-way routes that are to be followed.

Minoru oval is one of Richmond’s busiest sport fields, usually used daily for a variety of training and events. The existing field surface is 12 years old and has exceeded the typical life span for an artificial turf field, which is generally up to 10 years. At that point, the turf layer and shock absorbency start to breakdown due to wear and tear.

The replacement work will include the addition of a new shock pad (shock absorbance under layer) to provide long term shock impact attenuation (absorbing impact energy when running.) The existing infill will also be replaced with a new thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) infill, which is suggested to be a cleaner alternative to recycled rubber tire granules.

The project is weather dependent, so could experience some delays if it rains more than usual this summer.

72,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7583/experience-nature-from-your-own-backyard,Experience nature from your own backyard,[],,"Summer has arrived, and with it another season of camping.

But the COVID-19 pandemic has changed many things about a season traditionally filled with outdoor excursions. In the absence of formal events, people can still enjoy the joys of nature from the safety of their own backyard.

“I love the idea of camping in your backyard because it’s convenient,” says Richmond Nature Park coordinator Kris Bauder. “You don’t have that fuss and bother of going out into the woods somewhere, and there are amazing things happening at night that most people don’t even think are there.”

Bauder says many people go inside as soon as it gets dark, so they miss many aspects of outdoor life. In her own backyard she’s recorded a variety of wildlife including raccoons, skunks, bats, squirrels, rabbits, and frogs—which she calls “the chorus of the night.”

“One of the most wonderful things I ever saw was dew worms dancing,” says Bauder. “They come partway out of their burrow and twist and turn, and it’s this slow motion ballet—it’s absolutely amazing.”

Some animals can be heard even when invisible. Crickets and frogs are easy for most people to hear, but bats can be more stealthy because of their quiet volume.

“Mostly it’s children that can hear (bats), because they have a wider range of hearing,” says Bauder.

But, she warns, there are some animals to be extra cautious around. If you live in a neighbourhood with bears, don’t sleep outside. And if you have coyotes nearby, spook them by making loud noises with pots and pans or throwing small stones, sticks or a tennis ball.

To avoid attracting animals at night, put all food and cooking supplies away—including your barbecue or grill. Raccoons can also open things like barbecues, and may damage them if left in the open.

“Water is something that will attract things as well, so if you have a bird bath or a fish pond or something in your backyard, it can be a wonderful draw for wildlife,” Bauder says. “Raccoons are definitely drawn to ponds with goldfish in them, mosquitoes breed in ponds, and other things like bats will be around because of the mosquitoes.”

While precautions should be taken outside, there are also huge advantages to experiencing the outdoors at night.

“It’s enlightenment—I think you can learn to appreciate what’s out there,” says Bauder. “There’s a whole community of life that most people probably aren’t aware of.”

While backyard camping may be the most accessible way to sleep outside this summer, plans are afoot for more learning opportunities courtesy of Parks Canada and the city.

“The City of Richmond has run a ‘learn to camp’ program for about seven or eight years, an overnight program where we stay at one of the parks,” explains Rich Kenny, community facilities programmer for Richmond Nature Park and Terra Nova Park.

After discovering that Parks Canada offered similar programs, the city combined forces with the organization two years ago. Since then, events have run at Woodward’s Landing—a Girl Guides of Canada property on Dyke Road—each year.

The pandemic has forced the cancellation of this year’s ‘learn to camp’ event—which would have run last weekend under normal circumstances. But Kenny says the Parks Canada team is exploring several alternative options, including programs on how to physical distance effectively outside and while camping, as well as ‘animal aware’ sessions for adults and families.

73,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7467/reopening-strategist-castex-named-new-french-prime-minister,Reopening strategist Castex named new French prime minister,[],,"PARIS — The new French prime minister appointed Friday said he feels ready to face the key challenge of reviving France's economy following the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic and a two-month nationwide lockdown.

The relatively low-profile Jean Castex, who co-ordinated France’s virus reopening strategy, replaces Edouard Philippe, who resigned earlier in the day as French President Emmanuel Macron reshuffles the government to shift its focus for the remaining two years of his term.

Macron, who says he wants a “new path” for the remainder of his first presidential term, chose in Castex a new face to address social and economic issues amid France's recovery. The 42-year-old centrist president has not said yet whether he plans to seek reelection in 2022.

Largely unknown to the French public, Castex, 55, is a career public servant who has worked with multiple governments but never as a minister. France’s gradual reopening since May 11, a task the new prime minister oversaw, has been seen as generally successful so far.

Castex's most recent mission consisted of co-ordinating efforts to lift lockdown restrictions while keeping the virus under control, from reopening schools to making face masks mandatory on public transportation.

His appointment as prime minister does not require parliamentary approval.

“The health crisis is unfortunately not over ... and the economic and social crisis is already there,” Castex said during the handover ceremony putting him in office.

“Priorities will need to evolve, methods will need to be adapted,” he added, without elaborating.

Earlier in the day, Castex acknowledged in a written statement ""the immense task ahead.”

A conservative, Castex began a local political career in 2008 in the small town of Prades in southern France, where he was reelected as mayor in March with backing from The Republicans party. He also held elected office in the Pyrenees-Orientales region, near the Spanish border.

He notably worked as deputy secretary-general at the presidency under former President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011-2012. He had previous jobs at the Health Ministry and Labor Ministry.

He’s been a co-ordinator of government planning for the Olympic Games since 2017, along with other major sporting events.

Castex is also considered an expert in social affairs and health policies, two topics that will be on top of the agenda in the coming months.

He is a graduate of France’s elite Ecole Nationale d’Administration, the training ground also attended by Macron and many previous French presidents. Castex also studied law and political science, according to his biography on the Prades town website .

Many government members are expected to be replaced in the forthcoming reshuffle.

Macron seeks balance between ministers coming from the right and from the left as well as centrist allies and people from the private sector.

The reshuffle comes days after a green wave swept over France in local elections. Macron saw his young centrist party defeated in France’s biggest cities and failing to plant local roots across the country.

The changes were planned even before Sunday's voting, as Macron’s government faced obstacles and criticism before and during the virus crisis.

As the pandemic was peaking in the country in March and April, authorities came under fire for the lack of masks, tests and medical equipment.

Before that, Macron’s pro-business policies, widely seen as favouring the wealthier, had been hampered by the yellow vest economic movement against perceived social injustice. This winter, weeks of strikes and street demonstrations against a planned pension overhaul disrupted the country.

Macron’s popularity rate, which plunged to a record low when the yellow vest movement emerged, is now hovering around 39 per cent on average, according to French polls institutes. This is about 7 points higher than before the virus crisis.

Macron’s efforts to boost job creation have been swept away by the economic and social consequences of the country’s lockdown.

The government issued a 460 billion-euro emergency package through a state-funded partial activity scheme, tax cuts and other financial aids for businesses, and Macron needs to adapt his policies as France’s economy is expected to shrink by 11 per cent this year.

The unemployment rate that fell from 9.2 per cent at the beginning of Macron’s term in 2017 to 7.6 per cent earlier this year — its lowest level since 2008 — is now expected to increase steadily.

“Our first priority will be to rebuild an economy that is strong, ecological, sovereign and united,” Macron said in a televised address to the nation on June 14.

He ruled out any tax rise and instead said “working and producing more” is the response amid bankruptcies and layoffs caused by the crisis.

He put an emphasis on creating new jobs with climate-oriented policies including renovation of old buildings and greener transport and industries.

Philippe, 49, is expected to become the mayor of his hometown of Le Havre, in western France, after he won a large victory in Sunday's voting.

A conservative, former member of The Republicans’ party, he had joined Macron’s government in May 2017.

He had seen his popularity sharply increase in recent weeks, according to French poll institutes that show many French consider he did good job in gradually easing virus-related restrictions in the country and enforcing an emergency package to support the French economy.

78,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7640/wisconsin-supreme-court-oks-gop-authored-lame-duck-laws,Wisconsin Supreme Court OKs GOP-authored lame-duck laws,[],,"MADISON, Wis. — The conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Republican-authored lame-duck laws that stripped power from the incoming Democratic attorney general just before he took office in 2019.

The justices rejected arguments that the laws were unconstitutional, handing another win to Republicans who have scored multiple high-profile victories before the court in recent years.

The 5-2 ruling marks the second time that the court has upheld the lame-duck laws passed in December 2018, just weeks before Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, took office. The actions in Wisconsin mirrored Republican moves after losing control of the governors' offices in Michigan in November 2018 and in North Carolina in 2016. Democrats decried the tactics as brazen attempts to hold onto power after losing elections.

The Wisconsin laws curtailed the powers of both the governor and attorney general, but the case decided Thursday dealt primarily with powers taken from Kaul.

The attorney general said in a statement that Republican legislators have demonstrated open hostility to him and Evers and made it harder for state government to function. Evers echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, saying Republicans have been working against him “every chance they get, regardless of the consequences.”

Thursday’s ruling involved a case filed by a coalition of labour unions led by the State Employees International Union. The coalition argued that the laws give the Legislature power over the attorney general’s office and that this violates the separation of powers doctrine in the state constitution.

The laws prohibit Evers from ordering Kaul to withdraw from lawsuits, let legislators intervene in lawsuits using their own attorneys rather than Kaul’s state Department of Justice lawyers, and force Kaul to get permission from the Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee before settling lawsuits.

Republicans designed the laws to prohibit Evers from pulling Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and to ensure that they have a say in court if Kaul chooses not to defend GOP-authored laws.

Evers still pulled the state out of the health care lawsuit after a lower judge temporarily blocked the laws, but the restrictions on settlements have proven divisive. Kaul has said settlement discussions are confidential and has refused to share details of cases with the committee, putting tens of millions of dollars in potential settlement revenue in jeopardy. In recent months the committee has signed off on a handful of settlements after the litigants allowed Kaul to share details of the deals, but no formal process exists for how to handle settlements under the laws.

The court ruled that the attorney general derives his powers from state statutes, not the constitution, and his role is not a core function of the executive branch. The Legislature clearly has an interest in joining lawsuits independently and signing off on settlements because it's responsible for spending the state's money, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority.

""While representing the State in litigation is predominately an executive function, it is within those borderlands of shared powers, most notably in cases that implicate an institutional interest of the legislature,"" Hagedorn wrote.

The Legislature's top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, hailed the ruling as a victory.

“A rogue attorney general can no longer unilaterally settle away laws already on the books,” Fitzgerald said.

The court's two liberal justices, Rebecca Dallet and Ann Walsh Bradley, argued in dissent that the ruling blurs the lines between the executive and legislative branches.

“The power of the purse cannot be understood so broadly as to permit substantial burdens on another branch’s intersecting power,” Dallet wrote. “The Wisconsin Constitution, like the United States Constitution, does not contemplate an active role for the legislature in executing or in supervising the executive officers charged with executing the laws it enacts.”

The unions' attorneys didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The decision doesn't close the door to future legal challenges. Hagedorn wrote that the ruling doesn't address how the lame-duck laws are specifically applied, leaving open a potential line of attack. For example, a litigant looking to get a case settled with the state could sue if the budget committee simply won't address the matter, Evers' attorney Lester Pines said.

Kaul said in a phone interview that he wasn't sure what his next steps would be, but he didn't rule out that he or his allies might file more challenges.

“That (the court) didn't rule more broadly indicates we're going to have success in challenging applications of those laws,” he said.

Democrats and liberal groups have been trying to push back against the laws since they were passed but have had little success.

Liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now persuaded a federal judge in January 2019 to block language in the law that restricted in-person early voting to the two weeks before an election.

The League of Women Voters and other groups filed a state lawsuit arguing the laws as a whole were invalid because Republican lawmakers passed them after the Legislature’s regular session had ended months earlier. The justices ruled last year that lawmakers can meet whenever they wish.

The Supreme Court did deliver a partial win for Evers on Thursday, throwing out some of the rules the Legislature put in place that required his administration to rewrite thousands of government “guidance documents” and websites . The law also gave the Legislature more power to block rules written by the Evers administration.

The court found the rules were overly broad and unconstitutional. Evers had argued that the new requirements to rewrite documents were so extensive it would make it impossible for the executive branch to get information to the public.

The court is set to hand down another significant ruling Friday on whether Evers exceeded his authority with four partial budget vetoes he issued last year. That decision could further weaken his ability to rewrite proposals coming out of the Republican-led Legislature.

The settlement comes as government workers scramble to get emergency benefits out to individual Canadians and businesses affected by the economic crisis that has flowed from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The lump-sum payments are contained in a side deal reached late Thursday alongside a tentative contract settlement for about 70,000 civil servants that includes average annual wage increases of 2.11 per cent over a three-year term.

The Public Service Alliance of Canada said the payments are compensation for the problems caused to federal workers by the broken Phoenix pay system, which created underpayments, overpayments or in some cases no pay cheques for tens of thousands of government employees.

""After four years of stress, uncertainty, and financial hardships because their employer couldn't pay them correctly or on time, our members will finally be compensated for the Phoenix pay disaster,"" PSAC national president Chris Aylward said in a statement.

The compensation agreement affects about 140,000 PSAC members but could also affect members of other unions that last year agreed to compensation of five days of cashable leave.

PSAC, Canada's biggest civil service union, had rejected that settlement, calling the five extra vacation days ""meagre.""

The other unions may benefit from the PSAC deal, however, because their agreements included clauses that would provide their members with compensation equal to whatever PSAC was able to negotiate.

The PSAC agreement, which does not require ratification by its members, would see general damages paid to federal public service employees working for a range of government departments between 2016 and 2020.

It also includes compensation for the late implementation of collective agreements during those years caused by the Phoenix pay system.

Compensation totals $1,000 for employees working in the fiscal year 2016-17 and $500 in each of the following three years.

Beyond the lump sum, government employees who suffered severe losses due to the Phoenix pay system, such as losing their homes, cars or investments, or who had their credit ratings harmed, can claim damages.

When conceived in 2009, the Phoenix system was supposed to streamline the public service payroll and save taxpayers more than $70 million annually.

But after its launch in 2016, more than half of civil servants experienced pay problems, forcing the government to hire extra staff and set up satellite pay centres across the country in an effort to chip away at problem cases.

As of June 24, the backlog of problem files had been reduced to 125,000 financial transactions beyond normal workload, according to the public service pay centre dashboard, which tracks pay issues.

The most recent estimated cost of stabilizing Phoenix was pegged at more than $1 billion, not including the amount it will take to create, test and launch a new pay system that works.

Separately, PSAC and the Treasury Board Secretariat, which is responsible for negotiating contracts with federal employees, said they had reached a tentative settlement late Thursday for about half of PSAC's members.

The three-year deal for program and administrative services group employees includes wage increases of 2.8 per cent in the first year, followed by 2.2 per cent in the second and 1.35 per cent in the final year.

The tentative agreement applies to close to 84,000 federal employees, including non-unionized workers, according to Treasury Board.

It also contains new provisions for caregiver leave, extended parental leave, and up to 10 days of domestic violence leave.

Details on when a ratification vote will be held are expected next week.

Peter Nygard's motion filed Wednesday in a New York court argues it does not have jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit.

Fifty-seven women, including 18 Canadians, have joined the lawsuit, which alleges that Nygard used violence, intimidation, bribery and company employees to lure victims and avoid accountability for decades.

The women are asking for a trial by jury and are seeking yet-to-be determined damages.

Nygard, who is 78, has denied all allegations and blames a conspiracy caused by a feud with his billionaire neighbour in the Bahamas.

He stepped down as chairman of his company after the FBI and police in New York City raided his offices in February soon after the lawsuit was filed.

The original lawsuit against Nygard included allegations from 10 women accusing him of enticing them to his estate in the Bahamas. Women continued to add their names to the lawsuit.

Some of the allegations date back 40 years.

In court documents, the women share stories about being brought to Nygard's offices and properties with promises of modelling and other career opportunities. Some of the women allege they were given alcohol spiked with drugs before they were sexually assaulted.

The lawsuit contains allegations that have not been proven in court.

Nygard was once one of the richest people in Canada. The lawsuit said Nygard has an estimated net worth of about $900 million.

He started his company in Winnipeg more than 50 years ago.

Nygard says Manitoba has been his primary residence since the start of 2019. He considered Nassau in the Bahamas, where he has permanent residency, his main home from 1970 until that time.

Court documents say he is not a citizen or permanent resident in the United States and doesn't pay taxes in New York.

Nygard also says that while New York City was described as the Nygard ""world"" or ""corporate"" headquarters, it was only done for promotional and marketing purposes.

The motion argues that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York does not have jurisdiction for those reasons.

The documents also say the women's claims are not eligible for a class-action suit.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court. Cargill did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

82,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7466/provincial-watchdog-probes-often-dont-lead-to-charges-against-police,Provincial watchdog probes often don't lead to charges against police,[],,"An analysis of data from civilian police watchdogs in Canada shows that most of their investigations do not result in charges against officers.

Charges were laid or forwarded to Crown prosecutors for consideration in three to nine per cent of the cases opened by the provincial agencies, a review by The Canadian Press of their most recent annual reports largely covering 2018 and 2019 found.

Seven provinces have independent police oversight agencies that probe cases of death and serious injury that could be the result of police action or inaction, however, the data was incomplete for some units.

Erick Laming, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto who studies police use of force and its impacts on Indigenous and Black communities, said the numbers can be interpreted in two ways.

They may be taken to mean that watchdogs cast wide nets in their investigations and officers in most cases were justified in their use of force. But they can also be seen as evidence that the agencies are toothless against a legal system that makes it difficult to prosecute officers, he said.

Under the Criminal Code, a police officer is justified in using force in a lawful arrest as long as the officer acts on ""reasonable and probable grounds and uses only as much force as reasonably necessary in the circumstances.""

If they fear for their life or someone else's and that fear is deemed reasonable, they are typically cleared, he said.

""They have a very long rope when you think about it,"" Laming said.

Civilian oversight agencies are relatively new. Apart from 30-year-old Ontario's Special Investigations Unit, which closed 416 cases and charged officers in 15 of them in 2018, most have been introduced in the past decade.

They're a welcome addition to police oversight, given that the alternative sees police or watchdogs from outside jurisdictions conduct investigations, Laming said.

""When you have another police service going in to investigate that has no connection to that area, it's problematic,"" he said.

But the agencies aren't perfect, Laming said. They typically have a high threshold for defining ""serious injury"" so anything that doesn't end in hospitalization is excluded from an investigation, he said.

The use of former police officers as investigators is also seen by some as a built-in bias, while Laming said they should strive to include more Indigenous, Black and other investigators of colour.

A Canadian Press review found that of the 167 members involved in these units, 111 are former police officers.

And only some of the agencies are empowered to lay charges themselves, while others can only share the results of their investigations with the Crown, Laming said.

Felix Cacchione, director of Nova Scotia's Serious Incident Response Team, said officers are expected to use a ""continuum of force"" when responding to a call.

""The first part of that continuum is trying to reason with the person, calm them down, diffuse the situation verbally and then it progresses from there,"" he said.

Cacchione's team recorded the highest rate of charges among the provincial units, with four charges laid in 44 cases opened in 2018-19. The charges represent nine per cent of all cases opened that year — although charges were laid in 22 per cent of the cases that resulted in investigations.

""If a peace officer or a person assisting a peace officer is in a situation that poses a threat of grievous bodily harm, then that peace officer or person assisting can use as much force as necessary to prevent the threat from being a reality,"" he said.

If an officer enters an empty church and there's a person 12 metres away ""ranting and raving"" with a knife, that's not enough to justify the use of force, said Cacchione. If the person is two metres away with a butcher's knife, that's considered a real threat, he said.

Cacchione worked as a criminal defence lawyer for decades before taking the job at the civilian agency in 2018. He said he was shocked to learn police training involves aiming for the centre body mass of someone posing a threat.

""Whenever I would hear someone being shot six, seven, eight, nine times by a police officer, I would think, well what's going on, this is excessive. Why didn't they shoot the person in the knee or the arm?""

He said he learned officers are trained that way because they're likely to miss an arm or a leg. Cacchione recalled watching an instructor with a timer order an officer to shoot the centre body mass three times, then the head twice on the count of three.

""That takes just 2.4 seconds,"" he said.

Based on what he's learned, Cacchione said he believes there should be a greater involvement of mental health workers where possible, although there's not always time in dynamic situations.

Adam Palmer, president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, said there are many levels of oversight in Canada, ranging from police boards for municipal forces to complaint commissioners and other bodies.

He would welcome the introduction of civilian oversight bodies for incidents of death or serious harm in jurisdictions that don't have them yet, he said.

""I'm definitely in favour of it,"" said Palmer, who is also chief constable of the Vancouver Police Department.

Data from the Independent Investigations Office of B.C. shows Palmer's police department was investigated 30 times last year, a large number relative to other forces in B.C. The next highest source of complaints was the RCMP's Surrey and Prince George detachments, with six investigations each.

Although Vancouver with a population of 630,000 is marginally larger than Surrey at 520,000, Palmer attributed the high number of incidents to Vancouver's role as a hub city that is a destination for people from across the region, rather than training or officer conduct.

In the vast majority of cases, officers were not charged and Palmer said that shows they operated legally.

Nobody wants to see anyone injured during an interaction with police, but it's unrealistic to expect that's entirely avoidable, he said.

""Sometimes to get in there and save somebody's life or assist someone in need you will need to use physical force,"" he said. ""Not every case will be de-escalated.""

Harsha Walia, executive director of the BC Civil Liberties Association, said oversight of the police wouldn't need to be reviewed if there was a broader shift to reduce the scope and scale of the departments, including the removal of mental-health calls from their mandate.

""It's clear we need other solutions,"" she added.

When officers are involved in a violent incident, they should be held to a higher standard than other citizens, said Walia.

""There have to be different standards in place based on the power dynamic,"" she said.

83,richmondsentinel,https://richmondsentinel.ca/article-detail/7676/with-new-name-and-album-the-chicks-voices-ring-loud-again,"With new name and album, The Chicks' voices ring loud again",[],,"NASHVILLE — The Dixie Chicks are no more. Breaking their ties to the South, The Chicks are stepping into a new chapter in their storied career with their first new music in 14 years.

The Texas trio of Emily Strayer, Martie Maguire and Natalie Maines have been teasing new music for a year, and “Gaslighter” finally drops on July 17 when the nation is embroiled in divisive politics, cancel culture and a racial reckoning.

“It just seemed like a good reflection on our times,” said Maines. “In 20 years, we’ll look back at that album cover and title and remember exactly what was going on in the country right then.”

“Gaslighter” is a term that describes a psychological abuser who manipulates the truth to make a person feel crazy. In recent years, it’s been used to describe powerful men like Harvey Weinstein or Donald Trump.

“I think most everybody has a gaslighter in their lives somewhere,” said Strayer. “But, yeah, it was so weird how it echoes our current administration.”

As the bestselling female group in RIAA history, The Chicks appealed to a generation of country fans who saw themselves in the band’s stories, whether it was “Wide Open Spaces” or “Cowboy Take Me Away.” Their first major label record in 1998 has sold 13 million copies in the U.S. alone.

With Maguire on fiddle and Strayer on banjo, they were all steeped in bluegrass and classic country, but relished in fun country pop on crossover songs like “Goodbye Earl.” They were country music’s next big thing until suddenly the door was slammed on them.

In 2003, as then-President George Bush was preparing to invade Iraq, the trio were playing a show in London when Maines announced they were ashamed that the president was from Texas.

The fallout became country music lore, a warning to stay away from political talk, especially of the liberal kind. They were booed on awards shows, radio stations pulled their music and fans destroyed their CDs. Maguire only recently showed her daughters the 2006 documentary called “Shut Up and Sing,” that showed how the backlash affected them behind the scenes.

Maguire feared her 11-year-old might be too young for some of the material, which included death threats.

Instead, her social media-savvy daughters were confused by the reaction to Maines’ tame comments compared to today's vitriolic criticism.

“And it was just funny hearing 16- and 11-year-olds going, ‘Why? What? Wait. She said that? And people got so mad?’” said Maguire.

The trio are all now parents of teenagers when youth activists are taking the lead on gun control, climate change and racial inequality. Their song, “March March,” which was released the same day they announced they were dropping the word Dixie from their name, was inspired by student-led gun control demonstrations in 2018.

On “Juliana Calm Down,” their daughters and nieces are name-checked in a song that encourages young women to keep their heads held high when struggling through life’s obstacles. Maines speaks to her two teenage boys on “Young Man,” a song for all those divorced parents who feel like they’ve let down their kids.

Hit pop songwriter Justin Tranter, who has co-written hits for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and Lady Gaga, helped The Chicks co-write some of the album's most raw, vulnerable break up songs, including “Sleep At Night.""

“Some of those pre-choruses are not songs,” said Tranter. “Natalie was just talking and I was literally writing down what she was saying and then I found a way to put it to a melody.”

“Gaslighter” was recorded and co-written with Jack Antonoff, a Grammy-winning producer-artist known for recording with Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey and Lorde. He pushed them to use their core strength, the three-part harmonies backed by fiddle and banjo, in new ways.

Their last album, 2006's “Taking The Long Way,” earned five Grammys, including album of the year, and won over masses of fans who never listened to them before. But it’s unlikely the fans who turned their back on The Chicks 17 years ago are going to feel any different about their return.

When The Chicks and Beyoncé performed at the Country Music Association Awards in 2016, a vocal minority unleashed their anger on social media at the idea that both artists would be invited to perform.

Although their fallout occurred before Twitter or Facebook, The Chicks have a unique viewpoint on the rise of cancel culture, when prominent people are attacked online in an almost mob mentality.

“On one hand, you know, it’s freeing now. People just are way more vocal,"" said Maines. ""But then the downside is one slip up, one major slip up, and no publicist can make that go away.”

Maines said for movements like #MeToo, those speaking out online held people accountable. “And you can’t silence or quiet them when you’ve got so many women coming forward.""

The phrase “shut up and sing” is still used as a weapon against women, minorities and anyone straying from their musical lane. But The Chicks think younger music fans don’t adhere to that idea.

“There’s not a whole lot of respect anymore if you’re just going to smile and entertain,” Maines said. “They want you to have a point of view.”

The Election Department said Lee’s People’s Action Party secured 83 parliamentary seats, or 89% of the total. The Workers Party, the only opposition with a presence in parliament, increased its seats from six to 10. Local media reported the PAP’s popular vote fell to 61%. It marked a decline in the PAP’s performance from 2015 polls where it took 93% of seats and nearly 70% of total vote.

“In the Singapore context, this is a defeat (for PAP). Worst seat performance and loss of popular vote in an election that they called early in a pandemic mistakenly thinking the crisis would help them,"" said Bridget Welsh, honorary research associate at Malaysia's University of Nottingham.

“The PAP has a mandate but one that puts the party on notice that Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans, expect more,"" she said.

The PAP has dominated politics since 1959, when Lee’s father, Lee Kuan Yew, became Singapore’s first prime minister and built the resource-poor city-state into one of the world’s richest nations during 31 years in office. But it has also been criticized for tight government control, media censorship and use of oppressive laws and civil lawsuits against dissidents.

Polling was earlier extended by two hours until 10 p.m. (1400 GMT) after strict safety measures in place for Southeast Asia’s first national election amid the pandemic delayed voting at some stations. Some opposition parties slammed the move as irregular and warned it may compromise the election's integrity.

Voting is compulsory in the tiny city-state, one of a handful of countries that has held elections during the pandemic. The Election Department earlier dropped a requirement that disposable gloves be worn during voting to cut waiting time.

Retiree Dennis Phua said the election shouldn't have been rushed since the PAP's five-year mandate would have continued until next April. He said he hopes for louder opposition voices in parliament so the PAP wont be “so arrogant.""

“There are so many things we are not satisfied with. It’s a good government, but the way they do things can be better,"" Phua said as he waited outside a school to vote.

But not all agree.

“I hope that it will remain as the status quo. For so many years, it has been the same and so far so good,” said homemaker Florence See. She praised the government for putting in place strict measures to protect voters.

Lee has faced opposition from his estranged younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, who said the PAP had turned into an elitist party. The younger Lee joined an opposition party last month but is not running in the election. The prime minister has said the polls are about ensuring a strong government to secure the country's future, not his family feud.

Singapore’s election follows polls in Serbia and Mongolia last month and in South Korea in April, when governing parties in all three countries scored resounding victories.

The polls come just weeks after the country emerged from a two-month lockdown aimed at controlling one of Asia’s worst coronavirus outbreaks. The tiny nation of 5.8 million people has reported more than 45,000 cases, most of them foreign workers living in crowded dormitories that were overlooked in the early phase of its crisis management.

With the economy forecast to shrink this year by up to 7 per cent, Lee's government has unveiled several economic assistance packages totalling nearly 100 billion Singapore dollars ($71.7 billion) but warned the full economic impact hasn't been felt yet.

While coronavirus cases have mostly declined, new daily cases still top 100.

The government determined the election could be held safely with the number of polling stations increased from 880 to 1,100 and other safety measures such as masks and temperature checks.

Voters were given a two-hour window to cast their ballots to reduce crowding, with senior citizens give priority to vote in the first four hours. Election officials were wearing full personal protective gear and polling booths were sanitized every half hour. People being treated for COVID-19 or under quarantine at home were not allowed to vote.

Ng reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
