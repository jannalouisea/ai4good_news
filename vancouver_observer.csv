Some very recent releases have been rushed out, like Onward (at Disney+) and Portrait of a Lady On Fire, one of the best from last year. Several that were to open theatrically today are now streaming too. I cover several of those, including …

Elephant: 3 ½ stars

Dolphin Reef: 3

ELEPHANT: is the most enthralling of the now several of these annual Disney wildlife documentaries that I’ve seen. As usual there is sentimentality and a cutesy story but there are also spectacularly beautiful images and a couple of extremely scary sequences. And best of all, a lot to learn. It’s good for kids, though I’d be careful with the very young. Oh, and there’s even a fart joke.

“Family is everything,” says the narrator, “Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex” who was briefly a BC resident. It’s a bearable statement because it’s based on observation. There are other lines that are just too anthropomorphic to feel real. “Time for a pool party.” And how do the filmmakers know what elephants dream about when they sleep?





Their central character is a one-year old named Jomo who is playful, easily distracted and by the end of the film must learn the ancient ways of his species. He gets that from mom and her sister, the matriarch who leads the herd on a 1,000 mile trek. The route takes them from a delta that dries up annually in Botswana to Victoria Falls with its plentiful water. Along the way, and back, they trudge through a long dry saltpan, through windstorms, awfully close to crocodiles and hyenas and in a most tense sequence through an attack by lions. There’s high drama and danger (as when a baby has to be rescued from a mud pit) and impossible pictures (like swimming elephants photographed from below in the water). Ms. Markle’s reading of a rather stiff script can’t match the majesty of those visuals. (Disney+) 3 ½ out of 5

DOLPHIN REEF: This one follows the same story arc as Elephant. There's a playful child who has to learn to grow up, a family group that has to live within the particular rules of its environment and an attack by predators. There's even more dazzling colour than usual because this family lives at a coral reef among a sparkling array of plants and creatures. It's ""like one big carnival"" according to narrator Natalie Portman. They're Pacific bottlenose dolphins; the child is named Echo and those are orcas that come attacking. Also sharks and cuttlefish.

Echo gets lost at one point, wastes his time playing with a shell at another and ultimately has to learn a lot, especially about co-operation. Dolphins make allies of humpback whales. Every creature on the reef has to contribute to keep it alive and healthy. Parrotfish, for instance, keep it clean, gardener fish eat the excess plants. Sometimes we get a swirling mass of fish; other times a slow motion ballet, in crisp and beautiful underwater cinematography. There's high tension when Echo wanders off and is alone in the dark. That's when the sharks prowl. The highlight though is an amazing fishing scene. The dolphins get the fish to leap out of the water and literally catch them out of the air. Again, enlightening; though I would have liked more about the workings of the reef and the threats it faces. (Disney+) 3 out of 5

SLAY THE DRAGON: The Canadian distributor figures this powerful documentary wouldn’t be of much interest here because it is so American. Have they never heard of the long Gracie’s Finger controversy here in Vancouver? Or how many of us wonder how in the American system politicians can get fewer votes than their opponents and still win an election? One answer is gerrymandering, an old tactic named after a state governor back in the 1800s and used spectacularly just 10 years ago. Re-draw the voting districts, “pack” your opponents’ supporters in just a few, and ensure your own voters are the majority in most, and you win. Modern data mining makes it easier than ever to identify those people.

A Republican strategist named Chris Jankowski pushed it, through his Project Red Map, as a response to Obama’s election. He’s in the film talking proudly about how cheap and effective it was in key states. Businessmen like the Koch brothers and a lobby group The American Legislative Exchange Council supported it and the new maps were drawn in lawyers’ offices. “An assault on democracy,” says a Mother Jones reporter. “A fixed system,” says Arnold Schwarzenegger.",[]

Semi-binge watching The Crown is popular over there at Netflix. Disney+ is rushing The Call of the Wild and Downhill on to its site early and other very recent films like The Hunt, The Invisible Man and Emma are available from Telus and probably others. Star Wars #9, The Gentlemen and Bad Boys for Life are just days away.

Crave TV, which includes HBO, is offering a 30-day free trial (https://www.crave.ca); Amazon (https://www.amazon.com) is giving free access to its kiddie content, including The Stinky & Dirty Show and the Cinematheque has alerted me to the most interesting free offer.

The streaming service MUBI will let you watch their films free for three months and they’re worthwhile. It’s a curated and changing line up, 30 titles at a time, currently ranging from foreign art house hits like Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate, from Japan, three Louis Malle films from France, an Errol Flynn western and a real curio: Our Daily Bread, King Vidor’s film from 1934 that seems to suggest socialism as a cure for the depression. MUBI (https://mubi.com/cinematheque) charges you $1 to create an account.

Also notice the CBC is filling Saturday’s hockey slot with movies, including this week a second and good stab at making a Canadian war film by Paul Gross. Hyena Road depicts our soldiers in Afghanistan fighting and dealing with their issues, something we normally only watch Americans do.

And these are five other titles you can rent and/or stream.

BACURAU: Brazilian directors Juliano Dornelles and Kleber Mendonça Filho have a serious statement to make here – about exploitation of and condescension towards people out there is small rural communities. And by implication about the nation ruled by an increasingly right-wing government. Don’t expect a heavy political screed though. This is a metaphor about colonialism built out of familiar tools of popular culture: traces of science fiction, war movies, widescreen epics and a great deal of the look and feel of American westerns.

You’re entertained; not preached at.

In a fictional village in Brazil’s insubordinate north-east region, American tourists suddenly show up (led by a German mercenary played by Udo Kier). “Technically we are not here,” he says. The locals who have gathered for the funeral of a revered matriarch are on edge. They’re suspicious of strangers, maybe from experience. The name of their town has disappeared off official maps and a doctor, played by Sonia Braga, has a drunken rant warning “We are under attack.” How, I won’t say right now, but with the help of a notorious (and, incidentally, gay) rebel, who they spring from jail, and then by popping “mood-inhibitor” drugs and picking up guns, they organize to take a stand. It’s equally fun and provocative. (Streaming by viff.org) 4 out of 5

THE WILD GOOSE LAKE: The elements are pure film noir. There’s a mysterious woman. A hood with a complex history now chased by both his gang and the police. Shifting alliances, double-crosses and mystery. Not where you expect though. This is set in Wuhan, the Chinese city so much in the news for other reasons these days. It’s dark and rainy much of the time, fitting the story perfectly.

Zhou Zenong (Hu Ge) is hiding out in a train station when he’s approached by a femme fatale, Liu Aiai (Gwei Lun Mei), offering to be his wife. He asks why his real wife hasn’t come to him; she won’t say and they both go off to find her. That’s the start of a byzantine tale that’ll keep you guessing through his own story which he relates in detail, her history as a “bathing beauty” (a prostitute down at the beach) and a violent war between rival gangsters. Diao Yinan, the director, creates a moody atmosphere and stages exciting chases, shootouts and imaginative images. Most interestingly, he gives a raw and dark picture of a lawless strata of Chinese society. I’m surprised the authorities let it come out. (Streaming by viff.org) 3 ½ out of 5",[]

One by one the theatres announced they're closing because of COVID-19: The Rio, Cinematheque, VanCity, the Regal chain, which operates in 42 US states, and then our major ones, Cineplex and Landmark.

Big films like James Bond's 25th, A Quiet Place Part II and Black Widow are delayed. Smaller films too. Mick Jagger was to be on screen as of today (Friday) in an art-world thriller that also includes Donald Sutherland. Two Canadian films, Anne at 13,000 Feet and Ash will just have to wait and the Chinese film To Live to Sing won’t be back in theatres on Monday as planned but goes the next day to iTunes.

There’s more. Both Cannes and the DOXA film festivals has just been postponed, although they were still weeks away. So have the Canadian Screen Awards of March 29.

Worse there are now all sorts of articles fearing for the future--initially for the summer movie season because so much film production has stopped for now and ultimately for the industry as a whole.

Will movie theatres die altogether? Pessimists are asking that question as the streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ fill in and more people discover how much easier it is to watch them than to go out.

I’m not too worried. I say movies have survived onslaughts before and theatre, radio and books haven't disappeared either, have they? But a change is in progress and streaming is it right now.

In that spirit, here are a few recommendations, not at all comprehensive, but maybe useful.

NETFLIX: The streaming giant has a lot of original movies that, according to a friend who’s watched many, are merely ordinary.

That includes Spenser Confidential, the Mark Wahlberg film they’re hyping so much these days. But a new one starting today, The Platform, is getting good reviews.

Good bets though are the four films the Academy Awards nominated: Roma, last year, and The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes this year. Good time to catch up if you haven’t seen them, especially The Two Popes, my favorite of the four.

Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce put on an acting showcase as Benedict and his successor Francis (Pryce should have won the Oscar). Since so much of the film is of the erudite, witty and often funny conversations between the two, it plays well on a TV. Ironically, it also shows what you miss. There’s a re-created Sistine Chapel (filming isn’t allowed in the real one) but you don’t feel the grandeur if you don’t see it on the big screen.

Digging deeper on Netflix I found a gem from four years ago, Lion, in which a boy in India gets himself lost, adopted by a couple in Australia (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) and 20 years later tries to find where he came from. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire and the freshly delayed The Personal History of David Copperfield) plays him as an adult towards a most emotional resolution.

I didn’t have to dig too far to find Contagion. It’s nine years old and has had a lot of attention now because it’s so spot on about exactly what we’re going through. A virus is spreading, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cottilard and others are trying to contain it and a nutbar blogger (Jude Law) is an interfering troll.

There’s constant unease in this Stephen Soderbergh film but also documentary realism that’s scientifically accurate and quite detailed. It seems other streaming services have the film too. It’s enjoying a new life.",[]

Disneyland shut down. The NBA out. Tribeca Film Festival and more movies delayed. Next week's Quiet Place Part II and Mulan the following week are the latest. All because of the coronavirus. Here in town the Rio and Van City Theatres have issued extra precautions to make you feel safe, mostly with cleanliness and also assurances. The Rio says it’s large enough that you won’t be sitting too close to anyone else. VanCity is making sure of that by selling only half the seats.

Ironically this is another week with a big number of new films in town. 11 in all. More than I’ve been able to catch.

BEANPOLE: Of all the movies new in town right now, this is a must see. It is so deeply felt about the aftermath of war, especially on women, that you’ll have a long time forgetting it. The sentiments it raises are so strong that you’ll hardly think about how grim the background is.

It’s set in Leningrad, Russia about a year after World War II has ended and centers on two women. Iya, nicknamed Beanpole because she’s tall and thin, works as a nurse in a hospital. She’s just as traumatized as her patients and prone to freezing up, quivering and shaking. She’s also caring for the 3-year-old son of her army buddy Masha who returns, sloughs off some very bad news and suggests they go dancing. Masha is a life-force, brilliantly played by a newcomer named Vasilisa Perelygina. In fact both women (Viktoria Miroshnichenko is Iya) have never acted in a movie before and yet they are completely convincing. They get themselves picked up at the dance hall, have sex, meet the parents of one of the guys and insult the mother after she denigrates their contributions during the war. Masha has medical issues that add another layer of deep drama. It’s rare to find a film this rich with emotion and human experience. The director, Kantemir Balagov, is only 28 years old and definitely one to watch. (VanCity Theatre) 4 ½ out of 5

THE WHISTLERS: Corneliu Porumboiu from Romania makes highly enjoyable films stocked with deadpan humor, plot twists and acerbic views of officialdom. He’s outdone himself in his latest, certainly with the funny and the twisty, though with less of the mocking of politicians. He’s mostly concerned with criminals here and a crooked cop. He, played by the well-known Vlad Ivanov, wants to free a crook from prison, at the behest of the guy’s girlfriend (Catrinel Marlon), a real femme fatale. It’s not love motivating her; it’s money. The crook knows where 30 million Euros in illegal cash is stashed. The cop, his female boss (Rodica Lazar) and the Mafia boss he’s been co-operating with, all want it.

He first has to go to the Canary Island named Gomera to learn an ancient language entirely made up of whistles. It’s been used for centuries to outwit authorities, usually over ravines and mountainscapes but works just as well in the modern canyons of big cities and against surveillance cameras. The film takes the idea to pleasingly absurd levels. There are twists and revelations (too many actually) and we don’t know who is loyal to who and who is being honest and not. Operatic music plays now and then to add flavor, although an Iggy Pop record starts the movie and a visit to Singapore ends it. It’s all part of the fun. (VanCity Theatre) 3 ½ out of 5

RED SNOW: I'm not quite as able to draw a connection between Indigenous people in Canada’s north and the Pashtun of Afghanistan, not to the extent that Marie Clements has done in her first movie drama. But she’s made a strong case for how she sees it and, more pertinently, for the need these days to find similarities between people. Her background in documentary film and her heritage (Metis, based here in BC) shape that message. It comes with a pretty good adventure film wrapped around it.

A soldier (Asivak Koostachin) from the Gwich’in people (part of the Yukon and the North West Territories) is captured by the Taliban and interrogated about that code he’s writing in his notebook. It’s not code; it’s his native language. He’s not American, he’s Canadian. “The same,” the Taliban guy says. “You are on my land? Protecting your country?”",[]

Or staying away like James Bond? It’s not a time to stop because there’s so much new in town. I’ve got nine just arrived that I’m writing about this week.

ONWARD: It’s not as emotionally heady as the best of Pixar’s films, and too familiar at times, but there’s quite a bit here to recommend it. Sharp animation, naturally, plus a heartfelt affirmation of family, a wild adventure, magic and myth, all set in a totally modern world. Two brothers out on a quest driving a souped-up van echo countless teen movies, except that these boys are elves, modern versions with only their big ears to distinguish them. They lament that inventions like the lightbulb and now the smart phone have killed magic and but are given a chance to get some back. Their father, a wizard who had to make do as an accountant and died before they got to know him, left them a present. It’s a wizard stick with which they can bring him back for one whole day.

It works but only half of him is there, from the belt down. It’s a race against time to revive the rest of him. The burly older boy (voiced by Chris Pratt) pushes his insecure brother (Tom Holland) to come on the quest, hone his magic skills and find a mystical gem. They take “the path of peril” instead of the highway and encounter scavenging unicorns, a centaur cop, a crevasse they have to use magic to cross, fairies who ride motorcycles and a once-fierce manticore (Octavia Spencer) now reduced to running a roadside restaurant. Too easy, these sendups. Little kids won’t get most of them but might enjoy the flash of the busy roadtrip. Everyone else should wait through it for a very poignant ending. The story, inspired by director Dan Scanlon’s own thoughts of a dad he lost, eventually rewards with real feelings. (Dunbar, International Village, Scotiabank, Marine Gateway and many suburban theatres) 3 out of 5

GREED: Some people, and critics, are down on this one because they thought it should be more of a comedy than it is. Others think it fires at too many targets. I don’t. This is the most radical movie I’ve seen in some time and it hits its targets bluntly and deservedly. Steve Coogan is the star, in his seventh collaboration with director Michael Winterbottom, and they’ve created an evisceration of the super-rich. The comedy is there but it’s so stinging that it may not feel like it. If you like seeing pompous, hucksters getting hit with absolutely valid broadsides, you’ll enjoy this, and chuckle often.

Coogan plays the owner of a chain of London fashion shops who worked his way up with the prodding of a harpy mother and his own feelings of entitlement. He’s inspired by a real merchandiser who is well-known in England but I see him as a stand in for not one man, but a type. He’s a bully as a deal maker; he has clothes manufactured for cheap in Sri Lanka sweatshops and sells them at top prices; he’s immensely rich and avoids taxes. He’s shown organizing a lavish birthday party for himself on a Greek Island, testifying about bankruptcies before a parliamentary committee, humiliating his staff and driving unconscionable deals in Sri Lanka. There are many true details: a toady of a journalist is writing a biography, Bulgarian workers are building a mock Coliseum, Syrian refugees are spoiling the view by camping on the beach. He justifies avoiding taxes and cites Bono, Facebook and others to prove it. Too much? Not until the postscripts at the end that say it all again. Before that it’s a sprawling assault on income inequality. Bernie Sanders would like this film. (5th Avenue) 3 ½ out of 5",[]

The Vancouver International Women in Film Festival (https://viwff.ca/ ) starts Tuesday for a 5-day run. The opener is Parkland Rising which documents the gun control campaign mounted by students from the Florida high school where a shooter killed 17 people two years ago. The director, Cheryl Horner McDonough will be at the screening.

The Cinematheque (https://thecinematheque.ca) has a new collection of films that UCLA has restored, rediscovered and generally rescued from neglect. They range from early silents, including some rare Laurel and Hardy films, film noirs and even a Don Johnson film from 1975. The series runs for three weeks and starts Thursday with The Mortal Storm the 1940 film that got all MGM films banned from Nazi Germany. It shows a family split and a father ruined when the Nazis came to power.

ORDINARY LOVE: It’s best to relish films made for mature adults when they come along because these days there aren’t enough of them. This one is extraordinary because it is so real in a depicting a long-time marriage. The couple played by Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville are settled, comfortable, happily following a routine. They go for walks, laugh, banter and debate. Their conversations are perfectly scripted by playwright Owen McCafferty and directed by the husband and wife team Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn to show the easy understanding and respect between them.

That’s the central concern of this film although I’m sure you’ve heard that it gets disrupted when she’s diagnosed with breast cancer. How will their good rapport fare under that intrusion? Again the film is absolutely authentic. “There isn’t a moment I won’t be there with you,” he says early on. Later, there are flash arguments brought on by the tension and fear. “We’re both going through this.” “No we’re not. I have the cancer.” It gets louder. At the same time we’re taken along to the hospital visits and the tests (“They charge you for parking”) and follow every step of the procedures she goes through. Not too graphically but, with 12 medical advisors on the film, very accurately. Her emotions too are perfectly defined. She gets advice from and gives advice to other patients but laments that for the big decisions “we’re all just really on our own.” There’s an unnecessary subplot about grieving a lost daughter but elsewhere the superb acting gets across all the variable feelings and help make this a very satisfying film. It came without fanfare but is worth your time. (International Village) 4 ½ out of 5

The Canadians …

THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: Perverse, wicked, phantasmagoric. They’re all accurate in describing this wild film about Canadian history and its send up of our national identity. It’s reassuring that we can make films as cheeky and outrageous as this about our image of ourselves. And that we can also see it as sort-of-correctly represented in this film by Matthew Rankin about William Lyon Mackenzie King.",[]
6,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/culture/theatre/check-your-privilege-gateway-arts-club,"Check Your Privilege @ Gateway, Arts Club","['More Lincoln Kaye', 'Feb']",,"Face it: live theatre-goers are privileged. You can tell it just by scanning a typical Vancouver stage-play audience – mostly white, “of a certain age,” well-upholstered and seemly in dress. At least, being Canadian, we have the decency to be sorry about our privilege. That’s why performances lead off with elaborate acknowledgements of funding subsidies and land theft.

But this week a couple of our pre-eminent stage companies go well beyond such pro-forma apologetics to offer far more incisive dissections of entitlement. Gateway brings us a laugh-till-you-cry family farce, Straight White Men, while Arts Club mounts a taut, tense sleuth-opera, Cipher.

Thanks to smart casting and slick production values, both shows go down easy enough, as long you’re comfortably seated in their respective auditoria. But both, if you seriously mull their enigmatic conclusions, could seriously roil your digestion over after-theatre supper.

Korean-American playwright Young Jean Lee, 45, has spent nearly half her life-to-date troubling tummies with her explorations of identity dynamics. Vancouver audiences most recently encountered her in The Shipment, a thoroughly provocative disquisition on Blackness, which ran here for two successive seasons.

But her latest play, SWM (to borrow a shorthand from the kinkier Alt Weekly lonely hearts ad pages), broaches a class-cum-ethnic identity so long dominant that, until lately, it seemed almost invisible to its cossetted beneficiaries, like the air we breathe. All the more shock, then, when the air turns stiflingly toxic, as it has for the four titular protagonists, each of whom is facing a mid- to late-life crisis.

Number One Son Matt (Daniel Martin), a Harvard-educated Golden Boy who’s now working off his student loans as an N.G.O. office temp, has moved in with his recently widowed Dad (Peter Anderson). His two younger siblings, freshly divorced merchant banker Jake (Carlo Marks) and author manqué Drew (Sebastian Arnold), come home to the family MacMansion for that Whitest of holidays, the Caucasoid Christmas.

In their unaccustomed, womanless isolation, they find themselves each at loose ends. So they wind up ritualistically enacting the male bonding rites of Yuletides Past: jokey wrestling, rank-out banter, pajama breakfast, Chinese take-out dinner, a few rounds of Monopoly.

Except their Monopoly playing board has been customized by their late Mom into a new game, called “Privilege,” in which -- just for being a SWM -- you have to ante up a penalty every time you pass “Go.” That’s how punctiliously “woke” they are in this family.

They lovingly re-enact Matt’s Klan-themed spoof of their high school musical, “OaKKKlahoma!” Jake’s Ex- is a Yuppie of Colour and his children are well-groomed little Hapas. Therapy-addled Drew (it changed “my whole fucking life”) prioritizes empathy above all. Starting, of course, with self-empathy.

In short relatable people, at least to much of the Gateway crowd. Well-meaning and principled, by their own lights; no Trumpian deplorables.

But the two visiting kid brothers can’t get over the spectacle of Matt, the erstwhile high-flyer, now drawing temp pay and tidying up after Dad at home. A waste of Talent! An affront to Merit! Their pain and puzzlement become acute when, over Christmas dinner, Matt briefly and unaccountably weeps into his Chinese take-out.

What gives? He’s clinically depressed, Drew diagnoses. Nothing therapy can’t deal with. He should just learn to love himself.

“He should learn to sell himself,” Jake rejoins. As a case in point, the brothers role-play a mock job interview for a staff (versus a temp) position at the NGO. No surprise that braggadocious Jake woefully upstages shambling Matt.",[]

THE CALL OF THE WILD: This story has been filmed many times since Jack London published his novel in 1903. The leads before Harrison Ford included Clark Gable, Charlton Heston, Rick Schroeder in a TV movie filmed near Quesnel and Nick Mancuso in a TV series filmed around Maple Ridge. But this is the first time that I’m aware of that a man has played the dog. Terry Notary is the guy; motion-capture recorded his movements and computers turned them into the amazingly expressive and responsive Buck, who can hold his own playing alongside Ford who alternates between amiable and dour, grief-laden.

Buck was dognapped in California, taken to the Yukon gold rush and sold to work on a dogsled team transporting mail. He was clumsy at first but brave and managed to best the alpha dog to be the leader. But the mail run was shut down, he was bought by a cruel and greedy prospector (Dan Stevens) and had to be rescued by John Thornton, played by Ford. After that the film develops two ways: dog and man bond, (Buck even stops him drinking) and dog follows the call of his “ancestors,” the wolves. There’s a lady timberwolf involved too. The film celebrates nature and is a good choice for children. It’s quite mild and doesn’t scare. A bit of it was filmed here in BC, likely the canoe ride over a waterfall and through some rapids. The animals, the bears, caribou, rabbits and more are also computer generated and though Buck doesn’t always look and move exactly realistically he’ll charm most any dog lover.

KDOCS FILM FESTIVAL: It started small at Kwantlen University some years ago and is now an annual show of superb social-issue documentaries at the VanCity Theatre ( see http://www.kdocsff.com/). English literature instructor Janice Morris started and directs it and she’s put together a very strong lineup of 13 films this year. They run through the weekend and include several I’ve written about, and praised, before.

BECAUSE WE ARE GIRLS is an incendiary film in which three sisters from northern B.C. confront their Punjabi parents who knew about but didn’t stop the sexual abuse by a relative. The most forceful of the sisters will be there to talk about it.

TOXIC BEAUTY is an alarming film that points out how dangerous some commonly-used cosmetics and personal care products really are. Most startling to me? Talcum powder. The director, Phyllis Ellis, and a whistleblower, Deane Berg, will be there.

WE WILL STAND UP describes the shocking case of and continuing controversy over Colten Boushie, the Indigenous man in Saskatchewan who was shot dead by a farmer, who was then acquitted by a court.

The film follows the trial and a campaign to get justice (which reached all the way to the United Nations) and adds a corrective history about how white/native relations really went in Canada.



PUSH is particularly relevant here in Vancouver, even as housing prices have eased a bit. The film visits cities from Toronto to London, even Valparaiso, to see how, and why housing costs are so high there. No surprise: Housing is now a commodity, it says, sold, bought and flipped for profit by big corporations, pension funds and rich investors. There’s also a concise explanation of how money laundering works to make things worse. The main presenter in the film, Leilani Farha, of Ottawa, who works for the United Nations, will be here as a keynote speaker.

HUMAN NATURE is relevant for everybody because it’s about our evolution. It outlines the latest advances in genetic engineering and the future they predict. Designer babies? No inherited disease? Soldiers who can’t feel pain? The science is clearly explained and we’re forewarned of the dangers, in this film executive produced by Dan Rather. Provocative stuff.

And two films I’ve just now seen for the first time:",[]

But for Vancouverites venturing south of the border anyway, one defense against in-your-face America Firstism might be to stick to the archipelago of “sanctuary cities” that have officially pledged to resist Trumpian xenophobia.

Luckily for us, there’s a convenient chain of such enclaves strung along the length of U.S. Interstate Route 5 (I-5) running from the Washington line all the way down to the Mexican border. One of the shiniest jewels in this diadem is Ashland, Oregon, (pop. 20,000) about 900 km down the road.

Think: lush public parks and campgrounds, variegated fine dining options, daunting property prices, boutiquey retailers, buskers, backpackers, patchouli-scented spas, street-legal cannabis, organic grocers, hot and cold running cappuccino, trans-friendly washrooms and unchallenged pedestrian right-of-way at every crosswalk.

In other words, an errant shard of gentrified Vancouver, so alien to its host country that it’s incurred a boycott by its more mainstream neighbours in the surrounding American “heartland.”

But – for sheer audience size, eclectic repertoire and snazzy production values – nothing in Vancouver can match Ashland’s main claim to fame: the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. From a mostly amateur summertime pop-up production on a borrowed stage, the OSF has evolved, over the course of its 82-year history, into North America’s première repertory theatre company.

Nowadays, in its eight-month annual season, the Festival mounts a dozen plays – ancient and modern, edgy experiments and grandiose extravaganzas – in its three state-of-the-art theatres.

OSF still manages to wring new nuance out of its namesake; it’s now two years into its ambitious target of recapping The Bard’s entire stage opus. Yet, in any given season, less than half the Ashland repertoire is Shakespeare anymore.

The company is equally committed to multiculturalism, serving up a potpourri of theatrical vernaculars from all over the world. And it continues to commission new plays, such as decade-long (2008-2018) ‘American Revolutions’ cycle of 37 historically acute scripts that have won prestigious prizes.

Performers come back year after year, both for the job security (rare in the acting biz) and for the chance to appear in such a wide range of classy roles. To be cast in an OSF season is a bit like a tenure-track faculty appointment; to star repeatedly is like an endowed professorship.

But these players earn their perks. Almost all of them appear in multiple shows, which means conning lengthy lines and juggling disparate rehearsal and performance schedules. And in the decade since current artistic director Bill Rauch took over the OSF helm, Ashland productions incorporate more and more musical and “physical theatre” elements, which puts the Festival’s multi-talented performers through their singing, dancing and martial arts paces.

Mercifully, for actors and audiences alike, the annual repertoire comes in three bursts. The season starts with a flurry of indoor productions from February onwards in the 600-seat thrust-stage Angus Bowmer Theatre and the more intimate and flexible “black box” venue of the Thomas Theatre.

With the onset of summer in June, three more expansive shows open in the outdoor Elizabethan Theatre. New plays rotate into some of the indoor theatre slots around mid-summer to carry the Festival through the end of October.

In a three-day marathon, we managed to take in most of OSF’s starting spring line-up for 2017. This binge provided not only a banner weekend of absolutely world-class theatre, but also a sense of the play-going public’s white-knuckled angst at the edge of our current historical precipice.

The Festival’s spring roster includes a couple of intensely political Shakespearian plays – Henry IV (Part One) and Julius Caesar – that explore such themes as leadership legitimation, the fickleness of crowds, class status gaps and the perils of fake news.",[]

It is the first Korean Film to win an Oscar and the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. But its creator, Bong Joon Ho, also did something that hasn’t been done in 67 years. He personally won four Oscars. Walt Disney did it in 1953 with four films. Bong won as director, screenwriter, and producer in two categories for this one film.

Parasite is on almost twice as many screens starting today. In Canada that’s 144. But not at the Rio here in town and that’s got the theatre into another petition campaign. They want Ottawa, through its Competition Bureau, to stop the Cineplex Theatres corporation to stop using its near-monopoly power to prevent films like it to get into independent theatres.

PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE: This is one of those rare films that is close to perfect. I can’t find anything wrong with this rapturous slow-maturing love story between two women in 18th Century France. It’s got a thorny start, a pressing time limit on the way and a wistful ending all elegantly written, acted and crafted into a film you should see. I can’t imagine why this didn’t get a nomination at the Academy Awards. France’s equivalent, the César awards have given it 10 nominations. At Cannes, it won for best screenplay.

It’s a film about longing and the glances that convey it. Director Céline Sciamma orchestrates them beautifully to the pace of a classic novel. She also wrote it. A young artist (Noémie Merlant) is called to a seaside estate in Brittany to paint a portrait of a young woman (Adèle Haenel ) soon to be married. (She’s the blonde in the picture and, incidentally, a former partner of Sciamma’s). Problem: the subject won’t pose because a portrait would advance the marriage which she doesn’t want. The artist has to study her and paint in secret. As she does she gets to know her, and of a tragic incident in her past. They have long talks about love. What is it like? “It’s hard to say”. They end up in bed. “Do all lovers feel they’re inventing something?” The feminist theme continues with a servant girl and an unwelcome pregnancy but that’s secondary to their love story, which flames for a time and offers a bittersweet addendum. No matter what your taste, this film can stir you emotionally.(5th Avenue) 4½ out of 5

THE ASSISTANT: Compared to the lurid testimony we’ve read from the Harvey Weinstein trial, this film, which revolves around a man somewhat like him, feels tame. You want some noise; some melodrama. Instead you get a restrained look at sexual politics in an office of an entertainment mogul. It’s not even a look; it’s a slow realization by a lowly employee of what is going on. Most of it is suspicion based on fragments of evidence: stains on a couch, a fallen earring, a waitress brought in from an Idaho ski resort and put up in an expensive hotel. There’s value in that approach; it points out signs people should pay attention to at their workplace. But in a movie you want more.

Julia Garner, who last year won an Emmy for the TV series Ozark, is low-key but effective as the assistant. We see her do the photocopying, appointment booking, phone answering, mail opening (too much actually) as the film underlines that her status in the office isn’t very high. So what power does she have to report her boss’s behavior? She gets condescension from two male co-workers and there’s a great scene when she finally goes to a human resources guy (Matthew Macfadyen). He does his best to not understand what she’s telling him; says it adds up to nothing and assures her that she’s safe: “You’re not his type.” In other words, people know and don’t speak up. The office culture portrayed here by writer/director Kitty Green is accurate and based on some she’s worked in herself. It’s too subtle though. We never even see the offending mogul; just hear him on the phone briefly, getting abusive. There’s also a dim and grey look to this film which further holds back the heat. (International Village) 3 out of 5

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: Movies based on video games do not have a great track record. This is one of the better ones (the best, according to one expert I talked to) and it’s precisely because it is aimed at kids. That’s a bit odd because how many of them are familiar with the character? He’s a Japanese creation, started in 1991 and that means he’s quite retro these days. Dads would know him better.

11,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/culture/theatre/pillars-salt-sing-and-dance-0,Pillars of salt that sing and dance,"['More Lincoln Kaye', 'Feb']",,"Refugee sagas and annals of exile are as old (at least!) as the Old Testament. Way back in Genesis, we find a pair of messenger angels hustling the Biblical patriarch Lot and his womenfolk out of their house in iniquitous Sodom. ""Escape for thy life,"" the angels warn. ""Look not behind thee … lest thou be swept away.""

Easier said than done, at least for Mrs. Lot (nameless in the Bible), who can’t help casting a backward glance at the rain of brimstone engulfing her homeland. For this all-too-human lapse, God turns her into a pillar of salt.

To our abiding human sorrow and shame, the story remains as pertinent as ever in our own time, as attested by three brilliant exile dramas highlighting this year’s PuSh Fest bill. All three of these vivid productions feature bravura music and dance. Yet all three leave a distinctly salty aftertaste.

In playwright Carmen Aguirre’s Anywhere But Here, the “salt” is delivered in the form of “foul language, brief nudity, mature subject matter, fake guns … [and] limited stage violence,” as listed in the “Audience Advice” of the program notes. All this salt to help us bolt down a high-octane tequila shot; the searing, tragic saga of LatinX South-to-North dislocation.

In the lobby of the Vancouver Playhouse, where the show World Premieres February 4-15, an audience-participation shrine commemorates the deadly toll of these mass migrations. A timeline unfurls alongside, running from the Spanish conquista all the way down to Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Wall” and its attendant concentration camps, detailing LatinX hegiras, wave after wave.

In the first such wave to be accorded refugee status in Canada, Aguirre and her family landed up here in the early 1970’s, after Pierre Trudeau’s government – under pressure of sustained protests – dialed back (a little) its embrace of the CIA-sponsored military coup that overthrew Chile’s elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende.

Like Lot’s wife, the Aguirre’s could not help looking back towards their lost homeland even as they adapted to their new milieu. It's this dilemma, finctionalised, that propels the action of Anywhere But Here.

The play (or at least its outermost ""shell story"") is set in1979, with the coup and the resulting exile still a fresh, raw wound. The estranged Dad of a family hijacks his two daughters and sets out on a road trip back from Canada back to Chile, with the Mom in hot pursuit.

But it’s a LatinX story, after all, with plenty of latitude for chronology-bending realismo mágico. Racing southwards to the US/Mexico border, the 1970’s exiles run smack up against the Donald Trump's Great Wall of MAGA.

And skulking, scrambling and dodging their way northwards towards the same wall comes a file of very 21st century asylum-seekers. This ""caravan"" is spearheaded by a Honduran rapper (Alen Dominguez) who chronicles their travails in rat-a-tat-rhyme.

The hip-hop lyrics are the only part of the eloquent script that Aguirre did not pen entirely on her own. For those hectoring cadences., she turned to a Juno-. Emmy- and Peabody-certified collaborator: rap laureate and broadcast curator, Shad Kabango.

LatinX he’s not, but Shad knows his way around the refugee experience, as a Kenya-born Rwandan shunted “all over East Africa” before settling at last in Ontario. And, anyway, the rest of the show’s production team more than makes up for LatinX bona fides, starting with Mexico-born Los Angeles-based director Juliette Carillo.

Switching and swapping roles throughout the show, the nine member cast -- Augusto Bitter, Alen Dominguez, Alexandra Lainfiesta, Shawn Lall, Nadeem Phillip, Christine Quintana, Michelle Rios, AJ Simmons, and Manuela Sosa – boast immigrant roots ranging from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela to Puerto Rico. Other Mexico-born luminaries on the crew include costume designer Carmen Alatorre, projections designer Candelario Andrade and set designer Christopher Acebo.

Between them, these ChicanX production superstars melded their talents for a compelling mise en scene – a circular performance space, covered in cork fragments (to suggest desert grit) and backed by a cyclorama of shifting colours. It’s marked at the base with the beckoning lights of a distant urban haven, but the sky above is streaked with projected footage of the hardships of the road and the legacies of the past.",[]

I’m particularly impressed by his role in ending the blacklist.

The big drama, of course, is the tight race to win best picture. 1917 is the favorite now, having already done well at the BAFTA’s in England and with producer and director guilds over here. I’d vote for it; give its chief competitor, Parasite, the Best International Film prize, and relegate Joker, with it’s 11 nominations, to where it belongs. Well, OK give it the best actor prize.

We’ll see what happens. And here are the new ones you can see.

Birds of Prey … Harley Quinn: 2 ½ stars

The Traitor: 3

Come to Daddy: 3

The Sound of Masks (Black History): 4

BIRDS OF PREY: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, to give you the full title, is being passed off as a female empowerment twist in the comic book movie genre. And a lot of writers are welcoming it as such. Don’t believe it, unless you accept the kind of substitute that pumps out violent revenge, a lot of kicks to the groin and cheeky nihilism as a step towards equality. You might be persuaded by the credits to see it that way. Oscar nominee Margot Robbie not only stars but is one of the producers. The writer and the director are both women (although a man was brought in to handle the many action scenes). And the plot is all about sisterhood, of a sort.

Harley, a DC comics character since 1992 (although originally inspired by a TV soap opera) was the one bright element four years ago in Suicide Squad. She was a psychiatrist who was corrupted by her lover, The Joker. An animated prologue recalls that whole story. She’s now free of him, has to fight off guys with grievances against her (explained with comic-book notes on screen) and collects a group of women around her to take on one particular villain. He’s a nightclub owner (aka Black Mask) played with cheery malice by Ewan McGregor. He lost a diamond to a pickpocket and wants it back. Harley allies with a singer called Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), a crossbow-armed Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and a police detective (Rosie Perez) to protect the thief who has swallowed the diamond and inspired a lot of jokes about how to get it back out of her. The film offers cheap humour and plays everything for a lark. This isn’t empowerment; it’s DC taking a cue from Deadpool and putting out its own wise-cracking, reckless, R-rated, but admittedly, lively, counterpart. (5th Avenue, Dunbar, Scotiabank, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres everywhere) 2 ½ out of 5

THE TRAITOR: It’s too long, wandering and not fully explanatory, but the story it tells is so interesting you’d be right to make an effort. It’s from Italy, made by the veteran director Marco Bellocchio and tells a true but dramatized story about a mobster who turned states evidence and brought down the Cosa Nostra. Or maybe the Mafia. The film tries to assert a distinction between the two. How convincingly is not definite. Certainly Tommaso Buscetta, the snitch, tries to argue that the original mob had principles; its members were honorable. He had moral standards, even as a wave of killings and money hunger evolved along with the quick profits of the heroin trade. He testified in a number of trials in the 1980s that jailed and/or fined hundreds of mobsters.",[]

According to U.S. tax documents, the Fraser Institute received $150,000 from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation in 2008, $175,500 in 2009, and another $150,000 in 2010. The grants were purportedly for ""research support"" and ""educational programs"".

Koch U.S. Tax document slideshow:

Prior to 2008, the Institute received another $25,000 in funding from the Claude R. Lambe Foundation, which is under the umbrella of Koch Family Foundations.

It has long been known that the ultra-conservative Koch Brothers have been donors for the conservative policy think-tank—though this information is not listed the Institute’s Annual Reports—however, the extent of their funding in the past few years demonstrates the foundation’s more recent influence in Canadian politics.

Grants to the Fraser Institute are also among the highest amounts listed in the Koch Foundation’s tax records; apart from a few substantial grants to American universities, most of the other donations were under $10,000.

The Fraser Institute, described by rabble.ca as “Canada’s most intensely political organization”, is a registered non-profit focused on economic and public policy research.

Two foundations under the Koch family's auspices – the Charles G. Koch and the Claude R. Lambe Foundations – gave the Fraser Institute large grants to conduct “international work,” its former executive director Michael Walker told the Vancouver Observer.

“I know the grant from the Koch Foundation is for our international work, but I can't tell you which of the projects that it's funding,” Walker, who co-founded the institute in 1974 and remains a Senior Fellow, told the Vancouver Observer. “Before the Koch Foundation, we used to get funding from Koch Industries, when they had extensive holdings in Canada.

“Years and years” prior to receiving grants from the Koch family foundation, Walker said, a Canadian subsidiary of Koch Industries made regular donations to the organization as a corporate member.

“If your intent is to find out that the Fraser Institute, just like the (David) Suzuki Foundation, is funded by offshore money, the truth is that any money I'm aware of from that source – if we're even getting any anymore – is used for our international research. We do have an extensive international program, so we do have to raise money offshore from different sources.”

The institute's international work includes an ""Economic Freedom Network,” and will expand this year to co-publishing a “Human Freedom Index” with the Koch-created Cato Institute, which was originally founded as the Charles Koch Foundation in 1974, the same year as the Fraser Institute's inception.

Koch Industries is responsible for 25 per cent of Canadian oil sands imports, or roughly 250,000 barrels a year, to the United States.

With heated rhetoric in recent months about US funding for Canadian environmental groups – such as the David Suzuki Foundation (DSF) and the Sierra Club of Canada – nearly 16 per cent of the Fraser Institute's own funding comes from “sources outside Canada,” according to the group's 2010 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) return.

Those foreign donations – totalling more than $1.7 million in 2010 – are significantly higher than both David Suzuki Foundation's and the Sierra Club of Canada's.",[]

Buzzell said Tuesday the company sees these trends taking hold and is responding with billions of dollars in new investments. While he wouldn't speculate on long-term hiring plans in Canada, he said Ford would still need a strong manufacturing workforce.

""At the end of the day, you still have to manufacture autonomous vehicles,"" he said in an interview at Vancouver's auto show. ""If anything, it's going to add jobs because we need software development engineers to help us with the technology.""

Ford has already invested in San Francisco-based Chariot, which allows people to use a mobile app to hail rides on transit vans, as well as bike-sharing service GoBike. Last month, it announced $1 billion for a company called Argo AI, which is led by former Google and Uber executives and aims to develop a new software platform for Ford's first autonomous vehicle.

""There's a lot of new disruptors or new players trying to get into this space,"" Buzzell said. ""As our chairman Bill Ford has said, it's an interesting time when we need to figure out who's our friend and who's our foe. In some cases, they may be one and the same.""

The company is promising to have a self-driving vehicle, without a steering wheel or gas pedal, on the market by 2021. Currently, Ford is testing a fleet of 30 autonomous vehicles in the U.S. and aims to expand to 90 around the globe, Buzzell said.

Ford has also invested $4.5 billion in electric vehicles to bring 13 new models to market over the next four or five years.

""I think we can do a better job of creating awareness of the features and benefits these vehicles bring,"" he said. ""Then I think we have to overcome some anxieties.""

Customers have ""range anxiety,"" worrying that they will run out of energy, he said. But he said Ford is working to ensure more charging stations are available while piloting wireless charging technology in other parts of the world.

Buzzell said Canada is trying to position itself as a technology and innovation leader and the company is working closely with the federal government on projects including improving engine development at its two engine plants in Windsor, Ont.

Ford promised last fall it would inject $700 million into the Windsor plants and its assembly plant in Oakville, Ont., as part of a labour deal reached with Unifor, which represents about 6,700 workers at the company's facilities.

Buzzell has said this commitment has not wavered since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump. He reaffirmed his position on Tuesday, adding it would be unfair to speculate about Trump's protectionist proposals.

He said it's too early to comment on the U.S. administration's proposal for a border-adjusted tax on imports, but he said Ford chairman Bill Ford and CEO Mark Fields are communicating to Trump that the company supports free trade. He wouldn't comment on what they were hearing in response.

He said the company is also working with Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and governors of Great Lakes states, as Ford facilities on either side of the border are highly interdependent.

""NAFTA has been around for 22 years and for the most part, it's served us very well,"" he said. ""We're in favour of very open trade agreements that make it easy for us to do business around the globe.""",[]

The Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) calls for an immediate halt to the forced evictions of the Boon and Meek/Jardine families on Treaty 8 territory and to suspend any new contracts, and cease the construction of the Site C Dam project threatening the Treaty 8 First Nations, the families, and the communities of the Peace Valley.

Confronted with an allied BC Green Party and BC New Democratic Party, Premier Clark’s Liberal government faces an evermore uncertain future. An NDP government supported by the Greens represents an end to the era of unfettered development and destruction throughout First Nations lands and territories.

Extending the residential leases for the Boon and Meek/Jardine families by one month beyond May 31, 2017, is not sufficient. With the future of the Site C Dam in question, the eviction of families serves no useful purpose and is both premature and irresponsible.

BC Hydro must suspend Site C’s planned schedule to prevent irreversible harm to the families and the environment.

It is no longer business as usual in B.C., and the government-in-waiting holds no mandate to pursue Site C. John Horgan has committed a BC NDP government to submit the Site C Dam project to a necessary, and previously overlooked, review by the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC).

In considering the economic impacts of this project, the UBCIC agrees the BCUC should review and consult on the development of Site C, while acknowledging the impact of this project on the land-based traditional economies of Indigenous peoples.

A BC NDP government will welcome and adopt the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which reaffirms Indigenous peoples’ inherent rights to their lands, territories, and resources as well as their spiritual relationship with their traditionally owned lands, territories, and waters.

Proceeding with construction of the Site C Dam runs roughshod over many of these rights. This project will have a devastating impact in the Treaty and Aboriginal Rights of Treaty 8 First Nations. The project will eliminate the Treaty 8 First Nation communities’ ability to continue their way of life and exercise their Treaty-protected constitutional rights to hunt, fish, trap, harvest and carry out their practices on their land.

Devastating and irreparable harm to multi-generational farming families and First Nations title and rights, including the destruction of numerous sacred and traditional use sites, must be avoided by ensuring that Site C’s planned schedule is suspended.

Irresponsibly rushing the development of the Site C Dam ahead of the BC Utilities Commission review is a reckless and negligent use of tax dollars. As per Resolution 2015-14, the UBCIC unequivocally supports Treaty 8 tribal leadership in their opposition to the proposed Site C Dam project and their assessment that the proposed project is a threat to their ability to exercise their constitutionally-protected Treaty rights, and to the survival of their culture and People. The UBCIC calls for the immediate suspension of construction of the Site C Dam pending completion of a review by the BCUC.

And although two-thirds of Britons would have said otherwise back in 2011, now 61 per cent think electoral reform is necessary.

Instead of the UK vote representing the will of the people, it has revealed deep and inherent flaws in the so-called “first-past-the-post” system, which Brits – like Canadians – still cling to like some kind of perverse life jacket.

In this system, getting a single vote more than your opponent means you get in, while your opponent goes home.

Contrast this to a proportional voting system – and there are various types – in which the number of elected members is “proportional” to the number of votes a party gets.

To continental Europeans, most of whom live under a proportional voting system, the voting method used in Britain seems nothing short of “weird” – literally, as this French journalist states.

That’s because once you’ve lived under a proportional system, with its inherent fairness and broad embrace of all points of view, you never want to go back to the old ways.

New Zealand – the very first country, by the way, that first gave women the vote, in 1893 – switched to a proportional system in 1996. Two referenda brought forward since then by disgruntled citizens who wanted to change back to the old first-past-the-post horserace were soundly defeated.

Let’s look at some numbers.

How ""too close to call"" turned to crushing defeat

Before the UK election, everybody thought the results were too close to call.

Exit polls showed that the Labor and Conservative parties were neck and neck, at 33 per cent and 34 per cent of voter preferences respectively. The Scottish National Party (SNP) had only 4 per cent of committed voters, but estimates based on the current system – remember this is before the election actually took place – suggested that they would win double their proportionate number of seats.

Why so? Because just about everybody who would vote for the Scottish National Party lives, not surprisingly, in Scotland.

The SNP has regional strength, period.

Conversely, the right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP) had 13 per cent of committed voters before the election, but under the current system, was expected to win no seats at all. That’s because the UKIP is based all over Britain, and also because it was nobody’s second choice.

If a voter was fed up with the Labour Party, he or she might vote for Liberal Democratic Party (LD). If a voter was fed up with the Conservative Party here she might vote for a number of other parties, but not necessarily the UKIP.

In the first-past-the-post system, people often swallow hard and vote for a party they don’t really want to vote for, because they believe that if they don’t do so they will be wasting their vote. That’s because the candidate with one vote more than the next candidate wins everything.

And vote wasting is one of the biggest problems with FPTP. Typically half or more of all votes in the system achieve nothing whatsoever, breeding cynicism, apathy and sometimes even disgust among voters.

The unfairness of ""first past the post""

So what actually happened in the election in Britain?

The Conservative Party did not win because it beat the Labour Party.

It won because the surging, revitalized Scottish National Party, led by a new and charismatic leader, Nicola Sturgeon, which had previously held only six seats in Scotland, swept all the Scottish seats but three (56/59). Most of those seats had been previously held by the Labour Party.",[]

We all know someone who has been murdered. We all know someone who has been removed from their family, we all know someone who’s displaying all kinds of trauma as a result of Indian residential schools and the child welfare system,” said Myrna McCallum, lawyer and “product of the Sixties Scoop” who has made it her life’s work to serve disenfranchised and disadvantaged Indigenous peoples and communities.

What she says is backed up by stark statistics.

Despite being only four per cent of the female population in Canada, Indigenous women make up nearly a quarter of homicide victims. Indigenous women are three times more likely to be physically assaulted, sexually assaulted or robbed than non-Indigenous women, and are vastly overrepresented in prisons.

But these numbers don’t indicate an issue pertaining solely to Canada’s Indigenous population. Rather, according to the reports on Canada’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG), it is widely concluded that the systemic nature of violence against Indigenous peoples is inherent in a colonial relationship with the Canadian state.

The National Inquiry into MMIWG has said it will build upon the common conclusions of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry (AJI), the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC): “that violence against Indigenous Peoples… is rooted in colonization. For the violence against Indigenous women and girls to end, the ongoing colonial relationship that facilitates it must end.”

According to the AJI report, unresponsiveness by police and justice systems enable violence against Indigenous women. RCAP, found that a “combination of racism and sexism” in Canada are among the most damaging attitudes resulting in the stereotyping and devaluing of Aboriginal women. The TRC’s legacy volume highlights Canada’s “sweeping history” of violence against Indigenous women and girls, as deeply entrenched consequence of colonization. All three reports came to the conclusion that the solution must be Indigenous led, and requires “transformational change to the core relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples.”

Root causes of violence

“When we look at Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, nobody needs to really do a lot of intensive research to find out what are the root causes of that kind of victimization and vulnerability because we know,” McCallum told National Observer.

The MMIWG interim report acknowledges that “no understanding of violence against Indigenous women and girls, including LGBTQ2S people can be understood without grounding it firmly within Canadian colonialism.”",[]
19,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/city/your-water-wise-summer-starts-early-year,Your water wise summer starts early this year,"['More Vancouver Observer', 'Apr', 'Mar']",,"Today City Council approved a new Drinking Water Conservation By-Law to align with the Metro Vancouver Drinking Water Conservation Plan. Under the new by-law, watering restrictions will start on May 1 and allow watering two days a week, instead of three.



""There is increasing pressure on our regional water supply from growing population and climate change. Seasonal watering restrictions help us ensure we prioritize our treated drinking water for where it is needed most - cooking, cleaning, and drinking,"" said Daniel Roberge, Director of Water, Sewer and Green Infrastructure.

""Fewer watering days still allow for healthy landscapes and will help us make sure we have enough water to last through the dry summer months. As we reduce our per-person use of treated drinking water, we can potentially defer the need for expensive infrastructure expansion.""



Permitted Watering Times (Stage 1)



Even with watering restrictions, Vancouver's water use doubles in the summer due to lawn and garden watering. Lawns in Vancouver generally need only one inch of water for one hour a week, including rainfall, to stay healthy and green. Residents can check their permitted watering through the VanConnect App or online at vancouver.ca/water-restrictions<http://vancouver.ca/waterrestrictions>.



Lawn watering days for residential addresses:



* Even-numbered addresses: 4:00am-9:00am on Wednesdays, and Saturdays



* Odd-numbered addresses: 4:00am-9:00am on Thursdays, and Sundays



Lawn watering days for non-residential addresses



* Even-numbered addresses: 1:00am-6:00am on Mondays



* Odd-numbered addresses: 1:00am-6:00am on Tuesdays



* All addresses: 4:00am - 9:00am on Fridays



Watering outside of the permitted times is a by-law offence. City staff are actively on patrol, and violations will result in a fine of $250-$1000.



The City and Park Board are also taking initiative to further reduce use of treated drinking water in public spaces, recreational facilities, and civic facilities. Initiatives include installing high-efficiency fixtures and controls, proactive leak detection and repair, increasing rain capture and reuse and improving irrigation efficiency.



Three easy ways to be water wise this summer



Minimizing outdoor water use is the single biggest thing residents can do in the summer to ensure treated drinking water isn't wasted.



* Check your irrigation system: To help residents adjust their irrigation systems, the City is running the Irrigation Assessment program again this year to walk residents through their watering system and make sure it is set to match water regulations free of charge. To learn more, visit vancouver.ca/irrigation-check<http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/is-your-irrigation-system-working-as-it-should.aspx>



* Buy a rain barrel: Save treated drinking water this summer and pick up a rain barrel at the annual Rain Barrel sale on May 6, 2018. To learn more, visit vancouver.ca/rainbarrel<http://www.vancouver.ca/rainbarrel>



* Let your lawn go gold: Do the simplest thing of all and let your lawn go gold, or dormant, through the summer. Even just one hour of lawn watering can use as much water as 25 toilet flushes, five loads of laundry, and five dishwasher loads combined.

Just naming a few of the films he’s cut should be enough of a draw: Apocalypse Now, The Talented Mr Ripley, Cold Mountain and The English Patient. He’ll have samples to show and a lot to say. He’s a writer too. There’s more information at https://www.viff.org

Meanwhile, there a long list of new movies now in town.

Mia and the White Lion: 3 ½ stars

Missing Link: 4

Little: 3 ½

Mary Magdalene: 2 ½

Stockholm: 3

Hellboy: 2

The Best of Enemies: --

After: --

Master Z: IP Man Legacy: --

MIA AND THE WHITE LION: This is a perfect film to take the kids to and maybe get a bit emotionally involved in yourself. It could be quite a bit because tension builds dramatically as the story progresses and then delivers a terrific cathartic moment, as the best of these animals-in-danger films do. You also learn a great deal about the wildlife tourism industry in Africa, some of which is not nice at all.

Mia is the petulant daughter of a family that’s returned to South Africa, after a few years in London. She’d rather still be there and isn’t interested in her dad’s hard work to set up a wildlife park as a tourist attraction. Until a rare white lion cub is born and bonds with her like a pet.

We watch their connection grow over three years but dad warns he’s a wild animal and “soon he’ll want to kill you.” A shady operator wants to buy him but dad refuses and in a foreboding comment says he doesn’t do that anymore. We eventually learn what “that” is. It shocks Mia enough to set her out on a desperate trek. The film is rich with drama about a young girl’s idealism and an expose of a dishonorable business. With lots of animals roaming through, it’s also something of a nature film. (International Village and suburban theatres) 3 ½ out of 5

MISSING LINK: Adults will get a lot more out of this animated film than children. The humor is very droll; there’s lots of it and most of it is based on classic situations reminiscent of novels and old movies. An exclusive explorer’s club in London, a saloon brawl in the old west, travelling to Shangri La and more get a send-up. A self-styled adventurer, voiced by Hugh Jackman, is barred from the club and heads all the way to Washington State on a tip that the Sasquatch is to be found there. What better way to prove himself?

He does find the creature who turns out to be surprisingly articulate (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) but lonely. He wants to find his cousins, the Yeti, and off they go to the Himalayas. A pushy widow (Zoe Saldana) comes along (she has a map) and a creepy hitman (Timothy Olyphant) is on their trail. He’s on assignment from the London club to stop them. An elder (Emma Thompson) offers the final bit of information but, of course, Shangri La isn’t what they had imagined. The film is full of surprises and gags as corralled by writer and director Chris Butler. He made it at Laika Studios in Oregon (his second there). The stop-motion animation is dazzling, especially in a scene with fragmented mirror images and a long sequence inside a storm-tossed ship. The story-telling shines. (International Village, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres) 4 out of 5

LITTLE: Take the plot of Big, turn it upside down, shift the culture and you’ve got this small and funny entertainer. It’s peppered with laughs, not sullied with a single obscenity and still presents a reasonably authentic view of life today. Much tinted by fantasy, though. Regina Hall is a demanding, high-powered boss at a small software design company. Just as her biggest client (SNL’s Mikey Day) is threatening to bail out, she is zapped with a magic spell by a young girl at a food truck. It works. She wakes up as a 14-year-old version of herself, played by Marsai Martin.

She’s a regular on the popular TV comedy Black-ish and came up with the idea for this film. She forgets she’s too young to drive and to drink, both bringing up many funny misunderstandings. She also can’t supervise her company and has to let the assistant she’s been disregarding (Issa Rae) do it. Worse, she has to go to school (a child welfare officer insists on it) and that brings back memories of being bullied when she was young because of her intelligence. She has to hang with the nerdy kids. The film, directed by Tina Gordon, avoids the trap of putting absolutely everything in parallel. But as a zippy, light and bright comedy it’s a winner.

The summer sequels have been underperforming. At least one is a disaster. That stops now. The latest Toy Story may save the day. And Disney has another answer too. It is re-releasing its big moneymaker The Avengers: Endgame next week, with a few added bits. A full scene and a tribute to Marvel honcho, the late Stan Lee among them. Why? The film is just $45 million short of beating the biggest moneymaker ever, Avatar. What a feat that would be to top it. And a week after that, there’s a new Spider-Man film.

This week we’ve got:

Toy Story 4: 4 stars

Child’s Play: 2 ½

The City Before the City + Bihttoš: 3

Anna: 2 ½

The Extraordinary Journey of the Fakir: 3

TOY STORY 4: This is something of a miracle. Rather than slide like many movie series, this one gives us the best one yet. And that’s about a decade after it seemed to have ended, when in Part 3, Andy gave his toys away. He had grown up. Bonnie, the new owner, favours a few of them, lets Woody (Tom Hanks) languish in the closet and faces her own growing up crisis: kindergarten. What that leads to is the most emotionally complex film of the four. It probes deeper into a continuing theme: the relationship between children and their toys and most emphatically the toys’ need for a child to love them. It’s a most heartfelt fantasy. And since it's opening in 4,400 theatres all at once, you can be sure it’ll be big.

Woody, at his protective best, sneakily goes along with Bonnie to school, sees her create a new toy she calls Forky, out of a plastic fork, a pipe cleaner and a popsicle stick, and then has to help her whenever she misplaces it. He also has to calm Forky with his existential crisis; he thinks he’s trash and repeatedly dives into garbage cans. Both things happen several times when the family goes on a road trip which also brings part of Woody’s past back to him.

He finds Bo Peep, his girlfriend from the first two films, (Annie Potts) in an antique store. He gets her out but is pursued by a needy and chatty doll who wants his voicebox and has a trio of creepy ventriloquist dolls helping her. That mix of sentimental and menacing is a hallmark of these Pixar films. This gets eerie at times but not really scary.

Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) has a few amusing scenes and the other toys are there but don’t figure much. New characters do though: Jordan Peele and Keegan Michael Key as wisecracking stuffed-toy prizes from a midway game and Keanu Reeves as a stunt motorcycle rider (the greatest in Canada, he says). They’re all big in the rescue mission this film inevitably builds up to. The animation, the colours and the excitement are tops. Even better, the interplay of the toys and their child owners and the needs they fulfill for each other is the heart of this movie. They’re delicately imagined on the way to the spectacle. (5th Avenue, Dunbar, International Village, Scotiabank, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres everywhere) 4 out of 5

CHILD’S PLAY: It takes an unusual personality to release this the same time as Toy Story 4. This is the anti-Toy Story movie. It’s not about the love that toys bring to children. It’s about making them sacred and even more than that: throwing death by slashing at them. Obviously it isn’t for them. Teenagers and people who hate children, sure, go. It’s stylishly directed (by Lars Klevberg), filmed here in Vancouver and has plenty of that “deranged Chucky humour“ the fans want.

Chucky was a doll infested with the soul of a serial killer (a voodoo thing) through seven movies starting in 1988. In this revival, he wants to be known by that name but is officially “Buddi,” a high tech toy designed to bond with a child, read his wishes and like a super Siri or Alexa get him what he needs. He just wants to please. However, he’s defective because a disgruntled worker in a factory in Vietnam turned off some safety features.

A single mom (Aubrey Plaza) gives him to her son Andy and soon is flooded with consequences. Buddi, voiced by Mark Hamill, misconstrues what a knife is for, why a Texas Chainsaw film on TV is funny and how to deal with a creepy boyfriend and a cat that scratches. At first it’s a caution about submitting to technology. Then it powers down into a standard slasher film with a frantic end. Curiously, it feels longer than the 90 minutes it is. Burnaby’s Bron Creative helped finance it. (Scotiabank and suburban theatres) 2 ½ out of 5",[]

Little Women: 4 stars

Song of Names: 2 ½

Spies in Disguise: 2

The Nightingale: --

Ip Man 4: The Finale: --

LITTLE WOMEN: One reason this book has remained a classic for 151 years is that young women have found they can identify with one of the four March sisters. Greta Gerwig must have favored ambitious Jo because she has put her story up front in this adaptation. Amy is secondary, with her selfish side considerably softened and the other two, sensible Meg and sickly Beth, a bit further back. There’s no harm to the story, it’s still about sisters and family bonds, but it allows more of a modern focus on the rules that impede women. It is important for you to marry well the girls are told by their aunt. Stories about women must end with them married, or dead, a publisher says. The novel offered a radical idea: think for yourself.

Gerwig’s version is warm, intelligent and beautifully designed and staged but with one difficulty. She bounces around in time, probably to show us the girls as adults as soon as possible and then flashing back and forth to and from their younger selves. It makes the story harder to follow. It takes us out of it a few times to ponder where are we right now. It’s my only complaint. The performances are excellent, Saoirse Ronan as the headstrong Jo, and Florence Pugh as the self-possessed Amy and Timothée Chalamet as the rich boy next door.

There’s also terrific work in small roles by Meryl Streep, Laura Dern, Chris Cooper and Tracy Letts (he’s the rule-spouting publisher. Remember he played Ronan’s father in Gerwig’s last film, Ladybird?). The look and feel owes some to the version that was made here and in Victoria in 1994 but all in all this new one is a triumph, a smart updating of an old story and a wonderful film for the holiday season. (5th Avenue, International Village, Marine Gateway and many suburban theatres) 4 out of 5

THE SONG OF NAMES: Over 20 years ago, Quebec’s François Girard gave us a very moving film called The Red Violin. He’s back to the same instrument here with less emotional impact but with much higher stakes in its very involving story. It sets up a mystery and then gradually eases out an explanation involving a wrenching history and a boy’s grief over the loss of his family in the Holocaust.",[]

To find out what this month has in store for you, calculate your KEY number by adding the day and month of your birth. The KEY number is not your LIFE PATH number, it is the key to your cycle. Continue adding until you arrive at a single digit. For example, if your birthday is October 14, your KEY number is determined as follows: 10 + 14 = 24. Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Being there.

This cycle month’s energy continues to be about cooperation while staying in the background. This may be a time when conversation can prove to be very profitable, as long as your communication is totally authentic.

Harmony in all aspects of life is very desirable. Especially in the cycle month’s energy, creating a harmonious environment in your home soothes the anxious spirit.

Being there for others, holding a listening ear for problems, coming up with positive encouragement, and out-of-the-box solutions will be easy when you’re not thinking of yourself.

This cycle energy is about being helpful and totally present for the benefit of others. Remember, what goes around comes around.

It may be a little hackneyed, but being able to truly listen to what others are experiencing, then responding authentically and compassionately, is one of the gifts this cycle energy brings to you.

Key Number 2

Allow your natural exuberance to shine through.

It’s important to be careful not to scatter your energy into many directions. There are so many things to catch your imagination in this cycle month’s energy. Having too many things happening at once can be exhausting, and also causes difficulties with focus.

Your biggest challenge this month may be to learn to communicate straightforwardly. Authentically finding words to match your true emotions will present some challenges.

Take some time to slow down and smell the flowers. Summer passes very quickly.





Key Number 3

Efficiency is at your fingertips.

Under this cycle month’s energy you are more inclined to create order and to be efficient. You will also find yourself coming up with practical solutions or approaches to situations.

In this cycle months energy it’s important to have something to build or fix. A relationship, perhaps?

Be neat and orderly in your surroundings and it will cause you to feel more comfortable. In your relationships, it’s important to be thoughtful and considerate with loved ones. Staying close to home is likely to make you happier.

Use your common sense to solve problems.

Key Number 4

Freedom and change.

This cycle month’s energy is full of enthusiasm and excellent powers of observation.

But, remember that what you see does not necessarily need to be commented on. There may be a tendency to be observant and critical. Best to keep it to just observing.

This cycle energy lends itself well to travel, and it is a good idea to visit new environments if you can fit it into your schedule. It’s important to be moderate and as consistent as you can be.

This is not a good cycle month to commit to a relationship.



Key Number 5

Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Google is your friend.

Don’t be surprised if you find yourself inclined to do lots of research. You are responding to the energy of this cycle month.

It’s a sensitive time when you may find yourself thinking deeply, contemplating and reflecting rather than being a social butterfly. You may find yourself experiencing a deep desire to know more about almost everything. Not a time to expand or make changes if you can avoid them.

Your intuition things and you are well advised to listen to its melody. In fact it’s not a good idea to ignore those inner voices.

Key Number 2

Remember to treat your plastic respectfully.

Credit cards may be temptations cards if you’re not careful under this cycle month’s energy. This tends to be an expansive, abundant (feeling, at least) energy in which you are likely to exhaust that little piece of plastic and spend in haste, forgetting how much the card actually represents.

Aside from that, it should be a time in which you feel self-confident and willing to take on the world.

It’s harvest time in this cycle, and seeds planted in the last few months will come to fruition.

Key Number 3

Prepare to change course.

This cycle month’s energy is about significant endings and transitions. Be prepared to let go of what has not been working for you. This includes friendships and relationships.

Finish and leave behind all that you see as deadwood.

Be honest with yourself about what has been happening in your life and where you have succeeded and where your plans have not worked.

Be prepared to change your thinking. Don’t allow habitual thinking patterns to hold you back.

Key Number 4

Year ending, new beginnings.

This cycle month’s energy is about starting over. This may be a little confusing in the midst of holiday frivolity.

On the other hand, this cycle month’s energy gives the perfect opportunity for you to a real evaluate how you interact with others. New attitudes and new ideas are on the menu.

Watch for developments. There may be exciting changes, dramatic progress and new beginnings. Social interaction gives you the opportunity to plant new seeds in many areas of your life.

You may feel quite energetic, but be careful not to be too assertive, especially in dealing with close emotional relationships. Your enthusiasm can be misunderstood, so keep a cool head.

Happy holidays!

Key Number 5

A low-key holiday month.

This cycle month’s energy is very social. At the same time, in the midst of the celebrations, it’s important to keep your head down. And enjoy social life, but do so quietly. You are super sensitive, and this season tends to bring lots of emotion to the surface.

As much as you can, avoid conflict. It will be more difficult than usual for you to stand up for yourself if conflict arises—better to avoid it at all costs. Not so easy this time of year, especially in family situations.

On the other hand, you are a peacemaker now, and you’re likely to be successful in creating a harmonious environment. By example, of course.

Key Number 6

A time for joyful self-expression.",[]

Key Number 1

Tidy up.

In some ways, you are in the perfect cycle energy for this trying time. Not that it’s easy for anyone to go through what is happening, but for you, in your personal cycle month, the opportunity for enforced isolation is an appropriate time to review what has been happening for the last few months. It will give you the opportunity to decide where you want to go from here.

This energy encourages completions and re-evaluation of what is really important.

Key Number 2

New resolutions.

In some ways, the enforced slowing of life may be more frustrating for you than for many. This cycle month’s energy is about starting over, so instead of taking action, you may have to put a great deal of energy into planning. It's not such a bad thing—making a slow, deliberate plan for the rest of the year in our new reality can be a gift.

You are, in some ways, much more fortunate because this cycle month’s energy has a little a ripple of optimism running under the surface of confusion.

Capture it and ride it. Make an action plan for when we are all free to take up our new lives.

It is a good idea to record your thoughts about the future. You can do it with technology, but it may be better to actually write it down.

Key Number 3

Find things to do.

In these trying times, it’s important for you to stay busy under this cycle energy.

It’s a sensitive cycle month. A time when even if we were not all experiencing the strange circumstances, you would be advised to keep a low profile.

So—in a way—it may be a bit easier for you to be a comfortable hermit. When you do communicate with others, be sure to remember you are not the only person experiencing strange and uncomfortable circumstances.

Find your own inner diplomat.

Spend lots of time cleaning not only your own paws, but all your other extremities.

You are under a water vibration this month: cleaning and grooming should be comfortable.

Key Number 4

Use your imagination.

This cycle month’s energy is not in tune with the rest of the world. Ordinarily the advice would be to reach out and socialize.

Not so easy in this new world.

Perhaps a great opportunity for using your imagination.

Think about creating a virtual dinner party. Cook something easy and encourage a friend, or friends to do the same.

Set a pretty table and eat the same food at the same time. Or – watch a movie at the same time with friends or family.

You are under a very creative energy. Don’t let it go to waste.

Key Number 5

Be a perfectionist.

In some ways, this is a perfect time to be living within a confined space. You can keep everything under control and see all the little details of your work.

This is a test cycle month, and in a test cycle month it’s always easier to follow the rules. It will also be a very good time to go back over the last few months and look at all the aspects of the foundation you have been creating.

You are a rock for those around you. Even though your usual routine is disrupted, you will still be able to create a strong platform for creativity.

This cycle month’s energy brings both blessings and challenges.

Careful not to fall into rigidity.

Key Number 6

Everything changes.

In this cycle month’s energy, everything changes—this is especially true for you at this time.

Although this is a disconcerting and changeable energy, there are also opportunities buried within. This can be very exciting. You are perfectly placed in your cycle to roll with the energy of change and unexpected events.

Look within and explore possibilities for doing things differently, and for accepting the possibility that these weird times can bring out your creativity and also be an opportunity for growth.

Remember to wash your paws.

Key Number 7

Focus on loved ones.

In this strange time, you may find comfort in nurturing others, even at a distance.

Though circumstances may limit physical love and nurturing, at least in some cases it can be done at a distance. Reach out to others through technology if you can. It’s amazing how comforting it can be to hear from someone who is going through the same scary experience as you are.

You are brave. And in this cycle energy, you have a natural tendency towards comforting others.

There is also a creative aspect of this cycle energy. Perhaps it is time to start a family memoir and share your memories with others in your tribe.

Key Number 8

Shelter in place.

If ever there was a good time for you in this cycle energy to be less social, this is it.

It is not comfortable for anyone, of course, but even if we were not in these strange circumstances this cycle month’s energy is appropriate for cutting down on social interaction and re-evaluating life. It’s a very sensitive energy, but also one in which you are more likely to enjoy the spiritual life.

Self-evaluation and asking the questions: Who am I? Where am I going? What do I want in my life from this time forward? is what you should be doing. Moreso than we all are at this time.

Use this time for tending to the spiritual life. Meditate, do yoga, and reach out only to people who are going to be supportive of your journey.

Key Number 9

Show your sensitive side.

Under this month’s cycle energy, it’s important for you to be aware that you may come across as a little authoritarian.

We are all under some stress, so perhaps it’s a good idea to put some of your energy into organizing.

You’re under the perfect energy for putting things together in a way that will make life much easier when things get back to normal.

Put energy into bringing dreams and visions together. Expand your ideas and re-evaluate some of your plans to see if they can be altered and perhaps become more serviceable, especially in career life.",[]
26,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/news/guy-dauncey-gets-ready-solar-tsunami,"Guy Dauncey gets ready for a ""solar tsunami""","['More Jenny Uechi', 'Jul', 'Sep', 'Apr', 'Mar']",,"""Clearly, the world has to work toward 100 per cent renewable energies as soon as possible,"" said Guy Dauncey, BC-based environmentalist, author and speaker, on the future of energy.

Dauncey said even though the technology is rapidly advancing, people have generally been extremely slow to make the switch to renewable energy. He worries that environmentalists are more focused on opposing energy projects rather than promoting solutions.

""What's really clear to me is that you can't change the world by saying 'no' to things, -- You can't just say 'stop the pipeline, the tar sands, stop natural gas, stop oil tankers, coal mines,'"" he said.

While Canada continues to invest heavily in Alberta's oil sands, other countries, especially in Europe, have already said 'yes' to renewable alternatives. In Germany, for example, 50 per cent of the nation's electricity came from solar power in June. Especially since its decision to abandon nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Germany has been accelerating its investment in clean energy.

""The solar tsunami is already happening in areas around the world. In areas where there are high prices of electricity and there's more sun, it's already cost-effective,"" Dauncey said.

""In BC, we've actually got a great advantage because 92 per cent of our power is green energy, hydro -- and it's not difficult to get to 100 per cent green power. And there's a 'solar tsunami' (energy storage) approaching the province right now.""

He says according to the latest reports, the price of installing solar power will become so affordable over the years that any person or business with a roof that doesn't have solar would be ""losing money"".

To Dauncey, the future is bright, if only we would turn towards it.",[]

Asked whether political contributions may have influenced the approval, former provincial biologist Marvin Rosenau responded:

""Is the Pope Catholic? I am not trying to be trite, but the history of Fraser River gravel removal has been one of constant and intensive political interference from the gravel interests in the eastern Fraser Valley.""

The Seabird Island First Nation, in partnership with Chilliwack-based Jakes Construction, has applied to remove 105,000 cubic metres of gravel in the area known as the ""Heart of the Fraser"" from a site called Seabird Bar B near Agassiz, B.C.

Last week, the provincial government quietly green-lighted the project, although Seabird Island has yet to formally accept the approval. One of the conditions for the approval is that Seabird must implement an onsite monitoring program to identify and track impacts, which the Band's corporate affairs director said will take place.

Between 2005 and 2013, nineteen member companies of the B.C. Stone, Sand and Gravel Association (BCSSGA) gave at least $664,990 to the B.C. Liberal Party. Jakes Construction, which is not a member of the association, also gave at least $15,000 to the Liberal Party.

Former cabinet minister and B.C. Liberal insider, John Les, is a lobbyist for Seabird Island Band. Les previously arranged a $5,000-per-plate ""evening with Premier Christy Clark"" fundraising event for the B.C. Liberal Party, which netted the party close to $100,000.

UBC political science professor Maxwell Cameron said one of the underlying problems was that there are no limits to political contributions in B.C., unlike in other provinces like Ontario and Alberta.

""Of course, companies expect something in return for their donations, and they influence public policy,"" said Cameron.

""What policy makers should ask themselves is whether the public might reasonably assume that the donation was made in order to influence the policy decision. If this seems like a reasonable assumption, then there is a risk to the public perception of integrity.""

The Fraser River is one of the few places on earth where ""truly wild sturgeon"" can still be found, according to the Fraser River Sturgeon Conservation Society. The sturgeon is considered a living fossil because it has survived virtually unchanged for more than 150 million years. They are a global rarity for their size and age, and can grow to six meters long.

Sturgeon are a federally listed species at risk. The lower Fraser sturgeon stock, which would be affected by this project, have been left off this list.

Former government scientists say politics have sealed the fate of one of only two known spawning sites for the Lower Fraser white sturgeon.

But BCSSGA executive director Paul Allard said political contributions have had no impact on the government's approval.

""We are a not-for-profit association that is not linked to any political party,"" Allard said. ""Your speculations are just that, speculations.""",[]
28,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/news/will-national-housing-strategy-cool-vancouver-house-prices-no-one-thinks-so,Will the National Housing Strategy cool Vancouver house prices? No one thinks so.,"['More Mark Louie', 'More Edward Ngai', 'Dec', 'Sep', 'Apr', 'Mar']",,"Despite the introduction of public policy tools designed to cool Vancouver’s record-breaking real estate market, newly released data suggests that sustained downward pressure on prices will not be forthcoming for months, if not years.

On Nov. 22, the federal Liberals unveiled Canada’s first National Housing Strategy, which calls for a $2,500 annual subsidy for low-income renters and the construction of 100,000 new affordable housing units nationwide. Besides broadly defining housing-related rights-- length of tenure, access to transportation, a safe environment, and others-- the government plan purported to “tackle all the drivers of housing affordability… by closing the gap between housing prices and local incomes.”

Proponents argue that an injection of affordable housing will let supply “trickle up”: lower-income buyers will move to newly available units, letting baby boomers downsize and freeing up valuable single-family homes.

“We expect the strategy to help ease some of the supply-side pressures in tight markets over time,” said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at RBC. “Accelerated growth in the affordable housing stock is bound to trigger a chain reaction across the various layers of the housing sector.”

Even so, Hogue cautions that because both the rental subsidy and construction targets will not be in place for several years, “the National Housing Strategy is not about to bring immediate supply-side relief.”

Vancouver realtors are much more skeptical-- while attempting to make supply-side changes, the Liberals may actually introduce new rounds of speculation for investors anticipating new housing stock. According to data published by ThinkPol, one in three Yaletown condos listed in late November were purchased for speculation: twenty-two units, or 17 percent, were flipped pre-sale.

“The National Housing Strategy will only make developers and investors want to buy or build more rental units, mainly for the investment or long term income,” said Judith Adamick, a realtor with Sutton West Coast Realty. “Demand for rental housing is just too great.”

Data: Canadian Real Estate Association and S&P Dow Jones Indices

This sustained demand has made Vancouver real estate a rock-solid investment. The Lower Mainland Home Price Index, which measures generic price changes through repeat sales or refinances, has been steadily rising for twelve years with only two major corrections. When prices do go down, they rebound quickly and ferociously. After the 2008 recession, U.S. home prices took 54 months to regain their value. House prices in Vancouver recovered in less than half the time: the first post-recession HPI record was set in April 2010. Since then, the HPI record has been broken 44 times.

The first months of 2018 will be a crucible test of how effective public policy measures are in cooling one of the world’s most expensive property markets. On January 1, the Canadian banking regulator will require prospective homebuyers to pass a new stress test. Interest rates, widely expected to increase in the spring, should also have a downward effect on demand and prices.

But in Vancouver, the government is taking unprecedented measures to cool prices further. As part of a ten-year plan released alongside the Liberals’ federal strategy, the City of Vancouver will begin implementing a tax on empty homes in February. According to Mayor Gregor Robertson, this first-in-Canada tax will disincentivize owning property for investment, drive up the number of available rentals, and release much-needed supply.

Vancouver realtors disagree. According to one prominent Westside realtor with twenty active listings worth more than $5 million dollars, “no one cares about the Empty Homes Tax. Investors are buying these properties,” he said. “They can easily rent them out.” (The realtor asked for anonymity when discussing his clients’ thinking.)

In addition, because so many buildings in Vancouver have strata-related restrictions on renting, government intervention may only pump up prices for properties which fall under certain loopholes. “The tax puts more demand on investors and people buying condos that cannot be rented out, condos that are therefore exempt,” Adamick said. “There are still many options for investors to purchase while avoiding new taxes.”

Anna Lee, an agent with Team 3000 Realty, says that the government should be focusing on approving building permits and expanding supply, not tinkering with a tax that “only affects people who haven’t decided what to do with their house yet.”

The new housing strategies are “more for politics than for any real impact on the market,” she said. “Rent is too high, and as a government, they have to do something. It’s just for show.”

But that was 10 days ago, and Bolandnazar hasn't seen his wife since. When Roya Arabloodariche tried to check in at an Iranian airport on Saturday, she was told she could not enter the U.S. due to an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.

""Our future was destroyed immediately,"" said Bolandnazar.

They are Iranian citizens who both hold advanced degrees from the University of British Columbia. The pair obtained visas to live in New York while Bolandnazar completes his finance and economics PhD at Columbia University.

Arabloodariche, an electrical engineer, had hoped to get her green card and work in the United States. Now, Bolandnazar, 29, said he expects them both to pursue their academic and career goals elsewhere — ideally in Canada.

The husband and wife are just two members of the academic community in North America who have been hurt by the order signed by Trump to ban entry of citizens for 90 days from seven majority-Muslim countries.

Universities Canada, which represents 97 universities across the country, said the immigration ban is already having a ""real, immediate and profound"" impact on research partnerships, international students, academic conference participation and field visits, as well as family relationships.

The American Association of Universities has also called for the ban to ""end as quickly as possible.""

Amir Abdi, a PhD candidate in the electrical and computer engineering department at UBC and recipient of a prestigious Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship, was invited to present as an author at a medical imaging conference in Florida next month.

Abdi, an Iranian citizen who is in Canada on a temporary resident visa, will not be able to attend to help present his team's work.

He said conferences exist for academics to make connections, exchange knowledge with others and contribute to research in their field. But because of Trump's ""unjust and inhumane"" executive order, scholars are being penalized, he said.

""I cannot believe that the U.S. president would believe that scholars could make America unsafe. We are actually the ones who are making every move to improve the human condition,"" he said.

Abdi, 29, who is also Bolandnazar's cousin, said he believes the reputation of the U.S. will be harmed. Members of his department are already reaching out to conference organizers south of the border to see if the events can be held in Canada instead, he said.

""The U.S. is known to attract the brightest minds from around the globe. But as a result of Trump's recent actions, I don't think that scholars are going to be that interested in continuing their education in the U.S.""

Young students, like 23-year-old Iranian-Canadian dual citizen Sina Marzoughi, have also been affected by the ban. He's a medical student at the University of Calgary who had been planning to attend a conference for student-run clinics in Los Angeles next month.

Despite the Canadian government's assurances that dual citizens will be able to cross the border, Marzoughi said the American government has yet to put that in writing, and he's been alarmed by reports of people being detained and having their phones searched.

He said his uncle is a professor at UCLA who has a green card and now can't visit his family in Alberta because he fears he will not be allowed back into the U.S.

""I'm just really worried,"" said Marzoughi. ""Ever since the law was signed on Friday, I'll be honest, it's having a toll on my mental health.""

The University of British Columbia has launched a task force to assist about 80 faculty or staff and 350 students who are from the affected countries.

The Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences, on behalf of Canada's 91,000 faculty and graduate students in these departments, has said the ban runs counter to its goals of building an ""inclusive, prosperous and democratic society.""",[]

Hasan Alam, a community liaison for the Islamophobia Legal Assistance Hotline, said Canadians often feel that race or faith-based discrimination are taboo topics and they should stick to the language of ""diversity and multiculturalism.""

""But I think we need to start pushing the envelope and being comfortable talking about things such as racism and Islamophobia and xenophobia, to name a few things, in a more open and public manner,"" he told a news conference Tuesday.

Alam said a range of legal groups in British Columbia started the hotline last March after the National Council of Canadian Muslims reported a significant increase in Islamophobic incidents. The hotline gives people targeted by Islamophobia access to free legal advice in multiple languages and across a number of legal fields including immigration, employment and human rights law.

He said the reasons for the rise in Islamophobia are complex and many, but during the last federal election a ""divisive form of Islamophobic rhetoric"" was used to single out Muslims as a threat, including the so-called ""barbaric cultural practices"" tipline floated by the Conservatives.

Now, Canadians are being exposed to a more extreme form of this rhetoric from the U.S, he said.

Alam said although he can't speak to a direct correlation, politicians need to be aware their statements can inspire or provide ""tacit approval"" of heinous acts.

""I think they should take their words very seriously. I think the public at large takes cue from those who hold power,"" he said.

The hotline also confidentially records incidents of Islamophobia in Canada, he said. While statistics are not yet available, Alam said the line has received numerous calls about hateful comments and attacks, including a recent incident in which he said a woman's hijab was ripped off in Vancouver. He would not share further details of the alleged incident.

Vancouver police said it has not seen an increase in reports related to faith-based incidents, and it was unable to locate a report of a woman's hijab being ripped off without additional information, such as the date or location.

The B.C. Civil Liberties Association and the Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers are among the legal groups that launched the hotline.

Laura Track, a lawyer with the civil liberties association, said her organization is joining others who have called for the federal government to suspend its safe third country agreement with the U.S. that allows Canada to turn away most refugee claimants who cross through the American border.

She said the agreement is based on the premise that the U.S. is a safe country in which refugees can make asylum claims. But she said that premise has been undermined after Trump's executive order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees and suspended all refugee admissions for at least 120 days.

The U.S. government said Tuesday that it would accept 872 refugees this week because they were ready for travel and stopping them would cause ""undue hardship.""

When asked about the safe third country agreement, Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said the situation in the U.S. is ""fast-changing.""

""The responsible thing to do is maintain contact, to continue to engage and make sure that we monitor the situation closely and make sure that we provide information to Canadians.""

Lorne Waldman of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers said the executive order left thousands of people in limbo, including refugees that have gone through exhaustive security screenings in order to resettle in the U.S.

Trudeau made the announcement at the university Tuesday, saying research at the five-storey centre will equip students with an education allowing them to contribute toward Canada's aim to be a world leader in research and innovation.

""The new building will also have specialized space and support for graduate students in the mechatronics program who are looking to commercialize their interdisciplinary engineering research,"" he said.

B.C. Premier Christy Clark said the new programs will create more jobs in a province that is already leading the country with the most startups per capita.

Clark said extra funding from the university and private donors will amount to a total of nearly $120 million in investments for the new building.

The slowdown is providing a steady supply of skilled workers for the Peace River project, the report says, easing previous concerns from experts who had warned of potential labour shortages.

The downturn and low interest rates have also resulted in a lower bottom line for the project, now pegged at $8.3 billion, about $500 million less than expected.

B.C. Hydro, which is building the dam, hired Ernst and Young and BTY Consultancy Group Inc. to review the project's risks and management of costs. The 43-page report concluded the project is on time and on budget.

Site C is slated to become the third hydro electric dam on northeast B.C.'s Peace River. It will provide enough energy power 410,000 homes.

Ernst and Young said the availability of workers in the Peace River region has increased since 2014 due to decreasing investments in the oil and gas sector and Alberta's jobless rate of 8.6 per cent.

The project is expected to create 7,650 construction jobs. Last July, there were more than 1,700 workers on site.

Dave Conway, Site C's community relations manager, said economic woes in the nearby oil patch are paying dividends for the dam.

""One of the factors is the present downturn in the economy has been a plus for the project,"" he said. ""Certainly, interest rates are one, cost of materials is a second, but the third is labour, and it certainly is the availability of a larger labour pool to draw on at this time.""

One energy analyst said three years ago — when B.C. was basking in the promise of thousands of possible LNG jobs — that labour shortages could hold up some projects.

The most recent July 2016 workforce data provided by B.C. Hydro pegged the workforce at 1,721, with 1,411 of those workers from B.C.

But the report warned Site C could face cost pressures because of the low value of the Canadian dollar, currently at about 76 cents to the United States dollar.

Opposition New Democrat Leader John Horgan said he can't put much stock in a report that he Crown corporation paid consultants to produce.

""This was a government that made the decision to proceed with this project without any third-party oversight,"" he said.

Site C has been embroiled in several court challenges from area First Nations, environmentalists and local residents. Amnesty International recently called for a stop work order on the project, saying it threatens indigenous rights.

Site C will create an 83 kilometre reservoir in the Peace River Valley area, flooding more than 5,550 hectares of land of which at least 3,800 hectares is agricultural land. It will flood First Nations heritage sites and force up to 20 families, most of them lifelong ranchers, to move.",[]

City staff and software company Ecotagious Inc. examined the electricity consumption of 225,000 homes in Vancouver over 12 years in response to growing public concerns that empty homes were driving up prices and leaving some neighbourhoods nearly abandoned.

The study, presented to city council Tuesday, found the residential non-occupancy rate was 4.9 per cent in 2002 and 4.8 per cent in 2014, although the number of empty units rose from 8,400 to 10,800 due to overall growth in housing stock.

Ninety per cent of vacant units were apartments. Apartments for rent had a vacancy rate of close to zero, while condominiums that are owned and not available for rent had a whopping 12.5 per cent vacancy rate in 2014.

""We know that there are thousands of units of empty homes that potentially could be available for rental, when we have one of the tightest rental markets in the world,"" Mayor Gregor Robertson told council after the presentation.

""This could be a great new supply of housing — thousands of units that could be available and also generate revenue for their owners.""

Council unanimously passed a motion for the mayor to write to Premier Christy Clark to reiterate a request made in May 2015 for municipalities to have the legal tools to track property ownership and ensure timely occupancy of empty units.

The motion also asked staff to report back this year with recommendations for specific policy and regulatory steps the city, province or federal government could take to address empty homes based on consultation with experts and residents.

The report effectively dispels the notion that investors are buying single-family homes in Vancouver and leaving them empty, driving up prices and reducing supply.

City housing planner Matthew Bourke said there doesn't appear to be a correlation between empty homes and housing prices, given that the vacancy rate remained flat while prices skyrocketed.

Single-family and duplex housing units showed low and relatively stable non-occupancy rates of one per cent between 2002 and 2014, the report found.

Bourke told council that about 70 per cent of single-family homes marked as vacant in 2014 were found to be waiting for a renovation permit.

Coun. Kerry Jang said the report raises the question of whether the idea that foreign buyers are parking their money in Vancouver is really just a ""myth.""

""If it was foreign buyers, you would see spikes all over the place or in particular parts of town, but it's all really just condos,"" he said.

The geographical region of Vancouver that includes the pricey west side had the highest overall non-occupancy rate at 7.4 per cent, while the rate downtown was six per cent.

The study was completed using anonymous BC Hydro data from 225,000 out of the approximately 280,000 homes in Vancouver.

“There’s very little evidence to show that this is going to have any concrete effect, I don’t know of too many flights between Toronto and the war zones, most of them are going through other countries so it won’t make a big difference practically speaking,” Mulcair told reporters after attending an NDP rally.

With the shadow of the Mike Duffy trial looming larger than ever, Stephen Harper kicked off Week 2 of the federal election campaign with a headline-grabbing effort to crack down on homegrown terror threats.

Harper says a re-elected Conservative government would establish “declared areas” – regions of the world where terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant hold control and use their base to recruit and train followers.

Forgoing casual campaign garb for the more prime ministerial suit and tie, Harper made his announcement at a news conference in Ottawa, flanked by Canadian flags.

He said national security agencies would track Canadians who travel to those areas; those who return would be required to prove they were in the region for humanitarian reasons, or as a journalist covering the conflict. Similar laws exist in Australia, which has designated parts of Iraq and Syria as no-travel zones.

Liberal leader Justin Trudeau called Harper’s announcement a diversion designed to take the attention of Canadians away from his government’s failed economic plan.

But, he added, Harper would have to answer a lot more questions than he did Sunday about any policy that proposes to take rights away from people.

On Wednesday, Duffy is scheduled to be back in court as his trial’s star witness takes the stand: Nigel Wright, Harper’s former chief of staff and the man who gave the disgraced former Conservative senator $90,000 to repay his disallowed housing and travel expenses.

Asked at a campaign event in the Ottawa-area later on Sunday about how Wright’s pending appearance might change the dynamic of the election campaign, Trudeau called it a reminder of Harper’s “lack of respect for democracy and of his extremely poor judgment.”

Harper has long insisted that Wright acted on his own and did not say anything about the transaction to him or anyone else in his office. But he was questioned Sunday about the trial — and in particular what Wright meant when he wrote in a February 2013 email that he’d been given a “good to go” from the prime minister.

“I did not know that Mr. Wright had made a payment to Mr. Duffy,” Harper replied. “As soon as I learned that, I made that public. And Mr. Wright has been clear about that. This is the purpose of the process and those who are responsible and I’ll let the court do its work.”

And “good to go”? “The words you’re quoting are not my words, they’re somebody else’s,” he said.

When asked about the ramifications of his proposed anti-terror measure, Harper struck a defiant tone.

“There is no right in this country to travel to an area under the governance of terrorists; that is not a human right,” he said to a barrage of partisan applause.

He acknowledged – grudgingly – that humanitarian workers, journalists and diplomats might “theoretically” have legitimate reasons for travelling to such a country.

“There will be exceptions in the law for those legitimate reasons, and I don’t think that people who have legitimate reasons will have difficulty showing those, but we know what other people are doing there,” Harper said.

“That is something that we have to nip in the bud before trained terrorists return to this country.”

Harper also volunteered an answer to a question he wasn’t asked, reacting to remarks made last week by “star NDP candidate” Linda McQuaig, who told a CBC panel discussion that for Canada to meet its climate change targets, “a lot of the oilsands oil may have to stay in the ground.”

The comments contrasted with NDP leader Tom Mulcair, who has been open to oilsands development provided there is rigorous environmental protection and legislation to force oil companies to pay for pollution they create, including increased greenhouse gas emissions. Mulcair does, however, support a west-to-east pipeline for moving oilsands crude to market.

“That is the NDP’s not-so-hidden agenda on development,” Harper said.

“The NDP is consistently against the development of our resources and our economy. That’s why they have been a disaster wherever they’ve been in government and why they would wreck this economy if they ever got in, and why they must never get into power in this country.”

Trudeau also chimed in, saying the exchange shows that both Harper and Mulcair are in “extreme positions” on oil extraction.

“What Albertans know, what all Canadians know, is the way to grow a strong economy in the 21st century is by caring for the environment, and you don’t get to make a choice between one or the other,” he said.

Mulcair repeated his party’s position in Vancouver on Sunday and stressed that developing Canada’s natural resources must go hand in hand with reducing climate change.

“Sustainable development is not a slogan, it’s something that has to become very real,” he said. “Canada’s reputation is being hurt on the world stage, simply because we’ve been working against the planet.”",[]

To find out what this month has in store for you, calculate your KEY number by adding the day and month of your birth. The KEY number is not your LIFE PATH number, it is the key to your cycle. Continue adding until you arrive at a single digit. For example, if your birthday is October 14, your KEY number is determined as follows: 10 + 14 = 24. Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Clarify your goals.

Since this is such a powerful cycle energy, it’s important to pay attention to details when looking at any of your goals whether they be financial, career or even family projects.

Be careful: impulse can play a role in this cycle month’s energy, but if you think things over carefully and do your research, it is a good time to take action at the right moment.

You will probably feel more assertive than usual. This can be a very good thing if you don’t misuse your power. As much as you can, radiate authority and self-confidence. Be efficient practical and rational in all your dealings. Think things through so you will exercise good judgement, especially in financial dealings.

Don’t lose sight of your emotional relationships. Pay attention to close ties with friends and family and show your sensitivity wherever it is appropriate.

Key Number 2

Forgive and try to forget.

This month is a good time to review past experiences and work on letting go of what cannot be changed. Continue to work on completions and bringing closure in your life on every level.

Follow your intuition. This is a very psychic energy and a time when your intuition and your dreams can be very accurate.

On a personal level, you will feel quite sensitive. Try not to push things forward unless you are working at completing something.

This cycle month’s energy gives you an opportunity to be realistic, to “grow up” in areas where you have been staying stuck. It’s part of this month’s process.

This is not an easy month. Letting go is harder for some people than others and almost everyone has resistance to change. This cycle month’s energy brings completions. Develop a philosophical attitude. Let your inner humanitarian do her work.

Key Number 3

Grow your new ideas.

You can do a great deal of growing this month. Letting go of past mental habits gives you the space to replace.

Continue to think about new goals and new ventures. Even if it is just organizing a closet, or a kitchen, making new is like making nice.

You will feel the energy flowing more freely if you clean up your mental space and your physical space. Leave space for new ideas and more fluid movement through your days. This is a time to let your innovative, courageous new thoughts rule.

You are likely to feel more independent. This is a leadership energy. Make the most of it.

Key Number 4

Be gentle with yourself.

Be gentle with yourself. This cycle month’s energy is sensitive. It is a time for you to stay in the background and definitely not a time for stirring things up.

Be a peacemaker. Be patient when you are not able to react speedily. It’s a slow energy.

In some situations, you may be indecisive. This is natural under this cycle energy. Working in partnership with others should make you happier.

In this cycle energy you may feel disappointed with yourself at times and wonder if you are weak. In reality, this cycle month’s energy asks you to stand out of the spotlight practice sensitivity and gentleness in all situations.

Pay attention to the beauty around you.

Calculate Your KEY Number

To find out what this month has in store for you, calculate your KEY number by adding the day and month of your birth. The KEY number is not your LIFE PATH number, it is the key to your cycle. Continue adding until you arrive at a single digit. For example, if your birthday is October 14, your KEY number is determined as follows: 10 + 14 = 24. Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Make the most of your power.

Under this cycle month’s energy, you may have more of a sense of power and organization ability. Any ongoing plan or venture you may have in mind is likely to come to fruition. It is a month of blossoming.

Pay attention to your economic picture. If ever there was a time when money can develop from unexpected places, this is it.

As new and progressive opportunities present themselves, think of power and potential and take advantage of what looks promising. It’s not a time to be impulsive, especially with finances, but this energy is a good time in which to invest, start a new project and watch for new and unique challenges. Not a time for risky investing in any sense, but a good time for buying or selling.

Key Number 2

Letting go.

This cycle month’s energy is a time of tying up the loose ends of the past.

In many ways it is a comfortable energy—emotional, yes –because letting go is always a bit emotional, but there is a comfort in letting go of what no longer works for you. And, whether you intend it or not, you will discard and let go.

You may notice rewards for efforts put forward in the past. But you may also notice karma playing its role, so decisions made in the past may bring conclusions you are not be expecting.

Don’t be afraid to work on dreaming and visualizing for the next cycle. The end always contains the seed of new beginnings.

Key Number 3

Begin again.­

This cycle month’s energy is a time of new beginnings. Not only is spring in the air, which always gives one a sense of optimism, but this is the beginning of a minor cycle for you personally.

Optimism and confusion are part of the package in new beginnings.

Planting seeds for the future means finding the right seeds to plant. Go with your intuition.

Last month, for you, was a completion. If you were not courageous enough to do a mental sweep of negative energy, you can still do some major mental cleansing this month. Look at your diet and your habits. Be ruthlessly honest with yourself about what is working in your life and polish it to make it fresh. At the same time, let go of what is not adding to your experience and say goodbye.

A great, positive energy to begin this new season.

Key Number 4

Honey over vinegar.

If ever there was a cycle month energy when being nice and cooperative and complementary to others, this is it! Be supportive and helpful whenever possible. When you find yourself in fraught situations, do whatever is necessary to create harmony for yourself and others.

This harmony-creating also applies to your surroundings. This is a very sensitive energy and you are likely to be more aware of anything out of place or disharmonious.

Things may move more slowly than they did last month. Be patient. The life energy you are storing by being slow to react will stand you in good stead next month.

Be a supporter and a cheerleader for family and friends. This is a time for you to hide your light under a bushel—temporarily, of course.

Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Now that we are done with hearts and flowers for another year…

This cycle month’s energy is also about curiosity and expanding your mind. Whether you are wondering about micro-needling for beauty or why the geckos in Florida are falling out of the trees in the cold, this is the time to do research. It is a mind cycle energy.

It is also very much a time for nature: enjoying it. The days are getting longer, and in Vancouver at least, the first whiff of spring is in the air. Walking is a wonderful thing.

I took a course in Qi gong, and one of the most enjoyable parts was the part where the master took us outside to hug trees – but only after asking their permission. You may not be a tree hugger usually. But, you may get a great deal of pleasure from a quick embrace, under this cycle month’s energy.

Key Number 2

Think abundance!

Because this is such a powerful cycle month energy, it is necessary to concentrate on some positive thinking in order to reap its benefits.

It may be uncomfortable – or it may even seem unreasonable if you’re being financially challenged, but this energy will insist that you think abundance, adopt an attitude of abundance, but also to bring balance to the material world and the spiritual world.

It is a good time to work on developing a healthy attitude towards money, at the same time knowing that money and power do not define you.

So, balance is important.

If you usually struggle to make ends meet this cycle energy may bring opportunities, but it’s important for you to notice them.

If ever there was a karmic energy, this is the time it will manifest. The law of cause and effect is always in operation. Your integrity is very important. Don’t let anyone take your personal power away.

Key Number 3

Compassion and forgiveness.

If you’re not curious or if you’re afraid of change, this month can be a little on the emotional side. It’s important to get ready to adapt to change and to try to be courageous and optimistic when faced with the unknown. Get yourself ready to surrender to the coming change, forgive others and yourself, and accept and let go of what must go.

Get ready to move on. Expect the unexpected. This can be a busy time when you are challenged to look your life squarely in the face and decide what to keep and what to let go of.

Though it is very much a year of endings it’s also a year of rebirth and compensation. Sometimes you may be surprised at the gifts you have been hoping for appear.

Key Number 4

Embrace individuality. Take action.

This cycle month’s energy is about embracing your individuality and independence. Stand on your own two feet and march the beat of your own drum.

Be brave enough to do things your way rather than following anyone else’s pattern. If you are strong within yourself, you have a much better chance for success in all areas of your life.

If you are smart enough, you will have faith in your own judgement and intuition, and you will be proactive following through with any new ideas or even life-changing decisions you will make.

It may feel a bit strange. If you are a pussycat, but this energy may give you the kind of courage to make the decisions that will start you in a new direction.

While last month was very much about forgiveness and sweetness, this month—if it isn’t already clear—is a time to be a bit selfish, make yourself number one and do what is right for you.

On the physical side, this is the perfect time to create a new you. Check out your wardrobe, think about a new hairstyle or colour, do something to remind you when you look in the mirror that you are on a new path now.",[]

There is a shift in energy in the fall of each year.

I like to think that cycles are not tsunamis. Instead, they are a bit like the tide gradually coming in.

Each new cycle year’s energy begins to slowly but surely overtake the existing cycle in the fall of the year.

By January 1, the new cycle energy is well-established. Welcome to the next chapter of your life!

Remember: calculate your personal cycle by adding the month and day of your birth, and the universal year (this year the universal year for the world is 4) – adding it all together and reducing it to one number which is the KEY to your personal cycle. The key to your personal cycles is not the same as your life path number.

Key Number 1

Because we start to feel the effect of the next cycle year in the fall of the previous year, you may have already noticed a shift in energy and events around you.

2019 was a test cycle for you. And, you may have felt a necessity to be a little bit fussier than usual, or at the very least, felt a strong urge to put everything in order. You may not have succeeded spectacularly with the order urge, since the year brought many tests which you had to work through.

2020 is different for you.

In this cycle energy, freedom is the key. You may be able to travel, have an urge to travel, or at the very least break your usual routine.

You may be surprised at how flexible you feel in situations where you would usually be a bit cautious. In this cycle year’s energy, you are more likely to let go of old things and make room for new ideas and even new strategies or reactions.

The advice for this cycle is to welcome new situations, places and even people into your life.

This is a year to make progress. Whether you have a business of your own or work for someone else, it’s best to bring new ideas or develop new strategies for dealing with your work life.

Be sure to advertise your strengths. This is not a year to be a wallflower! This is a cycle year in which you are more likely to take risks.

A word of caution: You are likely to feel restless, but it is best to focus your energy on learning new things and developing new habits rather than colouring outside the lines.

Also—avoid scattering your energies to widely. You are very adaptable under this cycle energy, but it is best to use that adaptability to keep the balance between risk and new developments. You may want to do many things that are outside of your usual way of dealing with life. You’re welcome to do a variety of things, but be sure that they are actions which will be useful in the future.

If you have been in a rut, this is the time to climb out.

Key Number 2

You may notice you have more responsibility on your shoulders since October or November of last year.

You will be needed in many situations and may be called upon to help those in your personal circle, including family and friends.

This cycle year is a year when must be of service to others. And you will enjoy being surrounded by family and domestic life. This cycle year’s energy is very much about love, family and home. If you make yourself available, you will probably be surrounded by love and friendship.

Remember to do what you do thoroughly and conscientiously. Finishing anything you start will give you surprising satisfaction.

You may be surprised to find you are a homebody. Not bored, but pleased to do the small. Energy moves a bit more slowly and it may seem as if not much is happening, but karma is working behind the scenes.

This is a wonderful year for personal relationships. As an old numerologist once said, “a fine and friendly influence for marriage and home.”

Key Number 1

Make some quiet time.

In the midst of the holiday, it would be a good idea to schedule some “NHD”s. Don’t be surprised if you’d not heard this acronym before. I think a friend and I made it up. It stands for “non-human days.” Non-human days are not social. They are thoughtful, quiet and a little reclusive.

The holiday season brings lots of opportunities to be touched emotionally. In this cycle month’s energy, it is a good idea to not ignore deep, sensitive, emotions.

Of course, it’s important to spend time with family and loved ones, but conserve your energy and filter your comments. This is an energy in which you can easily be misunderstood.

Happy holidays!

Key Number 2

Powerful energy.

It’s a while since you have been in such a powerful energy during the holiday season.

Remember to celebrate your accomplishments over the last few months. This cycle month’s energy is a time when you should be able to look back and see what you have accomplished in personal and career life.

At the same time, the holiday season is often fraught. You are able to organize more efficiently than you have been able for some time now. Of course this is a good thing, except, when someone who is an indifferent cycle resists your good intentions.

Powerful energy may need to be modulated.

Organize the people around you with a gentle hand.

And for sure you will have a happy holiday.

Key Number 3

The holiday season is always emotional.

The holiday season can be explosive. In this the last cycle month of this cycle year, don’t be surprised if things come to a head, especially in family and relationship matters.

This can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. No one wants an upset in the holidays, and yet you have important work to do in your emotional life.

You may have to be a bit ruthless and that’s not always comfortable. However, it’s really important to make a space for new ideas and new people and even new ventures that come up in the future. This may result in some hurt feelings.

Also – remember to keep your boundaries in place. This cycle month’s energy tends to be overly generous and compassionate. Can you be overly generous and overly compassionate? The answer is yes, and under this cycle energy it is much more likely.

Healthy boundaries are important at this time. This is especially true in creating a happy and healthy holiday season.

Key Number 4

Optimism and confusion.

During all the excitement of the holidays, you should be feeling a ripple of optimism running under some of this madness in celebration.

Remember to notice that little feeling of excitement, because it actually indicates new possibilities and new ideas growing under the surface where they cannot be seen but certainly can be felt.

This cycle month is a wonderful opportunity to make decisions about where you want to go in your life from this time forward.

Feel the vibration of newness. Even though it is the end of the year, it’s a time when you may feel positive energy of new ideas sprouting under the surface.

This is the cycle month when you can take on anything and be successful.

Key Number 1

Home is where the heart is.

Pay special attention to your home in the second half of this month. You may be tempted to make changes in order to create a more harmonious environment. Act on that impulse.

It may just be taking advantage of a kitchen sale to replace a worn out utensil, but for the most part paying attention to what your family and home require will be inescapable.

Relationships with people remain at the forefront of your experience.

The most exciting part of this cycle month’s energy is the possibility of improving relationships. However, it can be a little bit testy in the relationship part of your life as well.

Remember to think about harmony—it is something you can attain in your home. It isn’t always easy, but it is definitely worth fighting for.

Key Number 2

Continue looking within.

Because it isn’t always important in our daily life to stop and wonder – just wonder – it’s a good idea to take advantage of this cycle energy while you are in a state of having to analyze your life’s purpose.

When the energy of the cycle is specifically designed for inner work, it’s important to take advantage of this vibration.

Taking a few moments out of your day to make notes in your journal, or, in a journal if you don’t already have one, will bring enormous benefits in sorting out your future path.

Paying attention to synchronicities is wise. Though you may think “coincidence” is not significant, it is quite likely that these unexpected incidences are messages from deep inside your consciousness, telling you that you are on the right path.

This is not a good time for socializing. If you must, and it is getting close to the holiday season so perhaps it’s unavoidable, try to keep it (social life) to a minimum.

Key Number 3

High-flying energy.

This cycle month is not only about what you can accomplish in the future: it is important to look at what has been laid down as a foundation over the last few months. This is especially true with career and money matters.

If you have put good, positive energy out into the universe this cycle will bring acknowledgement and rewards. If this is not an easy month to negotiate, you may want to take a look at your thinking patterns.

Everything vibrates at its own frequency. Positive thoughts tend to bring positive results. Try and cultivate a good outlook, or at least a philosophical one, in all aspects of life.

Good results tend to come from positive thinking, whether you believe it or not.

Key Number 4

Create a new slate.

The idea of the slate is an old one. However, it is a useful image. Slates were used in school when paper was not so available. The advantage of the slate was that it could be wiped clean and the user could start over.

This is a time for slate cleaning: wiping what is not working out of your life and giving your slate a good cleaning to prepare for what comes next.

The reevaluation part of this cycle is very important, but it’s also important to acknowledge that this is an extremely sensitive time when your intuition is likely to be sharper than usual.

So – if you listen to your intuition it will probably tell you which path you must take to move forward in your life.

Key Number 5

New beginnings.

This cycle month’s energy continues to bring surprises. New plans and new ideas about how to bring plans into manifestation are likely to brighten your expectation of what comes next.

Pay attention to your intuition. This is a time when it’s most likely to point you in the right direction.

Don’t be surprised if you feel relieved when you let go of a plan or an idea, or even a relationship, that you thought would be part of your life forever.",[]

Stay close to home.

This cycle month’ s energy is decidedly domestic. If you want to be comfortable in yourself, it is important to stay close to home, be dutiful, and be willing to put yourself at the disposal of anyone who might need your help. Family dynamics will be at the forefront and being a good person and doing the right thing is your mission.

This is also an extremely favourable time for romance, and you may find yourself able to make a strong commitment to relationship or marriage if you are not already committed.

There will be opportunities to advance in your career, but remember that in this cycle month’s energy, the most important issue is your relationships with people and your family. Balancing your work obligations with home responsibilities may be a little bit tricky, but it is possible to do it well.

Another element of this cycle month’s energy is your creativity. Make some time for journaling or expressing yourself creatively. You’d be surprised how journaling makes your creative juices flow.

Key Number 2

Looking within is important.

Inner voices speak truth under this cycle month’s energy. It is very important for you to pay attention to intuition and your own inner wisdom. Psychology, philosophy, religion, and spirituality in all forms may snag your attention while you are in this complex and extremely interesting cycle.

Try to avoid socializing, especially in large groups. More intimate conversations and experiences are likely to bring more satisfaction in this introverted cycle month’s energy.

Be ready to answer – or at least search for – answers to questions like: Who am I? Where am I going? And what do I want in my life from this time forward? Don’t worry if the answers are not immediately available. The goal of looking at these questions is always to push you into looking at your inner life.

Key Number 3

Check your credit card balance.

Last month was about your inner life. This month is about the world of commerce, career, money, and credit.

It’s also a time when you begin to see the fruits of your labours. Harvest. If you do not see some signs and symptoms of what you have been thinking and doing over the last 10 months, you may miss some important information.

At the same time, this is a positive energy. Your self-confidence should be high. Be careful not to overwhelm your close circle with demands and plans. You are flying high, but they may not be in the same space.

Key Number 4

A time for completions.

Everything ends. There is order in the universe, and everything moves in cycles, including our lives. This cycle month’s energy is about tying up the loose ends of the past and completions. Coming close to the end of the year, you also experience the end of a minor cycle. This is a time to look at what you have accomplished and what you want to push forward, but also to look at which ideas and projects need to be redesigned or left aside for a while.

This is a time to be brave. Do a ruthless self-appraisal and decide which ventures and ideas deserve to be nourished and which are simply time gobblers.

Key Number 5

Starting over.

This cycle month’s energy should be optimistic and courageous. It’s a time for a fresh look at the direction your life is taking.",[]

A Halloween mask to represent the energy of this month would be Mother Teresa, as taking care of others should be your primary goal under this cycle energy. Mother Teresa was never a doormat. She had a strong sense of her mission and it was impossible for anyone to distract her.

In this cycle month’s energy, you may find yourself sacrificing your own long-term goals for someone else’s needs. This is not a bad thing.

However, because Mother Teresa was never a doormat, it is important for you not to allow yourself to be taken advantage of on any level. Being of service is one thing, and being unaware of your own needs, and sacrificing for others is important, as long as you don’t go over the edge.

This is a domestic, caring, and service-oriented month. Do what you can for others but take care of yourself as well.

Key Number 3

An appropriate Halloween mask for this cycle month and energy is that of the philosopher, or the Mystic. It’s best to continue to keep a low profile under this energy: Tall poppies are likely to lose their heads.

If you spend time thinking, you are likely to develop very good and innovative ideas. However, it’s best if you keep them to yourself until at least the end of the month when you’re able to shoot new ideas into the atmosphere like so many rockets.

In the meantime, meditate, do yoga or pilates, and walk on the beach or in the woods. Contact with nature is very helpful.

Key Number 4

In other years, I would’ve suggested Donald Trump as the perfect Halloween costume. This year, I suggest you find an entrepreneur who was a bit more successful.",[]

It’s important to watch your mood as well. This cycle month will give you an indication of what to expect in the next cycle year, which begins officially in January 2020.

Calculate Your KEY Number

To find out what this month has in store for you, calculate your KEY number by adding the day and month of your birth. The KEY number is not your LIFE PATH number, it is the key to your cycle. Continue adding until you arrive at a single digit. For example, if your birthday is October 14, your KEY number is determined as follows: 10 + 14 = 24. Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

This cycle months energy is meant to be a time of settling into autumn. For you, the energy is a bit chaotic and restless. A good time to take a break or to plan one.

Be as adventurous and flexible as possible whether you’re able to travel or not. Expect changes to crop like mushrooms in all parts of your life.

Rolling with changes and welcoming new perspectives is important and natural.

Watch for exciting social opportunities! This is a good time for making new friends and welcoming unexpected visitors.

Be careful not to scatter your energy too widely. If you become impatient to the point that you lose focus you will miss important opportunities to move forward.

You will probably be more appealing to the opposite sex than you have been for some time. Should your wardrobe reflect your inner risk taker? You decide.

Key Number 2

You’re in the perfect cycle month for settling into fall. The energy of this month is domestic and loves to be cozy at home.

This is also the cycle energy for dealing with relationships of all kinds. Can’t promise that it will be easy, but definitely intense. Love relationships can be a bit testy, and you can expect others to rely on you for wisdom in many areas of life.

You may have an irresistible urge to cook and clean and do things domestic. And, yes, contact your mother or any close family member you have been neglecting. This is a wonderful time for family feasts and get-togethers. Be dutiful, domestic, diplomatic in disagreements and generally a good house bunny.

Key Number 3

You will not be the life of the party under this slightly somber energy, but your inner life will call for attention—ignore that voice at your peril.

This is a powerful energy cycle for reflection, looking within and asking the questions: Who am I? Where am I going? And what do I want in my life from this time forward?

You will definitely feel cranky if you are crowded by family or friends. This is a time when you need space, and a time to enjoy your own company.

If you are going to speak, especially if giving advice, be sure to think it over very carefully before you begin to express. This is the cycle energy in which you are likely to be misunderstood. For the most part, it’s safer to fly under the radar.

Key Number 4

Although you may feel as if you’re absolutely in charge of your own life, it’s better to focus inward and not try to be the boss of everybody around you. This month cycle energy is a self-confident energy and you should use your personal power.

This is also a harvest energy and much of what turns up in your life will be the result of seeds you planted in your emotional life several months ago.

Money matters will rise to the top of the list of priorities. Pay attention to your bank balance as there may be a tendency to overspend. Spread your new ideas like a carpet all over your workplace or in your home. Solve all kinds of problems—you can do it—as this energy is perfect for problem-solving.

There continues to be a tendency for you to be more than a little bossy or in charge.",[]

Just a note:

The cycle energy of this month is very intense. Whatever cycle energy you have been experiencing this year, so far, is magnified in September. It is not the last gasp of your present cycle year, but it is a turning point. By the end of this month some of the energy of the next cycle year begins to lap at your toes, a little like the tide coming in.

Cycles are not tsunamis. They kind of creep up on you. So – don’t be surprised if some of your ideas and attitudes begin to shift gradually but noticeably. Watch for it. It’s a good thing.

Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.

Key Number 1

Nose to the grindstone.

This is a time to be practical. Life can be magical but there are times (cycles) when it’s important not to depend only on luck or dreams.

Staying grounded is what is necessary in creating strong and lasting outcomes in your life.

Try to be as efficient and economical as possible especially in financial matters.

Unfortunately, if you don’t manage your affairs cleverly this month, there may be some problems later.

With all the work necessary in this cycle month’s energy, you may feel a little bit restricted. It’s the energy of the month. Accept this testy vibration as the energy of the cycle and work with a positive point of view.

In the middle of all this testiness, it is a good idea to allow a few days to play and to take care of your romantic life—especially near the end of the month. You’re likely to feel quite serious because of all the hard work and tests you must endure this month, so it’s important to give yourself a little time for relaxation.

Key Number 2

Be ready for adventures of all kinds.

Don’t expect things to go the way you expect them to go under this cycle month’s energy. Be prepared for the unexpected and unusual changes. This chaotic energy can show up in all aspects of your life.

You may initiate the changes yourself or find yourself dealing with change initiated by other people or circumstance.

Take advantage of the shifting circumstances and flow with the evolving conditions. You don’t really have a choice—this is a time to show your versatility and quick and creative reactions.

You may be forced to release some old ideas. Be graceful in accepting these changes and make room for new ideas.

Key Number 3

Curl up and be cozy.

This cycle month’s energy continues to be cozy and homey. Drama around family and relationships may be where you have to focus.

Creating a harmonious environment in your home is essential for you to feel comfortable.

You may be called upon to give advice and comfort to family and friends, but it is important to avoid butting in where you are not invited. This cycle month’s energy is about creating positive family interactions, but it’s also important to let love ones make their own decisions unless you are asked to help.

This cycle month’s energy is all about people. It’s also a time for romance, so be prepared.

Key Number 4

Listen to your inner voices.

If you’re wondering why you are feeling less sociable than you normally do, blame it on the cycle. This cycle month’s energy should allow you to focus on your inner life. Pay attention to your intuition. It will be sharper than usual.

Don’t worry if you find you have tendencies towards being a hermit. It’s a natural way to fulfill the necessity to reevaluate and ask the questions who am I? Where am I going? What do I want in my life from this time forward?",[]

Then 2 + 4 = 6, and you have the KEY number (6) that you will keep for life.





Key Number 1

Keep the filter in place.

This cycle month’s energy continues to be one in which speech flows easily. Have you ever written a poem? If you have not, this is the cycle energy in which you are most likely to be successful poetically.

Throw a party, chat up a stranger, write a description of yourself for an online dating site. Whatever you do, bring the creative side of your nature to the forefront.

This continues to be a risky time in your cycle if you are not careful of speech. Criticism may spring to mind easily, and almost any situation, but if you are wise you will keep it to yourself.

This cycle month’s energy will tempt you to spread your energy thinly. Take risks on new ventures, but, don’t neglect essential duties.





Key Number 2

Play by the rules.

Playing by the rules is wise under this cycle month’s energy. Finish everything you start and avoid shoddy work. There is an old saying that goes: measure twice, cut once. In case it doesn’t make sense at first glance, it fits perfectly into this cycle month’s energy, and it means you will be sorry if you aren’t very careful to do your work as perfectly as possible.

This is also the cycle month in which you are likely to be tested on almost all levels.

Personal relationships will be a bit tricky. Even if you try very hard to exercise tact, you are likely to be misunderstood. Better to be quiet than to voice your opinion. Expect disagreements.

Key Number 1

Creativity and some conflict.

This cycle month’s energy moves between hilarity and depression. Creativity in the form of creative idea producing and problem-solving is more available than it has been for many months. Problem-solving, especially the kind where you have to think outside the box, is available. Just be patient enough to sit and think for a while.

You will be surprised at the unusual solutions which come to mind.

At the same time, you must remember to think before you speak. In this cycle month’s energy, the most important tool will be a filter. Be sure to fit it into place before you speak.

Creativity in communication is very helpful, however energy flowing indiscriminately through speech, especially the kind which consists of criticism can get you into all kinds of difficult situations.

Key Number 2

Colour inside the lines only.

Just your luck to have such serious, hardworking, energy in your cycle month just at the end of summer, when everyone wants to take advantage of the last rays.

Not you, though.

Pay attention to work or you will rue the day you abandoned necessary duties for a day at the beach. This month’s cycle energy is serious. No matter how hard you try to ignore what needs to be done, the energy of this cycle month will chain you to your desk or dirty dishes.

Ignore a tendency to speed or glance at your phone—in this cycle month’s energy, there’s bound to be a policeman waiting under a tree. Your boss or parents are bound to notice infringements of rules. On the bright side, physical pleasure is waiting to be acknowledged.

Key Number 3

Wild and woolly energy.

The rules tend to go out the window. Restlessness rules. In this cycle month it’s a good idea to take a holiday from perfection. Do what is absolutely necessary in the area of work and duty but try to avoid monotonous tasks.

This is an ideal energy for travel. Not for risky travel, though.

This cycle month’s energy is about the unexpected event. And though we love adventure, better to plan for it to be pleasurable rather than challenging.

Twists and turns and unusual outcomes are the norm in all areas of life.

You may want to experiment with dating if you are not committed. However, caution in this area is a good idea.

Key Number 4

Offer a helping hand.

In certain cycle months like this one, you may find it impossible to refuse to help. This is a good thing. Following your cycle energy, whether you know it or not, is usually irresistible.

This is one of those cycle months when you may find yourself, perhaps uncharacteristically, offering a helping hand to almost anyone who seems to be in need. Don’t fight it. At the same time, this cycle energy directs you to pay attention to your home and loved ones.

You will need to deal with personal problems of the family or romantic kind, whether the problems be large or small.

Another aspect of this cycle energy is creativity. Its best use is domestic. Beautify your home and you will beautify your life.

Key Number 5

Seek the spiritual path.

In this cycle month’s energy, you may find yourself wishing to be a hermit. Do your duty in the material world, but then withdraw. This is the time for contemplation and truth seeking—definitely not the time for indulging in social life. You’re much too sensitive to be comfortable in loud or discordant environments.",[]

BC's hot springs are beloved by Vancouver residents and travellers as an escape from the big city. Only a one and a half hour drive from downtown, you can start your hot springs adventure on Harrison Lake, where the famed West Coast mountains drop down to the water. Once you arrive there, you won't want to leave, so consider a couple of days in Harrison. Then you can move on to other destinations where travellers will be rewarded with the benefits of natural waters that are almost medicinal, as aches and pains, and problems, slip away.

1. Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia



Harrison Village, BC, boasts a magnificent setting and lovely hot springs. Less than two hours from Vancouver, the thermal waters of these hot springs attract vacationers all year round. Exceptionally high in mineral solids, they are believed to heal rheumatism and arthritis. In fact, the Coast Salish indigenous peoples have long considered these hot springs a healing place. For good reason, Harrison's springs have drawn stars like Clark Gable, John Wayne and Liam Neeson (not all at once, obviously).



The two thermal sources feeding the Harrison hot springs are at 40 and 65 degrees C – plenty hot for any spa-seeker. Unfortunately, closeness to Vancouver comes at a cost – the popular BC tourism destination's best array of hot, warm, and cold baths are only available to guests of the Harrison Hot Springs Resort – either hotel or spa guests. The resort is a pleasure for families and one of its best features outside of the baths is the Sunday morning buffet which is truly a feast. Travellers can also enjoy the full range of spa services and four large pools, including a lap pool with a view of the nearby mountains peeking over the hotel. In the summer, paddle boats are a fun adventure for children and the beach by the lake offers a nice walk with viewpoints to enjoy dramatic sunsets.

There's a more affordable public hot spring-fed pool just down the road, but it simply doesn't compare to the resort's five naturally hot pools, calming ambiance, and waterfall rock sculpture setting. The cheapest way for travelers to access to all the hot springs is a 25-minute relaxation massage ($100), then explore the rest. They're open 5 a.m. to 1 a.m. so there's plenty of soak time.





2. St. Agnes Well/Skookumchuck Hot Springs, British Columbia



This hot springs in British Columbia is the most undeveloped on the Vancouver Observer's list, and is only accessible by traveling on a rough gravel logging road. It's not to be confused with Lussier, the hot springs near Skookumchuck in interior BC. But for travellers looking for adventure on their vacation in British Columbia , plunging into these incredible wilderness baths – just over four hours from Vancouver – will be worth your while. Located on the edge of the stunning Lillooet River, BC, roughly an hour south of Pemberton and Mount Currie, these popular hot springs on Port Douglas, Skatin and Samaquam First Nations territory feature a campground if you decide to stay the night.",[]

The peace is also broken momentarily as a seal bursts out of the water, letting out a hearty snort before it dives back beneath the surface.

Gibsons is a quaint and colourful town at the southern end of British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, a 180-kilometre stretch of picturesque oceanside communities and jagged coastline along the Strait of Georgia.

Many visitors to Gibsons get a kick out of the numerous nods to the long-running Canadian sitcom ""The Beachcombers,"" which was filmed in the town and ran from 1972 to 1990.

The Persephone, the tug piloted in the show by log salvager Nick Adonidas (played by Bruno Gerussi), sits on a prominent street corner in the centre of town, right by Molly's Reach, the cafe where much of the action took place.

""Someone gets their picture taken every day in front of Molly's Reach,"" says bed-and-breakfast owner Celia Robben, who heads up Sunshine Coast Tourism.

""To a specific demographic, it's definitely a draw... If you're under 30, you don't have a clue.""

Most visitors arrive at the Sunshine Coast via ferry from Vancouver's Horseshoe Bay. The northern part of the Sunshine Coast can also be accessed by ferry from Comox, on Vancouver Island.

Robben estimates up to half a million visitors come to the region every year, though the summer is by far the busiest time. The permanent population is only about a tenth of that.

""We're very much a cottage country for Vancouver and the Lower Mainland,"" she says.

Robben and her husband moved to Gibsons about a decade ago from Houston to open their B&B, Arcturus Retreats. She recalls making the decision while on a ski vacation in Whistler.

""As we were driving up the Sea-to-Sky (Highway), we were looking over at the Sunshine Coast, seeing our future home at a distance,"" she says. That was in February.

""By July, we were househunting.""

Outdoor activities are a big draw, says Robben. In a climate where temperatures rarely dip below O C, kayaking, mountain biking and hiking can be done year-round.

In the winter, there's also cross-country skiing and snowshoeing on Dakota Ridge — a quiet alternative to packed resorts elsewhere on the West Coast.

""You can come over here and be on the trails on your own,"" says Robben. For hikers on the Sunshine Coast Trail, warming huts are also available throughout the winter.

In Gibsons, there's a steep but short hike up Soames Hill that ends with stunning views of the town, Howe Sound and the surrounding mountains. A gem for locals is Cliff Gilker Park, in Roberts Creek to the north, with trails of varying lengths and scenic views of waterfalls.

Even farther up the coast is Skookumchuck Narrows Provincial Park, where hikers, if they time it right, can see powerful tidal rapids in action.

The Sunshine Coast is also a magnet for art lovers, Robben says, with painters, potters, jewelry makers and glass blowers setting up shop in the region.

A purple banner outside an artists' studio signifies that the public is welcome to pop in. An ""art crawl"" is set for Oct. 21-23 along the Sunshine Coast Highway. Last year's event included 125 venues.

The region's tourism website boasts that the area is ""home to the highest per capita population of artists and crafters in Canada.""",[]

My nose confirms the good news almost as soon as I reach the town of 13,000 some 180 road-and-ferry kilometers north of Vancouver along the Sunshine Coast. Cresting the wooded bluff of Marine Avenue out of the Westview suburb, I’m greeted with a whiff of pristine air, faintly scented with sea-spray and cedar.

All the more incongruous, as the unfolding vista of the historic, original Townsite district is dominated by a sprawling paper mill – Powtown’s original raison d’être – sending up 100-metre billows out of multiple vents.

Paper mill at sunset; that's steam, not smog. Photo: John Berger

In the decades up to the 1960's, when this factory ranked as the worlds largest pulp and paper mill (by output), those stacks would have smothered the paternalistically planned company town in an acrid miasma of wood pulp smoke. But now they belch nothing but harmless steam from the mill’s state-of-the-art wood-fuelled power plant.

So limpid is the gaseous and liquid effluent that the erstwhile log-pen has become a favourite roosting place for seals and sea lions. You can hear them keening and quarrelling all the way from the Marine Avenue overlook, a kilometre away. But the sound is most striking right down at the water’s edge, where it echoes off the eerie, moss-grown Hulks that comprise the log-pen breakwater.

Ghost ships reincarnated

Back in Gibsons, when we started this road-trip, local artist Liz Williams complained that provincial and municipal officials were treating her live-in, flower-bedecked barge as “just an eyesore hulk” to be squeezed for tax revenue. But up here in Powell River, The Hulks are cherished as the town’s most distinctive icons.

These 1940’s-vintage ocean-going freighters, scuttled and anchored offshore, once served to shelter the mill’s log-raft feedstock from the waves of the Malaspina Strait.

Cast in concrete due to World War II steel shortages, the ships still rate as a quirky living museum for nautical history buffs. One of the Hulks, the S.S. Quartz, was even pressed into service for the first atom bomb tests off Bikini Atoll (and was pronounced contamination-free before being towed to Powell River in 1947).

One Incredible Hulk. Photo: Lawrence Behan

But now that the drastically downsized plant no longer processes raw logs, the breakwater has outlived its utility (except to its resident pinnipeds). Plans are afoot to sink four of the Hulks on a barren stretch of seafloor midway between Westview and Townsite to make an “artificial reef” underwater park.

Sportsdiving tourists flock here in the summer to frolic with 12-foot octopodidae and other charismatic marine fauna. In the winter, though, tourists of any sort are scarce, so Powtown’s charismatically local terrestrial fauna – especially the human ones – are left to frolic on their own.

Powtown's filmgoing public: broadening tastes and derrières

We join a queue of them outside the Patricia Theatre, North America’s oldest continuously operational movie house, for opening night of the Powell River Film Festival.

Given the city’s blue-collar antecedents, who would have expected such an artsy and international roster of movies? Some of them have already featured separately in the Vancouver Observer’s Film section; for the rest, watch this space.

Especially striking how much of the queue is made up of Powell River lifers: Baby Boomers with decades – if not generations – of background in the town and the mill. Not so surprising, though, to Jim Dickenson, 78, waiting patiently in line at the glassed-in Art Deco ticket kiosk. “I’m kind of a Hulk, myself. I've been coming here since I was a kid, when I'd blow my whole week's allowance at a go: 15¢ for the movie and an ice cream next door for a dime.”

Comfortably pensioned off when the factory slashed its payroll from over 3,000 to the present few hundred, Dickenson – like most Powell River Mill retirees – saw no reason to move away. But, with decades of leisure for self-cultivation, his film tastes have by now grown worldlier. So he looks forward to the Festival as an annually recurring treat.",[]

You can reliably look forward to panoramic vistas, poetic mists, layered history, gourmet ethnic dining, cross-country ski runs, roiling rapids, oyster shoals and affable locals with yarns to spin and ample time to tell them. Not to mention a world class annual international film festival now rounding on its 16th year.

But don’t expect to improve your suntan.

Not that it’s altogether impossible. Meteorologically, in February, anything can happen – even sunshine – along the 186 km stretch of ocean and asphalt comprising Highway 101 between Horseshoe Bay and Lund.

The evenest keel in the B.C. Ferries fleet

Last week, for instance, there was an unprecedented foot of snow all the way down to sea level. But then Valentine’s Day dawned balmy and bright as we drove onto B.C. Ferries’ Queen of Coquitlam at Horseshoe Bay. Yet by the time we rolled off in Langdale, 40 minutes later, it was already windshield-wiper weather.

That’s par for the course, according to the snappily uniformed pursar who welcomed us aboard. Just days ago, she relates, her ferry had sailed into the teeth of a full-blown gale.

B.C. Ferries' Langdale-bound Queen of Coquitlam: Sunshine Coast, as seen from sunless solarium. Photo: Lincoln Kaye.

None of which fazed her off-season passengers, she adds. “This route is the most reliable in our system.” Sheltered by islands and shoals, the Langdale crossing is relatively immune to winds and currents -- so stable that some locals can even rely on it for daily commutes to jobs in Greater Vancouver.

“We keep going even when the Nanaimo and Victoria services shut down. The only thing that’ll tip this vessel at all is the whale pod that sometimes tracks us in the summer. Then enough passengers crowd the rail for the whole boat to list a little,” she laughs.

Scouting Safari

But the laid-back Sunshine Coast lifestyle could start listing a whole lot more as current property market forces run their course.

Right in Horseshoe Bay, before even boarding the ferry, we ran into some harbingers of incipient real estate trends: a pair of high-rolling Beijing real estate speculators, along with their local overseas Chinese “fixer” and an Anglo potential “mark” who had 65 rural acres to sell.

Accompanied by a retinue of drivers, translators, lapdogs and assorted hangers-on, they rolled up to the on-ramp in a convoy of SUV’s. Parking their bonsai schnauzer with the chauffeur below decks, they adjourned to the elegant Coastal Café to enjoy the view. We sat in the next booth, the better to eavesdrop.

Clearly the main expeditionaries – the speculators and their local agent – didn’t know each other well, so the table talk turned right away to bragging. The mainlanders prided themselves not only on the quantity of money they represented, but also the quality: top-tier government functionaries – even military officials – held stakes in their capital pool.

The “fixer,” for her part, claimed access to vast untapped reservoirs of overseas Chinese demand now that the sheen was off the Vancouver market. The Sunshine Coast, with plenty of unincorporated locales free of such impedimenta as zoning, building codes or vacancy levies, stands poised to become the next big Mecca of flippable development.

Before we’d even berthed at Langdale, the two sides had already sketched in the broad outlines of a deal: enough mainland money to build big and build fast, so the B.C. broker -- at 20% commission.-- could surf the cresting waves of demand.

“Nothing wrong with that,” according to the agent. “Flipping,” as far as she’s concerned, is even a kind of public service. “Turnover, after all, is what makes the world go around. Isn’t it?”

Unsinkable Liz

Emphatically not, according to the first Sunshine Coast denizen we meet upon debarkation. “Nothing here’s for sale; none of it,” Liz Williams declares, with a sweep of her deft, tough hand to encompass the whole of her winter lair.

It’s a 10’ x 10’ cubicle mounted on a barge tucked under the wharf at Gibson’s Landing. The space is crammed full of spangle and sheen: bead curtains, disco balls, translucent batiks, spirit-catching webs, rainbow-hued CD’s, feather boas, fibre-optic fronds, winking nixies, dinky cars, bottle caps, ironwork filigree – more scintillating detail than the eye can take in.

Pearly rainlight shimmers among the piers under the wharf. It filters in through the beads and plumes and tiles. The boxy little room enfolds a hushed glow, like a stained glass chapel – but a good deal gaudier, with a magpie congeries of eclectic iconography.",[]

But now, he's looking forward to using Evo to commute to work at BCIT on rainy days and for all kinds of outdoor adventures, no longer limited to central Vancouver.

“Definitely them having the bike racks is a selling feature for us,” he says, referencing Evo’s spacious, four-door cars.

The expansion means Ryan and his girlfriend can book a car in East Van using the Evo App on their smartphone which now includes a handy reservation countdown timer, directions to the nearest car or parking location, and the ability to check your minutes and billing right from the App.

They can then drive to an area within the new Home Zone, drop off the car and bike to great destinations in North Van, Burnaby and beyond.

The vehicles — instantly recognizable by their black and blue design — also include ski racks, plenty of trunk space, and what Whyte describes as a “great sound system.”

“We’ll put our bikes on the roof to get to wherever we’re going,” he explains, “then maybe go for a bike ride and put them back on the roof on the way back. Being able to get closer to nature is great.”

An awesome addition to your transportation toolkit

Evo announced the expansion of its boundaries at the beginning of June, along with a large addition to its fleet of hybrids.

It was icing on the cake for North Vancouver resident Tracey O’Haggarty, who signed up as soon as she heard the good news.

Unlike Whyte, O’Haggarty is a vehicle owner, but like Whyte, she is an avid cyclist.

The car she shares with her partner doesn’t have a bike rack however, and with a young child at home, long bicycle trips haven’t really been an option for them. Now, she plans to throw their bikes on the rack and their little one in the back for rides around North Vancouver, Stanley Park and UBC.",[]

Far from it. Lorena just whips out her smartphone and searches for the closest available Evo car.

It's so easy because the Evo App allows her to find the Evo car nearest to her and reserve it right away. No fighting over the keys with the one she loves and she's ready to go.

“I use Evo at least once a week and sometimes many times in a week,"" she says, happily.

Since Evo launched last spring, the distinctive black and blue cars can be found all around town. “I love them,” says Lorena, who works for a non-profit organization near UBC. She takes Evo to the gym and to go out with her friends.

Evo cars are all Toyota Prius Hybrids which makes for an eco-friendly ride, she points out.

Nicer, quicker and always parking nearby

Avinaash Kapil, a False Creek resident who works for an IT company downtown, also owns a car. He uses Evo to get him to volleyball, soccer and floor hockey games at Urban Rec, an adventure that — more often than not — involves a few drinks after the match.

Evo Car Share members have exclusive access to parking spots almost everywhere in the city, including several near Kits Beach, English Bay, BC Place, and Canada Place.

""It’s easier than cabbing both ways,"" he says. ""It’s much nicer, it’s quicker, you can work on your own time frame, and there’s always parking close to where you want to go.”

Parking at sports games, be it Urban Rec or Kitsilano Beach, is a nightmare and the active 26-year-old says taking advantage of a one way drive with Evo makes the evening so much more relaxing and fun.

It's a cost-saving miracle, says Avinaash, who uses it more frequently when the price of gas is high. His cab use has been cut in half since Evo launched in 2015.

A great option for families

Sonia Sanghera, a busy mother of two, uses Evo as her family's second vehicle. She says it's a big cost-saver for her family.

Her husband takes the car to work, so she uses Evo to pick up her kids from school and for shopping, cultural outings and adventure.

""My daughter and I took Evo to Granville Island last week to watch a play,"" she says, ""and I just took it this morning to my classes in Olympic Village.""

Car sharing is a hidden secret for enjoying all the benefits of a second car without the cost of owning one.

Sonia feels safe with her kids in the car, because all Evo's fleet come fitted with seven airbags, antilock brakes and traction control.

As an added bonus, her six-year-old daughter thinks Evo is the grooviest thing since sliced bread with its keyless ignition and tap entry.

""I took her to Disney on Ice in an Evo car,"" says Sonia. ""She loves it.""

He's got his own wheels, too, but he chooses Evo on weekends when he's hitting bars on Granville Street or having a few beers after a softball game. The best part, he says, is having the option to park the car, and walk away from it, free to see what the evening brings.

Lorena, Avinaash, Sonia, and Joe say the best part about Evo Car Share is that it allows them to take full advantage of all that Vancouver has to offer. That's one sweet deal.

59,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/cognitive-dissonance-lng-bc-pursues-climate-goals,Cognitive dissonance on LNG as B.C. pursues climate goals,"['More Tracey Saxby', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct', 'Apr']",,"I never intended to become an activist.

As a marine scientist, climate change has been a big focus of my career over the last 16 years. I’ve worked with governments on their climate plans, people in Louisiana that have seen their way of life disappear under rising seas, and vulnerable Pacific Island Nations that are scrambling to ensure their communities are more resilient to the devastating impacts of climate change.

But over the last five years I’ve also picked up a megaphone to lead thousands of people in a climate uprising.

Why? Because the Canadian government is failing us.

While the rest of the world has been fawning over PM Justin Trudeau, or tweeting about what socks he’s wearing, our Prime Minister has blithely allocated billions of taxpayer money to buy and twin the Trans Mountain pipeline to prop up the Canadian tar sands.

Meanwhile, the provincial government in British Columbia (B.C.) has been recklessly encouraging the development of a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry, which experts say will create more greenhouse gases than coal due to leaking methane from fracking, and delay the transition to renewables.

The recent IPCC report warns us that we have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe. Scientists have made an urgent call to limit global warming to 1.5°C that will require “rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.""

Right now, Canada’s policies have us on track for a catastrophic 5°C increase.

The climate plan released by the B.C. government last week is a little ray of hope, with tangible policies to reduce carbon pollution and incentivize renewables, and an accountability mechanism to ensure we get there.

But the proposed 18.9 Mt of greenhouse gas reductions still fall 25 percent short of achieving our legislated 2030 target of 25.4 Mt to meet the Paris Agreement.

And to achieve the new emissions target outlined by the recent IPCC report, we need to reduce B.C.’s emissions by 27.9 Mt by 2030 (45 percent below 2010 levels). That means the shortfall between B.C’s climate plan and where we need to get to according to the IPCC is now a total of 9 Mt.

Luckily, there is a simple solution: projected emissions from the two approved LNG projects in British Columbia (Woodfibre LNG and LNG Canada) are 9.1 Mt annually. We need to pull the plug on LNG.

We simply cannot build new fossil fuel infrastructure when we’re facing a climate crisis. The tax breaks and subsidies that have already been granted to this fledgling LNG industry by both the provincial and federal governments are irresponsible and illogical.

We need to acknowledge the cognitive dissonance of our governments: while we work to reduce our emissions, our Provincial and Federal governments continue to approve new emission intensive projects like LNG. Makes total sense, right?

As B.C.’s Environment Minister, George Heyman, heads to the climate talks in Poland, ask him about B.C.’s dirty little secret: LNG.

It’s time to turn our collective megaphones up to eleven.",[]

Tragically, in 2018, this remains as urgent a cause as any.

According to the United Nations (UN), globally 1 in 3 women and girls experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. While that number is disturbingly high, many researchers suggest that this is an underestimate due to the almost-certainly high prevalence of unreported instances.

Here in Canada, women experience violence at a higher rate than men. And Indigenous women in this country experience nearly three times the rate of violence as their non-Indigenous counterparts. Indigenous women continue to be murdered or go missing at an unconscionable rate with—despite increased awareness—no resolution to the crisis.

Family violence

Violence takes on many forms and is perpetrated by different actors. The UN estimates that about half of all female homicides are at the hands of intimate partners or other family members. In Canada, a quarter of all reported violence is domestic, with the overwhelming majority being against women and girls.

The pervasiveness of domestic violence is in part explained by its cyclical pattern. There is an established relationship between witnessing violence as a child and becoming a perpetrator as an adult. A trend that is very difficult to break.

Gender-based violence and conflict

Outside the home, women and girls remain vulnerable in settings of conflict and colonization.

In war zones, rape has become a commonplace tactic in war. While conflict and rape have been synonymous since time in memoriam, UN observers note that while rape was once viewed—however horrifically—as a spoil of war, it has now transformed into a strategy, a kind of sadistic fusion of physical and psychological torture aimed to shred the very social fabric required to weave together communities.",[]
61,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/opinion-upstream-and-downstream-health-impacts-kinder-morgan-pipeline-are-not-worth-risk,Opinion: Upstream and downstream health impacts of the Kinder Morgan Pipeline are not worth the risk,"['More Amy Lubik', 'Apr', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct']",,"The risk assessment submitted by the proponents of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion (TMX) is woefully inadequate, especially regarding human health risks.

Consideration of climate change was prohibited by the National Energy Board (NEB) even though it directly increases risk to the project from wildfire and flooding. Many health professionals share the public’s concern about the cumulative health consequences of the TMX, from point of extraction to burning the product and are asking, it is worth the risk?

In Alberta, First Nations communities close to the oil sands, are facing toxic releases to their air and water. Higher rare cancer rates in First Nations have been reported, and while these studies are small, the level of uncertainly about the health impacts to already impoverished communities calls into question whether the national interest to expand oil sands production trumps these health concerns due to potentially harmful air and water pollution.

Along the pipeline route communities are concerned about the violence that can occur related to resource extraction.

The Secwpemc Women Warrior Society has vowed to oppose the TMX for many reasons, including the fact that construction brings with it “Man Camps”, where mostly non-indigenous male workers come to indigenous communities, and incidents of sexual harassment, violence, including rape and assault, escalate.

Emergency shelter workers in Calgary report that domestic violence increases during both the boom and the bust cycles of resource extraction. Adding to the public shame of this, Amnesty International has called for a national inquiry into the violence against women that corresponds with resource development in Canada.

A risk of pipeline rupture is present along the route. The health impacts of most diluted bitumen blends that the TMX is expected to carry are understudied; however, reports have shown increased incidents of leukemia in areas where there are high levels of benzene pollution, a component of diluted bitumen. Could a dilbit spill on a hot summer day in still weather conditions in Burnaby-Vancouver produce unacceptable risk?

Reports produced by the Burnaby Fire Department and by Simon Fraser University (SFU) raise concern about potential health impacts of the expansion project for the community on and around Burnaby Mountain and the campus.

The proposed increase in density of storage tanks on the side of Burnaby Mountain increases the risk of ignition of highly flammable diluted bitumen. Storage tanks are spaced as they are currently to allow fire fighters access if there were a fire, with minimal risk of flames spreading to other tanks. Densification of tanks would likely result in emergency crews having to let a tank burn, while protecting others from ignition. Fires may spread to the SFU community, which is relatively isolated, with only one road adjacent to the tank farm for the evacuation of over 25,000 people.

Regarding national economic interest economist Robyn Allan found that stoppages in oil production are not due to lack of pipeline capacity, but low oil prices, and as economies like China move to phase out internal combustion engine cars, these prices are unlikely to rebound.

Having a stable job is a key determinant of health, and if the fossil fuel industry cannot sustain current employment levels, the government should be investing in programs to retrain fossil fuel industry workers to work in the renewable energy and other technology sectors.

Climate change looms large in decisions about local energy projects. When Canadians consider national interest, we must also consider communities already ravaged by climate change. Villages in the Northwest Territories are losing homes due to permafrost melt, towns surrounded by drying forest are waiting for the next large fire, and communities seeking long-term, clean water are at increased flooding risk. This will negatively impact our collective health and cost our economy billions.

If Canada is really attempting to cut emissions by 30% by 2030 as we pledged in the 2015 Paris accord then as the United Nations climate panel recommends, we cannot keep expanding fossil fuel infrastructure. This is our ethical commitment to future generations.

By stopping this large fossil-energy project, Canada can put the health of its people and the planet first in the national interest.",[]
62,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/letter-editor-thank-you-premier-horgan-standing-bcs-coast,"Letter to editor: Thank you, Premier Horgan, for standing up for B.C.'s coast","[""More Readers' Letters"", 'Feb', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct']",,"Dear John Horgan and George Heyman;

First and foremost I would like to express our sincere appreciation for standing up for our coastline, rivers and lakes that support a vast and sustainable economy of which sport fishing is a huge contributor. One that provides a meaningful and rewarding career for many in B.C.

My name is Brian Mack. I work in the sport fishing tourism industry in Southwest British Columbia and hope that this way of life can be available for our children. Currently, it is being threatened by the proposed plan to ship toxic diluted bitumen over many of our pristine wild salmon rivers and along our coast. I started our company(Silversides Fishing) back in 1996. What we have been doing since then is allowing tourists from all over the world to enjoy some of the finest sport fishing in the world. Our clientele purposefully travel to Vancouver or the Fraser River Valley to catch salmon and giant white sturgeon or enjoy fly fishing too for trout, salmon and steelhead. Many of them come from Europe, the U.S. and every province in Canada including Alberta. This place is famous, and for good reason.

We have very serious concerns and fears about the future of our jobs and health of our waterway posed by a pipeline that is going to pump extremely toxic diluted bitumen (dilbit) over tributaries of the Fraser river including the Fraser itself. Dilbit destroys fish and their ecosystem. It cannot be cleaned up. What happened on the Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010 should be cause for serious concern.

And then the dilbit will travel by tankers that must navigate a most sensitive and risky route putting our coast at severe risk of disaster. Just check out what recently happened in the China Sea where a ‘safe’ double hulled tanker crashed into another ship, exploded and sank, spilling 1 million barrels of toxic condensate oil into the sea. The area is preparing for a marine catastrophe that threatens a vast food fishery.

Our concerns about leaking pipelines are justified by historical patterns in North America of pipeline safety or rather lack of safety. As we see it, a devastating pipeline spill is a 100 per cent certainty. For that reason alone we must stand up to a project that will bring colossal economic, social and food security harm to our province. There is no price that can compensate for such foolishness. Even my teen daughter, who gets to inherit a world dictated by our decisions, is very concerned.

A sham approval process was key to green lighting Trans Mountain. Trudeau admitted last week to selling out B.C. as a tradeoff in a recent exclusive interview with the National Observer.

The claim of Canada having a ‘world class oil spill response’ is a joke. It does not exist and never will. At best, only five to ten per cent of oil spills have ever been recovered.

The NEB approval process is at best a complete sham, akin to a kangaroo court system designed to fail justice itself. The NEB blatantly ignored science, DFO concerns, First Nations consultation and rights, Kinder Morgan’s pipeline safety record and many more key elements. Keep in mind the NEB is composed of some former oil-industry members who have never disapproved a project.

If certain Albertans think that we have to play Russian roulette with our coastline and freshwater resources that generate over a billion dollars and employ over 100,000 people, then something isn’t quite right. Certainly the recent Twitter hashtag #KeepCanadaWorking is more suited for B.C., as our tourism economy is far more valuable to the ‘national interest’ than environmental destruction.

And the further trampling of First Nations legal rights is not in the national interest of most Canadians either.

I believe that many Albertans won’t want to destroy the very resource that they use for their own pleasure. Many of B.C.’s sport fish bookings are from Albertans wanting to catch the fish of their life, right here in the Fraser Valley or coastal waters.

I think the bigger question is: since when does the oil industry get to trump B.C.’s constitutional right to protect our way of life, our jobs, especially one that is well established? Perhaps Alberta Premier Notley should question who she really serves because it doesn’t sound to us like the ‘national interest of Canada’.

We will continue to support our B.C. coastline, wild rivers, world class fishing and the rights of our children to continue to enjoy what many of us grew up with. Therefore, we support the decisions of John Horgan, George Heyman and certainly Andrew Weaver who is a key element in this.

Thank you.

As the province announced an investigation into B.C.’s 2017 wildfires, I came across this year’s Vancouver Mountain Film Festival (VMFF) grant winners, a B.C. duo who completed the first ever summer traverse of the Purcells by foot.

The fires, and ensuing backcountry closure, impacted their trip. I set up an interview with Steve Tersmette to ask if, in such a remote place, there is a different perspective on how we outdoor bums are, and will be increasingly affected by natural disasters.

Your trip was impacted by this summer's wildfires. You travelled through South East British Columbia's highly remote territory, including thick B.C. alder extensive stretches. Many scientists say climate change increases the scope of natural disasters. What is your view on how climate change impacts and will continue to impact our passion for the outdoors and our backyard?

There's no denying things are changing fast in this world. Obviously the wildfire season this year was unprecedented and escalated to the point where officials were forced to close the backcountry.

If scenarios like this become the norm, I'm sure we'll see many more of these types of closures in the future. I think the most evident area in which we observed the impacts of climate change were with the glaciers. As we were navigating with topo maps, it was obvious to us in a few instances as we crested over terrain expecting to see a glacier only to find that it was a kilometer or two away (Toby Glacier and Vowell Glacier were the most glaring examples).

What parallel do you see between life in the outdoors and in “real life”, to show the importance of experiencing the outdoors and what we learn there?

We live in a town of 7,000 people. Many people in town including Shawn and myself, have chosen a life away from the city primarily to be close to the mountains. There is a huge trend to outdoor recreating right now including hiking, climbing, mountaineering, camping and skiing (to name a few). We're fortunate in B.C. that anyone can go out and experience the mountains.

Some activities don't require a lot of skill or commitment while others require extensive training and knowledge with respects to safety and proficiency. The biggest challenge with more and more people experiencing the mountains is to minimize the impact to fragile alpine environments.

I think the most important thing that people can do first is to educate themselves on Leave No Trace principles and backcountry ethics. While it's important for people to get outside and enjoy and experience this world, we have to do it sustainably. When you compound the effects of climate change, sustainable use of our backcountry will become increasingly important.

Overall, what did your trip make you realize about environment protection?

We had an opportunity to cross a huge expanse of wilderness and terrain on this trip, including the entire north to south length of the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park as well as Bugaboo Provincial Park.

It's easy to come back from a trip like this and want to draw a bunch of lines around things. I think there are huge opportunities for further conservation, not just in the Purcells, but all over this country. Fully appreciating that we are still a resource based society including forestry and mining, more could and should be done to protect our wild spaces.

The Purcells do have a long history of resource extraction dating back to the mid 1800s and it is important to consider multiple interests including commercial, tourism, resource and government operations. At the end of the day, mother nature can't defend herself and we all need to stand up for her. As the trend grows for outdoor activity, my hope is that it brings increased awareness to these issues and increased conservation efforts.

Steve Tersmette and Shawn Emmett won the 2017 VIMFF MEC adventure grant to make their trip happen. If you also want to see what is at stakes with your own eyes, you can apply for this year's grant until January 12, 2018 and get the chance to complete a dream trip of yours: https://vimff.org/mec-adventure-grant/ You can come and listen to them at VIMFF on February 9-17th.

64,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/why-free-trade-talks-china-failed,Why free trade talks with China failed,"['More Vancouver Observer', 'Dec', 'Oct', 'Jan']",,"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jetted off to Beijing, the media was told to expect the announcement of a free trade agreement, the first of its kind between China and a G7 country.

The first sign that something was amiss was on Monday morning, when Trudeau’s meeting with China’s second-in-command ran late. Then, a planned press conference was hastily scrapped. Instead, Trudeau and the Chinese premier read prepared statements restating their commitment to “exploratory” trade talks.

Without the widely-hyped free trade announcement in hand, any remaining deliverables from Trudeau’s trip to China seem minor in comparison. But Yves Tiberghien, associate professor of political science at UBC and director emeritus of its Institute of Asian Research, cautions that Canada’s global trade position is undergoing unprecedented change. ""Canada is trying to do two things at the same time, and we have to be careful,"" he said in an interview with National Observer. ""The first goal is to diversify our trade footprint. Right now, our trade position is dependent on NAFTA, and that’s not the best place to be with Donald Trump. Nailing down free trade agreements with other significant partners, that is a priority of the very highest order.”

The second goal is to advance the “progressive trade agenda” -- free trade with specific provisions protecting women, workers, indigenous groups, and the environment. Last month, at a meeting of Trans-Pacific Partnership nations in Vietnam, Trudeau refused compromise and no-showed the planned signing ceremony.

It was a move that drew universal condemnation from the global press. “The Canadians screwed everybody,” huffed the Australian delegation. Trudeau “threw a spanner into the talks,” complained the Singaporeans. Japanese officials are still “fuming from the Trump-like no-show in Vietnam,” Tiberghien said. “They’ve even started pushing for a ‘TPP-10’ without Canada.”

Going forward, Trudeau’s challenge is to advance his signature values-based trade agenda without stalling the process of putting pen to paper on a trade deal.

“If we push this literally, in a very in-your-face kind of way, it may threaten diversification, the primary goal” Tiberghien said, citing the TPP fiasco. “But there is room for compromise here, particularly on labour, indigenous rights, and gender. Wages have increased 10 to 20 percent a year. On gender, China’s general trade position is not to take it into account, but they are trying to do something domestically here, too.”

Canada’s domestic politics complicate Trudeau’s task. According to the government’s consultation report, Canadian businesses remain suspicious of China’s dispute resolution system, uneven market access, and human rights abuses. Any free trade agreement would also greatly increase both Canada’s merchandise and service trade deficits with China: in 2015, more than 60% of Canada’s $45.5 billion bilateral trade deficit was made up of electronics and machinery. Despite our resource-based economy, Canada continues to import Chinese metals, mine, and energy products.









In recent years, powered by the growing Chinese tourism industry, Canada has posted modest surpluses in its bilateral services trade.

Repackaging stale deals and selling them is new a staple of foreign trip communications. In a Beijing event that was well-received by Chinese state media, Trudeau highlighted the 2018 China-Canada Year of Tourism, a program which was announced two years ago. The “exploratory talks” both sides recommitted to had started in 2016, when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Ottawa.

“At the end of the day, it is pretty unusual to have the PM to travel for minor agreements,” Tiberghien said. “Usually, you would send a minister. But there is also an agreement on climate change, full of interesting points and potential cooperation.”

The agreement facilitates the Paris Climate Accord’s implementation by creating bilateral cooperation mechanisms like an emission reduction partnership between Natural Resources Canada and China’s national energy administration.

With Trudeau back in Canada, Tiberghien says that the success or failure of his trip can only be measured when the other parts of Canada’s trade strategy pan out.

“If, in the long term, Canada and China start free trade negotiations and the deal is of higher quality, everybody will forget the fact that there was a delay,” Tiberghien said. “It is striking, though, that in a single month, China is delayed, NAFTA is deadlocked, and Canada nearly stalled the TPP. In Asia, a country the size of Canada can’t afford to play last-minute hardball. You have to follow due process. One Trump is enough.”

65,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/canada-and-climate-change-are-sustainable-cities-rich,Canada and climate change: Are sustainable cities for the rich?,"['More David Champagne', 'Nov', 'Dec', 'Oct']",,"Canada is slumping into an unresolved crisis. To housing affordability, household debt, job precariousness and income inequality, we add climate change.

Earlier this month, the United Nation's annual climate conference (COPP23) ended yet again, with insufficient Canadian commitment. An auspicious position, as a few days earlier 15,000 scientists worldwide issued the “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice,” an urgent warning to world leaders to avoid global climate disaster.

Yet, if Ottawa and the provinces fail to answer these challenges, then who will?

For many, “sustainable city” policies are the solution. Two hundred and forty seven cities are part of the Partners for Climate Protection (PCP) city-network, many of them mobilize sustainable city policies.

However, evidence suggests that despite their vision to ensure equitable urban spaces, inequalities continue to thrive. Is Canada producing green cities for the educated, the rich, and the employable? Cities that exclude the poor?

As part of my academic work, I investigated green city policies from Canada’s 33 metropolitan areas. What does it all come down to in term of equity?

At the outset, cities wield these policies as an adaptive strategy to globalized economy and to climate change rather than as a stand for equity. They tend to leave unabated two key inequalities: income and housing. Thus, they risk creating by default cities for the well-off.

However, according to a recent study by economist Francis Fong, it is mostly in four of Canada’s largest cities that income inequality reaches a critical level today: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.

Thus, sustainable city policies do not bear the same implications throughout Canada.

According to the United Nations, sustainability would ensure a development that meets “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”

Adding to climate change mitigation, these policies also target community well-being, poverty, homelessness and social marginalization.

As it turns out however, cities did not adopt these policies chiefly for their equity aims.

On the one hand, the lack of political, economic and legal powers of municipalities led them to this compromise between an environmental and equitable economy. On the other, cities understandably wish to maintain their economic prosperity.

Thus, they privilege economic growth above all else. This recipe tends to exacerbate inequality. At least, that is so through the current federal and provincial economic policies.

Calgary’s policy for instance states they wish to build an economy that attracts not only new citizens and visitors but also businesses. Likewise, climate change itself holds unexpected commercial opportunities in many cities’ view: for industry, commerce, insurance, energy, water management and emergency situations.

For a green economy, cities compete to attract and develop innovative businesses. The “green economy” is knowledge-based, creative and ensures the protection of the environment, but does not allow much room for equity.

In addition, cities do not hold the legal powers of Ottawa or of the provinces. This is one of the factors why they only marginally involve certain key equity issues such as income and housing. The bases for an equitable network of sustainable cities across the country are thus uncertain.

Despise these constraints, many attempt to improve housing, via affordable, social housing projects or via the regulation of residential zoning. Moncton, for instance, stresses an efficient mix of affordability and quality housing types. But legal limits weigh heavy in the balance.

Earlier last week, newly elected mayor of Montreal Valérie Plante asked the provincial level to grant the city additional legal powers to tax foreign buyers and shun risks of a housing bubble.",[]

Kinder Morgan, the pipeline company that put it there, patted itself on the back for its “innovative” use of the deterrent mats, which prevent salmon from digging nests in the streambed to spawn. Of course, the only problem is it didn’t have permission to install them.

But the company went ahead with its plans, although it had not met its conditions, to start construction without the necessary permits. This reckless behaviour is shocking from a company asking for the public’s trust.

On Sept. 8 the National Energy Board (NEB) sent a letter to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) asking for confirmation that this work, among other measures, would require authorization under the Fisheries Act. It noted Kinder Morgan’s plans, “could constitute serious harm.”

Kinder Morgan posted photos of Swift Creek lined with orange plastic even though DFO had not yet responded. If anybody else had gone into a major salmon-bearing stream and interfered with fish spawning, there would be absolute hell to pay. Violations of the Fisheries Actoften carry tens of thousands of dollars in fines but so far there’s been no penalty at all.

Are we supposed to just trust that Kinder Morgan knows what it’s doing? With dwindling salmon runs and starving killer whales, the company wants to use untested methods to prevent spawning in 26 streams along its pipeline route.

Thankfully, those plans were foiled by a concerned citizen, at least for now. Lynn Perrin, an Abbotsford resident and a director of PIPE UP, found the blog and complained to the NEB that Kinder Morgan had started construction without having met its conditions.

That led to a stern letter from the NEB ordering the company not to put any more mats down. But it did not require them to pull out the five which were already in place.

Now Kinder Morgan has asked the regulator to let its fumble slide, a classic tactic of begging forgiveness rather than asking permission. After thumbing its nose at the law by starting construction early and potentially violating the Fisheries Act, the company expects special treatment.

How entitled does a foreign corporation have to be to assume it can get away with this? Maybe the NEB used to take an “ask and it shall be granted” attitude to pipeline companies, but after years of outcry and scandal, the regulator is trying to prove it’s not in bed with industry. It cannot possibly allow Kinder Morgan to carry on as if it hadn’t just taken upon itself to waltz into critical salmon habitats and interrupt spawning.

Making an exception when the NEB failed to catch this activity in the first place would show how little has changed at the board. It’s not up to the public to discover that the company has started construction. That raises serious questions as to whether the regulator has the capacity to enforce its own conditions.

Why are these salmon deterrent mats even under consideration? There’s already a way to prevent damage to spawning salmon and their habitat, and it’s being used in elsewhere along the route. Kinder Morgan has the technology to drill underneath such critical streams — they’re just too cheap to use it.

Instead, company biologists have concocted this harebrained scheme with snow fencing to avoid having to work within windows of least risk to fish and therefore meet their aggressive construction schedule.

Already the company is whining the delays may interfere and even making threats to the NEB that it will have to harm fish if it doesn’t get its way. That’s obviously unacceptable and the NEB can refuse to allow it.

It’s only a few weeks into this company’s expansion plans and they’re already displaying a blatant disregard for the law of the land. Either Kinder Morgan is too incompetent to follow the rules or it just doesn’t care. Neither inspires much trust from the communities its pipeline puts at risk.

67,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/whos-who-candidates-running-vancouver-school-board-election,A who's who of the candidates running in the Vancouver School Board by-election,"['More Patti Bacchus', 'Sep', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct', 'Patti Bacchus']",,"Nominations close today (September 8) in the race to see who will take the nine trustee seats in the Vancouver School Board (VSB) by-election.

By my count there are 17 candidates so far vying for the spots to serve a one-year term — until the October 2018 elections.

I know a thing or two about running for school board after running successfully in three elections and serving eight years as a trustee. I know most of the candidates in the race this time, but not all of them. Here’s my totally biased rundown on what I’m seeing so far, in alphabetical order.

The candidates

Joy Alexander (Vision Vancouver). First elected in 2014, when she got the second highest number of votes despite being her first run for public office, Alexander is an experienced educator and psychologist with a depth of knowledge about how students learn and what they need to succeed. I had the pleasure of serving with Joy for two years and learned a great deal from her and appreciated her expertise and advice on complex education issues. She is analytical and can quickly get to the heart of an issue and consistently puts students first when it comes to setting priorities.

Fraser Ballantyne (Non-Partisan Association). This will be Ballantyne’s third run for the board after being elected in 2011, when he squeaked in at ninth place and again in 2014. Ballantyne has a reputation for being hot tempered at the board table and once shouted “shut up” at a public board meeting. He ran on a pledge to stop school closures in 2014 yet frequently criticized Vision trustees for not closing schools. He served as chair for five months. I’m trying to think of a cause he championed or an idea he brought to the table, but as far as I recall his sole cause had to do with how many metres marijuana dispensaries could be from schools.

Carrie Bercic (One City). Bercic is a long-time public education advocate who has a better attendance record at public VSB meetings than some trustees did. She knows the issues well and she’s well known in the district. Bercic called the firing of the previous board “the most shocking thing” she’d seen in 18 years as a public education advocate. She’s been involved in a group that advocates for school libraries along with other parent groups. I’ve known Carrie for several years and I believe she’d make a strong school trustee who could work across party lines and who would put students at the forefront of her decision making.

Ken Clement (Vision Vancouver). The first time I ran for the VSB (2008) I was lucky to run alongside Clement. He was elected twice — in 2008 and 2011 — and came tenth in 2014, just missing a seat on the board. As the first Aboriginal candidate to be elected in Vancouver, Clement worked to improve opportunities and outcomes for Aboriginal students. He played a key role in establishing the district’s Aboriginal Focus School and graduation rates for Aboriginal students steadily improved with Clement’s leadership. He also chaired the VSB committee that developed and steered the district’s progressive, ground-breaking sexual orientation and gender identity policy revisions in 2014 that drew international media coverage. A member of the Ktunaxa First Nation and a residential school survivor, Clement’s leadership and commitment to social justice are much needed as the VSB fulfills its commitment to Reconciliation and equitable learning opportunities for all students.

Diana Day (COPE). Day is COPE’s sole by-election candidate — which is surprising given COPE’s historical commitment to public education and the VSB. I was inspired to run the first time after seeing what a difference COPE trustees’ advocacy made for students. I’ve known and liked Day for almost a decade. She’s served on the executive of the district parent advisory council and has a solid record in community and social work. The COPE website describes her as “an Indigenous First Nations from the Oneida Nation, one of the members of the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy” and says she’s passionate about social justice issues for all students in the VSB, and in particular advocates for successful culturally safe learning environments for vulnerable youth.",[]
68,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/post-secondary-policies-tackling-poverty-reduction,Post-secondary policies tackling poverty reduction,"['More George Davison', 'Sep', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct', 'Patti Bacchus']",,"British Columbia continues to be the country’s only province without a formal poverty reduction strategy. And while that’s not something we can take pride in, we do have a handful of brand-new post-secondary policies that will have a significant impact on low-income earners, former youth-in-care, single parents, Indigenous and new Canadians.

The provincial government has implemented four new measures in the nick of time—in the month before the first day of school. It’s worth noting that none of these measures is new or groundbreaking.

Two of these policies used to exist but were axed by the former government, and the other two have been doing cartwheels in-and-around the Legislature for years.

Yet none of that really matters today; what’s important is that each one is here this September, and will play a role in poverty reduction for real people, who are trying to better their lives through advanced education.

It’s refreshing to witness public policy that supports students and our post-secondary system. These new measures are effectively opening doors to future job opportunities and career growth and, ultimately, they will benefit the province, socially and economically.

Affordable and accessible post-secondary training is undeniably good.

The B.C. government has been saying for a few years that 80 percent of future jobs will require some form of post-secondary training.

Study after study confirms that people with higher levels of education tend to have more stable employment and earn more than their lesser educated peers. They are also more likely to report to have good health and overall well-being.

Let’s look at each new policy to breakdown what impact it will have:

Policy #1: Tuition-free post-secondary for former youth-in-care. I know of very few kids, who at 19-years-old, have the necessary social and financial supports in place to become fully independent young adults, funding their housing, food, transportation and education past high school. Yet, that’s what was expected of the 700 kids who age out of the foster care system each year—until now.

Seventy percent of youth who have been in government care say they plan to continue their education after high school, but last year only 150 (or 21%) did so at fewer than half of the province’s post-secondary institutions.

The previous waivers were funded out of the institutions’ own resources. However, as of this week, these kids have one less barrier to pursuing that desired post-secondary training as all 25 of BC’s public colleges and universities are part of the province-wide, tuition-waiver program.

Policy #2: Tuition-free Adult Basic Education. These courses are the equivalent of high school upgrading for people who have never graduated, or for those who did graduate but were missing certain courses, or if more than five years have passed since they completed them.

As an example, requirements for many students who are looking to enter the healthcare field might include upgrading high school biology and chemistry before they can apply to certain programs.

Policy #3: Tuition-free courses for English language learners. These courses are the building blocks that English language learners need to incorporate successfully into society. Language proficiency makes day-to-day activities easier and it opens opportunities for personal, social and professional growth.

And it’s not just basic English—programs are tailored to foreign-trained engineers and healthcare professionals, among others.

I anticipate enrollment in ELL and Adult Basic Education courses will rebound this school year, reversing a 36 percent drop in the three years since when tuition (as high as $1,600 per semester) was imposed. Thousands of students will benefit from these policy changes.

Policy #4. A reduction in student loan rates. The average student debt in B.C. is $35,000 after a four-year program, making repayment on the principle, let alone the interest, rather monumental.

Since August 1, interest rates on student loans are held at prime (currently set at 2.95 percent), down from prime plus 2.5 percent. This measure effectively halves the accumulation of interest rates, which should help to lower the burden of student debt for learners across the province.

Graduates should be able to pay off their debt faster and, as a result, end up paying less in total. The government has promised to eliminate interest on all student loans, and introduce a completion grant of $1,000, benefiting tens of thousands of former B.C. students.

My opinion is that B.C. is off to an excellent start this school year, because:

● Former youth-in-care have tuition waived across the province should they opt to pursue post-secondary.

● Low-income earners and people who want to retrain can start on their path to high school upgrading, without the barrier of tuition.

● English Language Learners are getting the building blocks they need to communicate with others in their communities, and seek or better their employment.

● New graduates won’t be saddled with excessively high interest rates on debt they’ll already require decades to pay off.

This September, there are four fewer obstacles for students in B.C. who want to continue with post-secondary training—and I’m definitely proud of that.",[]
69,vancouverobserver,https://www.vancouverobserver.com/opinion/teachers-say-new-ndp-government-needs-clean-bcs-offshore-school-program-here-s-how,Teachers say new NDP government needs to clean up BC's offshore school program — here’s how,"['More Patti Bacchus', 'Jul', 'Dec', 'Nov', 'Oct', 'Patti Bacchus']",,"John Horgan’s new government is inheriting a lot of messes to clean up and the B.C. Liberals’ controversial offshore schools program is one of them.

After pleading for help from the B.C. government for months through the spring, a group of B.C.-certified teachers who were ordered to leave South Korea, where they worked at a B.C. Ministry of Education-certified offshore school, have some harsh words for the outgoing government and advice for the new one on how to clean up that mess.

The teachers from the former South Korean “Canada B.C. International School” (CBIS) left Korea in May after being ordered out of the country by South Korean immigration officials because they had the wrong visas for the kind of licenses their schools were operating under.

They say they’re trying to “create positive reform” so the offshore program can be successful and ensure teachers and students have stronger protections from owners and operators who don’t follow the rules.

After the teachers were kicked out of the country in May, the B.C. Ministry of Education posted an update on its website in early June saying it’s “placed all B.C. offshore schools in South Korea on probation as a result of the ongoing review of E2 teacher visas by the South Korean immigration department” adding that the South Korean immigration department “has decided to issue departure orders to teachers holding E2 visas from three B.C. offshore schools.”

The ministry is advising teachers not to take jobs at B.C.-certified offshore schools in South Korea until it “completes a review.”

The former CBIS teachers — who were the first group to be told to leave Korea for having the wrong visas — say they’re providing support to teachers who remain there, but are facing orders to leave, by sharing their own experiences, providing them with documents to help them navigate the immigration process, contact information, how to prepare for leaving the country and a messaging service to stay connected with the expelled CBIS teachers.

In an emailed statement, teacher Alexander Hebb alleges the B.C. education ministry knew the CBIS school was operating illegally.

“They had contracted inspectors review that exact license and the inspectors approved a license that did not exist. The ministry was also warned of the illegal operations of CBIS via an anonymous email dated January 27, 2017. The International Education Branch of the B.C. Ministry of Education let our school, teachers, and students fail and did nothing to intervene,” the teachers say in a “statement of fact” Hebb emailed to the Vancouver Observer.

The statement says there are still about 100 B.C.-certified teachers working at B.C. government-certified schools who are also being forced to leave South Korea and who will have that on their record to explain to future employers and when making visa requests.

“These teachers are essentially ambassadors of Canada along with fulfilling their teaching duties.They deal directly with the families that have searched out a Canadian education. Teachers are offered no protections or voices in the offshore school systems.

“Even bigger, this issue affects thousands of these families and students from South Korea that are potential future international students and immigrants to Canada. These are wealthy citizens who were ready to invest a part of their lives and their education in Canada. Now they’ve lost a chunk of their academic school year, and could have a soured view of B.C. or Canadian Education and of Canada itself for failing to intervene and allowing this illegal school and its shady operations to exist.

“These are human beings - kids - who have been hurt and have lost out on an education.

“This level of incompetence is astounding. All of this could have been prevented if the school owners, the B.C. ministry, and Korean Immigration were proactive or worked together, “ the statement says.",[]

From April 28th to May 9th nearly two million British Columbians took to the polls to give expression to their deep concerns relative to the previous sixteen years of a BC Liberal majority rule. Clearly, Sixty percent of those British Columbians have overwhelmingly voted for change.

Six years of a heavy-handed Clark majority government has left British Columbians deeply mired in an overwhelming debt, subsequent to a litany of highly outdated, unfeasible and environmentally destructive mega projects, including the Site C Dam, the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion Project and the fading market-dead LNG pipe dream.

British Columbia’s economy has become reliant on an industry propped up by a temporary and transient workforce precariously perched on archaic notions requiring the complete destruction of our pristine air, land, and waters, and on an industry which runs rough-shod over the democratic and human rights of Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike.

British Columbians demand a different way of governing and have called for a dramatic shift from protecting foreign corporate interests to ensuring the health, safety, well-being and the long-term, sustainable livelihoods of our families and communities.

The Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) calls on the newly elected government of BC to enact the change British Columbians have called for. More specifically, we call on the government of BC to immediately implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, to enact the 94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and to begin to implement the principles and provisions of the Supreme Court of Canada’s ruling in Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia.

The Province’s piecemeal approach of agreement making with First Nations across BC can no longer stand in place of recognizing Indigenous peoples’ Inherent Title, Rights, jurisdiction and especially First Nations’ right to consent.

We must immediately begin to make significant changes to strengthen the BC Environmental Assessment process by disposing of the problematic and dangerous MOU between the BC Environmental Assessment Office and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency allowing BC to substitute its EA process for projects where both provincial and federal EAs are required, and to promote the wellbeing of communities across BC.

First Nations have called for significant engagement that is both genuine and meaningful.

Further, we must work together to address the destructive policies and practices permeating the state of child and family care in BC. A new BC government must not only provide safe healthy environments for children but must ensure future opportunities for their growth and development, to do so we must address the funding and resourcing shortfalls of First Nations education and health care services throughout the province.

Homelessness and affordable housing must also become immediate priorities of the new government. BC must also take significant movement to address and effectively end the devastating opioid crises gripping numerous BC communities.

The new BC government must make great strides to rebuild the trust of British Columbians and to protect the future of our environment and our communities.

Three new films this week weren’t available to preview but a batch of Academy Award nominees were. Including all the shorts. They’re showing at the Van City Theatre and will help if you’re getting into an Oscar pool.

Meanwhile note these other events:

This year’s Rendez-vous French Film Festival starts Wednesday and runs for about two weeks. The thirty or so films being shown are from France and Quebec and include award winners, crowd pleasers and favorite stars. There are three films with 11-time Cesar nominee Fabrice Luchini and one film with Jean-Louis Trintignant, Anouk Aimée and Monica Bellucci directed by Claude Lelouch. To learn more visit http://www.rendez-vousvancouver.com/

And tomorrow the VanCity Theatre also kicks off its annual series of films for Black History month. They start with the wonderful Spider-Man film Into the Spider Verse (11:45 am). There’ll be a panel of local artists to talk afterwards including Pearl Low, who worked on one of the Oscar nominees that I write about below. The next films will be on Monday: Harriet and Boyz in the Hood. For more info visit https://viff.org

Today’s reviews:

Corpus Christi: 4 stars

Oscar Shorts Live Action: 4 ½ (aggregate)

Oscar Shorts Documentaries: 4 (aggregate)

Oscar Shorts Animated: 3 ½ (aggregate)

Gretel & Hansel: --

The Rhythm Section:--

Rabid: --

CORPUS CHRISTI: That core belief of the Catholic Church has multiple facets in this superb film from Poland. Events lead up to the annual feast day of the same name. The sacrament is performed in several masses in the film. And a young man metaphorically joins with the body of Christ in the story. Remarkably, it’s not a somber, religious tale but a cleverly-told fable apparently based on a true story. Now it’s one of the five nominees for the Oscar in the international category (formerly known as “foreign language”). It’s a very engaging film.

Daniel, who we first meet (and see roughed up) in a juvenile detention centre wants to be priest. He’s barred from any seminary but is sent to a small town to work in a sawmill. That doesn’t appeal to him and in town he claims to be a priest thereby getting an invitation to fill in just one time for the real priest who’s asleep drunk. That’s extended and his unconventional style and charisma in celebrating mass and hearing confession prove popular with the townspeople. So, how long before he’s found out and how will it happen? That’s one story line. A second involves a feud that’s divided the town after a tragic road accident. What can he do about that? There’s more than one way to do good, is said early in the film and demonstrated through the rest. It’s moral in its own way and also cheeky by asking what good are confession and priestly celibacy anyway? (VanCity Theatre) 4 out of 5

OSCAR SHORTS (LIVE ACTION): Of the three categories this is the best. There’s not a dud among these five films and a couple are supremely powerful.

BROTHERHOOD: The director, Meryam Joobeur lives in Montreal and filmed this highly engrossing tale back in Tunisia where she was born. Among her revelations: Family and personal honor are paramount. The title recalls both a key Islamic precept and the Muslim Brotherhood. And some people in Tunisia, including her central character, have red hair and freckles.

The story is set on a sheep farm where a young man has just returned from Syria where he went to join ISIS. He’s brought his pregnant wife and gradually we learn a complex backstory. The Arab Spring aroused a wave of idealism. The son’s participation estranged him from his dad; his wife’s experience was dreadful. The family has a struggle ahead to accept them. All that is told in just 25 minutes. Two festivals ago at TIFF it won the award for best Canadian short film.

NEFTA FOOTBALL CLUB: Also set in Tunisia, but a French co-production this time, it’s a lighthearted episode with the best comedy pay-off in the series. Two brothers argue the soccer talents of Messi or Mahrez while searching for some lost goats. They find a donkey carrying bags of drugs.

The younger thinks it’s laundry detergent; the older knows what it is and has plans to sell it. Things don’t work out as he expects, in very funny way.",[]

The Rio theatre is showing all four Mad Max movies tomorrow back to back. It’s a marathon to raise money to help with relief after the destructive bushfires in Australia. Doors open at 3:30 and first film starts an hour later. There’ll be door prizes, trivia, a 50/50 draw and a costume contest. Incidentally, that’s on the eve of Australia’s national Day. There’s more info at http://riotheatre.ca/

Over at International Village, the Japanese anime film Weathering With You, which arrived with little fanfare last week, is doing so well, often selling out, that’s it’s being moved into the theatre’s largest auditorium. Makes up for the first show last week that had to be cancelled. Somebody had to go tell a full-house that technical difficulties were the reason. Human error was the real cause but probably not mentioned. People weren’t happy considering the frightful weather they had to endure to get there.

And this week we have:

Les Misérables: 4 stars

The Gentlemen: 3

Nomad: In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin: 4

Cunningham: 3 ½

The Last Full Measure: 3 ½

Color Out of Space: 2 ½

The Turning: not previewed

LES MISÉRABLES: No, not the Victor Hugo novel or the musical, but quite related anyway. It takes place in the same Montfermeil suburb of Paris but in modern time and as one character says, “Things haven’t changed.” This riveting film gives a full picture of what he means: the poverty, the bustling street life, the sketchy people who wield influence and the little details of how people survive there. There’s a collection of immigrant groups. The Muslim Brotherhood has stopped the drug trade but prostitution, run by Nigerians, is growing. A self-styled “mayor” rules but a shawarma shop operator is the moral authority. Director, Ladj Ly, originally from Mali, depicts the neighborhood, where he’s lived for years, as a powder keg.

What sets it off seems improbable, but he says it actually happened. A boy steals a lion cub from a circus. A group of gypsies waving baseball bats demand it be brought back and a trio of plain-clothed police have to find it, or else. They do, but accidentally ignite an uprising, and a debate. What’s the use in rioting, one character says. In 2005 all it produced was burnt-out cars and smashed bus shelters. “What if voicing anger was the only way to be heard?” is the answer that comes much later. It’s a logical result of the casual racism and harassment by police, the ethnic competition and the angry-at-the-world teenagers we’ve been watching. The film is as vibrant as any Hollywood product and has an Academy Award nomination. (International Village) 4 out of 5

THE GENTLEMEN: With Aladdin and King Arthur done and gone, Guy Ritchie returns to his best field of play: England’s classy (or not) criminal underworld. It’s on an upscale level this time, although the language is surprisingly rough. A name for a female body part has all but replaced another popular word containing the letter “u”. That indicates clearly what you’re in for, in tone anyway. There’s a very engrossing story around it but try and make sense of it. That’s hard to do, though in general it plays out with great style and fun.

Most of it is told in flashbacks by Hugh Grant as a skuzzy private investigator sent by a tabloid newspaper editor to get the goods on an American (Matthew McConaughey) who has built a thriving marijuana growing operation on the estates of cash-strapped nobles. He tells what he knows to an associate (Charlie Hunnam) hoping to extract some blackmail money. McConaughey meanwhile is trying to get out of the business and is negotiating with two potential buyers, a rich Jewish-American (Jeremy Strong) and a Chinese gangster (Henry Golding). A group of teenage athletes almost scuttle the deal and their boxing coach (Colin Farrell) has to get involved. A noble’s daughter has to be rescued from a junkie pad and later some Russian oligarchs show up too. See, how complicated it gets? It’s brisk and even at times witty though and Michelle Dockery, over from Downton Abbey, adds some glamour as a classy wife. (5th Avenue, Scotiabank, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres) 3 out of 5

NOMAD: IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BRUCE CHATWIN: Werner Herzog delivers a lovely tribute to his friend the travel writer who died over 30 years ago and through it reveals that they were kindred spirits. Chatwin mourned the loss of nomadic cultures and searched for the origin of objects he saw in museums. Herzog has made films on every continent and with a clip from them here and there demonstrates how similar the two men were.",[]

Many were unsure whether the Vancouver fans would brave the unusually cold and snowy conditions but I was pleasantly surprised to see many come out and support Half Moon Run's 2020 Tour. The theatre more than 90 percent full was packed with eager fans excited to see the Montreal's Indie Rock Band perform. The band recently released their third album titled ""A Blemish In The Great Light"". They did not disappoint, playing half of their latest album and many of their older hits too. Their latest album sees a transition to more of a rich indie folk sound, which don't get me wrong sounds great but it is an escape from the band's original sound that I fell in love with. They are dubbed as psychedelic indie rock, the word critics and fans alike come back to when describing the band’s music is “complex”. There are many resemblances to one of my favourite bands radiohead. If you haven't had an opportunity to see them perform live, please do, they are an absolute treat in person and will not disappoint. Catch them on the rest of their 2020 world tour.

Frozen II only got a song nomination although it has just hit a major milestone. It is now the biggest-earning animated film ever. And Adam Sandler wasn’t mentioned all although he’s been getting great notices for his acting in Uncut Gems. Both films are in my notes below.

And while on awards, think of the Vancouver film The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open. It’s been nominated in many competitions and won in eight, including Toronto, Montreal, online and in Vancouver (both the film festival and the film critics circle). If you haven’t seen it, you can, Tuesday night at the Rio, or, for free, as part of the film festival’s campus screening program.

And for this week, we have:

Bad Boys for Life: 3 stars

Uncut Gems: 2 ½

Clemency: 3

Weathering With You: 3 ½

Dolittle: 2

Frozen II sing along

BAD BOYS FOR LIFE: Seventeen years since we last saw these two bickering Miami drug cops (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) they’re back in a third film and facing a different world (somewhat). They’re older; one is now a grandfather and thinking of retiring. Will, though, is gung ho to keep on fighting the bad guys. Their methods, tough and brutal, may just be obsolete compared to the high tech ways of the new young crime fighters with their computers. Those two debates infuse the film but remain underdeveloped alongside the hyper car, motorcycle and helicopter chases, the crashes and explosions and the elaborate shootouts.

I haven’t seen a film as gun happy as this one in quite a while. It’s as if Michael Bay is still in charge, and not just in it, in a cameo as a wedding MC. The new directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah from Belgium have taken on his love of carnage and excess and found a level somewhat midway to his range. It’s speedy and fun, if you want it. The story has our buddy cops targeted in revenge for killing a Mexican drug lord. The guy’s wife orders her son to go and pay them back in a particular way. A story twist eventually explains why, and though it’s an interesting add-on it also feels like a stretch because we’ve had no hint before about what is really a major backstory. Notice two very welcome additions: Paola Núñez, as the new-style team leader and Vancouver actor Alexander Ludwig as the techie in the group. Meanwhile, the turn to religion by Martin’s character (he promised God to forsake violence) is discharged easily. Will hands him a giant gun and says it’s “a gift from God.” A gift to the fans, I’d say. (Scotiabank, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres) 3 out of 5

UNCUT GEMS: Adam Sandler has been getting wide praise for his acting in this film and that’s fine. He does create a distinctive character. But he didn’t get a widely predicated Oscar nomination this week, possibly because the film is thoroughly unpleasant. The first sight we get of him is a camera shot up his colon (hopefully of a stunt double). That level of gross isn’t sustained visually but it is in the dialogue. A popular word used as an intensifier is heard in every line, sometimes two, three or four times in the same sentence. Most these are shouted at full volume, often with two or more characters yelling things at the same time. It’s completely annoying, though the filmmakers, the Safdie brothers, Benny and Josh, may think it’s edgy.

Sandler plays a jeweler in New York’s diamond district. He’s got a gambling problem and is in debt to a Jewish mob and in trouble with both his wife and his mistress. One big score could pull him back out and an unrefined rock from Ethiopia bearing a giant opal could bring it. He puts it up for auction, urges a rapper (Toronto’s The Weeknd) and a basketball player (the NBA’s Kevin Garnett) to bid on it and tries to manipulate the bidding up to get what he needs and what he thinks it’s worth. But he’s both a risk taker and a screw-up, so there’s suspense and you’re drawn in. The story hurtles along and even with a pause for a well-staged seder to mark Passover it’s a shrill and exhausting experience. Beware. (VanCity) 2 ½ out of 5

But if you’re really interested you might wander over Saturday afternoon also for the last film that won Sandler so many kudos: Punch-Drunk Love, from 2002, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. This is part of the Van City Theatre’s film studies program and will be introduced by Steven Malcic of SFU’s School of Communication.

CLEMENCY: You can praise this deliberation on capital punishment for its unusual vantage point and at the same time lament its shortcomings. Here, it’s not just the victim and his family who suffer; it’s also the prison warden who supervises the executions. As Alfre Woodard plays her she suffers psychological scars that give her bad dreams and disintegrate her marriage. She’s “an empty shell of a wife,” says her husband. “I do a damned good job,” she insists to justify continuing her work even as doubts build up. The assistant warden, the attending priest and a defense lawyer are all ready to quit, so worn down are they by the emotional toil.",[]

1917: Simply one of the best war movies ever made. It’s tense, action-filled and heroic but entirely on a personal level, thanks in part to a technique that some have called a conceit but actually pulls you along relentlessly and puts you right into the action. Two British soldiers in World War One have to make their way through the trenches, across bombed-out no man’s land and through shattered towns and farms to warn a brigade commander to call off an attack because the Germans have an ambush planned. It’s a potential suicide mission and we’re with them as they avoid booby traps and a dive-bombing plane, survive a collapsing tunnel, jump into a swollen river and make their way past human bodies and rats.

The film presents all this in what looks like one continuous sequence, no edits apparently (though not really). It took months of rehearsal, a new small camera, expert cinematography by a master, Roger Deakins, and precise direction by Sam Mendes to achieve that. It’s not a gimmick. It’s immersive. You really do feel what it must have been like to go through war perils like these. Mendes is telling real stories he heard from his grandfather and he’s showing them from the viewpoint of two regular blokes. George MacKay plays a corporal already sick of war and Dean-Charles Chapman (known from “Game of Thrones”) is the still-eager younger one. Officers, played by big names like Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch, are merely cameos. The focus is squarely on the heroic contributions of ordinary soldiers. It’s not only a thrill ride; it’s an act of respect. (Scotiabank, Park, Marine Gateway and suburban theatres) 4 ½ out of 5

JUST MERCY: There are people (I was talking to one just the other day) who are tired of all these films we’ve been getting from the U.S. about legal injustices to blacks. I say while the problem goes on, the films should too. This one is a true story and quotes a startling statistic: one of every nine prisoners who die by capital punishment, have been wrongly convicted. Many of those are black and that’s a leftover from slavery. The film is not subtle in making points like that by dramatizing a case in Alabama back in 1987.

Jamie Foxx plays a man on death row for the murder an 18-year-old girl. Problem is: he wasn’t anywhere nearby the day of the killing and the “eye-witness” couldn’t be right in identifying him. But try to get the authorities to re-think the speedy conviction. Michael B. Jordan plays the lawyer who tries, Bryan Stevenson, who came from up north as an intern to work with The Southern Prisoners Defense Committee. This is just one of over 100 cases he’s worked on; it was even featured on 60 Minutes. The film has exactly what you’d expect—abusive cops, no-sympathy sheriffs, angry citizens—but a few surprises too. The points it makes are obvious but so are the facts. “You’re guilty from the moment you’re born,” Foxx says in one of his scenes. Fine acting by the two leads, and Brie Larson and Tim Blake Nelson in support, and strong direction by Destin Daniel Cretton elevate this film. It’s about a crusading lawyer, but more about exposing the issues. (International Village and suburban theatres) 3 ½ out of 5

UNDERWATER: It’s something of a mystery. How could a story with so much promise become a movie this boring? I think it’s because the director, William Eubank, and his writers aren’t bothering to speak to us.They’re so wrapped up in putting in visions of technology that they don’t make it mean much to us, and in fact leave us at sea and uninvolved the whole way. There are also a couple of environmental comments in some vague hope of making this film mean something. It doesn’t though, since they’re unexplored.

Kirsten Stewart is the star, seriously out of the depths she’s found in her recent films, as a science officer in a deep ocean drilling facility. (“We shouldn’t be down here,” says another character). There’s a leak in the ceiling, clunks and bangs hitting from the outside and a hallway collapse. Kirsten, plus a worker pulled out from under some concrete chunks (T.J. Miller), a tough captain (Vincent Cassel) and others put on giant suits like spacemen wear to walk the ocean floor to a giant drill. How that will save them we’re not told, but it hardly matters because a giant creature that looks like a cross between an octopus and a squid with very sharp teeth shows up. The film turns into a survival epic (though there’s not much surviving going on). It’s all murky rather than exciting, and surprisingly short of suspense. 20th Century Fox made it three years ago and let it sit. Disney, which bought the company, is clearing out the overmatter.
