Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

“A District of Sechelt resident was observed impersonating a bylaw officer and issuing fake parking tickets over the weekend,” a July 13 post on the district’s Facebook page said. “The fake ticket is a photocopy of a bylaw infraction warning, which would never be issued with a fine.”

The district said one of its staff members was on the receiving end of one of the fake tickets and reported it immediately. The person responsible has “been spoken to [and] has agreed to not impersonate a bylaw officer or obstruct bylaw officers.”

The district is advising people that if they get a bylaw violation notice or ticket and aren’t sure if it’s legit to contact the bylaw enforcement office at 604-740-8480.

This isn’t the first time fake parking tickets have shown up on windshields in Sechelt.

In late 2018 several people reported returning to their vehicles to find a ticket for $142 from “Sunshine Coast Parking Authority.”

RCMP at first thought it could be a scam because the ticket gave a website people could go to make payment, but it was later confirmed to be a prank.

The offences on those tickets included the usual parking violations and obviously fake ones like “Thinking only of yourself/laziness” and “Not keeping a safe level of blinker fluid.”",[]

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Over the last couple of weeks, daily numbers have sometimes been in the single digits. But over the last three days, since Friday, there have been an average of 20 to 21 new cases per day: 62 in total since Friday.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.”

He is currently serving 4.5 years, minus time already served for possession drugs, including fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking.

article continues below

The Squamish Chief wrote about Noel's charges and conviction, so we were interested in what he had to say for himself now, while behind bars.

When we spoke with him, Noel was in a room in Mountain Institution, a medium-security facility in the Fraser Valley where he is serving part of his sentence. A corrections officer dialed the phone and handed it to Noel, then he was left alone to speak with us.

What follows is a version of that conversation edited for length and clarity.

Q: Your issue was dealing drugs. There is an opioid crisis and people are dying. Do you think about that?

A: When I was into drugs, that is all you think about — getting drugs.

You are desensitized to all that. Now that I look back, it is not only the deaths, but it is also destroying families. Putting people in jail. It destroys lives all the way around. It destroys communities. It is bad stuff.

I was too deep in it. But now I look back at it and I understand.

Q: Some people are likely going to give us heck for talking to you. The argument would be why talk to you, given what you did and being in prison. What do you say to that?

A: I would say alcohol and drugs — I have been into them deep. And crack cocaine, I did that from 2003 to 2010.

Even when I restarted doing drugs I was doing meth.

Once you are stuck in that cycle, it is so hard to get out.

With the drugs, you will mess up your family. The drug is so strong that it destroys lives.

I am done.

I was clean for six years. I know I can do it.

The only way I made my way out the first time is to find God.

I messed up again, but I know that I have reconnected with God again and I know when I get out, I will be good with it.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about Mountain Institution and what it is like there for you?

A: It is a 120-man unit.

You eat in the cafeteria. You get yard-time four times a day, for one hour each time. But right now because of COVID-19, we are only getting one yard a day.

Basically, we stay on the units the whole day.

Q: What was it like to be in there and the pandemic sweeping the globe? Were you aware of it when it first started?

A: Yes. We aren't allowed to get newspapers, but we saw it on the news. The gym is closed, we couldn't get any visitors. I didn't get sick.

Q: Can you tell me about how you came to Squamish and when?

A: I came from Quebec. I was in Whistler in 1995 and moved to Squamish in 1996.

It was cheaper in Squamish. I was only 21 and I was working construction and after a few months, one of my friends said he lived in Squamish and was going to travel.

I stayed at his place until I found a place of my own.

Q: And you worked mostly construction?

A: We were doing drilling and blasting back then for a contractor.

I worked doing some salt masonry.

Then I worked running an excavator and loader for a landscaping company.

Q: Obviously, something in your life went sideways, given where you are. What is your perspective on that?

A: My emotions got the best of me. I had gotten married and it went sideways.

Q: Do you struggle with drugs?

A: I did.

Q: Why do you think that happens?

A: I think a lot of people have trouble dealing with their emotions.

I got out of jail in 2012 and I was clean for six years and a productive member of society and then in 2016 when my marriage when sideways, I went ""Frick It!"" and I threw everything away. I thought I would party for a weekend, but I ended up going back to the way I had been living.

Q: What was your upbringing like with drugs and stuff like that?

A: My parents are not drug addicts. My dad was a weekend drinker, had two companies, was a hard worker.

I wasn't raised in that kind of environment. I was raised well.

Q: Do you think there is enough support in the Sea to Sky for people who want to manage their substance use?

A: I think it is pretty good. There's people like Lisa Young at Sea to Sky Community Services, if people need help, they are good.

And there is harm reduction and people to talk to.

I think there is some good help, but when somebody is not ready, they are just not ready.

But I will tell you one thing, I am ready now.

Q: There is talk of the decriminalization of drugs, say as Portugal has done. What do you think of that? More harm reduction and less criminal prosecution, would you like to see that?

A: I am an extremist. Some people can be functioning addicts, but no. I couldn't do it. I don't know if it would be that good, personally. I would still be an extremist.

Q: Does prison give you the chance to reflect on why you hurt yourself in this way?

A: Yes. The federal system has good programs. I did the three-month program. If you really wanted, you can do a trade in here too.

Q: When you get out, what do you want for yourself?

A: I still have until 2022, I am going to a drug rehabilitation house for a few months. Then I can have a job. I will be in a halfway house after that.

When I am working, I hope to put money away and rent a place, get to have weekends there, slowly.

Q: If you picture your best future, what would it be?

A: I am going to be drug-free. I think I want to get into car detailing and slowly maybe sell cars and maybe get a dealer's license. Or maybe even mobile car detailing?

Q: What are you looking forward to the first day you are out?

A: Dairy Queen, coffee and donuts.

Q: Anything else you would like people to know?

A: I would like them to know that once people are on drugs, it changes them. That is not the real person. That is the drug that you are seeing. It is sad. If someone you know is struggling with drugs, maybe take them to the gym or for a hike. Help him slowly to get better. For myself, if I would have gone to the gym and saw some gains and would have been happier with myself, that might have changed things. When you are on drugs you become unhappy and depressed.

Q: There's a lot of writing and understanding now about how addictions are linked to trauma. So the addiction is a symptom of something else?

A: Yes, I would say so. Trauma, mental health issues. And some people also hurt their backs, end up getting prescribed medication and then end up on street drugs.

Q: Why did you agree to do this interview?

A: I don't know. I just wanted to be helpful.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

“There were a lot of different factors involved,” said manager Heather Miller. “And then COVID just kind of came along and took things sideways and made it impossible to plan or to resolve some of the other issues that we face.”

The lease was expiring, putting further pressure on coming to a decision said Miller.

Murray and Janice Skeels started Artisan Office in the late ‘90s across the street from its current location and Margaret Miller bought the business in 2013. Heather took over managing Artisan Office a year ago.

The business today encompasses delivery services, office services and a community-wide newsletter (the Bulletin).

Faxing (a number of items still need to be faxed these days noted Miller) and scanning documents and being Bowen’s FedEx retailer were among Artisan Office’s unique services. It would also take documents to in-town accountants and lawyers, bring in bank deposits and whatever else. “So that people…can have their life on Bowen,” said Miller. “They don’t have to give up a day’s work on Bowen to go into town to take care of business.”

Miller said she’s going to miss Artisan Office life.

The union wants governments and employers to ensure their jobs are protected, that there is a safe way back to work and that there is income support for the duration of the crisis.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

Coroner Paul Dionne says 32-year-old Ihor Horbanov died of multiple trauma on March 11, 2019, after his car hit the pothole near Contrecoeur, Que., and crashed behind a Transport Department truck.

In his report published in April, Dionne notes the segment of Autoroute 30 where the accident occurred was known to be problematic.

Dionne also says emergency repairs were conducted on that stretch of road three days prior to the fatal incident.

He notes, however, the department has since taken steps to repair the highway and to review the way potholes are identified and fixed.

Dionne says Horbanov's car was otherwise in good condition and he had not consumed any alcohol when he skidded off the road while driving with his family.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

“I love it because I get to know more,” says Pauline. “I’m a curious person so I get to find out this interesting stuff about people and then come down to what is the essence and what they want to celebrate and then write a song about it.”

While this is a new chapter for Pauline, it also comes with making peace that she’s no longer––as she describes it––the “Energizer bunny.”

Following the publication of her 2017 book, Whale in the Door, and the surrounding commitments of touring, Pauline was left burnt out and she has had some health issues over the past couple of years. But her recent living situation change has reinvigorated her creativity.

“So I start every morning.. I sit down and write a poem about old age,” says Pauline.

“I’m calling it ‘Let me tell you something about old age’ And some of them are really funny…some of them are not funny and they’re just facing…lack of future. What that means to a person.

“Or less future I guess.”

But it’s the future Pauline’s preparing for. She had considered moving off-island but after a bout of bronchitis over the holidays and a constant stream of soup from friends, she realized that her community is here and resolved to stay.

“That’s why I need to make money, so I can stay here because it’s expensive to live here,” she says. “If I live to be 80 I can just live off my savings. But, that’s four years from now. If I’m like my dad and live to be 94, I’m in deep doo doo.”

With a few customers already lined up, Pauline bounces in her chair as she discusses her projects––rather like the Energizer bunny.

The Undercurrent got in touch with owner Casey Kennedy to find out what the business is all about.

What is The Watering Can Supply?

article continues below

A refill and sustainable supply store with an emphasis on local Canadian products.

Why do you find it important to sell sustainable products and from mostly Canadian suppliers?

Now more than ever we need to look at our consumption practices and how they serve us, our environment and the world. By choosing sustainable and local products, we are able to give directly back to our communities. I believe people are ready to make greener choices for their families but accessibility can sometimes get in the way. One of my goals in creating The Watering Can Supply is to help make the change easier for people. By choosing eco-friendly products, we’re supporting our families, investing in our health and truly caring for our environment.

What do you refill?

The list keeps growing each week! We have a lot of cleaning and personal hygiene refills. This includes dish detergent, dish soap, laundry detergent, all-purpose cleaner, stain remover, shampoo and conditioner, deodorant, toothpaste, dental floss, soap, cosmetic oils, floral waters, and lots more. We also carry other sustainable items that are not refillable but are definitely compostable or minimal waste. Things like bamboo toothbrushes, produce bags, baby wipes, cutlery and refillable candles.

What was your inspiration for opening the store?

It’s personally very important to me to lower my environmental impact, support Canadian companies and support others in leading more sustainable lives. That coupled with a huge leap of faith and a supportive community led me to create The Watering Can Supply.

Why on Bowen?

Community-based living has always been a huge part of my life and I couldn’t imagine creating the store anywhere else. I love that The Watering Can Supply has allowed me to offer a much-needed service to the community but also provided me with an opportunity to support our neighbours and friends in choosing eco-friendly products.

What has the local response been?

The support I’ve received has been beyond amazing. I cannot put into words how grateful I am for the amount of love, support, and curiosity I have received. From excitement and congratulations to product suggestions to a friendly hello, it’s truly been a warm welcome.

The Watering Can Supply is open Tuesday to Thursday 3 to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 to 4 p.m. It’s located at #102 - 555 Prometheus Place.",[]

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

article continues below

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

article continues below

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos. When this band sings ""We Strike Back,"" you'd best believe it, in the most literal sense.",[]
43,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/usa-today-navarro-s-anti-fauci-column-didn-t-meet-standards-1.24171362,USA Today: Navarro's anti-Fauci column didn't meet standards,['David Bauder'],,"NEW YORK — USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

[Editor’s note: the Undercurrent hasn’t actually received reports of backyard mini-putt championships but would dearly like pictures if they’re happening.]

The Bowen public can once again book tee times but with strict rules for COVID protection:

Hours are Wednesday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Thursday, Friday, Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed Monday, Tuesday for maintenance).

Reservations must be made online and green fees pre-purchased.

Twosomes or singles only and six-foot distance must be maintained always.

Tee times are at 15-minute intervals (again, a max. of two per tee time).

Show up within 15 minutes of tee-time, not early, as the previous golfers must be teed off before you enter the parking lot.

No playing without reservations.

The pro shop, range, practice greens, vending machines and washroom are closed. No garbage cans either.

No rentals of any kind (though you can buy balls online and they’ll be waiting for you at tee-time).

No flags (a sign is posted each morning of where the holes have been cut on the greens in lieu of a flag) and ball cups are upside down (so balls rest near the surface). No rakes, ball washers, flags or garbage cans at the golf course and the washrooms are closed too.

No bunker rakes or ball washers and players must dispose of their own broken tees at home.

No alcohol allowed.

Leave a car’s width between cars when parking.

And don’t go if you’re showing COVID-19 symptoms or have travelled in the last two weeks.

Golf courses across the lower mainland are reopening with similar measures in place.

Pro Shop manager Les Meszaros says that the Bowen course been running a two-week test of these measures with members, which has been a success. With the limited tee times and hours, capacity’s been at 90 to a hundred per cent and golfers have self-enforced the rules.

Cups in the holes are inverted so the balls don't drop far.

“People took it seriously,” said Meszaros. “They understood what we’re trying to do.”

Golfers noted that with so few people on the course (eight in an hour) it’s like having your own private golf course, Meszaros relayed. While some have asked about raising the number of people allowed in a tee time, Meszaros said they’re taking it slow and going with what they know works.

“Could we have more people on here? Probably, but I’m in no hurry,” said Meszaros. “We’ll get to the right time with the right number of people.”

Meszaros said that Vancouver Coastal Health approved golf course operations under their current COVID rules.

Whereas there’s usually a golf course staff of eight to 10 people, it’s been just the superintendent Frank Griffiths and Meszaros running the course, working seven days a week. However, Meszaros did get funding to hire a couple of students for the summer season––a season that’s sure to look different from any before it. Golf tournaments are cancelled and the clubhouse shuttered for now.

“We just adapt and adjust and try to figure out how we keep working,” said Meszaros.

Also to note, the course is opening to islanders only. “This isn’t about tourism,” said Meszaros. “This is about providing an outlet for people to do something in a really nice, safe way.”",[]

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Team Canada was electric all weekend, beating three of the top-four ranked teams in the world as 74,560 fans packed BC Place for the annual event.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

The Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. The Ultraman World Championship. The Boston Marathon. Just to name a few.

Smallwood lives in California and combines travel and racing. With the world at his doorstep, Smallwood will be returning to Bowen Island to participate in the third annual SwimBowen event this summer. We asked, “Why Bowen?”

article continues below

“I have two basic criteria that I look for in races,” Smallwood shared. “One is the challenge of the race and the competition and the other is the experience. It’s meeting and connecting with other people and making more friends.

“SwimBowen fits perfectly into my lifestyle,” he said. “It’s an event I will continue to do every year as long as it’s offered.”

For Smallwood, the differences between SwimBowen and other perhaps more renowned events are striking. Bowen is “very much a family feeling environment” he said.

“It’s very welcoming, fully supportive, emotionally, whether you’re a beginning swimmer, just there to see if you can make it, or whether you’re a swimmer who is there to try to swim fast and maybe compete to win it. Either one is going to get the same experience, the same benefits from the event.

“I swim well enough to generally be one of the first few summers finishing but I’m standing there at the water’s edge cheering on and helping every swimmer I can come in. And pretty much everyone is doing that.”

More than the camaraderie, Smallwood appreciates the connections he’s made to both Bowen and its residents. “One can go to any given event, you can compete, and the memory of that might last a few days, a few weeks. But when you can go someplace, meet people, and make friends. Friends can last forever.

“[From Bowen] you get something that can last your whole life as opposed to a t-shirt or a medal that might sit in a drawer or a box and never be seen again.”

Compared to other races, SwimBowen is a small event but as Smallwood points out it is attracting people from other countries. “I think it’s would be worthwhile for anyone on Bowen Island if they had the morning or afternoon free to come by and take in the event. When you have 100 people all trying to encourage each other to complete this thing, it’s very contagious.”

“It would also be equally enjoyable if you were there just to watch the race. You can watch an ice hockey, football, basketball, or soccer game on television––you don’t get anywhere near the enjoyment out of it as coming down and watching an event like this,” he aid. “It’s like being able to have front row seats and sitting with the athletes in a competitive event. And you go do that right on Bowen Island.”

Does Smallwood have any advice for those who might be thinking of participating? “If someone’s thinking about participating they should get water safe. If they feel they can safely and comfortably swim for 20 minutes they can do the short course.”

Oh yeah, did we mention, Smallwood just turned 65. “There is no better health insurance, anywhere, anyhow,” he said. “The best health insurance anyone can have is staying active. That doesn’t mean having to be the fastest or the strongest. It just means use your body. Get out and do something. Go for a walk, hike. Swimming is a fantastic exercise.

The 17-year-old islander was one of 20 players (four from B.C.) selected for the Canada’s Women’s Under-20 National Team, Canada Soccer announced last week.

The team, with former women’s national team player Rhian Wilson as head coach, is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic this week for the Concacaf Women’s Under-20 Championships. The tournament runs Feb. 22 to March 8 with Canada opening the tournament with a Feb. 22 game against El Salvador. They also have round-robin games against Guatemala (Feb 24) and Jamaica (Feb 26) before the knockout round. The final is March 8.

The top two teams will advance to the 2020 FIFA Women’s Under-20 World Cup in Costa Rica and Panama in August. Canada will likely have to beat the U.S. or Mexico for one of the two open Concacaf spots.

As Molly was born in 2002, and will turn 18 during the tournament, she is also eligible for the 2022 Under-20 World Cup cycle.

Molly was five when she started playing for Bowen Island Football Club. Her father Morgan and Burns Jennings were her early coaches.

“Bowen Island FC gave me the opportunity to discover and pursue my love of soccer. The commitment of the players and coaches to develop one another was remarkable,” said Molly. “I love that I come from a community and club like Bowen island.”

After seven seasons with BIFC, she moved onto the BC Soccer Premier League’s Mountain United and then went onto the provincial program. She played at every age level until joining the full-time Vancouver Whitecaps Girls Elite Super REX program in 2017. Always dedicated, Molly had to change high schools and billet with families in Surrey and Burnaby to continue on her path.

The chef was raised behind a deli counter (his mother ran Springfield Meats and Sausage in Kelowna) and grew up foraging with his mother. So perhaps his path was inevitable.

Matheson is one of three men behind Orbaek Farm to Table Takeaway & Meats. Along with head chef Jak Hedley and salumist (maker of charcuterie and sausages) Dylan Ricci, Matheson operates the food lounge at Meadowbrook Corner. (Orbaek is not a restaurant as it’s on provincially designated agricultural land reserve and therefore under certain restrictions).

Last June, Orbaek opened as a reservation-only, word-of-mouth dining lounge for groups of between eight and 25 people. “We were going to build the brand from there,” said Matheson, “And then COVID happens.”

The hours-long sit-down Scandanavian-style meals of last year didn’t suit the COVID environment so Orbaek pivoted to Japanese-Danish fusion take-out. “Which is bizarre to think about,” said Matheson. “But it actually works really well because they’re two very similar cuisines when you look at the aesthetic of the food.”

“The two cuisines, the two aesthetics of the people, how they live their lives, how they set the table, how they view food, how they view family…the Danes and the Japanese have a lot of similarities,” said Matheson. “For us, it was just a natural combination.”

The team also wanted to make sure that Orbaek’s new model would suit whatever’s to follow with COVID-19. “We thought about that for a while and were like, ‘Hey, let’s just do some fun food really easily.’

“Quickly prepared… but it’s all fresh made.”

One can either order from Orbaek online or in person at the Grafton Rd. property.

“Our ideas to give people a lot of options so they don’t have to go to the cove if they just want to grab a few things for dinner,” said Matheson.

There’s the fresh menu with five different rice bowls and three salads (including an octopus seaweed salad), there are sourdough breads from a rotation of local bakers, broths and “comforting Danish-style” desserts (which are Matheson’s specialty). There’s a selection of meats from Ricci, which in the right season includes lamb raised on the property.

“We’re just going to develop the menu as it goes along,” explained Matheson.

Most of the greens are grown on the Meadowbrook property or sourced from local farms. “It’s as local as it can get,” said Matheson. “It’s very farm to table.”

Also featured (when in season) are wild mushrooms and wild strawberries.

“I was raised in a very traditional Danish household so food was such a big deal and foraging wild goods,” said Matheson. (Matheson was out in a chanterelle patch with his young daughter when we chatted.) “It’s just part of my lifestyle,” he said. “And then I just work it into putting stuff on the menu.”

“Orbaek” Matheson’s Danish clan––a name that dates back to the 10th century. It’s also a long-standing family tradition to name businesses Orbaek. Matheson’s grandfather Ove Orbaek Larsen was a well-known furniture maker in Vancouver in the 1950s.His shop on Hastings Street? Orbaek Designs.

“It’s very much my homage to my heritage,” said Matheson. “I was taking the whole history of everything and just presenting it in a culinary way and giving people a taste of what my upbringing was.”

In that vein, the lounge space features family heirlooms, paintings from Matheson’s grandfather and dishware from Denmark.

Accompanying his Danish upbringing, Matheson was classically trained as a chef and has for years also run Vine & Garden Catering (which he started as a project in school. “It was a passion project,” he said. “It was my romanticism of what I wanted to do with food.”)

With the three partners, Matheson and Hedley work the weekends (desserts and salads are Matheson’s domain and the rest is Hedley’s) and Ricci prepares the meats during the week. “It’s just magical what we actually created here,” said Matheson. “Jak is very much the art of the projects, I guess I would be the romanticist…Dylan has the mastery of the meats.”

Orbaek also just became one of a handful of non-deli or meat producers in Metro Vancouver to hold a charcuterie ticket said Matheson.

As for what the future holds, later this summer there could be opportunity for more dining for little groups on the patio and for future years, this isn’t the last of what’s to come on Meadowbrook Corner.

Hours are noon to 7 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

The messaging starts before people visit the island. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has recommended tourists call ahead before visiting towns to make sure they’re welcoming visitors (some aren’t) and what the protocols are. On the COVID-19 alerts and updates page of the tourism website is a note that BC Ferries and several island businesses request or require masks and when people email Tourism Bowen Island about visiting the island, they’re reminded of that fact said Jody Lorenz of Tourism Bowen Island.

On the ground in Snug Cove, “When we’re talking to people, we’re wearing a mask so we’re modeling the protocol,” said Lorenz. They have hand sanitizer at the centre and signs up about distancing. When they do a group talk, they make sure people are well spaced apart, said Lorenz. “So it’s definitely different. We have to approach things slightly differently.”

“We’re very much trying to make sure that people are aware that, as Dr. Henry says, when you travel, you take your travel manners with you that you abide by what you’ve been doing at home when you go elsewhere,” she said.

The staff are trying to stay on top of local businesses’ hours and protocols and share that with visitors said Lorenz (though sometimes these can change quickly.) Often people are coming to the island for its outdoor options so the tourism office shares short walk options as well as longer treks such as up Mt. Gardner. “Our nature experience is the big draw,” said Lorenz.

While it’s early days, the visitor centre only opened June 27, Lorenz said the island is getting visitors. “We are finding that with the nice weather, as it has always been,…people are coming. “They want to get out of dodge and go get some fresh air. So Bowen, we’ve got that kind of nice little escape for people to come here.”

However, numbers may be down from the average July weekends of the past. “I have not looked at what was last year,” said Lorenz. “But just looking, to me it is down.

“Will that continue? I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going to happen.”

“It’s always weather dependent,” she noted.

“COVID has made so many people very nervous and in many ways, rightly so,” said Lorenz. “I do want to make sure that residents are aware that we are taking our role as helping to promote COVID health safety [seriously].

“I really want to make sure that we do what we can with the people that we talk to,” she said, noting that they don’t talk to every visitor. “The people that we’re generally seeing are aware and we’re just trying to reinforce that.”",[]

During these challenging times we might not be able to gather together in-person for the annual volunteers’ tea but thanks to the voice of the local newspaper and social media and the sponsorship of the Community School Association (CSA) we are still able to recognize people and organizations that make a positive difference in the community by distributing the BICS Volunteer of the Year Award and the Community Spirit Awards (formerly ACEbc awards) and sharing the stories of how the recipients have been making our community a better place.

The Community Spirit Awards for 2020 recipients have been announced:

The recipient of this year’s Youth Leadership Award is in grade four. Eden Currah has been volunteering at community events, most notably at the Bowen Farmers’ market, Applefest and Bowfest for more than three years. She shows up just to help out however she can. She is an enthusiastic and responsible member of the BICS Student Council, as well as exemplifying the pillars of Order of BICS. She has a keen interest in the arts and has set up an informal fine arts apprenticeship, as well as a keen interest in fitness; proposing and leading various physical literacy opportunities for her peers. As a well-rounded, keen, curious and contributing youth, Eden deserves recognition for her community spirit and youth leadership!

Eden Currah received a youth leadership award. - Submitted

Whales. Anchovies. Understanding the waters of Howe Sound. Mapping. Investigating. Videoing. Educating. Sharing. Caring and promoting understanding of our environment, from our social and cultural environment to the science of our ecology. The man with the video camera, the kayak, wet suit, endless curiosity and the big heart is Bob Turner who has spent many years writing about, creating films, books, essays and mapping our environment on many levels. Bob shares his passion through education at the community school, from the BICS Welcome Pole documentary film, to endlessly being a resource about geology and ecology to students on field trips and in-class talks, as well as at the community level. He has contributed so much, we wish we could give him an award every year!

“We’d like to paint a whale. A really big whale.” BICS collaborated with Squamish host nation elders and held its first Kulelakum ‘Whale Day’ in 2012 to celebrate and deepen our understanding of yew yews, (orca whales,) and to learn about and celebrate the importance of whales through First Nations culture and traditions, science, local history, geography, and ecology.

Sara Bryant received a BICS volunteer of the year award. - Submitted

In 2013, to deepen our understanding of how we are all part of a bigger, interconnected picture that was symbolized by a large whale mosaic that was about 20’ long and 10’ high and comprised of over 300 canvases, each one painted by a BICS student. How are we going to do this? We applied to Opus Art Supplies’ program that supports community projects and when we wanted to make a 50’ x 50’ reusable canvas labyrinth with clay domes, they supported that project too! And when the CSA wanted to create a fundraiser and community-wide youth art show, Opus Art Supplies supported us not once, but twice. Opus Arts Supplies is a recipient of one of this year’s Community Spirit Awards for their enduring support of cultural education in the community school and the community. We have so many ideas, and we couldn’t do it without the generosity of Opus. Thank you for providing the support and material for so many young imaginations at the community school and in the community.

In addition to the Community Spirit Awards, this year’s BICS Volunteer(s) of the Year Award goes to our PAC co-chairs: Sarah Cormier and Sara Bryant, who are stepping down after serving their full terms as Parent Advisory Council co-chairs and are greatly deserving of the award after many years of volunteering on a myriad of traditional and new fundraisers and special events. From the Family Fair, to the Yogathon, parent education talks, card projects, photos with Santa, the Friday Lunch program and more. Sarah and Sara have enthusiastically collaborated and supported the PAC, CSA, BICS students and staff and so we would like to thank them and recognize them for their many contributions to the community and community school.",[]

So she pivoted. Over the course of three days in Toronto, just before heading to Bowen to isolate with her family, Spear recorded her first digital-release EP, Morning & Melancholia. Where there would’ve been studio musicians, there’s just Spear and the producer, engineer and player of steel pedal, guitar and piano Aaron Goldstein.

article continues below

A single from the EP, “If I had Wings,” was released this week while the entire four-song EP is coming out July 31.

Folk with a bit of country and a bit of bluegrass, Spear described her latest endeavour.

Spear grew up on Bowen playing a lot of music with her family. Her mom (Dyan) brought her to bluegrass camp in Sorrento and her dad (Ted) taught her how to play guitar. After high school, Spear moved to Montreal and was quietly playing music until two years ago.

After a bad breakup, Spear decided to put her music out into the world. “It was just a way to work through those feelings,” said Spear. “I was like, ‘I’ve got nothing to lose, I’m just going to start releasing music.’”

After an ex-partner died in a car accident, Spear started writing about that. “It’s just been a way to self soothe and work through things that are going on in my life,” she reflected.

The title of the EP Spear adapted from Sigmund Freud’s 1918 essay “Mourning and melancholia” about the ways people experience grief.

“Grief is such an interesting thing and it changes day to day,” said Spear.

She clarified that the title isn’t to endorse Freud’s larger body of work but rather she used the book to consider her own grief and mourning. “Music, it’s a source of comfort for me,” said Spear. “It’s nice to create a song and then…if it was written in a moment of deep sadness or whatever it was, to move away from that and then come to it anew and experience it in a different way.

“A theme that I talk about in the EP is when someone passes away being the sole keeper of a shared memory and how memory changes.

“When you only have one side of the story, it’s like a great weight and responsibility to get it right and remember it right,” said Spear. “Because our memories are so slippery.""

Spear signed with the American label Secretly Canadian and the Canadian label Royal Mountain and had been all set for the album when COVID disrupted the everyone’s plans.

“This period has been a very interesting time for musicians because people are working with limits,” said Spear. “There’s this idea that if you’re making a big record, then you go somewhere to do it and you use people from L.A. like I’m doing, but that’s not the way that has to be.”

“I think what I’m learning is how many resources I have all around me all the time and how creating a sense of community in music is so important and to work with people that are close to you.”

Now, for the first time in a decade, Spear is back living with her family on Bowen, including her older siblings, Bowen’s filmmaking twins known as the Spear Sisters (who filmed part of the music video for “If I Had Wings.”)

“I look up to my parents and my sisters so much and they are just always working and creating so I guess that fostered this need to make things,” said Spear. “ But I’ve also always had such support from them and the community growing up here.

“I think you have a twisted sense of how you’re doing because everyone’s just so behind you.”

But also on Spear’s mind these days is the style of music she plays as a white musician in Canada. “I’ve been doing a lot of research on the history of bluegrass and country and folk and there’s a lot of Black artists that have been teaching me a lot about the true history and the erasure of Black artists within the genres that I play,” she said. “That’s definitely been on my mind. And something I think that all musicians should consider.”

“It’s made me want to reconsider my position in the industry and make sure that I’m elevating [Black, Indigenous and People of Colour] voices as much as I can,” she said. “Also figuring out systems of oppression within the music industry and understanding how to dismantle them and also paying tribute to the people that shaped the music that I play like Arnold Schulz…the true father of Bluegrass.”

Spear is donating her share of the royalties from “If I had Wings” to the following organizations: Taking What We Need, Vancouver Black Therapy and Advocacy Fund and Black Women in Motion.

The album in L.A. is still in the works for when the situation is safer.",[]

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

Bowen’s latest business owners are not only starting their marriage during a global pandemic but a tourism-based business. So as one might expect, this is a love story.

Angela Saunders and Brendan Robertson opened their e-bike rental company, Bowen eBikes, from their Cates Hill home last week.

“E-bikes was always a thought for us that would make Bowen quite a bit more accessible to anyone,” said Saunders. “That coupled with COVID, as people get concerned about tourists coming back onto Bowen and all the tourists end up getting stuck at the Snug because without a vehicle you’re not really going too far out there.” There was also the bonus that biking can be a socially distanced activity.

Neither has a background in tourism: Saunders works for a tech company that makes software for designing custom prosthetics and orthotics. Robertson runs a small web shop on the island.

But both have a background in cycling: they’re triathletes who’ve competed at multiple world championships, which is where they met.

“We kept missing each other year after year after year,” said Robertson. They’d heard rumours of one another and had at least one friend in common but hadn’t yet crossed paths.

“So many races that we both competed at and never met,” said Saunders.

But after missing one another at world championships three times, they finally met in London in 2013 and exchanged information.

Two years ago the couple moved to Bowen –– “We came over for just a weekend and we were like, ‘Yep, this is where we need to be,” said Saunders.

“We are not in the same shape as we once were but we still enjoy community races here and there,” said Saunders. “Obviously the race season is completely shut down this year so we are just enjoying trying to do our training outside and to make the most of our own backyard.”

Robertson also for a while had a YouTube channel to try to help people get into triathalon and for a time was a triathalon coach at UBC. “I think that whole notion of how to help people get outside and get physical is part of who you are,” Saunders told her new husband, noting that he was being humble in listing his credentials.

While both used to be e-bike skeptics, they have since recanted their no pedal assist stances.

For Saunders it was watching fellow commuters pedaling out to UBC or South Vancouver instead of driving. For Robertson it was jealousy. “As an athlete you can get to be very competitive,” he laughed recalling other people on e-bikes passing his non-motorized but long-training self. “A little bit like, ‘…that’s cheating; that shouldn’t be allowed!’

“Then of course then we get them and we try them out and it’s like, ‘ooh, but I love cheating.

“I love being one of those guys with the e-bikes passing everybody. It feels good in a bad way.”

E-bikes also deal with the post-winter hurdle of getting back on the bike and out training noted Saunders. “It’s just about getting people back outside and in whatever weather conditions and with these bikes you have to pedal to engage,” she said. “You do have to pedal up the hill, you’re just getting that little boost to help you up there.”

“You see families of older generations or younger generations trying to figure out what they would do all together and e-bikes are a great way to normalize that,” said Saunders.

Another bonus for the couple is that it’s a car alternative.

“That’s thing that drew us to cycling in the first place,” said Saunders. “It’s human powered.”

To say that Bowen eBikes is something new in the Saunders and Robertsons’ lives could be an understatement.

It was two weeks ago that Saunders was in London Drugs when she overheard someone say that there was a good price on e-bikes. Sparing a glance at the bikes, she agreed that they were a good price.

A few days later the couple had four bikes and a few days after that they had eight.

Last weekend they had their first group out on the bikes.

“Everyone has been so supportive,” said Saunders. “They’re just like, this is really something that Bowen could use.”

The e-bikes are class one, meaning they have pedal assist, so you have to pedal to enable them, but there’s no throttle. Each is rented out with a charger, lock and pannier.

Customers can come to the couple’s home or Bowen eBikes can also drop-off bikes. But everyone needs to bring a helmet for COVID-19 safety reasons.

As the business is new, Saunders and Robertson are still working out some details such as how to do bike drop-off in the cove.

“The main thing is just to provide a different way for people to be out and social distance too,” said Saunders.

“The nice thing with the e-bikes is you don’t have to have a driver’s license so we can offer it to youths,” she said. They don’t currently have child-sized e-bikes.

“I think it’s evolving a little bit because of what the feedback that we are getting from different people that are renting,” said Robertson.

The bikes aren’t just for tourists noted Robertson, there’s also the potential for locals to rent them.

It was just a few weeks ago that Robertson and Saunders tied the knot at their Bowen home. - Dave and Jennah Park of wearetheparks.co

And the couple has already met the pandemic head on: they’d been set to get married in a big wedding on June 20.

“We had this really grand plan,” said Saunders. But with the virus, they pivoted. Just their immediate family came to the wedding at their home on Cates Hill and they sourced on-island help for event rentals, flowers, food, invitations and music.

“It was so nice to just be in the backyard,” she said. “And then it was so perfect because when we finished the ceremony, we peaked around the corner and a whole bunch of neighbors had gathered to watch.”

“You have to kind of adapt to things as you go along. Not everything is just how you think it would be,” said Saunders. “It’s the same with our wedding and it turned out really great.”

Though that was their wedding, they’ll still have a celebration when the spectre of COVID lifts.

“It’s a year-and-a-half long delayed reception,” laughed Robertson.

The roles of Robertson and Saunders in the business are quite clear: “He’s the dreamer, I’m the pragmatist,” laughed Saunders. (Robertson spent much of the interview bouncing with new ideas––Saunders spent much of the interview reigning in expectations.)

That’s not to say Robertson can’t be pragmatic: he added at the end of the interview a note that those renting bikes should pack a lunch.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

“A District of Sechelt resident was observed impersonating a bylaw officer and issuing fake parking tickets over the weekend,” a July 13 post on the district’s Facebook page said. “The fake ticket is a photocopy of a bylaw infraction warning, which would never be issued with a fine.”

The district said one of its staff members was on the receiving end of one of the fake tickets and reported it immediately. The person responsible has “been spoken to [and] has agreed to not impersonate a bylaw officer or obstruct bylaw officers.”

The district is advising people that if they get a bylaw violation notice or ticket and aren’t sure if it’s legit to contact the bylaw enforcement office at 604-740-8480.

This isn’t the first time fake parking tickets have shown up on windshields in Sechelt.

In late 2018 several people reported returning to their vehicles to find a ticket for $142 from “Sunshine Coast Parking Authority.”

RCMP at first thought it could be a scam because the ticket gave a website people could go to make payment, but it was later confirmed to be a prank.

The offences on those tickets included the usual parking violations and obviously fake ones like “Thinking only of yourself/laziness” and “Not keeping a safe level of blinker fluid.”",[]

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

89,bowenislandundercurrent,http://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Over the last couple of weeks, daily numbers have sometimes been in the single digits. But over the last three days, since Friday, there have been an average of 20 to 21 new cases per day: 62 in total since Friday.

article continues below

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.”

He is currently serving 4.5 years, minus time already served for possession drugs, including fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking.

article continues below

The Squamish Chief wrote about Noel's charges and conviction, so we were interested in what he had to say for himself now, while behind bars.

When we spoke with him, Noel was in a room in Mountain Institution, a medium-security facility in the Fraser Valley where he is serving part of his sentence. A corrections officer dialed the phone and handed it to Noel, then he was left alone to speak with us.

What follows is a version of that conversation edited for length and clarity.

Q: Your issue was dealing drugs. There is an opioid crisis and people are dying. Do you think about that?

A: When I was into drugs, that is all you think about — getting drugs.

You are desensitized to all that. Now that I look back, it is not only the deaths, but it is also destroying families. Putting people in jail. It destroys lives all the way around. It destroys communities. It is bad stuff.

I was too deep in it. But now I look back at it and I understand.

Q: Some people are likely going to give us heck for talking to you. The argument would be why talk to you, given what you did and being in prison. What do you say to that?

A: I would say alcohol and drugs — I have been into them deep. And crack cocaine, I did that from 2003 to 2010.

Even when I restarted doing drugs I was doing meth.

Once you are stuck in that cycle, it is so hard to get out.

With the drugs, you will mess up your family. The drug is so strong that it destroys lives.

I am done.

I was clean for six years. I know I can do it.

The only way I made my way out the first time is to find God.

I messed up again, but I know that I have reconnected with God again and I know when I get out, I will be good with it.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about Mountain Institution and what it is like there for you?

A: It is a 120-man unit.

You eat in the cafeteria. You get yard-time four times a day, for one hour each time. But right now because of COVID-19, we are only getting one yard a day.

Basically, we stay on the units the whole day.

Q: What was it like to be in there and the pandemic sweeping the globe? Were you aware of it when it first started?

A: Yes. We aren't allowed to get newspapers, but we saw it on the news. The gym is closed, we couldn't get any visitors. I didn't get sick.

Q: Can you tell me about how you came to Squamish and when?

A: I came from Quebec. I was in Whistler in 1995 and moved to Squamish in 1996.

It was cheaper in Squamish. I was only 21 and I was working construction and after a few months, one of my friends said he lived in Squamish and was going to travel.

I stayed at his place until I found a place of my own.

Q: And you worked mostly construction?

A: We were doing drilling and blasting back then for a contractor.

I worked doing some salt masonry.

Then I worked running an excavator and loader for a landscaping company.

Q: Obviously, something in your life went sideways, given where you are. What is your perspective on that?

A: My emotions got the best of me. I had gotten married and it went sideways.

Q: Do you struggle with drugs?

A: I did.

Q: Why do you think that happens?

A: I think a lot of people have trouble dealing with their emotions.

I got out of jail in 2012 and I was clean for six years and a productive member of society and then in 2016 when my marriage when sideways, I went ""Frick It!"" and I threw everything away. I thought I would party for a weekend, but I ended up going back to the way I had been living.

Q: What was your upbringing like with drugs and stuff like that?

A: My parents are not drug addicts. My dad was a weekend drinker, had two companies, was a hard worker.

I wasn't raised in that kind of environment. I was raised well.

Q: Do you think there is enough support in the Sea to Sky for people who want to manage their substance use?

A: I think it is pretty good. There's people like Lisa Young at Sea to Sky Community Services, if people need help, they are good.

And there is harm reduction and people to talk to.

I think there is some good help, but when somebody is not ready, they are just not ready.

But I will tell you one thing, I am ready now.

Q: There is talk of the decriminalization of drugs, say as Portugal has done. What do you think of that? More harm reduction and less criminal prosecution, would you like to see that?

A: I am an extremist. Some people can be functioning addicts, but no. I couldn't do it. I don't know if it would be that good, personally. I would still be an extremist.

Q: Does prison give you the chance to reflect on why you hurt yourself in this way?

A: Yes. The federal system has good programs. I did the three-month program. If you really wanted, you can do a trade in here too.

Q: When you get out, what do you want for yourself?

A: I still have until 2022, I am going to a drug rehabilitation house for a few months. Then I can have a job. I will be in a halfway house after that.

When I am working, I hope to put money away and rent a place, get to have weekends there, slowly.

Q: If you picture your best future, what would it be?

A: I am going to be drug-free. I think I want to get into car detailing and slowly maybe sell cars and maybe get a dealer's license. Or maybe even mobile car detailing?

Q: What are you looking forward to the first day you are out?

A: Dairy Queen, coffee and donuts.

Q: Anything else you would like people to know?

A: I would like them to know that once people are on drugs, it changes them. That is not the real person. That is the drug that you are seeing. It is sad. If someone you know is struggling with drugs, maybe take them to the gym or for a hike. Help him slowly to get better. For myself, if I would have gone to the gym and saw some gains and would have been happier with myself, that might have changed things. When you are on drugs you become unhappy and depressed.

Q: There's a lot of writing and understanding now about how addictions are linked to trauma. So the addiction is a symptom of something else?

A: Yes, I would say so. Trauma, mental health issues. And some people also hurt their backs, end up getting prescribed medication and then end up on street drugs.

Q: Why did you agree to do this interview?

A: I don't know. I just wanted to be helpful.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

“There were a lot of different factors involved,” said manager Heather Miller. “And then COVID just kind of came along and took things sideways and made it impossible to plan or to resolve some of the other issues that we face.”

The lease was expiring, putting further pressure on coming to a decision said Miller.

Murray and Janice Skeels started Artisan Office in the late ‘90s across the street from its current location and Margaret Miller bought the business in 2013. Heather took over managing Artisan Office a year ago.

The business today encompasses delivery services, office services and a community-wide newsletter (the Bulletin).

Faxing (a number of items still need to be faxed these days noted Miller) and scanning documents and being Bowen’s FedEx retailer were among Artisan Office’s unique services. It would also take documents to in-town accountants and lawyers, bring in bank deposits and whatever else. “So that people…can have their life on Bowen,” said Miller. “They don’t have to give up a day’s work on Bowen to go into town to take care of business.”

Miller said she’s going to miss Artisan Office life.

Chief coroner Lisa Lapointe says the pandemic has limited access to harm-reduction services and people should not be using opioids or other substances alone.

Lapointe is urging substance users to have someone present when using drugs or to go to an overdose prevention or supervised-consumption site where drugs can be checked for toxicity.

She says opioids, along with cocaine and the stimulants methamphetamine and amphetamine, have been detected among those who have fatally overdosed.

However, she says the illicit opioid fentanyl remains the most significant driver in the high number of deaths.

Ian Robb says over 90 per cent of hospitality employees in the country's hotels, airports, stadiums, universities and schools haven't worked since March.

He says too few employers are using the federal wage subsidy program to keep workers tied to their jobs and all levels of government need to work creatively to avoid long-term unemployment in the sector.

The union wants governments and employers to ensure their jobs are protected, that there is a safe way back to work and that there is income support for the duration of the crisis.

Robb says analysts predict the industry may not fully recover until the summer of 2022, leading to uncertainty for tens of thousands of workers and their families.

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

The fiscal and economic report released a week ago detailed the Liberals' financial expectations, including a $343.2-billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux says in a report that there are other numbers behind the biggest ones that MPs and senators should question.

He points to projections that enterprise Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. and Business Development Bank of Canada, will collectively lose $12 billion this fiscal year.

Giroux notes that loss is a sharp turnaround from the $7.3 billion in gains for the 12-month period ending in March.

He says losses are unusual for these Crown corporations and adds that each should provide detailed projections to Parliament as soon as possible about its COVID-19 liquidity programs.

Similarly, Giroux says the Liberals should provide details of their own borrowing, which his office estimates will exceed by $150 billion the ceiling set by federal legislation.

The budget office estimates the government's planned debt issuance this fiscal year of $713 billion will cost $2.2 billion annually in interest.

The report released Thursday also notes $4.4 billion in spending for measures the government has yet to announce.

All the spending is expected to push the federal debt past the $1-trillion mark.

The Liberals had previously made a declining debt-to-GDP ratio key to their fiscal plans, but skyrocketing spending will push the ratio to 49 per cent from 31.1 per cent.

Giroux says fiscal transparency and accountability would be enhanced if the Liberals identify their new ""fiscal anchor,"" how they'll measure their own successful handling of the budget and national economy, which wasn't specifically laid out in the update last week.

He said the federal government will contribute $19 billion under the ""Safe Restart Agreement.""

article continues below

The money is to help the lower-tier governments with needs such as funding child care, bailing out cities whose expenses have soared and revenues plunged, increasing contact-tracing capacity, and buying personal protective equipment.

Trudeau had promised $14 billion in early June, but several premiers resisted some of the conditions the federal Liberals wanted to put on the money and said it wasn't enough.

Ontario's Doug Ford was one who didn't like a federal demand that some of it fund up to 10 days of paid sick leave to discourage workers with precarious employment from going into work ill. Quebec's Francois Legault wanted the money to be transferred without conditions so provinces could use it on whatever they considered most important.

Trudeau said the agreement outlines seven priority areas, with some flexibility for the provinces to apply the money to their particular needs over the next six to eight months.

""The provinces agreed to invest in the targeted sectors,"" Trudeau said. ""There are areas like support for vulnerable people where we will expect the provinces to declare publicly what they will do.""

At his side, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland added the agreement includes standards in certain areas, such as COVID-19 testing, in exchange for the federal money.

The pandemic is a health crisis, but Trudeau said it has a deep economic dimension that the funding is intended to address.

He said workers can't work if their children don't have safe care, and many can't get to their jobs if they don't have access to safe transit systems.

That means funding public services better so they don't have to rely on crowding many people into small spaces for their finances to make sense.

Municipal governments, which deliver many of those services, have been warning for months that their finances are careening toward brick walls and have been begging for aid.

Canada's largest city, Toronto, has reported that it's facing a $1.35-billion deficit this year. Montreal says it has a $500-million shortfall. Halifax expects to be short $85.4 million.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

The FBI is investigating the hack, according to a person familiar with the probe who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing probe and spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday.

article continues below

The ruse discovered Wednesday included bogus tweets from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked.

Hackers used social engineering to target some of Twitter’s employees and then gained access to the high-profile accounts. The attackers sent out tweets from the accounts of the public figures, offering to send $2,000 for every $1,000 sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address.

Cybersecurity experts say such a breach could have dire consequences since the attackers were tweeting from verified, globally influential accounts with millions of followers.

""If you receive a tweet from a verified account, belonging to a well-known and therefore trusted person, you can no longer assume it’s really from them,"" said Michael Gazeley, managing director of cybersecurity firm Network Box.

Reacting to the breach, Twitter swiftly deleted the tweets and locked down the accounts to investigate. In the process it prevented verified users from sending out tweets for several hours.

The company said Thursday it has taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools.""

Many celebrities, politicians and business leaders often use Twitter as a public platform to make statements. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, regularly uses Twitter to post about national and geopolitical matters, and his account is closely followed by media, analysts and governments around the world.

Twitter faces an uphill battle in regaining people’s confidence, Gazeley said. For a start, it needs to figure out exactly the accounts were hacked and show the vulnerabilities have been fixed, he said.

""If key employees at Twitter were tricked, that’s actually a serious cybersecurity problem in itself,"" he said. ""How can one of the world’s most used social media platforms have such weak security, from a human perspective?""

Rachel Tobac, CEO of Socialproof Security, said that the breach appeared to be largely financially motivated. But such an attack could cause more serious consequences.

""Can you imagine if they had taken over a world leader’s account, and tweeted out a threat of violence to another country’s leader?"" asked Tobac, a social engineering hacker who specializes in providing training for companies to protect themselves from such breaches.

Social engineering attacks typically target human weaknesses to exploit networks and online platforms. Companies can guard themselves against such attacks by beefing up multi-factor authentication -– where users have to present multiple pieces of evidence as authentication before being allowed to log into a system, Tobac said.

Such a process could include having a physical token that an employee must have with them, on top of a password, before they can log into a corporate or other private system. Other methods include installing technical tools to monitor for suspicious insider activities and reducing the number of people who have access to an administrative panel, Tobac said.

Several U.S. lawmakers called on Twitter to co-operate with authorities including the Department of Justice and the FBI to secure the site.

""I am concerned that this event may represent not merely a co-ordinated set of separate hacking incidents but rather a successful attack on the security of Twitter itself,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.

He added that millions of users relied on Twitter not just to send tweets but also communicate privately via direct messaging. Twitter hasn't said if hackers were able to access the private messages of their high-profile targets.

Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told him in a private conversation in 2018 that the company was working on protecting direct messages, known as DMs, with end-to-end encryption.

But that promise never materialized, Wyden said Thursday, leaving everyone's private messages ""vulnerable to employees who abuse their internal access to the company’s systems, and hackers who gain unauthorized access.""

""This is a vulnerability that has lasted for far too long, and one that is not present in other, competing platforms,"" Wyden said in an emailed statement. ""If hackers gained access to users’ DMs, this breach could have a breathtaking impact, for years to come.""

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

CFIB, a policy advocacy group that represents small and medium-sized businesses and has 110,000 members, collected the data from members online between July 3 to July 6.

Looking to mark a significant birthday, anniversary or acknowledge someone you love? You can now hire Pauline to write you a song.

While the impetus to start Write Me A Song Pauline! was her longtime partner moving out due to health reasons and therefore she needed some income, Pauline’s songwriting pen has never been far from her hand.

“I got this idea to do what I’ve already always done,” says Pauline, who has released five CDs of original songs since 2000.

Last summer, when friends of Pauline’s celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, she wrote a song to sing at their celebrations.

Before Pauline dove into the writing, she interviewed the couple.

“It was really fun to do,” she says. “I take the notes and then I go home and I get my highlighter––like she said that, he said that––and the song starts to come to me.”

“He made her laugh, she made him think, little did they know they were on the brink of love that would blossom and grow…”

“I love it because I get to know more,” says Pauline. “I’m a curious person so I get to find out this interesting stuff about people and then come down to what is the essence and what they want to celebrate and then write a song about it.”

While this is a new chapter for Pauline, it also comes with making peace that she’s no longer––as she describes it––the “Energizer bunny.”

Following the publication of her 2017 book, Whale in the Door, and the surrounding commitments of touring, Pauline was left burnt out and she has had some health issues over the past couple of years. But her recent living situation change has reinvigorated her creativity.

“So I start every morning.. I sit down and write a poem about old age,” says Pauline.

“I’m calling it ‘Let me tell you something about old age’ And some of them are really funny…some of them are not funny and they’re just facing…lack of future. What that means to a person.

“Or less future I guess.”

But it’s the future Pauline’s preparing for. She had considered moving off-island but after a bout of bronchitis over the holidays and a constant stream of soup from friends, she realized that her community is here and resolved to stay.

“That’s why I need to make money, so I can stay here because it’s expensive to live here,” she says. “If I live to be 80 I can just live off my savings. But, that’s four years from now. If I’m like my dad and live to be 94, I’m in deep doo doo.”

With a few customers already lined up, Pauline bounces in her chair as she discusses her projects––rather like the Energizer bunny.

The Undercurrent got in touch with owner Casey Kennedy to find out what the business is all about.

What is The Watering Can Supply?

article continues below

A refill and sustainable supply store with an emphasis on local Canadian products.

Why do you find it important to sell sustainable products and from mostly Canadian suppliers?

Now more than ever we need to look at our consumption practices and how they serve us, our environment and the world. By choosing sustainable and local products, we are able to give directly back to our communities. I believe people are ready to make greener choices for their families but accessibility can sometimes get in the way. One of my goals in creating The Watering Can Supply is to help make the change easier for people. By choosing eco-friendly products, we’re supporting our families, investing in our health and truly caring for our environment.

What do you refill?

The list keeps growing each week! We have a lot of cleaning and personal hygiene refills. This includes dish detergent, dish soap, laundry detergent, all-purpose cleaner, stain remover, shampoo and conditioner, deodorant, toothpaste, dental floss, soap, cosmetic oils, floral waters, and lots more. We also carry other sustainable items that are not refillable but are definitely compostable or minimal waste. Things like bamboo toothbrushes, produce bags, baby wipes, cutlery and refillable candles.

What was your inspiration for opening the store?

It’s personally very important to me to lower my environmental impact, support Canadian companies and support others in leading more sustainable lives. That coupled with a huge leap of faith and a supportive community led me to create The Watering Can Supply.

Why on Bowen?

Community-based living has always been a huge part of my life and I couldn’t imagine creating the store anywhere else. I love that The Watering Can Supply has allowed me to offer a much-needed service to the community but also provided me with an opportunity to support our neighbours and friends in choosing eco-friendly products.

What has the local response been?

The support I’ve received has been beyond amazing. I cannot put into words how grateful I am for the amount of love, support, and curiosity I have received. From excitement and congratulations to product suggestions to a friendly hello, it’s truly been a warm welcome.

The Watering Can Supply is open Tuesday to Thursday 3 to 6 p.m. and Saturday 9 to 4 p.m. It’s located at #102 - 555 Prometheus Place.",[]

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

article continues below

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

The metaphor suggested by the title of Christian Sands’ new album is apt.

The jazz pianist says he was trying to be freer and more flexible on ""Be Water,"" and it shows. The set's 10 cuts explore a wide range of moods and instrumental combinations, with Sands' trio at the core.

Much of the material is built on the same pattern of tension and release found in a body of water. That begins with the opening ""Intro,"" which settles on the tonic chord after nearly four minutes of shimmering undulation.

The reflective ""Still,"" featuring Marvin Sewell on acoustic guitar, rides a mere ripple of rhythm. On ""Be Water II,"" a string quartet plays against the lapping beat established by Sands' piano. Marcus Strickland's woodwind work makes ""Drive"" swing as it crests with a cascading electric guitar solo by Sewell.

Sands rarely cuts loose at the piano — his objective isn't to be splashy — but he takes an active role as the producer, overdubbing extra keyboards and including sound effects and brief recitations by martial artist Bruce Lee. ""Water can flow, or it can crash,"" Lee says. Forgive the flood of puns, but ""Be Water"" flows freely.",[]

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

The Bowen public can once again book tee times but with strict rules for COVID protection:

Hours are Wednesday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Thursday, Friday, Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed Monday, Tuesday for maintenance).

Reservations must be made online and green fees pre-purchased.

Twosomes or singles only and six-foot distance must be maintained always.

Tee times are at 15-minute intervals (again, a max. of two per tee time).

Show up within 15 minutes of tee-time, not early, as the previous golfers must be teed off before you enter the parking lot.

No playing without reservations.

The pro shop, range, practice greens, vending machines and washroom are closed. No garbage cans either.

No rentals of any kind (though you can buy balls online and they’ll be waiting for you at tee-time).

No flags (a sign is posted each morning of where the holes have been cut on the greens in lieu of a flag) and ball cups are upside down (so balls rest near the surface). No rakes, ball washers, flags or garbage cans at the golf course and the washrooms are closed too.

No bunker rakes or ball washers and players must dispose of their own broken tees at home.

No alcohol allowed.

Leave a car’s width between cars when parking.

And don’t go if you’re showing COVID-19 symptoms or have travelled in the last two weeks.

Golf courses across the lower mainland are reopening with similar measures in place.

Pro Shop manager Les Meszaros says that the Bowen course been running a two-week test of these measures with members, which has been a success. With the limited tee times and hours, capacity’s been at 90 to a hundred per cent and golfers have self-enforced the rules.

Cups in the holes are inverted so the balls don't drop far.

“People took it seriously,” said Meszaros. “They understood what we’re trying to do.”

Golfers noted that with so few people on the course (eight in an hour) it’s like having your own private golf course, Meszaros relayed. While some have asked about raising the number of people allowed in a tee time, Meszaros said they’re taking it slow and going with what they know works.

“Could we have more people on here? Probably, but I’m in no hurry,” said Meszaros. “We’ll get to the right time with the right number of people.”

Meszaros said that Vancouver Coastal Health approved golf course operations under their current COVID rules.

Whereas there’s usually a golf course staff of eight to 10 people, it’s been just the superintendent Frank Griffiths and Meszaros running the course, working seven days a week. However, Meszaros did get funding to hire a couple of students for the summer season––a season that’s sure to look different from any before it. Golf tournaments are cancelled and the clubhouse shuttered for now.

“We just adapt and adjust and try to figure out how we keep working,” said Meszaros.

Also to note, the course is opening to islanders only. “This isn’t about tourism,” said Meszaros. “This is about providing an outlet for people to do something in a really nice, safe way.”",[]

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Team Canada was electric all weekend, beating three of the top-four ranked teams in the world as 74,560 fans packed BC Place for the annual event.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

The Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii. The Ultraman World Championship. The Boston Marathon. Just to name a few.

Smallwood lives in California and combines travel and racing. With the world at his doorstep, Smallwood will be returning to Bowen Island to participate in the third annual SwimBowen event this summer. We asked, “Why Bowen?”

“I have two basic criteria that I look for in races,” Smallwood shared. “One is the challenge of the race and the competition and the other is the experience. It’s meeting and connecting with other people and making more friends.

“SwimBowen fits perfectly into my lifestyle,” he said. “It’s an event I will continue to do every year as long as it’s offered.”

For Smallwood, the differences between SwimBowen and other perhaps more renowned events are striking. Bowen is “very much a family feeling environment” he said.

“It’s very welcoming, fully supportive, emotionally, whether you’re a beginning swimmer, just there to see if you can make it, or whether you’re a swimmer who is there to try to swim fast and maybe compete to win it. Either one is going to get the same experience, the same benefits from the event.

“I swim well enough to generally be one of the first few summers finishing but I’m standing there at the water’s edge cheering on and helping every swimmer I can come in. And pretty much everyone is doing that.”

More than the camaraderie, Smallwood appreciates the connections he’s made to both Bowen and its residents. “One can go to any given event, you can compete, and the memory of that might last a few days, a few weeks. But when you can go someplace, meet people, and make friends. Friends can last forever.

“[From Bowen] you get something that can last your whole life as opposed to a t-shirt or a medal that might sit in a drawer or a box and never be seen again.”

Compared to other races, SwimBowen is a small event but as Smallwood points out it is attracting people from other countries. “I think it’s would be worthwhile for anyone on Bowen Island if they had the morning or afternoon free to come by and take in the event. When you have 100 people all trying to encourage each other to complete this thing, it’s very contagious.”

“It would also be equally enjoyable if you were there just to watch the race. You can watch an ice hockey, football, basketball, or soccer game on television––you don’t get anywhere near the enjoyment out of it as coming down and watching an event like this,” he aid. “It’s like being able to have front row seats and sitting with the athletes in a competitive event. And you go do that right on Bowen Island.”

Does Smallwood have any advice for those who might be thinking of participating? “If someone’s thinking about participating they should get water safe. If they feel they can safely and comfortably swim for 20 minutes they can do the short course.”

Oh yeah, did we mention, Smallwood just turned 65. “There is no better health insurance, anywhere, anyhow,” he said. “The best health insurance anyone can have is staying active. That doesn’t mean having to be the fastest or the strongest. It just means use your body. Get out and do something. Go for a walk, hike. Swimming is a fantastic exercise.

The 17-year-old islander was one of 20 players (four from B.C.) selected for the Canada’s Women’s Under-20 National Team, Canada Soccer announced last week.

article continues below

The team, with former women’s national team player Rhian Wilson as head coach, is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic this week for the Concacaf Women’s Under-20 Championships. The tournament runs Feb. 22 to March 8 with Canada opening the tournament with a Feb. 22 game against El Salvador. They also have round-robin games against Guatemala (Feb 24) and Jamaica (Feb 26) before the knockout round. The final is March 8.

The top two teams will advance to the 2020 FIFA Women’s Under-20 World Cup in Costa Rica and Panama in August. Canada will likely have to beat the U.S. or Mexico for one of the two open Concacaf spots.

As Molly was born in 2002, and will turn 18 during the tournament, she is also eligible for the 2022 Under-20 World Cup cycle.

Molly was five when she started playing for Bowen Island Football Club. Her father Morgan and Burns Jennings were her early coaches.

“Bowen Island FC gave me the opportunity to discover and pursue my love of soccer. The commitment of the players and coaches to develop one another was remarkable,” said Molly. “I love that I come from a community and club like Bowen island.”

After seven seasons with BIFC, she moved onto the BC Soccer Premier League’s Mountain United and then went onto the provincial program. She played at every age level until joining the full-time Vancouver Whitecaps Girls Elite Super REX program in 2017. Always dedicated, Molly had to change high schools and billet with families in Surrey and Burnaby to continue on her path.

Molly will attend the University of Nebraska on a soccer scholarship this summer.",[]

The chef was raised behind a deli counter (his mother ran Springfield Meats and Sausage in Kelowna) and grew up foraging with his mother. So perhaps his path was inevitable.

article continues below

Matheson is one of three men behind Orbaek Farm to Table Takeaway & Meats. Along with head chef Jak Hedley and salumist (maker of charcuterie and sausages) Dylan Ricci, Matheson operates the food lounge at Meadowbrook Corner. (Orbaek is not a restaurant as it’s on provincially designated agricultural land reserve and therefore under certain restrictions).

Last June, Orbaek opened as a reservation-only, word-of-mouth dining lounge for groups of between eight and 25 people. “We were going to build the brand from there,” said Matheson, “And then COVID happens.”

The hours-long sit-down Scandanavian-style meals of last year didn’t suit the COVID environment so Orbaek pivoted to Japanese-Danish fusion take-out. “Which is bizarre to think about,” said Matheson. “But it actually works really well because they’re two very similar cuisines when you look at the aesthetic of the food.”

“The two cuisines, the two aesthetics of the people, how they live their lives, how they set the table, how they view food, how they view family…the Danes and the Japanese have a lot of similarities,” said Matheson. “For us, it was just a natural combination.”

The team also wanted to make sure that Orbaek’s new model would suit whatever’s to follow with COVID-19. “We thought about that for a while and were like, ‘Hey, let’s just do some fun food really easily.’

“Quickly prepared… but it’s all fresh made.”

One can either order from Orbaek online or in person at the Grafton Rd. property.

“Our ideas to give people a lot of options so they don’t have to go to the cove if they just want to grab a few things for dinner,” said Matheson.

There’s the fresh menu with five different rice bowls and three salads (including an octopus seaweed salad), there are sourdough breads from a rotation of local bakers, broths and “comforting Danish-style” desserts (which are Matheson’s specialty). There’s a selection of meats from Ricci, which in the right season includes lamb raised on the property.

“We’re just going to develop the menu as it goes along,” explained Matheson.

Most of the greens are grown on the Meadowbrook property or sourced from local farms. “It’s as local as it can get,” said Matheson. “It’s very farm to table.”

Also featured (when in season) are wild mushrooms and wild strawberries.

“I was raised in a very traditional Danish household so food was such a big deal and foraging wild goods,” said Matheson. (Matheson was out in a chanterelle patch with his young daughter when we chatted.) “It’s just part of my lifestyle,” he said. “And then I just work it into putting stuff on the menu.”

“Orbaek” Matheson’s Danish clan––a name that dates back to the 10th century. It’s also a long-standing family tradition to name businesses Orbaek. Matheson’s grandfather Ove Orbaek Larsen was a well-known furniture maker in Vancouver in the 1950s.His shop on Hastings Street? Orbaek Designs.

“It’s very much my homage to my heritage,” said Matheson. “I was taking the whole history of everything and just presenting it in a culinary way and giving people a taste of what my upbringing was.”

In that vein, the lounge space features family heirlooms, paintings from Matheson’s grandfather and dishware from Denmark.

Accompanying his Danish upbringing, Matheson was classically trained as a chef and has for years also run Vine & Garden Catering (which he started as a project in school. “It was a passion project,” he said. “It was my romanticism of what I wanted to do with food.”)

With the three partners, Matheson and Hedley work the weekends (desserts and salads are Matheson’s domain and the rest is Hedley’s) and Ricci prepares the meats during the week. “It’s just magical what we actually created here,” said Matheson. “Jak is very much the art of the projects, I guess I would be the romanticist…Dylan has the mastery of the meats.”

Orbaek also just became one of a handful of non-deli or meat producers in Metro Vancouver to hold a charcuterie ticket said Matheson.

As for what the future holds, later this summer there could be opportunity for more dining for little groups on the patio and for future years, this isn’t the last of what’s to come on Meadowbrook Corner.

Hours are noon to 7 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

The messaging starts before people visit the island. Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has recommended tourists call ahead before visiting towns to make sure they’re welcoming visitors (some aren’t) and what the protocols are. On the COVID-19 alerts and updates page of the tourism website is a note that BC Ferries and several island businesses request or require masks and when people email Tourism Bowen Island about visiting the island, they’re reminded of that fact said Jody Lorenz of Tourism Bowen Island.

On the ground in Snug Cove, “When we’re talking to people, we’re wearing a mask so we’re modeling the protocol,” said Lorenz. They have hand sanitizer at the centre and signs up about distancing. When they do a group talk, they make sure people are well spaced apart, said Lorenz. “So it’s definitely different. We have to approach things slightly differently.”

“We’re very much trying to make sure that people are aware that, as Dr. Henry says, when you travel, you take your travel manners with you that you abide by what you’ve been doing at home when you go elsewhere,” she said.

The staff are trying to stay on top of local businesses’ hours and protocols and share that with visitors said Lorenz (though sometimes these can change quickly.) Often people are coming to the island for its outdoor options so the tourism office shares short walk options as well as longer treks such as up Mt. Gardner. “Our nature experience is the big draw,” said Lorenz.

While it’s early days, the visitor centre only opened June 27, Lorenz said the island is getting visitors. “We are finding that with the nice weather, as it has always been,…people are coming. “They want to get out of dodge and go get some fresh air. So Bowen, we’ve got that kind of nice little escape for people to come here.”

However, numbers may be down from the average July weekends of the past. “I have not looked at what was last year,” said Lorenz. “But just looking, to me it is down.

“Will that continue? I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going to happen.”

“It’s always weather dependent,” she noted.

“COVID has made so many people very nervous and in many ways, rightly so,” said Lorenz. “I do want to make sure that residents are aware that we are taking our role as helping to promote COVID health safety [seriously].

“I really want to make sure that we do what we can with the people that we talk to,” she said, noting that they don’t talk to every visitor. “The people that we’re generally seeing are aware and we’re just trying to reinforce that.”",[]

The recipient of this year’s Youth Leadership Award is in grade four. Eden Currah has been volunteering at community events, most notably at the Bowen Farmers’ market, Applefest and Bowfest for more than three years. She shows up just to help out however she can. She is an enthusiastic and responsible member of the BICS Student Council, as well as exemplifying the pillars of Order of BICS. She has a keen interest in the arts and has set up an informal fine arts apprenticeship, as well as a keen interest in fitness; proposing and leading various physical literacy opportunities for her peers. As a well-rounded, keen, curious and contributing youth, Eden deserves recognition for her community spirit and youth leadership!

Whales. Anchovies. Understanding the waters of Howe Sound. Mapping. Investigating. Videoing. Educating. Sharing. Caring and promoting understanding of our environment, from our social and cultural environment to the science of our ecology. The man with the video camera, the kayak, wet suit, endless curiosity and the big heart is Bob Turner who has spent many years writing about, creating films, books, essays and mapping our environment on many levels. Bob shares his passion through education at the community school, from the BICS Welcome Pole documentary film, to endlessly being a resource about geology and ecology to students on field trips and in-class talks, as well as at the community level. He has contributed so much, we wish we could give him an award every year!

“We’d like to paint a whale. A really big whale.” BICS collaborated with Squamish host nation elders and held its first Kulelakum ‘Whale Day’ in 2012 to celebrate and deepen our understanding of yew yews, (orca whales,) and to learn about and celebrate the importance of whales through First Nations culture and traditions, science, local history, geography, and ecology.

In 2013, to deepen our understanding of how we are all part of a bigger, interconnected picture that was symbolized by a large whale mosaic that was about 20’ long and 10’ high and comprised of over 300 canvases, each one painted by a BICS student. How are we going to do this? We applied to Opus Art Supplies’ program that supports community projects and when we wanted to make a 50’ x 50’ reusable canvas labyrinth with clay domes, they supported that project too! And when the CSA wanted to create a fundraiser and community-wide youth art show, Opus Art Supplies supported us not once, but twice. Opus Arts Supplies is a recipient of one of this year’s Community Spirit Awards for their enduring support of cultural education in the community school and the community. We have so many ideas, and we couldn’t do it without the generosity of Opus. Thank you for providing the support and material for so many young imaginations at the community school and in the community.

In addition to the Community Spirit Awards, this year’s BICS Volunteer(s) of the Year Award goes to our PAC co-chairs: Sarah Cormier and Sara Bryant, who are stepping down after serving their full terms as Parent Advisory Council co-chairs and are greatly deserving of the award after many years of volunteering on a myriad of traditional and new fundraisers and special events. From the Family Fair, to the Yogathon, parent education talks, card projects, photos with Santa, the Friday Lunch program and more. Sarah and Sara have enthusiastically collaborated and supported the PAC, CSA, BICS students and staff and so we would like to thank them and recognize them for their many contributions to the community and community school.",[]

So she pivoted. Over the course of three days in Toronto, just before heading to Bowen to isolate with her family, Spear recorded her first digital-release EP, Morning & Melancholia. Where there would’ve been studio musicians, there’s just Spear and the producer, engineer and player of steel pedal, guitar and piano Aaron Goldstein.

article continues below

A single from the EP, “If I had Wings,” was released this week while the entire four-song EP is coming out July 31.

Folk with a bit of country and a bit of bluegrass, Spear described her latest endeavour.

Spear grew up on Bowen playing a lot of music with her family. Her mom (Dyan) brought her to bluegrass camp in Sorrento and her dad (Ted) taught her how to play guitar. After high school, Spear moved to Montreal and was quietly playing music until two years ago.

After a bad breakup, Spear decided to put her music out into the world. “It was just a way to work through those feelings,” said Spear. “I was like, ‘I’ve got nothing to lose, I’m just going to start releasing music.’”

After an ex-partner died in a car accident, Spear started writing about that. “It’s just been a way to self soothe and work through things that are going on in my life,” she reflected.

The title of the EP Spear adapted from Sigmund Freud’s 1918 essay “Mourning and melancholia” about the ways people experience grief.

“Grief is such an interesting thing and it changes day to day,” said Spear.

She clarified that the title isn’t to endorse Freud’s larger body of work but rather she used the book to consider her own grief and mourning. “Music, it’s a source of comfort for me,” said Spear. “It’s nice to create a song and then…if it was written in a moment of deep sadness or whatever it was, to move away from that and then come to it anew and experience it in a different way.

“A theme that I talk about in the EP is when someone passes away being the sole keeper of a shared memory and how memory changes.

“When you only have one side of the story, it’s like a great weight and responsibility to get it right and remember it right,” said Spear. “Because our memories are so slippery.""

Spear signed with the American label Secretly Canadian and the Canadian label Royal Mountain and had been all set for the album when COVID disrupted the everyone’s plans.

“This period has been a very interesting time for musicians because people are working with limits,” said Spear. “There’s this idea that if you’re making a big record, then you go somewhere to do it and you use people from L.A. like I’m doing, but that’s not the way that has to be.”

“I think what I’m learning is how many resources I have all around me all the time and how creating a sense of community in music is so important and to work with people that are close to you.”

Now, for the first time in a decade, Spear is back living with her family on Bowen, including her older siblings, Bowen’s filmmaking twins known as the Spear Sisters (who filmed part of the music video for “If I Had Wings.”)

“I look up to my parents and my sisters so much and they are just always working and creating so I guess that fostered this need to make things,” said Spear. “ But I’ve also always had such support from them and the community growing up here.

“I think you have a twisted sense of how you’re doing because everyone’s just so behind you.”

But also on Spear’s mind these days is the style of music she plays as a white musician in Canada. “I’ve been doing a lot of research on the history of bluegrass and country and folk and there’s a lot of Black artists that have been teaching me a lot about the true history and the erasure of Black artists within the genres that I play,” she said. “That’s definitely been on my mind. And something I think that all musicians should consider.”

“It’s made me want to reconsider my position in the industry and make sure that I’m elevating [Black, Indigenous and People of Colour] voices as much as I can,” she said. “Also figuring out systems of oppression within the music industry and understanding how to dismantle them and also paying tribute to the people that shaped the music that I play like Arnold Schulz…the true father of Bluegrass.”

Spear is donating her share of the royalties from “If I had Wings” to the following organizations: Taking What We Need, Vancouver Black Therapy and Advocacy Fund and Black Women in Motion.

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

The roundhouse theme was the retrospective, the history of transportation. Like all Czech contributions, it was quite quirky. One element was a bunch of dead inventors holding patent models of their contraptions. At the closing of the fair, the patent models went to Science World but the figures were auctioned off with the office furniture. I learned later that they had been bought by a film production company that planned to soak them in gasoline and burn them in a horror movie.

Bowen’s latest business owners are not only starting their marriage during a global pandemic but a tourism-based business. So as one might expect, this is a love story.

article continues below

Angela Saunders and Brendan Robertson opened their e-bike rental company, Bowen eBikes, from their Cates Hill home last week.

“E-bikes was always a thought for us that would make Bowen quite a bit more accessible to anyone,” said Saunders. “That coupled with COVID, as people get concerned about tourists coming back onto Bowen and all the tourists end up getting stuck at the Snug because without a vehicle you’re not really going too far out there.” There was also the bonus that biking can be a socially distanced activity.

Neither has a background in tourism: Saunders works for a tech company that makes software for designing custom prosthetics and orthotics. Robertson runs a small web shop on the island.

But both have a background in cycling: they’re triathletes who’ve competed at multiple world championships, which is where they met.

“We kept missing each other year after year after year,” said Robertson. They’d heard rumours of one another and had at least one friend in common but hadn’t yet crossed paths.

“So many races that we both competed at and never met,” said Saunders.

But after missing one another at world championships three times, they finally met in London in 2013 and exchanged information.

Two years ago the couple moved to Bowen –– “We came over for just a weekend and we were like, ‘Yep, this is where we need to be,” said Saunders.

“We are not in the same shape as we once were but we still enjoy community races here and there,” said Saunders. “Obviously the race season is completely shut down this year so we are just enjoying trying to do our training outside and to make the most of our own backyard.”

Robertson also for a while had a YouTube channel to try to help people get into triathalon and for a time was a triathalon coach at UBC. “I think that whole notion of how to help people get outside and get physical is part of who you are,” Saunders told her new husband, noting that he was being humble in listing his credentials.

While both used to be e-bike skeptics, they have since recanted their no pedal assist stances.

For Saunders it was watching fellow commuters pedaling out to UBC or South Vancouver instead of driving. For Robertson it was jealousy. “As an athlete you can get to be very competitive,” he laughed recalling other people on e-bikes passing his non-motorized but long-training self. “A little bit like, ‘…that’s cheating; that shouldn’t be allowed!’

“Then of course then we get them and we try them out and it’s like, ‘ooh, but I love cheating.

“I love being one of those guys with the e-bikes passing everybody. It feels good in a bad way.”

E-bikes also deal with the post-winter hurdle of getting back on the bike and out training noted Saunders. “It’s just about getting people back outside and in whatever weather conditions and with these bikes you have to pedal to engage,” she said. “You do have to pedal up the hill, you’re just getting that little boost to help you up there.”

“You see families of older generations or younger generations trying to figure out what they would do all together and e-bikes are a great way to normalize that,” said Saunders.

Another bonus for the couple is that it’s a car alternative.

“That’s thing that drew us to cycling in the first place,” said Saunders. “It’s human powered.”

To say that Bowen eBikes is something new in the Saunders and Robertsons’ lives could be an understatement.

It was two weeks ago that Saunders was in London Drugs when she overheard someone say that there was a good price on e-bikes. Sparing a glance at the bikes, she agreed that they were a good price.

A few days later the couple had four bikes and a few days after that they had eight.

Last weekend they had their first group out on the bikes.

“Everyone has been so supportive,” said Saunders. “They’re just like, this is really something that Bowen could use.”

The e-bikes are class one, meaning they have pedal assist, so you have to pedal to enable them, but there’s no throttle. Each is rented out with a charger, lock and pannier.

Customers can come to the couple’s home or Bowen eBikes can also drop-off bikes. But everyone needs to bring a helmet for COVID-19 safety reasons.

As the business is new, Saunders and Robertson are still working out some details such as how to do bike drop-off in the cove.

“The main thing is just to provide a different way for people to be out and social distance too,” said Saunders.

“The nice thing with the e-bikes is you don’t have to have a driver’s license so we can offer it to youths,” she said. They don’t currently have child-sized e-bikes.

“I think it’s evolving a little bit because of what the feedback that we are getting from different people that are renting,” said Robertson.

The bikes aren’t just for tourists noted Robertson, there’s also the potential for locals to rent them.

It was just a few weeks ago that Robertson and Saunders tied the knot at their Bowen home. - Dave and Jennah Park of wearetheparks.co

And the couple has already met the pandemic head on: they’d been set to get married in a big wedding on June 20.

“We had this really grand plan,” said Saunders. But with the virus, they pivoted. Just their immediate family came to the wedding at their home on Cates Hill and they sourced on-island help for event rentals, flowers, food, invitations and music.

“It was so nice to just be in the backyard,” she said. “And then it was so perfect because when we finished the ceremony, we peaked around the corner and a whole bunch of neighbors had gathered to watch.”

“You have to kind of adapt to things as you go along. Not everything is just how you think it would be,” said Saunders. “It’s the same with our wedding and it turned out really great.”

Though that was their wedding, they’ll still have a celebration when the spectre of COVID lifts.

“It’s a year-and-a-half long delayed reception,” laughed Robertson.

The roles of Robertson and Saunders in the business are quite clear: “He’s the dreamer, I’m the pragmatist,” laughed Saunders. (Robertson spent much of the interview bouncing with new ideas––Saunders spent much of the interview reigning in expectations.)

That’s not to say Robertson can’t be pragmatic: he added at the end of the interview a note that those renting bikes should pack a lunch.

The 13 recommendations include a variety of initiatives from connecting workers with childcare and streamlining regulations, to promoting consumer confidence and helping businesses adopt technology.

article continues below

The action plan will now be implemented by the Burnaby Board of Trade over the coming weeks and months with support from local businesses, government and community partners.

Central to the Task Force’s action plan is the development of a Centre for Business Recovery and Resilience which will house the majority of the Task Force’s other recommended initiatives and will be located virtually and physically at the Burnaby Board of Trade.

This Centre while provide a destination for businesses seeking targeted supports, guidance and assistance through the current COVID response and recovery period, and will ultimately transition into a longer-term program consistent with the Task Force’s vision for an economic future that promotes equity and sustainability, attracts employers, creates jobs, and generates pride in local, independent, and community-involved businesses.

“The Task Force has created a forward-thinking action plan to support our local economy, and I’m proud of the leadership it has displayed,” said Paul Holden, chair of the Task Force and president and CEO of the Burnaby Board of Trade. “By bringing together business, government, non-profit, post-secondary education, and labour, it is a model for how communities should work collaboratively to recover and rebuild from COVID-19,” added Holden.

The Burnaby Business Recovery Task Force met 10 times over the past two and a half months to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, identify the concerns and needs of the local business community, and determine ways to support Burnaby’s recovery.

Armed with survey data from local businesses and presentations by subject matter experts, the Task Force developed 6 “quick starts” which it began advancing immediately, and 7 additional initiatives which will be now be developed and implemented to support Burnaby businesses.

The 13 actions recommended by the Task Force include:

Create a “Centre for Business Recovery and Resilience” This combined virtual and physical Centre would house a number of initiatives, resources and supports for businesses of all types, sectors and sizes, initially to assist through the current COVID response and recovery period, but potentially transitioning into a longer-term program

Examples of potential services could include training and skills development opportunities, access to technical advice and coaching, and support in adapting business models to the new economy Advocate for New Grants or WorkSafeBC Rebates to Pay for PPE and Safety Equipment (Quick Start) According to a Task Force survey of Burnaby businesses, 34% of organizations spent more than $1000 in the first month of re-opening on PPE and safety equipment

To help businesses afford this new equipment, the Task Force will call on the provincial government for either a direct grant or a rebate on WorkSafeBC premiums Launch a Burnaby PPE Supplier List (Quick Start) To help businesses source PPE, the Task Force should create a PPE and COVID-19 Safety Equipment Supplier List with direct connections to local suppliers and manufacturers Create More Opportunities for Patios and Outdoor Dining (Quick Start) Advocate for and support government permitting and licensing changes to allow restaurants, breweries, caterers, and other food service businesses to quickly set up new, or expand existing, patios throughout the city Enable Business Uses of Public Property Beyond the Sale of Food and Beverage (Quick Start) Work with the City of Burnaby to streamline and communicate opportunities for businesses to use designated areas in Burnaby parks for classes and small events while observing safety protocols

Work with the City of Burnaby to provide extended hours and more easily-accessible parking in high traffic areas such as Hastings, Kingsway and the North Road area Work with the Childcare Sector and Employers to Support Parents Returning to Work (Quick Start) Work with the Burnaby childcare community to inventory summer childcare/camp opportunities and communicate this to its networks,

Explore opportunities to work with the business community and the City on childcare space creation

Engage employers about flexible workplace policies to support families with childcare needs, and explore opportunities for employers to repurpose workspace into childcare space

Advocate to the provincial and federal government to continue to provide financial supports that enable employees to work and to review childcare regulations to provide flexibility in order to create temporary childcare spaces. Launch a “Recovery Policy Working Group” to Advocate to Senior Government for Additional Financial Supports (Quick Start) Create a dedicated, local working group to focus solely on providing feedback and recommendations on government policies around COVID-19 business support and recovery to ensure supports are sufficient to support Burnaby businesses Develop a “Business Digital Development Support Program” A made-in-Burnaby program should be implemented to assist local companies in bolstering their digital presence and furthering the adoption of technology in their operations

Leveraging the availability of skilled students of BCIT and SFU the program would provide direct, hands-on support to small to medium businesses Explore the Potential to Pilot a “Digital Main Street” Initiative in Burnaby Investigate the potential to pilot with Digital Main Street to roll-out an initiative to provide businesses in Burnaby access to e-commerce sites quickly and at reasonable costs Expand Communications Efforts to Connect Businesses with Existing Economic Recovery Information & Resources Ensure all Burnaby businesses have access to information on programs, supports and resources related to COVID-19 response and recovery and work to widely distribute this information in our diverse business community Engage with & Advocate to Financial Institutions on Ways to Unlock Capital for Business Loans Convene leaders of local financial institutions to find new ways of supporting small businesses Create Incentives and Supports to Position Burnaby as a Hub For New Businesses and Entrepreneurs Implement a program of supports and incentives to make it as easy as possible to start a new business in Burnaby

Explore advocating for reduced fees and streamlined application processes

Develop entrepreneur supports such as mentorship programs with established businesses, pop-up stores to test proof of concept, and one-on-one new business coaching and guidance Expand the “#BuyLocalBuyBurnaby” Program Develop a local procurement challenge whereby major Burnaby employers and institutions are encouraged to increase the percentage of purchasing that is done locally

Expand the existing Burnaby Board of Trade’s ‘Open for Business’ directory and continue promotion

Execute ongoing “buy local” and “consumer confidence” marketing and social campaigns

The Burnaby Business Recovery Task Force is an initiative of the Burnaby Board of Trade, the city’s chamber of commerce and economic development partner, and was facilitated by the SFU Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue. The Task Force is comprised of 15 members representing senior positions in local government, major employers, small business, non-profits, labour unions, business associations, and post-secondary institutions.

Vince Li wants to have a word with you about that. The 26-year-old had been battling a fever for several days back in March when he made his way to Burnaby Hospital looking for answers.

article continues below

The results of an X-ray and blood test revealed tell-tale signs of COVID-19. Doctors decided to immediately sedate, intubate, and send Li to Royal Columbian Hospital, one of the province’s primary COVID-19 sites. There, he became the youngest COVID-positive patient to be mechanically ventilated in the hospital’s intensive care unit during the pandemic’s spring peak, according to the RCH foundation.

“I didn’t have a chance to tell anybody,” Li recalls after hearing he would be placed in an induced coma. “My mom was outside at the waiting area in the ER, and social workers called her.”

“His blood levels of oxygen were ridiculously low, so he needed quite a lot of oxygen to support him,” said Dr. Robert Sharpe, a critical care physician at RCH. “His carbon dioxide levels were also quite high. It was quite difficult to blow off CO2 because his lungs were greatly inflamed from the body’s reaction to the virus. He was pretty touch and go early on.”

A personal trainer and competitive mixed-martial artist who controlled his type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise, Li remained hospitalized for a month and remembers nothing about the first three weeks. During that time, ICU teams kept a close watch on his blood gases, made sure his organs were getting enough oxygen, and watched for signs of new infections.

Since there is no specific treatment yet for COVID-19, patients are supported medically in the hopes they can fight off the virus.

“He fooled us a couple of times, where we thought he was ready to come off the ventilator,” said Sharpe. “And then we just needed to give him more time, and he turned around.”

When he regained consciousness, Li was surprised at the amount of weight and muscle he lost. It took him a while to start moving comfortably again.

“In the beginning, it was pretty rough,” he said. “I didn’t realize that being in a bed for a month, I could have so much muscle atrophy.”

While his time at Royal Columbian is hazy, Li says the care – from the doctors to the nurses and physiotherapists – stands out, as does other, simpler milestones.

“My fondest memory was getting the tubes out of my nose and eating actual food for the first time in a month,” Li said. “That felt pretty good.”",[]

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

The Montreal-based airline says it is not proposing relaxing U.S. border restrictions that are expected to be extended until at least late August.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions — not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

article continues below

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

article continues below

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The league said in a statement Monday that over 600 players reported to their club's training facilities for Phase 2 — which began June 8 and allowed players to train in small groups at their teams' facilities — and 4,934 COVID-19 tests were administered to that group.

Phase 3 of the plan, the opening of training camps, started Monday.

The NHL said players who tested positive were or are currently self-isolated and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health Canada protocols.

Information on the identity of the players or their teams is not being provided by the league.

The league suspended its season March 12 due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The NHL is scheduled to resume play Aug. 1 in Edmonton and Toronto.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

article continues below

The program is the heart of the Liberals' promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give ""greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.""

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

article continues below

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Ferries loosens restrictions",['Roxanne Egan-Elliott'],,"B.C. Ferries is loosening some restrictions and increasing capacity as summer travel within the province grows.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

article continues below

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

article continues below

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 990 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1610 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 202 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There was one new COVID-19-related death recorded in the past day, for a total of 187.

Of the 187 people actively fighting off the disease, 16 are in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

The recovery rate has dipped below 87%, as 2,679 people have recovered.

""As we continue through summer, simple steps will help us to keep COVID-19 low and slow in British Columbia,"" Henry and Dix said in their statement.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others. We know that the more layers of protection we use, the safer we will be. Let's all 'layer up' by washing our hands regularly, using barriers, staying a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is challenging.""

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

The new listing did not specify which seats were affected on the flights, meaning any passengers aboard the flight should “self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the flight.”

Travellers arriving to B.C. from outside of Canada are already required to file a 14-day self-isolation plan upon their return. For flight 696, that period of quarantine ended Thursday, July 9.

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

article continues below

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

article continues below

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

article continues below

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

""If you're looking at your savings account and realizing, wait a minute, I may not be able to get through this next two, three months and beyond, that's probably another really big trigger.""

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

article continues below

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Full details of provincial court operations are available here.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

article continues below

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

Inspectors have issues 65 orders for the trade sector, 60 for construction, 18 for primary resources, three for public sector and two for transportation and warehousing, which includes taxis and ride hailing.",[]

Golf Canada reports that there were 17 per cent more scores registered with the national sport body this June compared to the same month last year. A total of 1,483,506 rounds were submitted to Golf Canada's handicap calculator last month compared to 1,271,782 in June 2019.

article continues below

""It was a pretty big jump from last year, comparing 2019 numbers to this year,"" said Adam Helmer, senior director of golf services for Golf Canada, on Wednesday. ""We were expecting that as golf has emerged as one of the safest activities, where people can be physically distant and we've reduced touchpoints.""

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

article continues below

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

228,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/covid-19/high-unemployment-343b-deficit-projected-in-liberals-fiscal-snapshot-1.24166665,"High unemployment, $343B deficit projected in Liberals' fiscal snapshot",[],,"OTTAWA — The Trudeau Liberals say they expect nearly two million Canadians to remain without jobs this year as the COVID-19 pandemic drags down the domestic economy and federal aid sends the deficit to a historic $343.2 billion.

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

article continues below

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

article continues below

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. The Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with virtual and in-person walk-in services available through the Gibsons Medical Clinic from Monday to Saturday. Please note that all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking people without a local family doctor.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

Here are today’s COVID-19 numbers for Monday, July 6, with numbers from Friday July 3, the last reporting period, in brackets:

New cases: 31 (13)

Total: 2,978 (2,947)

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 6, 2020.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]
244,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/covid-19/public-gets-inside-access-at-gibsons-library-for-first-time-since-pandemic-hit-1.24165700,Public gets inside access at Gibsons library for first time since pandemic hit,['Sophie Woodrooffe'],,"As of July 6, people wanting books from Gibsons and District Public Library will no longer have to order them like pizza – for the first time in four months, they can walk inside and browse the shelves themselves.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and lead author Dr. Danuta Skowronski with the BC Centre for Disease Control say the serology study determined the level of COVID-19 antibodies in hundreds of blood tests.

article continues below

Tests, gathered anonymously from Metro Vancouver residents whose blood was being checked for unrelated reasons, revealed eight times more infections than reported cases of COVID-19.

Despite that, both doctors say community transmission rate was low at less than one per cent, which they credit to careful observance of physical distancing and other infection control measures.

Henry says given the scant transmission level, what is now needed is targeted testing to determine who has been most affected by the respiratory illness.

She says testing would include health workers in long-term care, some ethnic groups and certain economically vulnerable populations.

Henry told a news conference in Victoria on Thursday serology testing will help determine if there has been transmission ""when cases pop up out of nowhere seemingly, if there has been missed transmission.""

She says when an outbreak occurred in Alert Bay off northern Vancouver Island in late April, serology tests were done on ""a good proportion"" of residents there.

""That gives us a better idea of how this virus is transmitted in community settings so we can more nimbly target outbreaks (elsewhere) as we go into the fall,"" she says.

Researchers relied on four measures, or assays, to identify COVID-19 antibodies in the blood of test subjects because no single assay is a completely reliable marker, Skowronski says.

So-called neutralizing antibodies are considered the ""gold standard"" of contact with a particular virus and Skowronski says such antibodies were found in blood tests analyzed in mid-May.

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it would mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed, supporting the low transmission rate.

""The flip side of that, of course, is that we cannot rest on our laurels, we cannot assume we are in the clear, because it also means there is still substantial residual susceptibility in the population,"" says Skowronski.

Henry says researchers are unsure how much protection COVID-19 antibodies may provide to those who have been exposed to the virus, or how long any protection might last.

""This study does not address that question,"" says Skowronski.

""It does, however, very clearly say that we do not have sufficient immunity in the population to prevent subsequent waves.""

That means it will come down to individual and collective measures of British Columbians to continue to keep this virus at bay, Skowronski says.

A government news release issued Wednesday said British Columbia recorded 21 new cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths by July 15.

There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered.

During these increasingly difficult times, the financial impact of this pandemic on all Canadians has been staggering, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better any time soon. Ongoing layoffs and the shutdown of non-essential services has caused many to face financial uncertainty with reduced incomes yet limited change in essential expenses, including servicing debt.

These circumstances are becoming increasingly dire for many, and it’s not surprising the majority of Canadians are more concerned about their financial health than they are about their physical wellbeing.

Here are five ways Canadians can help manage debt during the COVID-19 pandemic:

Restructure your current budget into an emergency budget

While it might be too late to save for this current emergency, it’s not too late to create a new budget based on your current financial circumstances. This may include a reduced level of income, changes in monthly expenses, and not knowing the long term financial impact this pandemic will create.

Include all family members in a discussion about reducing costs and consider cancelling or putting on hold non-essential monthly fees like subscription services. While self-isolating, put other monthly expenses like parking passes and gym memberships on hold as well, as these can all add up. The money saved can be used for important essential items and other expenses.

Apply for the help you’re eligible for

Losing any amount of your income can be frightening. As the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve, there are several resources available to eligible Canadians to help relieve some of the financial burden due to the loss of employment. Financial assistance can come from traditional Employment Insurance, municipal and provincial rental assistance programs for tenants, the Emergency Care Benefit program, or extended benefits at work, if available.

It’s important to submit any applications promptly as processing times may be longer due to the sheer number of applications and the possibility of reduced staff.

Look to your bank for assistance

Many of Canada’s major banks have implemented changes and leniency to lending rules in response to COVID-19. These changes are designed for people experiencing loss of income and businesses experiencing profit loss.

Mortgage payment deferrals, skipping payments, loan extensions, revised terms or even reduced interest rates are some of the things your lenders can consider. Contact your bank, financial advisor or credit union for further information to see if they are willing to work with you to help lessen your financial burden.

If you can, use deferred payments to create or deepen your emergency savings for the future as no one knows how long this pandemic will continue or its ongoing financial impact.

Consider a personal loan in an emergency

Personal loans don’t require any security and can be used for any purpose, making them an ideal financial resource in the face of an emergency. A personal loan is a flexible form of financing that allows you to access a lump sum with a fixed repayment schedule. This type of loan can be obtained quickly, especially through a licensed online lender.

Seek advice to ease the uncertainty

Things are difficult and there’s no shame in asking for help. If you’re experiencing looming debt issues as a result of COVID-19, or are finding your current debt-repayment plan has been derailed because of this pandemic, consider seeking the advice of a credit counselling service. Credit counsellors can offer tailored advice or enrol you (if you qualify) in a Debt Management Program (DMP) to consolidate unsecured debts into one, affordable, monthly payment. Creditors are more likely to accept a DMP in a financial crisis because some payment will be collected on a consistent basis.

“Times are really tough right now, and what we are seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic is completely unprecedented”, explains Loans Canada Chief Technology Officer, Cris Ravazzano.

“We are seeing a lot of volatility in the lending space, with some lenders slowing or even temporarily stopping their operations. On the other hand, many lending institutions are designated as essential services and are choosing to keep their doors open. As Canada’s first and largest loan comparison website, our close relationship with these institutions enables us to continue to provide Canadians with the emergency financial solutions they need. We have also made it a priority to maintain up-to-date information on COVID-19’s effect on the credit industry and invite Canadians to visit www.loanscanada.ca for the latest information.”

The impacts of COVID-19 are widespread, affecting all Canadians in a multitude of ways. If you’re experiencing financial hardship and are finding it difficult to cope with debt during these unprecedented times, please utilize whatever tools and forms of relief are available to help you manage during these circumstances. Although you may feel overwhelmed and uncertain, the first step to addressing debt is to come up with a plan.",[]

The sessions are offered online over Zoom, but will be interactive and allow for lots of sharing. I can’t wait to hang out in a virtual room with other writers.

Over the years, I’ve benefited so much from participating in writing workshops and especially in taking the plunge to share my writing with other participants. I remember well the first time I read something I wrote to a group in a writing workshop. My heart was pounding and I wanted to sink through the floor! But encouraged by the workshop facilitator, I found my voice, and those who know me also know that I haven’t looked back since my first novel was published in 2014.

article continues below

My workshop experiences really helped me grow as a writer. So now, I want to help other writers, especially aspiring writers, learn new skills, and most importantly, gain confidence in their writing. Because writing well starts with feeling empowered and knowing that what you have to say matters.

I’m offering the writing workshop over three two-hour sessions. Participants will complete short writing exercises and be encouraged to share what they’ve written—but only if they want to. No pressure! I’ll also deliver interactive presentations on a variety of writing topics such as character and theme development, plotting, research, editing, and publishing options.

Participants will receive worksheets and other materials to help them develop their writing skills.

The course also includes the optional opportunity to connect with me by phone to receive individual feedback about a specific writing project.

I’m offering two intakes in July: Tuesdays July 7, 14, 21 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. or Thursdays July 9, 16, 23 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

To enroll in the Tuesday or Thursday sessions, email me at carolcram@gmail.com. The deadline for enrollment in either of the two sessions is July 2, 2020. Please specify which day you’d like to attend (Tuesday or Thursday). Enrollment is limited, so don’t wait.

However, we will be posting video as soon as possible after the event. Meribeth Deen is creating a short documentary of the ceremony, the sign, and how it came to be.

Due to COVID-19 health orders, we ask that members of the public please do not attend the ceremony itself. To ensure everyone’s safety and to respect the specific wishes of the Skwxwú7mesh Nation participants, this event cannot be a public in-person event.

The sign will be unveiled June 21 (National Indigenous Peoples Day) with representatives from the Skwxwú7mesh Nation and invited representatives of Bowen Island. Squamish Nation will bless our new sign, as it is unveiled to welcome residents and guests to Nexwlélexwm (Bowen Island).

Again, to ensure physical distancing measures we ask that members of the public please do not attend this event in person.

Once completed, Deen’s full documentary will be available at bowenlibrary.ca and at thehearth.ca.

Pauline Le Bel explained the story behind the sign in her recent Undercurrent story about this historic event. Squamish people called this island Kwilàkm and Nexwlélexwm long before settlers attached “Bowen Island” to its shores. Now the island will recognize its original name with a sign at the Snug Cove Dock alongside the “Bowen Island Welcomes You” sign. The unveiling of the sign is part of the Knowing Our Place reconciliation initiative, which Le Bel began three years ago with the dedicated support of the Bowen Island Arts Council and the Bowen Library.

Funding for this initiative was gratefully received from the following contributors: Rina Freed of Source Environmental Associates, Bowen Island Municipality, who will install and maintain the sign, Heritage Canada and through a Neighbourhood Small Grant from the Bowen Island Community Foundation, Bowen Island Municipality, and the Vancouver Foundation.",[]

While specific timelines for each phase have not been provided yet, the guidelines give us framework for what conditions we might expect for the future of arts and cultural programming. We are hopeful and optimistic that we will be able to gather for cultural programming as a community as soon as it is safe to do so.

The Gallery @ Cove Commons will reopen soon, while following the new protocols of the Phase 2 plan, which suggests cultural spaces can reopen from mid-May onwards. In the meantime, private viewings of the current exhibition Forests of the Coast by Jean Bradbury can be arranged by appointment. Email the curator, Emilie Kaplun at curator@thehearth.ca

Artists in our Midst is a new program through the Hearth offering interviews, virtual gallery and studio visits and promotion of creative projects as a way to support our hard working artists who have been deeply affected by the closure of performance spaces, galleries and cancellation of cultural events.

Beginning this new series was a virtual tour of the current exhibition and interview with the artist, Jean Bradbury. Our next virtual offering featured a 15-day creative challenge by artist Tracy McLachlan ––a Panthera Big Cat Sanctuary fundraiser.

Currently in the works, we will offer a live online artist talk and discussion with Paul Deggan followed by another session featuring a virtual studio tour with his wife and skilled potter, Babette. Their son Tristan, who is an accomplished videographer and artist, will film the sessions. Since 2002, the Deggan family has lived on Bowen Island for part of the year. The summers for the last 40 years were spent in France. This year, it’s a little different (as it is for everyone) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Lock down” has inspired a new excitement for the Bowen woods in spring and a new body of work The Spirit of Place. Some of you may have spotted Paul sketching by the lakeside or in the trails with his signature Tilly Hat and plein air kit. With his many years of creating and teaching, Paul is a treasure trove of knowledge and inspiration. This will be a fun and interactive session and may inspire more.

We invite community members to subscribe to our weekly newsletter and follow us on social media to stay connected to the exciting projects that are in the works in the art scene on Bowen. Artists are encouraged to reach out to the Hearth if they would like to be featured by contacting creative@thehearth.ca.

The Hearth’s new executive director, Jami Scheffer, has arrived on Bowen and settled in with her dog, Roscoe.

You might see her through the window at the gallery office these days as she gets acquainted with all things Arts Council.

We wish Jami a very warm welcome and give praise to the search committee for finding the right person to lead the arts council into this new age and bright future. And we say a fond farewell to outgoing executive director, Jacqueline Massey. It feels very strange not to be able to connect in person and celebrate her many years of dedication and leadership.

We look forward to the days when we can gather again and celebrate with our wonderful creative community.

The Hearth acknowledges the valuable contributions that our dedicated volunteers make to the operation of our gallery and programs. Normally, we would have a party to celebrate during national volunteer week, but due to physical distancing, we will come up with other creative ways to honour our volunteers.

As you are aware, the Gallery @ Cove Commons is closed to the public until further notice and previously scheduled programming has been cancelled or postponed. While we miss the physical connection to our beautiful gallery, the exterior is being transformed! A huge shout out to the municipality and Bowenshire Landscaping for the work being done to make the exterior space accessible, functional and beautiful. Thank you.

The current exhibition, Forests of the Coast, paintings and light boxes by Jean Bradbury will be available as a virtual tour in the very near future. There will also be an interview with the artist available soon with a link on the Hearth website and social media. Artworks are being sold (Congratulations Jean!) even though the gallery is closed to the public and the exhibition dates have been extended. Arrangements can be made to view the works by contacting Curator Emilie Kaplun, at curator@thehearth.ca. Proper protocol as outlined by the health authorities will be strictly maintained.

Calls for entry have gone out for the 2021 exhibition season at the Gallery @ Cove Commons as well as the open call for the Saving Sea to Sky Exhibit. Information and applications are available on the Hearth website.

More online content will be on offer in the near future as we work together to support and nurture arts and culture in our community and beyond.

The Hearth sponsors groups and organizations so that they may offer the quality performances we are blessed with on Bowen. Members of the Hearth can also take advantage of the benefit of sponsorship of their events, which includes liability insurance ($25 fee required), enhanced publicity and ticket sales, both online and at the Gallery @ Cove Commons.

The organization’s new executive director Jami Scheffer arrived April 1, marking the end of Jacqueline Massey’s long run heading up the organization.

As a born and raised B.C.-er, Scheffer comes to Bowen by way of Invermere (a town with a population of just under 3,500 people near the Alberta border, though with thousands more people in the surroundings) where she was with Columbia Valley Arts Council for 15 years.

Like her predecessor at the Bowen Island Arts Council, Schaeffer was the first paid executive director of Invermere organization.

In the early 2000s, when the more than hundred-year-old Pynelogs Cultural Centre and Art Gallery got a half-a-million dollar makeover, the Columbia Valley Arts Council, until then always artist-run, hired its first year-round executive director.

“Fifteen years of, you know, taking an arts organization from the grassroots level to a well-running business,” said Scheffer.

Scheffer comes from a recreation and event planning background. She created the Invermere Music Festival, a live music series for the arts council, a Canada Day festival and was also the planner for the Wings Over the Rockies wildlife festival. “I tried a lot of events and programs and gallery shows and fundraising ideas over the years. So it was super fun,” she said.

After Scheffer’s mother, who she was caring for, died last year and with her adult children living on the coast, the time was right to move on.

“This job just kind of landed in my inbox and everything fell into place so easily,” said Scheffer. “It was kind of weird––it was like it was meant to be.”

Scheffer’s son was finishing a degree in Ontario and his school shut down, so he moved to Bowen too (though he’ll soon be leaving for a job on the mainland).

“It feels right. It feels like I’m at the right place at the right time,” said Scheffer.

Despite the pandemic, as an outdoors person, Scheffer is getting a taste of Bowen life. She’s been SUP boarding in Bowen Bay, mountain biking and exploring the trail systems with her dog Roscoe.

When it comes to Hearth operations, Scheffer is just starting to meet with people (virtually, of course).

“I don’t want to come in and change everything because that’s not who I am,” said Scheffer. “But I definitely have 15 years of experience and will maybe use some of that to maybe revise things a little bit or freshen things up a little bit or try some new things.”

In the meantime, Scheffer is looking for recommendations as to where to have her hair cut as soon as the pandemic lets up.",[]

The history that shapes The Kissing Fence is the Doukhobor experience in B.C., beginning in the 1950s and continuing to leave its mark on contemporary lives in Vancouver.

article continues below

Brian recreates a pivotal moment in that history when the RCMP launches a raid on the resident Doukhobor community at Perry Siding in the Kootenays on Sept. 9, 1953.

Author Brian Thomas-Peter - Jacqueline Massey

Their crime was public nakedness, the tactic famously used by the Dukhobors to register their opposition to military service, to public schooling for their children, and many other pressures from the state. The Canadian government added public nudity to the criminal code in 1931 in reaction to a Doukhobor anti-conscription protest. The Doukhobors had fled religious persecution in Russia and come to Canada because they were promised by the government of the time the freedom to live according to their religious beliefs.

In the course of the raid, the naked singing adults are brutally clubbed, arrested, and transported to prison. Their children are rounded up and taken to a repurposed tuberculosis sanitorium in New Denver where they are schooled. The “kissing fence” of the title is the chain-link fence through which Doukhobor parents on rare visiting days could kiss their children.

Into this scene of violence, Gerry Flanagan arrives: a cop with a conscience who is appalled by the raid he is required to join. In the commotion, he allows two children to escape to the forest. Throughout the novel, Flanagan is the only humane official voice. His instinctive resistance of the mindless oppression of the children is a relief from the inhumanity of his counterparts.

Nina, one of the children Flanagan shields from a succession of police round-ups, emerges as a key character. When finally captured and sent to the New Denver school, Nina is alienated by her suspicious peers but she wins their trust by her determined opposition to the school authorities. Her bravery is matched by Pawel’s, another child who emerges as a leader. Both characters have so much promise but their lives are disrupted by violence and divisiveness within and outside the Doukhobor community.

The historical sections of the novel are paralleled by scenes set in contemporary Vancouver. William is a shifty character who runs a successful but marginally legal small business on the North Shore. His late-night cycle ride through Stanley Park to liaise with a shady business partner ends in an encounter with an owl and a trip to the ER. These parts of the novel move at a brisk pace as William’s business ventures and personal morality spiral out of control. As the novel proceeds, the parallel sections gradually merge.

Small and not so small acts of resistance run through the novel – some of them life- and dignity-sustaining and some deeply destructive. The resistance always traces back to the rigid regulations and betrayals of local and federal governments.

Brian’s characters are amalgams of people he researched and heard about in his interviews with New Denver survivors. He says there is evidence to suggest that a small number of RCMP officers were sickened by their role in these events.

The Kissing Fence is a remarkably gripping novel. I was grateful to it for its moving depiction of a shameful and forgotten period in B.C. history and for its thriller-like pace that held my attention at a time when our unfolding daily news offers much to escape from.

Impromptu came out of an International Poetry Month challenge to respond to a daily writing prompt.

article continues below

Every morning last April, Jude would get up at 5 a.m., eager to rise to that day’s challenge.

“It was like unwrapping a Christmas present. I never knew it was going to be.”

One day it could be surrealism, the next an elegy, or a Shakespearian sonnet. By the end of April, Jude had 30 poems. But she liked the challenge so much that she asked for 17 more prompts.

“And I sent them off to my publisher and he said ‘what a great book!’” Explained Jude.

One of Jude’s favourite prompts was to use two lines of a Shakespearean sonnet and create a whole new poem.

“That thou among the wastes of time must go,/Then of thy beauty do I question make, you ask me once again” (that’s the Shakespeare part) becomes Jude’s own reckoning with aging. “I am but a thorny rose,/whose blossoms fair and sweet/doth bloom, in the deepest days of this long winter.”

Joni Mitchell’s 1970 classic “Big Yellow Taxi” also makes an appearance in the varied but always personal series of poems alongside Psalm 23.

“What makes these poems different is that within a strict structure I was always telling my own story,” Jude wrote in an email after our conversation. “What condensed for me was love.”“These poems are of light and love, betrayal and sadness, journey and quest.

“I received a gift each morning with which to explore my own world.”

Jude said that this is her favourite yet book. “It was the most challenging, the most difficult, the most rewarding and I’m very goal-oriented when I write...and I met every goal.

“Everything is autobiographical, almost,” Jude told me. “[It’s] like reading a story of my life.”

Prompt six, “Using “if” write about changing negative to positive,” became “Changes.”

“If I let go of worry I would be filled with the sacred reflection of/possibilities opening like a flower.”

“I’m pretty devastated about what’s going on with the world right now and feel pretty impotent,” said Jude. “This poem was the perfect way to change that.”

As the book is also essentially a series of writing exercises, Jude describes Impromptu as “a perfect book for writers.”

“Because so often writers say ‘I don’t know what to write about,” said Jude. “And here it is, all provided for you.” She’s even used the book in teaching students at Island Pacific School about poetry.

Impromptu is published by Ekstasis Editions and Jude is holding a book launch 4 p.m. March 8 at Collins Hall.

Come June, Jude will be at Joy Kogawa House for her next project.",[]

The singer-songwriter, who is playing a Hearth concert at Cove Commons Feb. 23, started her musical journey at 28-years old.

article continues below

Caro had been living the corporate life in Brazil for seven years and had anything money could buy.

“But [I] still felt empty inside, like there was something missing,” she says.

Then, she saw a small ad for a choir. She auditioned for the choir as a side-gig and made the cut. For four years Caro sang with the 20-odd voices of all sorts of backgrounds.

“It was a beautiful thing to experience just being part of something,” she says. They’d rehearse twice a week along with touring and it became a sort of lifestyle.

“That was what helped me break out of that routine because I realized that when I was singing was the only time that I felt like myself, that I felt like nothing was missing.”

But the choir ended and her marriage was ending and Caro needed a change.

So she moved to Los Angeles where she’d gone to school in earlier years and went into singing full-time.

“At that time being Brazilian was my was my only weapon,” she says, “was my only tool that I could offer.”

Through Craigslist Caro joined up with folks putting together a world band and then she branched into her own song writing.

“I was going through my divorce…and then all that process of finding myself and finding who I was and finding what I wanted,” she says. “It was what I was writing about. It was like a little journal exercise for me.”

They recorded an album that made it to the Grammy ballot for best world music album.

“And that was 12 years ago and now it’s been a beautiful journey I couldn’t be happier with myself and where I am with myself,” she says. “Musically speaking, I still want to achieve a lot but if I didn’t wake up tomorrow, it would have been a great life because I definitely have found myself.”

About five years ago, Caro went solo, meaning she writes and can perform all the music herself (though she still likes having a band) and this is the third year she’s been touring. She’s played in London and France among other places.

“My music has been able to connect with people from everywhere and for an artist that’s the biggest blessing.”

As for her show on Bowen, while it’ll be Caro’s first time here, islanders may recognize drummer Felipe Fraga from last month’s lauded Quarteto Nuevo concert.

Caro says that concert goers can expect a Brazillian pop music show but with classical elements such as Bossa Nova and Samba.

“Because everybody in the band is Brazilian, and we joke about it ––like everything we play ends up in Samba,” she laughs. “It’s how we’re programmed I guess.”

“Myself and the band, we try to really have fun with what we’re doing,” says Caro. “The goal is to just like share that fun with the audience.

“Just really connect through music.”

We encourage guests to join the fun and dress in theme as their favourite artist (perhaps Van Gogh minus his ear) or a character from a fantastic painting (maybe the Last Supper or Warhol’s Marilyn). We will award a prize for best costume.

The gala evening is the conclusion of our annual exhibit of local artists’ mini masterpieces.

Each year, local artists and a few from away donate their masterpieces on 8” x 8” canvases or mounted in frames generously donated by Opus Framing and Art. Our Visual Arts Committee and volunteers organize the exhibition and transform the Gallery @ Cove Commons with festive decorations. We appreciate the incredible support we receive from everyone involved.

The Gallery @ Cove Commons, fresh from its annual spruce-up, then reopens to the public on Feb. 12. We will resume our opening hours of Wednesday through Monday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on that date.

Drop by to see and be the first to bid on these original artworks. The anonymous mini masterpieces are sold by silent and live auction. The mystery of who the artist is is the game. All bidding starts at $125, an incredible deal for an original artwork from one of our much-celebrated artists or up-and-coming new talent. Paintings with two or more bids will go to live auction.

All shall be revealed at the gala as the auctioneer takes live bids on the various artworks and the audience finally learns the identity of the artist.

Each year, art lovers and partygoers come out in droves to attend the gala and live auction in anticipation of taking home a mini masterpiece. And in the process, by supporting this fundraiser, they help the Bowen Island Arts Council keep the doors open at the Gallery.

This year, more than 60 artists have created the spectacular pieces. Our amazing auctioneer Tim Hausch, of Shaw Cable fame returns this year, with the talented and irrepressible Marc Gawthrop providing musical entertainment. As always, there will be delicious treats and a cash wine bar.

Tickets are $20 for the Live Auction event on Feb. 29 and are now available online at: bowen-island-arts-council.square.site/mini-gala-tickets. It’s the often sold-out event of the season. Paper tickets will be available to purchase at the Gallery @ Cove Commons on Feb. 12. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the auction starts at 7:30 p.m.

Can’t attend? We accept absentee bids. Please contact either Emilie Kaplun at curator@thehearth.ca or Jacqueline Massey at executivedirector@thehearth.ca, or identify the Lot # of the artwork you are interested it, indicate a maximum bid, write down your name and phone number and leave this at the Gallery in a sealed envelope, no later than 4 p.m. Feb. 29. We will bid on your behalf up to the maximum bid offer. If you have any questions regarding the Mini Gala, please contact Emilie Kaplun, Gallery Curator at curator@thehearth.ca.

When I first heard her I was so taken by her exceptional song writing – her honest, vulnerable, exceedingly well-crafted songs that really raised the bar in my mind. And then there’s her unmistakable voice – beautiful, full of character and rich tone. She’s also a hell of a good guitar player. In fact, when I did a “My Playlist” show for CBC I included her song “Unravel” as one of my top 10 favourite songs. As is so often the case in the folk world, we crossed paths soon enough – first on a festival stage in Ottawa and I discovered what a wicked sense of humour she has – on and off stage!

Lynn is one of Canada’s most accomplished singer/songwriters, with 13 solo albums to her credit; a Juno Award for Roots and Traditional Solo Album of the Year; multiple Canadian Folk Music Awards including Solo Artist of The Year and English Songwriter of the Year; and several other awards for her with THE LYNNeS . Her song “Black Flowers” is on the 2017 Grammy-nominated North By South album by Claire Lynch. Her song “Three Chords and the Truth” is included in the BBC TV show Case Histories. Oh, the accolades and accomplishments go on.

One of the great benefits meeting and befriending other artists is being able to invite them to Bowen Island for a concert and sleepover. And that’s just what’s going to happen Feb.1, at 7:30 p.m. at our wonderful Tir-na-nOg Theatre.

There is much to celebrate: we’ve had another incredible year connecting with our community and building arts and culture on our island. Over the past year we welcomed more than 16,000 visitors to the Gallery; we presented 11 exhibits and the second annual Bowen Studio Tour and showcased the work of more than 170 artists. We’ve presented, co-produced or sponsored more than 12 performances and we’ve offered a dozen or so arts classes and workshops. We continue to work with the Bowen Island Municipality and advocate for a community centre, with a 180-seat performing arts space, and to top it off, we are busy networking with dozens of local and off-island groups.

None of what we have achieved could be done without the support of our members and volunteers. They are imperative to the work we do in building community on Bowen. We welcome community members to join our team of volunteers to keep the arts council and the gallery running smoothly.

It’s A Wrap! is on now at the gallery and the annual exhibit and sale features one-of-a-kind treasures created by more than 30 local artists and artisans. We’re open Wednesday through Monday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., right up to December 30. As a special treat, on Dec. 5 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and we’ll be open late to accommodate late night shoppers as will Connie Wright, Squirrel and Catching Stars.

Everyone is invited to the 32nd Annual General Meeting on December 8 from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at the Cove Commons. Following a short business meeting and elections, join us for a reception to bid farewell to Jacqueline Massey, outgoing executive director. Enjoy live music presented byAmber and Randy, along with festive refreshments.

We are excited to announce a new musical collaboration with Kay Meek Performing Arts Centre in West Vancouver. We’ll be co-presenting a series of world-class concerts at the Cove Commons. The 2020 series gets underway on January 18, with Quarteto Nuevo, followed by Caro Pierotto on February 23. Tickets are on sale for these fabulous concerts, which we expect to sell out.

Discounted ticket prices will apply for Hearth Members in good standing for these two concerts.

Plans are already underway for the 2020 Annual Mini Gala exhibit, and live auction set for Feb. 29, 2020. This is the largest fundraiser for the Gallery, and always a fabulous way to spend an evening.

We invite artists to create a mini-masterpiece for the event. Participants can pick up a canvas or frame, courtesy of our sponsor, Opus Framing & Art Supplies, at the Gallery. Participating artists will receive a ticket to the festive event.

Throughout the year, the Hearth sponsors groups and organizations presenting the quality performances we are blessed with on Bowen.

On Sunday, Nov. 24, at Tir-na-nOg Theatre, Ontario singer-songwriter and expedition host David Newland will join Canadian Geographic Photographer-in-residence Scott Forsyth to share their experiences from several summers (often along with Barney Bentall) travelling to the Artic and Inside Passage with Adventure Canada as zodiac drivers, hosts, crew, and entertainers, or in Scott’s case, photographer.

The trips are so inspiring that each artist has newly released works based on those experiences and the two have teamed up to share their works in concerts across the country. David will share songs from his latest album Northbound, a descriptive and moving culmination of seven trips to the truly Great White North. Scott will share images from his new book The Wild Coasts of Canada, an astounding collection of photographs and essays celebrating the grandeur of Canada’s most remote regions along the three ocean coastlines.

I can promise you a very special evening.

You can learn more about David’s music at davidnewland.com and Scott’s photography at scottforsyth.ca and adventurecanada.com.

If Barney can make it back from Calgary in time he will reunite with his shipmates for couple of songs.

When I first started the series, I stuck to presenting shows for friends who were going to be touring in the area whose music I knew well, with the added bonus of having a nice visit.

article continues below

But in the world of touring musicians the word gets out amongst performers and I’ve had many artists contact me about presenting shows. Between being unfamiliar and with limited time, I generally politely decline. But occasionally someone comes across my radar who is too compelling to miss out on the opportunity to share with the community.

Such was the case with The Wardens.

Band member Bradley Bischoff contacted me out of the blue about Bowen being a stop on their next tour and the story was so intriguing.

The Wardens – Scott Ward, Bradley Bischoff and Ray Schmidt, are a Banff National Park-based trio celebrating 10 years sharing their stories and songs, which rise from he very land they’ve protected for the decades as––that’s right––Wardens!

The Wardens’ music, blending folk, roots and western styles, is a piece of Canadiana reflecting the pristine wilderness of the Rocky Mountains.

They have performed widely across western Canada and from Alaska to California and shared the stage with Blue Rodeo, Pharis & Jason Romero and Ian Tyson.

Bradley, (vocals and guitar) was stationed in the rugged South Boundary region of Jasper National Park in 1981. Alone with a handful of horses for seventeen days at a time, he penned many songs by the dim cabin lights and the dusky summers spent in the alpine ranges.

Founding member Ray Schmidt (vocals, upright bass and mandolin) is currently posted in Rogers Pass, B.C., and works with grizzly bears in the interior rainforest of Glacier National Park. Ray founded The Wardens in 2009 with Scott Ward during the national park warden centennial after discovering the rich depth of music and stories within this region of Canada.

Scott Ward (vocals, fingerstyle guitar) was a national park warden for more than 30 years in Banff National Park. Scott’s music stems from a life lived in the deep wilderness of the Canadian Rockies as a horseman, search-and-rescue dog handler and technical alpine specialist. In 2001, Scott was awarded the Governor General’ s Award for Exemplary Service as a Peace Officer.

As a special bonus for this show the trio is joined by the world-class fiddler Scott Duncan. Raised in Calgary Alberta, Scott plays everything from Celtic fiddling, bluegrass, folk, classical, swing, country, Cajun, French-Canadian and other regional folk styles. I’ve heard him with John Wort Hannam and am thrilled to get another opportunity.

The concert is this coming Wednesday, Nov. 6 at Tir-na-nog Theatre.

The tickets are $20 and are available at The Hearth as a first step in collaborating with the Arts Council on future shows, or online at trustme.brownpapertickets.com.",[]

Now, two islanders are looking to bring those shadows to the stage, with your help.

“Our theatres are cardboard boxes,” explains Liz Nankin, co-creator of Bowen Fables, a free shadow puppet workshop starting Oct. 12. The Los Angeles costume designer-turned Bowener clasps a handful of silhouettes depicting one tragic Bowen incident –– a 1910 powder factory explosion in Tunstall Bay. It’s just one of several Bowen-themed story ideas the islander has for participants of the six-week series of workshops she’s leading with island filmmaker Daniella Sorrentino. Over the course of the workshops, puppeteers-in-the-making will each create a one-to-two-minute shadow puppet film. The films will be set against images from the Museum and Archives. The stories may be factual, based on real events, or completely invented.

“It is spring boarding, hopefully from the archives,” says Nankin. “But you can come in with your fable because that’s part of the lore.

“Everyone tells a story. How do you tell a story? How do you share it?”

“What it is, is an opportunity for the community to come together and create something that has cultural legacy,” says Sorrentino.

“Even in the seven years that I’ve been here, the community of Bowen has changed very, very rapidly,” she says. “I think that having that legacy is important because it allows the community to hold onto something that is distinctly Bowen.”

Though when this idea came about neither woman had extensive experience with shadow puppetry, both are experienced with aesthetics and storytelling. On top of her work as a costume designer for theatre, film and TV, Nankin has trained with a puppeteer in L.A. And Daniella, as a freelance filmmaker, has run a mobile film camp for the past few years.

Bowen Fables, funded through a municipal grant and crowd-funding, run in partnership with Island Pacific School and Bowen Island Museum and Archives, is open to puppeteers-to-be of all ages (though youth under 12 must be accompanied by an older person).

“In North America, particularly, there’s not a lot of opportunities for different generations to work together,” says Sorrentino. “People end up getting very compartmentalized.

“We’re hoping to get a really good broad age range out and skill range out to make these community days.”

The three-hour Saturday weekly workshops will cover storytelling, set-building, character development, puppet-making, storyboarding, story editing and more. Once the films are made, Nankin and Sorrentino will hold a public screening.

This October, nearly 130 years after the Borden murders, Lizzie’s coming to Bowen Island.

Next month, Theatre on the Isle is performing the Governor General’s Award-winning play Blood Relations by Canadian playwright Sharon Pollock.

In the first Theatre on the Isle play since 2017’s The Importance of Being Earnest, Calder Stewart makes his theatre directorial debut.

The Bowen-raised youth acting teacher is no stranger to the stage. Stewart started out acting at Tir-na-nOg as a six-year-old (shortly after he had moved to the island) and continued honing the art through his childhood until he moved off-island at about 20. At that point Stewart stopped doing plays in favour of a career teaching martial arts. A couple of years ago, Stewart returned to what he’d always wanted to do: acting.

While Stewart now lives on the mainland and works where he can in the industry, the (relatively) young director’s connection to Bowen is still strong and Stewart frequently acts in local plays (most recently, Much Ado About Nothing).

Stewart first read Blood Relations about a decade ago. Through the years, the play stuck with him. When contemplating directing his first play, Stewart knew what he wanted to show.

“It’s an incredibly well-written piece, there’s almost no wasted time,” says Stewart.

“It really speaks to me on the level of identity and the truth of these characters,” says Stewart. “It’s probably my favorite player I’ve ever read.”

The play is set a decade after the murders of Lizzie’s father and step-mother. Lizzie is visiting her friend, an actress, who is playing Lizzie in a play. The actress asks the real Lizzie if she “did it” (the real Lizzie was famously acquitted after a widely publicized trial, but popular opinion is that she killed her parents and got away with it). In response, Lizzie suggests the two act out what might have happened that summer a decade earlier.

“The author doesn’t try and make it a big mystery about like, ‘did she, didn’t she?’” Says Stewart. “Even though that’s a question that’s asked within the play, that’s not the point.”

Instead the play explores women’s societal positions of the time (one of the questions raised in the murder trial was ‘could a woman do this?’).

“It’s more about if we put you, the audience, into this situation, what would your opinions be? How would you feel about these things? Because it’s not okay the way that women were treated at that point,” says Stewart “Because what [Lizzie] wants and what she wants to be is definitely not a wife.”

“It’s all very human,” says Kat Stephens, who plays Lizzie’s actress friend. “We all pretty much know how it ends and yet this whole story, people are still going to be pulled in to see how and why.

“To see the raw, human traits that attract people to do what they do.”

“It was like the O.J. Simpson trial of the 1890s,” said actor Frazer Elliott. “This gives it a human side of the story.”

The play is a drama (not a comedy like many recent island productions) and though there isn’t explicit content, it isn’t directed toward children.

Blood Relations stars Kat Stephens, Morgan Darcy, Graham Ritchie, Ann-Marie Delawsky, Frazer Elliott, Sam Spear and Davin Killy.

It will run just under two hours at Tir-na-nOg and is scheduled so that people will be able to make the 9:30 p.m. ferry.

Show dates are Oct. 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26. The Friday and Saturday shows start at 7 p.m. and the Sunday show on Oct. 25 is a matinee. Tickets are available at Phoenix for $20.

“Hopefully [as] an October thing, too [audiences] will be a little bit in the mood for a little bit of a mystery and…the idea of gore,” says Stewart.",[]

She is a child of the island. Emily grew up free in a nurturing community exposed to nature, visual art, music, theatre and writing. Since I returned here 20 years ago, I have been amazed by the accomplished young people who have reaped the benefits of the island and are expressing it in their chosen fields.

Emily’s work is cutting-edge. Last summer I took international artist Evelyn Roth to visit Emily’s studio. She was blown away by the strong, exciting, work of this emerging talent. Emily understands form, colour and ideas.

September 18 to October 20, the Gallery at Cove Commons will be showing change/able––current work by Emily van Lidth de Jeude with a sound installation by her friend about us.

The change/able show offers possibilities. When you enter the gallery, there are gloves to put on, and a choice: this way or that way. The installation’s walls are filled with Emily’s paintings and you are free to rearrange them.

Emily grew up on Bowen Island before leaving at 17 to travel, work, and study. She was kicked out of the Royal Academy in the Hague, Netherlands, before returning to B.C. to study arts and sciences, finally receiving her BFA from ECUAD. She then moved back to Bowen Island and threw herself fully into parenting, volunteering, and teaching, following her passion for explorative learning and play as she unschooled her two children and developed various local programs. Now in her 40’s, Emily has spent half her life as an explorative learning facilitator and educator, and finally has created an installation based purely on exploration.

This is a show that will appeal to all ages. Bring your children in and keep up the Bowen tradition. The opening reception is 6 to 8 p.m. September 21.",[]

Fall brings with it an enticing variety of exhibitions, programming and events from the Hearth. The arts council on Bowen Island continues to uphold the mandate to further opportunities for the arts and artists and to work in a way that will socially and economically benefit our community.

Events such as the Still/ed Here presentation, a story of displacement and healing, coming to Bowen Island on Sept. 26, are an example of the social impact that arts and culture has on the local and global community. The Hearth is proud to present this free, interactive event to the Bowen community. This collaboration between a poet and a multi-media artist uses poetry, photography and new media called Augmented Reality, to tell the collective story of displacement as it shapes our world. Pandora’s Collective, an organization some of our celebrated Bowen poets belong to, sponsors this project. Join us at the library annex on Sept. 26, from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. Visit Still/ed Here.ca for more about this project.

Culture Days, the Hearth presents the second annual Bowen Studio Tour on Sept. 28 and 29 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Save the dates and invite your friends from the mainland to take the self-guided tour. Watch for the signs indicating open studios. Get the details and complete listing of participating studios and galleries at bowenstudiotours.com.

The popular Eat Drink Paint sessions continue with facilitator, Kathleen Ainscough. The next is one set for Nov. 16 and is inspired by Tom Thomson’s Autumn Birches. Check out the Bowen Community Recreation website to sign up for these programs.

Exhibitions in the Gallery @ Cove Commons have had great success this year with close to 7,500 visitors coming through the gallery from May to September.

New Works––sculptures and printmaking by four Bowen artists: Vanessa Hall-Patch, Julie York, Russell Hackney and Marty Levenson, continues until Sept. 16. Opening on Sept. 18, Emily Van Lidth de Jeude will have a solo exhibition titled change/able, an immersive, interactive installation with soundscape by Bevvy Swift.

Join us for the opening reception on Sept. 21, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The exhibition runs until Oct. 20. You may have spotted the artist Jose De Juan painting scenes around Bowen this summer. Lightscapes, a solo exhibition of his plein air paintings will run from Oct. 23 to Nov. 17 and you can meet the artist at the reception on Oct. 26, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

And calling all Bowen artists, it’s time to get your creations ready. Applications for It’s A Wrap! are available now at the gallery and the Hearth website. The deadline for applications is Nov. 3 and the exhibit runs from Nov. 20 to Dec. 30.

Membership in the arts council continues to be key to our ability to support arts and culture on Bowen Island and beyond the physical borders of the island. We welcome community members to join our amazing team of volunteers to keep the arts council and the gallery running smoothly. Working in tandem with the municipality, we’ve been intent on moving forward the community centre project while we await results of a grant application submitted in early January.

As the news of the resignation of Jacqueline Massey, the executive director of the Hearth, reaches the community, one can rest assured that she will be on hand for the transition to the new executive director. She will be leaving a strong organization in capable hands of a new leader, a strong board of directors and a team of dedicated volunteers and staff.

“Jacqueline’s decision has triggered reflections on all our many achievements during her tenure,” said Rob Gloor, chair our organization. “Her leadership, excellent rapport with colleagues and supporters, extensive knowledge base and incredibly strong work ethic will be difficult to match.”

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

article continues below

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Team Canada was electric all weekend, beating three of the top-four ranked teams in the world as 74,560 fans packed BC Place for the annual event.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

279,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/arts/opinion-bold-moves-needed-now-to-resolve-lower-mainland-livability-crisis-1.23797304,Opinion: Bold moves needed now to resolve Lower Mainland livability crisis,"['Jock Finlayson Ken Peacock Business Council Of British Columbia', 'Jock Finlayson', 'Ken Peacock', 'Business Council Of British Columbia']",,"It is time to get serious about housing, transportation, regional planning and growth in the Lower Mainland.

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

article continues below

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

His mother handed him her camera and told him to explore the garden. From that moment, he was enthralled by the world behind the lens.

That afternoon shooting insects developed into professional fashion photography, which eventually landed him in the front row seat of being a highly sought after travel photographer and videographer.

article continues below

For Sparling, travelling has been his job and life for the past two years.

After a few years of travelling the globe, Sparling has made friends with like-minded, equally passionate creators. They travel together, create together and inspire one another.

Over the past year, they realised that they wanted to start doing trips with “a bigger purpose and more meaning,” says Sparling. The idea is to use their massive influence for positive change.

In October 2018, Sparling and his mother, Tiffanee Scorer, founded Triplit.

Triplit’s focus is on telling stories with purpose and impact, rather than simply taking good photos.

The launch for Triplit comes to Bowen Island in August through a five day conference, facilitated by Scorer, Sparling and his fellow travel companions, some of the leading names in the travel photography industry.

The days will be filled with presentations, workshops, outdoor activities and connecting with like-minded individuals, growing a global community. Participants are coming from all over the world.

Sparling has visited roughly 40 countries and has come across many truths about the state of the oceans and pollution.

But he has also seen just how much of a change a country can make if they put their resources behind it. Bali, for example, has transformed itself over the past two years says Sparling.

“Bali’s been cleaned up like crazy which is cool to see,” he says.

“When you’re doing travel photography you’re always in new situations and seeing something super beautiful in a really cool place,” says Sparling.

Speakers at the conference include: Emmett Sparling; Chelsea Yamase, a leading female travel “influencer;” Sam Kolder, an influential travel videographer; Amir Zakeri and Timothy Sykes, creators of the documentary Save The Reef; Renee Hahnel and Matthew Hahnel, full time travel photographers based in Seattle; and Kalen Emsley from Tentree.

Sam Kolder recently released his latest video, one he has been working on for more than two and a half years about his brother’s tragic death, which ignited a spark across the internet and has been viewed by almost a million people in a matter of days.

The conference is the first step of building the community that they want, Sparling says. Traveling full time is not always easy but it’s a rewarding choice for him, as long as he is able to keep a healthy balance.

To Sparling, the essence of success is to “become obsessed with what you’re passionate about.”

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

Conducted by the hilarious character Maestro Oscar Stickman (performed by Konstantin Bozhinov), The Comedy of Music presents a satirical view on modern culture and a wonderful reassessment of the arts and their role in contemporary society. Maestro Stickman accomplishes this with his brilliant use of a multitude of musical instruments and an assortment of songs and dances, wrapped in layers of comical stories and anecdotes. Maestro Stickman’s seemingly endless talent is spread in all artistic directions as he satirically demonstrates that modern visual art is no more difficult to master than an exquisite Greek folk dance.

Maestro reveals his passionate side with a tender Irish ballad and an Argentinian tango, and in one of the more practical portions, Sir Stickman comically demonstrates what to do while on hold and which 1-800 line to call if you need a backup orchestra. A highlight of the show surely has to be Maestro’s playing of a Beethoven symphony on a comb as one of his brilliant ideas on how to reform classical music! Konstantin Ruslanov Bozhinov is a versatile musician, scholar, and entertainer. He specializes in improvisation, composition, and character comedy and enjoys a busy concert schedule as soloist, collaborator, and educator. Individuality and originality through improvisation and composition are at the core of Konstantin's philosophy and approach to music and theatre.

Because of the pandemic there was no physical contact, but I witnessed what I can only describe as a formal handshake between Skwxwú7mesh Nation and islanders.

Four members of the Squamish Seagoing Canoe Family (Alroy “Bucky” Baker K’etximtn, Stewart Sempulyan Gonzales, Mary Capilano, and Dennis Joseph) arrived off the noon ferry to do the ceremony. The first visit of the Canoe Family was in 2006 for the Voices in the Sound Festival and they paddled over in their 45-foot cedar dugout canoe. What an honour it was today, to place the red blanket on my friend “Bucky,” the speaker for the Squamish Nation, placing it in the traditional way so his heart would be protected, the headband around his forehead keeping his mind focused on the thoughts of the host family.

Dennis Joseph (foreground) and Stewart Sempulyan Gonzales - Len Gilday

The purpose of the ceremony was to separate the carver - Coral Louie - from the sign, which now belongs to the community. This also frees Coral to work on her next project. I placed the blanket, according to tradition, around her shoulders for protection and recognition. The blanket says we love her and want to care for her. The Coast Salish take their artists seriously.

According to Squamish Nation tradition, witnesses are invited to take in the ceremony and bring it back to their communities. Near the conclusion of the ceremony each spoke from the heart about what it all meant to them and how they will bring it back to their people and their communities.

The sign, described by Bucky as “a beautiful spirit” for which we are all responsible, is a visible manifestation of the desire for restoration with the people on whose unceded land we thrive.

“A powerful reminder of where we live,” said Chris Corrigan, a friend whom I called as witness to the ceremony.

Alroy “Bucky” Baker K’etximtn and Gary Ander - Len Gilday

“An amazing statement,” said Mayor Gary Ander, another called to witness. “As we invite people onto the island, it says we are together on the sign, together in our thoughts.” Next time you go to the Cove, pause and gaze at the two names for our island - Bowen and Nexwlélexwm - co-existing.

As a witness, Michael Yahgulanaas, called the sign “a big step forward, with another step to follow, I hope to be around for that next step.” I hope you are, Michael, and me too. We still have lots of work to do.

Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas - Len Gilday

If only there was some kind of medicine to keep your eyes dry at times like these. I managed –– with some difficulty –– until Dennis Joseph spoke as a witness. I will leave the last words to this Squamish Nation Elder and Knowledge Keeper, who carries two traditional names: a Hawaiian name meaning man with a strong heart and Xwechtàal, a Squamish name meaning serpent slayer.

“A healing journey has begun with this sign,” Dennis said. “We are no longer strangers. By sharing our ancestral name, our ancestors will know you from this day forward… A mighty bridge is being built and we have a foundation to work from.” Dennis expressed gratitude for the invitation, for being part of the ceremony. “It’s like coming home,” he said. “We are home together.”",[]

The hour of music, stories, reflections and meditation was held in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Proceeds from the fundraiser went to community bail funds and Hogan’s Alley Society.

Ellen Hayakawa

Ellen Hayakawa opened the event with an acknowledgment of the land and ocean where she invited islanders to learn how to pronounce Nexwlélexwm from Khelsílem’s YouTube video. “And to actually use the name when people ask you, where are you from and when they ask you about this island,” she said. “That would be a next step in decolonization.”

Hayakawa said her primary motivator to stand in solidarity with BLM was that her parents and grandparents were among the 22,000 Canadians of Japanese ancestry from whom the government illegally took land and property and put in incarceration camps during the Second World War. As a result she must stand in solidarity with those who are experiencing racism.

“We’re also invited at this time to look at the racism that each of us has inside of us––and I don’t exclude myself from that––and the racism that exists here in our community.

“This is the dawning of a new day, of a new time when we also have to have conversations about our relationship to land, about ownership of land.

“We have to look at our colonial relationship to lands everywhere and think about how we give back to the land and water.

“I invite each person to use their passions, gifts and talents and co-create a community and a world where we recognize all people as Brothers and Sisters,” she later said.

Next, Phil Adkins of Cates Hill Chapel sang a spiritual song, accompanied by Michelle and Matthew Harrison and organizer Chantal Russell of the Well invited people to discuss what compassion means.

Karen Windeler

Karen Windeler shared her experiences after moving to the island with her husband and two children three years ago. “When I showed up here, I didn’t even see the house––I was like, babe, I trust you, just pick a house,” said Windeler. “I didn’t know what the people would be like on the island.”

“I’m used to being one of the only Black people in the room,” she told the crowd.

“I remember one day, my husband [who is white] and I were at this function and I said to him, ‘Just once, I’d like to see someone at one of these parties that looks like me,’” she said. “So it’s so cute. Every time we went somewhere, anytime my husband saw a Black person, he’d be like, ‘babe, babe, a sister or a brother.’”

“It meant the world to me because he understood…you want to look over and you want to know that someone understands your plight in the world.”

Windeler also drew parallels between racism and COVID. “Racism is also a pandemic,” she said. “You feel unsafe being at a rally. Guess what, there are people like us that feel unsafe lot. Some people feel unsafe every single day of their lives.

“We have to teach our children very different lessons.”

Windeler recounted the experience of offering to check on her neighbour’s house when they were away but then seeing a car in the driveway when she went over. “I’m thinking, ‘[I’m] trespassing and…Black.’

“So I went home and I sent my husband because I felt that it was safer for him to go than it was for me.

“These are the lessons that we teach our children.”

But Windeler said she looks to how much has changed to find hope. “I try to be very positive. I think of all the things that we have achieved,” she said. “There is so much good in the world and I refuse to let it overshadow the bad that I see.”

“Yes, it’s hard. And I was angry. And I was sad. When you see people on TV that look like you that are dying, just for the color of their skin.”

While calling out the biases and discrimination that she sees and engaging in so many difficult conversations is emotionally draining, Windeler said if she doesn’t do it, it doesn’t help.

These days, she calls out her friends. “It’s okay because challenging someone is not labelling someone. Because I know that people have good hearts. And because it’s so systemic, you don’t even know that you have these biases.

“Hate is learned, but you know what the good thing is? That it can be unlearned.”

“And so thank you for being here, I love Bowen Island. My family loves Bowen Island.”

Windeler also added later that calling each other out is a two-way street, “My husband and kids check me, call me out every time I say something biased,” she said. “We all have prejudices and everyone needs to be bold enough and care enough to challenge each other to change.

Charlie Segal

Charlie Segal and his glee choir sang a heartfelt rendition of “Start of something new” and his brother William Segal and a friend recited resonant quotes from famous Black thinkers, writers and activists including Malcolm X, Trevor Noah, Maya Angelou and Frederick Douglass.

William and Charlie’s mother, Andrea Bastin, talked about her gratefulness when Windeler, as a Black woman, moved to the island as she and her husband had long talked about moving somewhere with more diversity (their sons are Black). “That becomes harder as you grow up––representation matters,” said Bastin.

William Segal (right) and his mother Andrea Bastin (middle)

Bastin invited the crowd to sit with their discomfort––acknowledging her and their racism. “We’ve got maybe 400 years of catching up to do and that’s ok,” she said. “We can catch up. We can talk. We can be challenged.

“So now, it’s my job to unburden my friends of color, my children, so that their weight in this lifetime can be a little bit easy.”

Lusungu Kayani Stearns lead the Tonglen meditation near the conclusion of the event. “This meditation practice allows us to replace negativity with compassion,” she said. “We’re in turn stronger, more resilient, and awake in the midst of heartbreak.

“The tremendous energy felt in this space where Here has the power to heal.

“I invite you to stay awake. Keep your hearts open to the suffering.

Lusungu Kayani Stearns

“Being awake makes us perceptible to action.”

Boat traffic and globalisation has increased dramatically since then, bringing in and killing off many species of seaweed.

As a biology student at UBC, I’m working with my phycology (study of seaweeds) professor, Dr. Bridgette Clarkson on such a study this summer and we need your help.

article continues below

I would like to invite all of you to help participate in science to help our coastal waters by collecting seaweed photos and uploading them to iNaturalist (a free app available for Android and Apple). The objective is to create a summary of all the species in the area and where exactly they are found. Typical maps of species habitats are very vague. Species may be listed as being found from Alaska down to the Baha Peninsula, but the individuals may be picky about where they live. If you have ever been out to Tofino, you’ll have noticed that the types of habitats and species therin can be very different from those on Bowen. There are even noticeable differences between places on Bowen. The Cove has fairly different speciation compared to Hood Point.

Using iNaturalist, anybody can contribute to and collect data for the scientific community while also learning something. The app is very simple, even for elementary school aged children. You find a seaweed on the beach, photograph it, then use the app to choose from its suggested IDs, and share. Datapoints such as GPS coordinates, time of day or year and the identification (or observations) are all kept together and uploaded to a massive database, which is then connected to an even bigger international database (GBIF). Your phone automatically collects all of this data but if you don’t have internet, or have location services turned off, adding these points of data is still very easy and quick.

You can use iNaturalist for identifying any form of life - seaweed, trees, bugs, fish, birds- basically anything you can get a good photo of. I want to see how many observations the Bowen Island community can make this year. I challenge Bowen Island to make 500 observations of seaweeds this summer. Even if someone has already identified the one you find, it’s still valuable information.

Whether scouring the beach or on an evening amble through the forest, iNaturalist drives you to find different types of life, not just the common ones. You can observe species in your backyard (be sure to mark any ‘captive’––i.e. plants in your garden––observations as such), or seaweed species on the beach. Please, introduce this app to your kids, your friends, your students, anyone and everyone. Citizen science becomes more effective as more people take part.

I would like to mention as a heads up that many species of seaweed can look very different from one another and still be the same species (similar to dogs) and some species of seaweed may look very similar but be completely different species (similar to mushrooms). If this happens, please label your observation as best you can as this will result in more people having the chance of reviewing your observation, this could be as vague as “algae.” Anything helps. Observations that have not been reviewed by other people won’t be uploaded to the databases until they have been reviewed.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions: tobinsparling@gmail.com.

Thanks everyone, I look forward to seeing your observations!",[]
286,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/community/art-of-the-dog-paddle-1.24157549,Art of the dog paddle,['Mary Letson'],,"My grandpa sent me a letter the summer of 1967 congratulating me on swimming all the way across King Edward Bay. I was four years old. He enclosed a dollar bill as a reward for my efforts. I still have the letter but was not so lucky (or smart) with the dollar and spent it on something important like penny candy. As children we spent our summers at King Edward Bay, learning to swim in the ocean with our eyes open under water like seals. We memorized the beach and shore line like it was our second home (because it was), and knew all the tidal pools, where the bullheads hid, when the tide was just right for diving off the “Big Rock” and the flattest rocks to stretch out to warm our almost blue bodies after hours in the bay.

Our parents were militant about the rules around swimming: no adult present meant no swimming. Period. Since our parents didn’t arrive at the beach until the afternoon, swimming never commenced until the tide was high, the water warming itself slowly over the rocks. Mom arrived at the beach in her black and white pinstriped one-piece, her beach bag heavy with a family-sized thermos brimming with her homemade lemonade called Imperial. At the bottom of her bag, there was a small, serious, plastic bag enclosing a CPR mask, something that as a child I found vaguely mysterious and a little scary knowing that it was a big deal if this equipment was ever required. It never was.

article continues below

I didn’t ever get formal swimming lessons, and other than my grandparents swimming pool, I only ever swam in the ocean during the summer. We all dog paddled our way around the bay, our heads above water to get from A to B, diving down when we needed to. Which was often. This is clearly a dated way to swim as I don’t ever see anyone dog paddling anymore. In fact, a quick Google search clarifies that the dog paddle was “…used by ancient humans and seen in Prehistoric cave paintings…” My parents weren’t ones to fuss with the latest trends.

I remember how adult all our parents were at the beach next to our splashing and dashing barefoot along the stony beach. I wondered how they could be so calm in the midst of so much fun. They strolled to the water’s edge, stepped out of their flip-flops to toss them up the beach out of the tide’s way. With a mincing walk, they made their way knee deep into the water to then stop and talk for what seemed a lifetime before lowering themselves slowly into the water. My dad however embraced the theatrical. He would lower himself into the water making hooting noises then submerged himself just until his eyes were above the water line, blowing bubbles and pretending to be a crocodile. Flipping himself onto his back he floated with toes pointed to the arc of blue sky, his arms out to his sides scalloping the water, still hooting. I marvelled at my dad’s ability to float. He was miraculous.

The summer my son was born, I spent long afternoons in the shade of the maple tree on that same beach nursing, reading, chatting, playing Scrabble with my Mom and yes, swimming. Clad in my Mom’s old two-piece bathing suit (the only thing that would fit my post pregnant curves) and with wee son in his granny’s arms, I took to swimming to the south point and back over and over and over. Thankfully, I shed the ancient art of the dog paddle for free style and – thanks to my dad’s genes – I had a knack for endurance. I found the long, submerged exhale comforting and King Edward Bay’s solitude restorative.

This summer I will take to another bay on the same island to train for my own personal event. In lieu of the annual SwimBowen event I will swim from Tunstall Bay to Bowen Bay (1.6 km) in late August. My love of ocean swimming sparked in me so many years ago with a humble stroke and rewarded so poignantly by my grandpa continue to buoy me. Dear grampa, look at me now. I do believe I have earned the dollar.",[]
287,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/community/q-a-aging-in-place-on-bowen-island-tips-from-an-interior-designer-1.24156672,"Q&A: aging in place on Bowen Island, tips from an interior designer",['Bronwyn Beairsto'],,"Barbara Wahler is a local professional interior designer of more than 30 years of experience, a member of the interior designers of Canada and a member of the American Society of Interior Design. She has a full-service residential practice with specialized training in kitchens and bathroom design. The Undercurrent recently chatted with Wahler about what islanders can do to adapt their homes to age in place. The following interview has been abridged for length, clarity and grammar.

BIU: Why do you think aging in places important for islanders?

article continues below

Wahler: I think it’s important to seniors everywhere, especially now as we’ve been watching some pretty ugly truths unfold about senior care options. Aside from that, there are so many aspects of Bowen’s special character and the quality of life that we have all come to really love here that we would sorely miss if we’re forced to leave because of age. And over the recent years, we’ve watched lots of people leave for exactly this reason.

BIU: What are some easy things people can do to make their homes more aging in place friendly?

W: There are a lot of easy things.

A lot of us have door knobs––switch those out to leavers which are much easier to manipulate if you’re suffering from arthritis. Same thing with cabinets: take any knobs off, drill a second hole and replace those knobs with a pole that’s easier to grab.

A really big one in my mind is lighting. As we age, our sight starts to decline and on a rainy day it’s pretty dull and dark inside a lot of people’s homes. You can improve lighting tremendously in terms of manufactured light: lamp light, surface fixtures. It can be as simple as replacing ceiling lighting fixtures.

The other thing with lighting is the issue of glare. That’s a really big problem for seniors. We live in a place where nobody likes to put anything on their windows because we want to be looking out at our beautiful view. But there are lots of non-obtrusive options, easy to raise or lower when you’ve got glare streaming in the window.

Another one is safety features and convenience items in bathrooms: add grab bars, a shower seat, a bathbench, change to a comfort-height toilet. A lot of homes have alcove tubs that can be so easily popped out and turned into a shower and the fittings can be changed to single-leaver fittings. That’s goes for faucets on lavatory sinks too. It is much easier for a senior to use a single-lever faucet as opposed to two leavers that you have to manipulate and fiddle with to get the temperature right.

Or just simply reducing clutter and adding some really good, easy-to-reach accessible storage options.

Or painting, adding colour. A lot of people here are afraid of colour because they think we live in this this grey environment and they don’t want to make their room dark. But the eye perceives lightness and brightness, not just from manufactured light, but also from contrast. So you can use color accents in a space that will actually make it a lot easier to navigate the space.

BIU:So then what are some of the more involved things to make homes more aging in place friendly?

W: More intense means more bucks––a complete kitchen or bathroom remodel. There are lots of guidelines about what one would look into to make those spaces more user-friendly.

Another thing is a residential elevator, which people think is scary in terms of cost and space, but several manufacturers have designed great small-scale residential elevators and it’s often easy to find a corner or a closet to accommodate something like that.

Look at moving a master suite to the main floor. Sometimes that requires an addition and adding extra space but often it doesn’t. Many times I’ve been able to say, hey, there’s this space here and if we move this wall and do this or that.

Adding a suite to be able to accommodate a professional caregiver too.

Or integrated technology: there are all kinds of wonderful systems like Control4 where you can integrate all of your lighting fixtures, your heating in a simple touch screen as opposed to having to manipulate switches. And it can incorporate alert systems like fall alert systems.

BIU: What are some common misconceptions you see when it comes to aging in place?

That in order to have a truly accessible space, it needs to be ugly. There is a basis for that misconception because 10-12 years ago when people started talking about this, you could only access products being made for hospitals or care facilities.

That is so not true now. Every major manufacturer has come out with the most beautiful things. You can design an accessible space in every possible style: traditional, contemporary, West Coast modern, etc. A bathroom can look like a spa bath in the finest hotel and yet be totally aging in place friendly.

[Wahler later added that interior design doesn’t need to cost a lot of money and that there are affordable options.]

I participated in a really interesting webinar the other day…aging in place has been the label for this for all of this time. And lately, professionals are starting to look at it a little bit differently: we’re talking about calling it living in place as opposed to aging in place.

BIU: When should one start thinking about this sort of matter?

W: It is never too soon. It’s been really interesting since the COVID situation began, all of a sudden I’m coming across young families who are starting to think seriously about this because they’re thinking about caring for their aging parents. They’re also thinking about the advantages of multi-generational living in this new normal where kids might be learning remotely or parents might be working from home. Also, young people have accidents and need a place to recover that is user-friendly. Or there are kids with disabilities. There are lots of good reasons to be looking at this, not just from the perspective of aging, and not just from the perspective of remodeling. A lot of developers now are being encouraged to consider this as they’re building new homes.

BIU: Anything to add?

W: There are easy ways to move forward with these initiatives without island shopping or off island labour. There are lots of good people, besides myself, here on the island to make these things happen.

With most of the easy options, the important thing is to get some good guidance in order to be sure that product choices are compatible with existing circumstances.

A little about Wahler:

When Wahler was a child, her father used to tell stories of being in the Navy and one of his favourite stories was about the time he and his buddies went AWOL to an island in Canada called Bowen Island.

“As far as my family’s concerned, I’m AWOL now,” laughs Wahler.

“When I first came here, I thought, okay, there’s going to be a price to pay for living in paradise,” she said. And for a few years she commuted to town where her clients were. But then came the turning point. Wahler read a story in the Undercurrent from Bruce Russell, explaining that the golf course was buying a trailer to use as a clubhouse and that they would be glad for donations from the community.

“So my husband and I were talking about at a dinner and we don’t play golf, but we both said you know, we should really make a contribution because we have so many friends who do play golf,” she said. But then another idea came to her––offering her interior decorating services without charge.

“Well, I did the project, and had lots of fun working with everybody out there. And that was the turning point for me. Since that time, at least 75% of my businesses been here on Bowen and In the past three years 90% of my business has been here on Bowen.",[]

Those of us at Bowen Island United Church cannot thank you enough for your generosity, your patience and your presence.

Thank you to the Bowen Island Legion for clearing your parking lot and allowing us the space within the Legion to make sandwiches, strawberry shortcake and more. Thank you to Artisan Eats for supplying us with the containers that held our yummy, slightly messy, shortcakes. Thank you to the volunteers who came out Friday to slice strawberries and the volunteers who came out on Saturday to prepare sandwiches and shortcake and to serve our community with a smile and with your own heartfelt generosity. To Bronwyn and the Bowen Island Undercurrent-thank you. To Heather and Barry Adams, thank you.

Above all, thank you to the Community of Bowen Island who hopped in your cars and brought your own enthusiasm and support to B.I. United Church. Indeed, we all look forward to this annual event when we can gather, visit, share stories and linger on the lawn. This year was different. But thanks to you, it was a huge success. As many of you know, we had enough for some and not for all. To those of you who were turned away once we had sold out, thank you for your patience. With this year’s circumstances and an uncertainty around the number of people we would be serving, our inventory only stretched so far. Due to the support of the community, we closed early with a sold out sign posted in the parking lot. We were overwhelmed. Thank you so very much.

And one more thank you. Lynn Williams, our Minister of Music (and so much more) and Sheila McCall, our chair of the board, this would not have happened without your dedication, energy and insistence that yes, this year, COVID or no COVID, our annual “Strawberry Tea,” would happen. And so with your energy and willingness, it happened. Thank you,

As the minister at Bowen Island United Church, my heart is warmed and I am deeply grateful to all of you who support us. These days we need each other more than ever.

When she puts it on, she knows she’s going to work in a public place. And she knows this is not the time for playing or socializing or eating or drinking; it’s only for focusing on her job: listening and communicating to me if there are sounds I need to know about. It’s a good thing she loves her job because I might never know if she chose to, for example, ignore my ringing phone.

Shay’s suit has two components: a red vest with “Lion’s Foundation of Canada Dog Guides [LFCDG] Hearing Dog Guide” written on it and a head harness called a Halti. The Halti looks a bit like a muzzle but doesn’t prevent Shay from opening her mouth as widely as she wants. With the leash connected to the Halti and the collar, I can feel where Shay is turning her head even when I’m not looking at her. Thus, I am aware of her reacting to sounds beside and behind me—even when I cannot hear them—and this gives me a sense of security that I have not known since my first hearing loss when I was four years old.

Gaining more confidence in moving through the world is an aspect of having a Dog Guide that I never anticipated. Having coped with my disability since I was small, I thought I was fine. I did not realize how very constantly I was on the alert, always trying to use my other senses to compensate for the enormous gap where hearing ought to be. When I was a child, I saw a poster at the Western Institute for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing that showed the words “Silence is golden.” “Golden” was crossed out and replaced with “lonely” and “isolating.” Even then, the truth of this correction struck me viscerally.

Since I learned to speak before my hearing loss (no hearing in my left ear, moderate to severe loss in my right ear), my voice does not reflect that loss. People therefore tend to assume the loss is minor and treat me accordingly, even when I tell them that I’m hearing impaired. Naturally, this leads to misunderstandings. Much more emotionally challenging for me, though, is the everyday experience of feeling excluded and isolated. For 55-odd years, I’ve relied on lip-reading and guesswork and this extra layer of effort is literally exhausting.

With Shay dressed for work and by my side, people actually believe me when I say that I can’t hear. When I tell them that I need to read their lips, they remember more often to look at me when they speak, and they’re more accommodating when I ask them to repeat something for the third or fourth time. They’re also less likely to think me stupid or rude for not understanding them the first time. For me, the difference is astounding and somehow liberating. And it’s all because of Shay.

The bulk of Shay’s work, though, happens at home where she remains on duty even though she’s not in her suit. She alerts me to sounds like the doorbell, door knocking, timers, my morning alarm, my phone, the fire alarm, and someone calling my name. For all but the fire alarm, she gets my attention by placing her paw on me, then leading me to the sound’s source. For the fire alarm, since I wouldn’t want her to lead me into a fire (!), she instead spins around three times. Now I’m more comfortable in my own home, another thing that I hadn’t realized was possible. Sometimes we play a game where I or someone in my family hides the timer in an unexpected place and Shay has a wonderful time searching it out. She’s so proud of herself when she finds it! And of course she gets big treats. As our wonderful instructors at Dog Guides Canada said, “We work for money; they work for treats,” which really isn’t so different when you think about it.

Shay does love her treats and is very clear about her favourite ones. The ball—a particular ball that’s chewable but bounces well—is up near the top. And grooming is a frequent highlight, since she must be as clean and presentable as possible when we’re out in public.

We share work and playtime and walks and Shay loves her Shaymobile, the bike trailer in which she rides. Only when Shay is in her crate a couple of times a week does she have complete time off. In this way, Shay’s life is a bit different from some of the other Dog Guides trained at LFCDG, like the vision ones whose primary work is outside the home.

In addition to Hearing Dog Guides, LFCDG trains Vision, Seizure Response, Service, Autism Assistance, Diabetic Alert and Facility Support Dog Guides. Their policy is no force-based training, and this gentle, loving, consistent approach is reflected in all the people who give their time and love to breeding, fostering and training the dogs, who grow into happy, enthusiastic canine citizens whether they graduate from Dog Guide training or become family dogs instead. LFCDG relies on corporate and private donations to fulfill its mission of assisting Canadians with a medical or physical disability by providing them Dog Guides at no cost. Since the actual cost of training a Dog Guide is $25,000, this is quite a feat. This year, LFCDG’s main annual fundraiser raised one-sixth of what it normally raises, so the deadline has been extended and the goal revised dramatically downward. If you’re able and interested, please do donate (www.walkfordogguides.com/virtualwalk) to support this work which makes such a very great difference in the lives of so many people. Shay and I are registered as a participant, so you can donate via us if you wish (walkfordogguides.com/locations/walker.cfm?ID=9933&EventID=2367).

Since Shay and I go everywhere together, our lives are now so intertwined that we know each other’s rhythms intimately. It’s an interesting partnership in which Shay knows that, when it comes to sound, she takes the lead and I follow. Her confidence in her hearing and my trust in her build upon each other. Yet, close as we are, Shay is not my dog. Remember that $25,000 cost to train a Dog Guide? LFCDG retains ownership of its dogs so that they can re-home a dog should they judge that its skills are not being used or it is being ill-treated. Oddly, for me, this fact is a reminder of how very lucky I am to love and work with this tremendously talented canine companion whose skills and devotion expand my world.",[]

However, no more live performing to packed houses up on Cates Hill has not stopped ‘Theatre on the Isle’ from providing Bowen with quality play production.

Since April 6, TOTI has been producing online theatre ‘meetings’ on Zoom, using local actors, naturally, and performing a play reading virtually every Monday evening at 7:30 p.m. They plan another two readings before taking a hiatus for a month or so.

article continues below

TOTI board of directors members spearheading the project, Kat Stephens and Calder Stewart, say it has been a joyful ride and both emphasize it’s about fun, fun for the actors and the audience of islanders who click the link and join them online for live theatre.

There have been technical glitches, like the time an actor lost their internet feed as the play began, missing their ‘entrance’ (removing a cover from the computer camera) but reconnecting in time to deliver their first line. But with that emphasize on fun it’s all remained, well, fun.

With a dollop of learning thrown in.

“We began with The Real Inspector Hound by Tom Stoppard,” Stephens, who has appeared in dozens of plays locally, told the Undercurrent. “It’s lengthy for a one-act, lots of characters, and a twisty plot, and was far trickier than I realized to stage in this online format.

“So we opted for smaller casts and simpler plots moving forward, and tried splitting a couple of full-length shows over two weeks: Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood, and another Stoppard piece called Rough Crossing.”

Stephens, a recreation programmer with the municipality by day, said the “short, punchy comedies” they turned to include The Brute by Anthon Chekhov and, last week, Pyramus and Thisbe, the play-within a play from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

“We even did the world premiere of Wingmen, an original play by Bowen’s own Frazer Elliott,” Stephens said, noting that the video for that short play is available for viewing on their Facebook page.

Their opening show featured a who’s who of long-time island TOTI actors like Heather Hodson, Tina Nielsen, Helen Wallwork and Martin Clarke. Other veterans, like Maureen Sawasy, Jackie Minns, Colleen O’Neil, Tanya Voormeij-de Zwart and David Cameron, have played since. Some of the younger actors appearing in a TOTI online Zoom production include Annabelle Coon, the ever-amusing Davin Killy, Sarah Cormier, Bev Rapley, Morgan Darcy and noted island juggler, Tobi Volkmann. They’ve used in total some 25 Bowen thespians.

The cast meets online for a brief rehearsal and, for the most part, that’s it. Show time comes and scripts are arranged somewhere easy to read, most actors arranging them onscreen next to the minimized view of the other actors. Faces come and go as entrances and exits are achieved.

They get upwards of 30 online audience computers (often entire families watch) and one feature Stephens and Stewart enjoy is the comments after each performance.

“Mostly it’s been enthusiastic messages like ‘Bravo!’ ‘Well done!’ ‘You’ve always been my favourite child,’ and ‘You’re so pretty!’,” Stephens says. “Most of these are written by my mother and Calder’s mother, though, so take what you will from that.

“Paul Hooson and Jude Neale send us some really lovely heartwarming kudos via email after each reading, and sometimes they tell us how their dog Molly felt about the show too, which is a rush as she really is quite the critic.”

To attend an online play meeting/reading all the prospective audience member does is go to TOTI’s Facebook page and click on a link. You can also sign up for TOTI’s newsletter and have the link sent to your inbox.

Stewart notes that when the pandemic is over “and the day comes that we can safely put on a live theatre performance – we will absolutely be ready.”",[]

Some creatures enjoy the wet, others the dry; some high airy cliffs and others dark caves. Let’s take a look at some of the different critters you might see on different hikes all across the island.

For spotting bald eagles and turkey vultures you’ll want to head up to rocky bluffs, usually with big old-growth conifers nearby. Sitting on the bluffs awhile, I’ve often seen more than a half-dozen of these large birds at a time, circling and diving, riding the air currents.

Great spots on Bowen for watching raptors are Dorman Point and Mt. Gardner (try the lookout halfway up the Laura Rd. trail and, of course, at the summit).

Garter snakes can be common on Bowen Island and can be found in a variety of locations but they really enjoy warm dry sites, preferably on sunny rocks and under dry leaves. Sometimes you can find them basking in the sun, right in the middle of a trail!

A few local areas to spot snakes are: the Evergreen Trails, Mike’s Lorg, or the trail around the Golf Course.

It’s not too difficult to plan a hike to see some Pileated Woodpeckers. Your best bet is to venture deep into the forest, where there are large hardwood trees all around. They enjoy snacking on insects in large dead snags.

Good places on Bowen to find these colorful birds are: along the mid-island trail, or deep into the woods on Mt. Collins or Mt. Gardner.

If you’re in the mood to hang out with some red legged frogs or rough-skinned newts, you’ll have to hike in marshy wetlands, surrounded by ferns, or venture into dark wet caves with standing water. Keep your eyes peeled, as they have excellent camouflage!

Some good areas for locating these critters are: along (i.e. under!) the boardwalks of Killarney lake, along the banks of Terminal Creek or inside the old mines on Mt Gardner. Just remember to keep quiet to hear the frogs’ song, and not scare them away.

Sometimes it is not so much the “where” but “how” you hike that will give you natural rewards. For example, deer are ubiquitous on Bowen but you might not see any if you are traipsing through the bush while chatting at high volume. They will bound away, long before you reach them. Many birds will also take off if they hear a loud party approaching but might stick around if you are walking silently, alone or with a single companion.

Planning a hike based on nature viewing can add a new dimension to your exercise routine. It can connect you to the world around you in an entirely new way. With these tips in mind, I hope you create many lovely nature-filled hikes, filled with many new wildlife friends.",[]

At the same time, the Community Economic Development Committee (CEDC) has been hosting weekly virtual meet-ups with Bowen’s businesses to discuss their many hardships during this extraordinary time.

Sixty-two Bowen islanders attended the town hall to participate in the conversation focused on the roles that businesses, residents, and visitors all have to play as we navigate through the coming months together. The panel consisted of a variety of subject matter experts: Glenn Cormier, owner of The Bowen Island Pub; Jody Lorenz of Tourism Bowen; Rod Marsh, chair of the CEDC and owner of Quickway Paint and Drywall; Jen McGowan, BIHCF director and BIM Emergency Program Coordinator; Dr. Carolyn Nesbitt, psychologist; and John Pickles, Environmental Health Officer, Vancouver Coastal Health. The event was hosted by Sheree Johnson and facilitated by Chris Corrigan.

The conversation began with a look at the current status of the virus in the Lower Mainland where the daily new case count is very low.

In mid-March, B.C. was looking at new cases in the twenties and now the new cases are in the single digits, VCH’s John Pickles noted. It’s a much better situation today but there is still a small amount of activity out there, he said. Everything the public has learned in the past few months is still applicable: stay home if you’re not feeling well, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and stay two metres apart. All of these will help with a smart re-start, said Pickles. He added that social distancing is the best protection and businesses should look at how to maintain this distance in their COVID safety plans. Industries’ guidelines are on the BC CDC and office of the public health officer websites.

Jody Lorenz said that the municipality and Tourism Bowen Island are upholding the phase two guidelines asking people to stay home as much as possible and to stay within their own communities. The visitor centre is currently closed as the island isn’t welcoming visitors, though some visitors are coming anyway. “As soon as we do restart…a part of our service is going to be welcoming people and making sure that they understand the health protocols,” said Lorenz. “I do see our role as very important and is helping to continue to manage visitors, it's just this year is going to be a little bit different.” She said that she’s hoping to work with the municipality and the business community to assure that Tourism Bowen is supporting the current health protocols and doing their part to reinforce the messaging however they can.

When it came to the age-old question of bathrooms, Lorenz said there’s a lack of public washrooms in the cove but pointed to the ferry washrooms, the Metro Vancouver outhouses by the ball diamond and perhaps a municipally funded outhouse by Gardena Rd. at the entrance to Crippen Park. “If anybody does use a so-called public washroom, the onus is on the person using the washroom to make sure that you're washing your hands after or using hand sanitizer,” said Lorenz.

One out-of-province home owner wanted to know when summer residents can return to Bowen. John Pickles reiterated that there are currently no official orders that prevent inter-provincial travel, however, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, has recommended that we stay in our own communities. That may change as we monitor through phase two. If things continue in the right direction, some decisions will be made mid or to the end of the month as to what the next phase will look like. In discussion later, McGowan said that while specific messaging for summer residents (when the travel restricting guidelines lift) hasn’t been on the radar, she can look into “welcome home or welcome back” messaging for people who may be unfamiliar with Bowen-specific protocols.

The next stage is Phase 3 and is currently scheduled for between June and September and depends on whether the virus transmission rate remains low or in decline. Phase three is when B&B owners can begin to welcome visitors again using the WorkSafe BC guidance for the hotel sector.

The Bowen Island Pub, which was take-out only at the height of the pandemic, re-opened for in-house dining June 3. Owner Glenn Cormier talked about re-fitting his business for the COVID era. “You have to really look at your entire operation and rethink all aspects of it,” said Cormier. He noted the importance of protecting employees and customers alike. “We make sure that from the moment [customers] come in the door, it's clear to them…what needs to be done and help them understand what their role is in it,” said Cormier. The pub has created additional positions, including a person at the door at all times to talk to customers, in this safety effort.

“When I talk about the restaurant industry or hospitality in general, every venue is very different,” said Cormier. Under the industry guidelines from WorkSafe BC and the BC Restaurant Food Service Association, the pub is in the same category as McDonald's or Starbucks. “Each individual operator needs to take the guidelines…and adapt them to their particular venue,” he said.

Education is key, Cormier highlighted. “We've had several staff meetings to make sure everybody understands what their role is,” said Cormier. “Make sure that they understand their responsibility in reporting to us their own health issues if there are any and helping them to understand what role they play in keeping our customers safe.”

Cormier said that customers have been very accommodating and respectful. “Everybody has been very understanding and they're doing their part.”

But even after in-house dining resumed, the pub’s take-out business remains strong––it dominated the business last Friday. “Obviously keeping people apart is important and take-out is a great way to do it.” Cormier said that he’s looked at alternative outdoor options, though as tables get spread out servicing them becomes a challenge. One option is putting picnic tables in the parking lot on the former pub site so that people who’ve gotten take-out can sit there.

The use of masks was of great interest to the group. There’s been no clear recommendations to businesses from WorkSafeBC unless you cannot maintain social distancing. It is each business’s responsibility to assure their venue accommodates social distancing. The Pub’s employees, for example, are required to wear masks when delivering food and drink to customers, or other situations where they cannot maintain a 2-metre distance. And Glenn added his own personal behaviour, “When I walk into a business, be it a grocery store or any other business, out of courtesy I put a mask on because as the customer coming into someone else's workplace, I feel it my obligation to do that,” he said. “Obviously with a restaurant, you can't. The customers have to eat and drink.”

As a closing reminder, participants were asked to please stay up to date with Dr. Henry’s briefings and recommendations and keep these conversations going in our community. And of course, above all else, be kind.

It's called Nexwlélexwm: Squamish people called this island Kwilàkm and Nexwlélexwm long before settlers attached “Bowen Island” to its shores. Now the island will recognize its original name with a sign at the Snug Cove Dock alongside the “Bowen Island Welcomes You” sign. Coral Louie, the same sign maker who made the Bowen Island Welcomes You, made the new sign. The sign will be unveiled June 21 (National Indigenous Peoples Day) with representatives from the Squamish Nation and select Bowen Islanders (due to COVID the ceremony isn’t open to the public but will be livestreamed.) Read the story here.

Reopening: several restaurants reopened for in-house dining this week including Doc Morgan's, the Bowen Island Pub and Barcelona. We'll keep up with the details as they're released in this evergreen story.

The new BIM boss: I caught up with the new chief administrative officer this week. Liam Edwards comes to Bowen from the province’s Local Government Division of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs. As the new islander had been working remotely from Halifax, he and his family moved across the country during a pandemic. Read the interview here.

This week’s update noted that there's a section of the virtual EOC that answers frequently asked questions such as “what is my social bubble” and “self-isolation is mandatory for people returning to Canada from international travel. What do I do if I see someone breaking this rule?”

Mayor Gary Ander’s video message denounced the race-based violence seen in B.C. in recent weeks.

“Bowen Island is not immune to racism and discrimination of all kinds,” he said and shared the Lieutenant Governor’s ‘Different Together’ pledge.

Ander also noted the need to keep social bubbles small, two to six people from outside of the household, and “air hugs only at this time.”

Looking to next week:

BIM’s emergency program coordinator is presenting the draft emergency management plan to mayor and council in a committee of the whole meeting. The plan “guides the operations, organization, responsibilities, and coordination of the Bowen Island Municipality Emergency Operations Centre in response to an incident or threat of an incident on Bowen Island.” Islanders can tune in Monday at 5 p.m. on YouTube.

On the slate for Monday’s regular council meeting:

A delegation from Bowen Trail Riders Association is presenting to council on the topic of motorized use of Mt. Gardner.

In April council voted to send a letter to the province asking that the province ban motorized vehicles on the Mt. Gardner Crown lands. The proposed letter from council is on Monday’s agenda. Dozens of islanders wrote letters to council in support of the prohibition.

Council is set to consider second reading of the Nectar Yoga rezoning on Gardner Lane. The applicant wants to create a retreat centre on a portion of the property.

The Islands Trust chief administrative officer provided a briefing note of the advantages Bowen has as part of the Islands Trust, read it here.

For a smile:

It was the last week of submissions for the Legion’s talent show. There's guitar playing, singing and Tiger King reenactments. Voting for all three weeks is open until Monday at noon.

Editorial

For at least the third time in 2020, we’re in a historical moment.

We saw the Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders and solidarity demonstrations across Canada bringing the issue of Indigenous land rights and title to the fore. In March COVID interrupted daily life, devastating many––especially those already marginalized. But now is not the time to look away.

The Black Lives Matter protests are making sure we ignore racial injustice no longer, and as uncomfortable is it is to confront our complicity, now is not the time to look away.

If white Canadians are feeling smug about our relationship with racism––it was just a year ago that the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found that Canada is complicit in race-based genocide in a 1,200-page report. We said we’d do better then. What have we done? How many of us read that report?

On Bowen we’re quick to say “not here, not us” when people, often people of colour, speak up about racism on-island. People who’ve experienced racism have had to defend their own experiences.

I’ve spent a lot of time this week wondering how to address Black Lives Matter, as someone with a platform but someone who is white. It’s not my voice you need to hear right now.

Please follow Black people, influencers, thinkers, journalists, storytellers on social media and add their works to your reading and viewing queues.

There are lists galore are circulating these days of books to read about the relationship between racism and whiteness. Some include:

So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo

White Fragility: Why it’s so hard for white people to talk about racism by Robin DiAngelo

Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria? by Beverly Daniel Tatum (thank you to a Bowen Islander for suggesting this one).

Hundreds more resources are a Google search away.

After reading even just one of these books, listening and hearing stories of Black people and people of colour, maybe we can start saying when it comes to racism yes Canada, yes Bowen, yes us.

Then we can do better. (And be open to being told how we can do better!)

Over Christmastime, Islanders Michelle and Matthew Harrison were matched with a five-year-old boy from an undisclosed country in Africa (the country doesn’t want its name mentioned). The couple was on an adoption list for about three years before the match came through.

“We were supposed to travel in March-April to go and get him and our family was going to go for a month and spend time in his country and work on bonding with him and just be together as a family,” said Michelle (the Harrisons have another 13-year-old son). But then COVID hit.

“Shortly after that borders started closing and the border to the country closed,” she said. “We haven’t been able to get to him. We don’t know when we’re going to get to him.”

While it looks like there could be flights in June, questions of borders and differing quarantine protocols add a layer of uncertainty. As it stands, it looks like just Michelle will go and she could spend two and a half months in quarantine as she travels to and from her son’s country.

“There is another mom who will be traveling with me who’s also picking up her children,” says Michelle. “So that’s a bit of a saving grace because we’ll have each other to travel with.

“We’ve never met but we talk every day.”

Under the original plan, the family was supposed to spend their new son’s fifth birthday together but instead they held a birthday party for him here. “It was sort of this bittersweet,” said Michelle.

“I think the one thing that I’m thankful for is that he doesn’t know about us yet,” she says. They don’t tell the children until the parents’ travel is booked. “It’s this really sad thing of him not knowing that there’s somebody out there waiting for him. But also…his little five year old brain isn’t waiting on somebody who’s not coming and doesn’t know why they’re not coming.”

“We know that he’s safe. We know that he’s well taken care of. We know that he’s nurtured,” said Matthew. “But it’s just prolonging and prolonging...a whole life to come live [here].”

“The crazy thing is, he’s our son,” said Michelle. “On paper and every document he is a Harrison at this point.”

“I always say to people, if your son was in another country and you couldn’t get to him, you would do everything you can to fight to get him.

“We can’t get him.”

But there’s still the anticipation.

“I’d say there’s a celebration and a euphoria,” said Matthew. “We feel so close to him. And the photos and the videos we’ve gotten…a day doesn’t go by that we don’t mention him 100 times.

“Michelle’s unbelievably diligent every morning just looking through all the news items and talking to people.

“I think kind of quite literally, it’s going to be one morning Michelle’s going to go right, that’s it, I gotta go,” said Matthew. “And then be gone for two and a half months.”

“There’s also the idea that I’m leaving my husband and my other son here,” said Michelle. “I’m leaving one son to get the other but we don’t really have choice.”

The Harrisons connected with a family who adopted a little boy who is their son’s best friend––the two have grown up together and slept side-by-side. “He has a little friend here waiting for him, he doesn’t even know his friend is here, but his friend here knows that he’s coming,” said Michelle.

This other boy’s family travelled to get him just before COVID hit and met the Harrisons’ son. “We get all these little nuggets of gold from them about what he’s like and his personality”

Another little girl nearby was adopted from the same place. “There’s three of them that, they’ll be able to speak their language together,” said Michelle.

“He’s got his brother, his family and his best friend and he doesn’t know he has any of those things,” said Matthew.

The Harrisons’ older son is “unbelievably stoked” about being a brother, said Matthew. “It’s going to be Christmas morning times 1000 when his brother gets here, but holy smokes this is the longest Christmas Eve of all time.”

But the Harrisons note the racism that will differently affect their two son’s lives (their new son is Black.)

“I’m so glad people are speaking up and fighting for racial justice,” said Michelle. “And I hope that in my son’s lifetime we see change towards this because he is one of those people who will be affected.”

“We don’t realize that we have white privilege until one day it hits us on the head and we see it,” she said. “We don’t think that we’re contributing to it in any way, because we’re not out there doing racist things…in some ways we do it without doing it by not saying anything about it.”

“I think about having a Black son and the difference that his life will look like from my other son, and that makes me sad and angry, and the whole gamut of emotions but then I think, Okay, so let’s do something about this.”

“For my nephews, for my brother-in-law for the black men around you, for my son, for all those people who are disadvantaged and can’t speak up for themselves for all the people who are affected by this, for all the mothers who lose their sons and all the little black boys who turn into black men. We have to stand up and fight because it’s time. It’s time. It’s been time for way too long.”",[]

Even after moving here, Bowen Island Municipality’s new chief administrative officer is still looking for long-term housing for his family.

And it’s with that introduction to one of Bowen’s hot issues that Edwards started his tenure in BIM’s top job May 25.

article continues below

While previous CAOs have commuted to Bowen, Edwards says it’s important for him to live on-island. “I’ve always been of the mind to live in a community where I work,” says Edwards. “If I’m going to be successful at this job, I figure I need to really be part of the community to understand the needs of mayor and council and of community in general.”

Edwards hasn’t spent much time on Bowen but both he and his wife have lived on Gulf Islands and like the island lifestyle (Edwards is quick to point out that every island is unique and has its own flavour.)

While having spent much of the last three decades out West, Edwards and his family spent the past four years in Halifax and Edwards worked remotely, leading a team in B.C. from afar. (So the virtual all-staff meeting on Edwards’ first day was nothing new for him.)

As he explains it, with the province of B.C. (where he worked for the past 14 years), Edwards wore three hats.

Under the first hat, Edwards was in charge of all local government finance. He and his team would draft and amend legislation relevant to local governments’ finances and worked with every city, town and regional district on their financial matters. All audited financial statements and all long-term borrowing (except in the case of City of Vancouver) would come to Edwards’ office and to him for approval.

“Any significant financial implication for a community would generally go through me,” he explains.

The second hat was working with communities on their infrastructure needs. This could mean drinking water, waste water, energy, recreation, or anything in between. Edwards and his team helped with funding and planning, as well as dispute resolution over servicing agreements.

“Often it was around water,” he explains. “[Drinking water and waste water] always became the hottest issues in terms of trying to help two communities resolve a dispute over shared services.”

The third hat was as deputy inspector of municipalities, essentially a statutory approving role, explains Edwards. While the province is less involved in approving specific bylaws these days, there are still some instances when there are significant financial implications that communities need provincial approval. In those cases, the bylaws would go to Edwards for approval.

Though this job is a shift from Edwards’ previous one, the plan was always go into local government––it just had to be the right time, right community and right place.

“I really loved my job with the province because the sphere of influence and impact was really significant and you could see it anywhere you went in the province,” says Edwards. “But you’re still that that much more removed from actually really being on the ground.”

“Local government is, to use the colloquialism, where the rubber hits the road,” he says.

Edwards acknowledged the work of his predecessor, Dennis Back, in helping the community navigate the firefighters dispute, the departure of former CAO Kathy Lalonde and then COVID.

When asked about priorities over coming months, Edwards says he looks to the staff. “It’s immediately apparent how strong the staff are here and how competent and capable they are,” he says.

“I can tell already that Bowen Islanders have a high expectation of their services providers and rightfully so, they pay taxes and so there’s an expectation that they get a good value for those dollars,” says Edwards. “And the team here take it very seriously.”

“I come from a lot of experience in infrastructure and finance,” says Edwards. “And I can see already that Bowen’s current slate of initiatives is very ambitious. And so taking on more, I think might be pretty challenging.”

Before even starting this job Edwards faced a challenge: moving across the country during a pandemic.

“Our plans for getting here changed so many times,” says Edwards. He, his wife, his nine-year-old daughter and five-month-old puppy were going to fly and then they weren’t. They were going to rent an RV and then realized they could be taken for tourists. At one point they were going to buy a truck and camperize it.

“What a crazy experience that would be to drive across the country in a pandemic,” muses Edwards. “But at the end, we decided no, that’s just too much.”

The family ended up flying across the country a few weeks ago. “It is very strange moving to a new community in COVID. Even so I appreciate the welcoming of Bowen because we were really worried about what it would be like showing up on island,” says Edwards “It is still really challenging because while people are welcoming, I think it’s going to take a lot longer for us to integrate.

But the family has tried to get out as much as possible in their weeks since arriving. “We feel really at home here. It’s really grounding.”

“So far, I’m impressed with the volume and the magnitude of the things going on Bowen and I really look forward to just becoming more a part of the community and understanding the local terminology.”",[]

AEDs: There are now 23 outdoor AEDs in place, as a result of the efforts of the Rotary Club, the Bowen Island Municipality and Amanda Ockeloen of Lifesavers First Aid Training. We are encouraging representatives from those communities that do not presently have an AED to contact us to find out how the system works. Our contact people are Allard and Amanda Ockeloen.

House numbers: Those blue number plates with a small Rotary logo on them are to be seen everywhere on the island. Islanders risk missing a vital delivery if you do not have a clearly visible sign at your gate. Check at the pharmacy for a flyer to find out how to acquire one or contact Sheila Webster.

BIRD: We have worked closely with BIRD in their initiative to acquire a new bin, and as a result of our volunteer work spearheaded by Ross Patterson, we were able to fund a large portion of the new bin cover. It will soon sport a Bowen Rotary logo on it.

We will be volunteering at BIRD again this year so that we can support our various projects.

Thirteen young women in Rwanda rely on us to fund their education and we cannot let them down so this year’s event will be a virtual run. That means that participants will run or walk 5K or 10K in their own time and on their favourite route and send in their times. Prizes will be draw prizes rather than place prizes. We hope that Bowen will step up to the mark for this event, as 100% of registrations and donations go straight to help out these young girls at high school and university in rural Rwanda. Our contact person is Hilary Butler.

Rotary Trails Guide: A new edition will be published this month. In the meantime, islanders are encouraged to pick up copies at the Pharmacy or Ruddy Potato. Many people do not know that there are good hikes everywhere on Bowen Island, apart from Crippen Park and Mt. Gardner.

NERP: Several of our members are NERP volunteers, and our club is offering support to the NERP in their various initiatives.

International Projects

Banderas Bay, Mexico: We have raised funds to help support the building of a women’s shelter in this area of Mexico. Ross Patterson has spent time and effort on this project.

Costalegre, Mexico: One project for repairs in an elementary school in the Barrio area has been completed, and we are sending a further donation for repairs at a middle school in El Ranchito.

Apart from projects, we have a good program of guest speakers at all our meetings, so Bowen Islanders are encouraged to reach out if you would like to try us out! We are open for new members! Our website is www.bowenrotary.com. Have a look!",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

302,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/community/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

It is a very special project and he has offered it for a very special cause. It will be sold to raise funds for Dr. Alexandra Morton, a marine biologist who is working to study, and save, wild salmon. Behm is looking toward the local community for help with the logistics.

Behm has been interested in Dr. Morton's work for the last four years. He met her personally in 2009 when she walked from North Vancouver Island to Victoria to raise awareness of the plight of the Sockeye salmon. Behm joined the march of supporters north of Nanaimo. Dr. Morton's research has revealed the devastating effect of sea lice that infest the Atlantic Salmon raised in open pens in BC's coastal waters and then attach themselves to young fry as they swim past into the open ocean. The sea lice stunt the salmon's growth and make them weak. As a result, they become easy prey for predators. And recently, Dr. Morton has identified a new threat: the ISN virus. Behm is impressed by Dr. Morton's integrity and was looking for a way to help.

Last Christmas, Behm worked on a card and developed a pattern for fish scales. ""That gave me the idea for the print,"" Behm said. He started with the project in March and added, ""It took longer than expected; the process was very challenging.""

The result is a stunning 63 cm by 95 cm print. It is an embossed image of a salmon on a background of a four-colour screen print that shows the Sockeye's life cycle. There are the eggs and the fry on the way downriver to the sea. The adult salmon then return from the ocean to freshwater where they change form and colour. The cycle end their lives after spawning. The print is done with interference colours that give the impression of a transparent coating that shimmers green, blue and red when viewed at different angles. The embossed image in the centre was produced with a hand carved plate.

Behm is a senior member of the art institute in the printmaking section of the Studio Arts Faculty at Capilano University. His instructor, Wayne Eastcott, told him that a print like this hasn't been done before.

The limited edition will have approximately 100 prints to be sold at $1,000 a piece. The price includes taxes, shipping and handling. Dr. Morton has written that she appreciates the effort and has offered her list of 20,000 email contacts as a means of promoting the sale. Since Dr. Morton operates on a limited budget and all her funds go to research, Behm has offered to oversee all other aspects of the fundraiser.

The Bowen Island Arts Council will display the print at its table at the BICS Christmas Craft Fair and Behm is looking for additional local support. He would like to find someone to help him with communication, monitoring the orders and payments, banking, packing and shipping.

In its quarterly outlook, the BCREA predicted that Greater Vancouver home sales on the MLS for the whole of 2018 will total 37,200 units, which is down 10.7 per cent compared with 2017 – but that transactions will recover somewhat in 2019 to rise 3.7 per cent.

The report said the average Greater Vancouver home sale price this year will be $1.08 million, which is 4.7 per cent higher than 2017’s average price of $1.03 million. BCREA added that it expected a continued slight rise of 2.3 per cent next year, to just over $1.1 million. This average encompasses all property types and all areas of the region, and doesn’t take into account larger variables between different property types and neighbourhood sub-markets.

“The housing market continues to be supported by a strong economy,” said Cameron Muir, BCREA chief economist. “However, slower economic growth is expected over the next two years as the economy is nearing full employment and consumers have stepped back from their 2017 spending spree.”

Across the province, residential resales are forecast to fall nine per cent to 94,200 units this year, following 103,700 unit sales in 2017, and stay flat in 2019. However, the BCREA said that B.C. sales are “expected to remain above the 10-year average of 84,800 units into 2020.”

“Demographics will play a key role in the housing market over the next few years,” added Muir, “as growth in the adult-aged population is bolstered by immigration and the massive millennial generation enters its household forming years.”",[]

Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

“A District of Sechelt resident was observed impersonating a bylaw officer and issuing fake parking tickets over the weekend,” a July 13 post on the district’s Facebook page said. “The fake ticket is a photocopy of a bylaw infraction warning, which would never be issued with a fine.”

The district said one of its staff members was on the receiving end of one of the fake tickets and reported it immediately. The person responsible has “been spoken to [and] has agreed to not impersonate a bylaw officer or obstruct bylaw officers.”

The district is advising people that if they get a bylaw violation notice or ticket and aren’t sure if it’s legit to contact the bylaw enforcement office at 604-740-8480.

This isn’t the first time fake parking tickets have shown up on windshields in Sechelt.

In late 2018 several people reported returning to their vehicles to find a ticket for $142 from “Sunshine Coast Parking Authority.”

RCMP at first thought it could be a scam because the ticket gave a website people could go to make payment, but it was later confirmed to be a prank.

The offences on those tickets included the usual parking violations and obviously fake ones like “Thinking only of yourself/laziness” and “Not keeping a safe level of blinker fluid.”",[]

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

315,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/news/gathering-potentially-disastrous-data-1.24170058,Gathering potentially disastrous data,['Dan Falloon'],,"A Vancouver company is synthesizing and analyzing data to unearth more information about landslide susceptibility in the Sea to Sky.

Minerva Intelligence has launched the Sea to Sky Landslide Map, available with an account at https://map.sea2sky.minervageohazards.com, as a pilot project.

article continues below

Minerva's geohazards lead, Dr. Gio Roberti, explained that the project brings together a wide variety of publicly available data from the provincial government and uses its cognitive artificial intelligence to synthesize the information.

""The software that has been developed mimics the human thinking process,"" he said, noting that the software can act more quickly than the human mind.

Roberti said that the project was built off the company's work in mineral exploration. Tracking granite, for example, could lead to veins of useful minerals or gold.

""After this first application in the mineral domain, the idea was, 'Why not try to do the same thing in the natural hazard domain?'"" he said, noting that the process for geologists is fairly similar when analyzing for not only landslide events, but floods, earthquakes and wildfires. ""They gather all the data, look for a specific type of soil and some categories of log stiffness, for example, because we know that some slopes are worse than others in terms of landslide likelihood.""

Among the information the software considers are soil layers, rock layers and slope maps. An example of a situation that the software looks out for, Roberti explained, is one where there are weak rocks on a steep slope in an area where the trees have recently been clear cut.

""We know that when the trees are clear cut, the roots die and they don't hold the soil together,"" he said. ""That's where it's likely to have a landslide in the near future.""

Among the map's long-term applications are insurance to disaster reduction to real estate.

""When you buy a house, you don't know if it's on a good slope or a bad slope,"" Roberti said. ""We hope this can bring some transparency to the process.""

The map also includes 24-hour and 48-hour forecasts, which Roberti explains can be used for emergency management situations, as it can track factors such as precipitation and ground movement.

""You want to know where it's going to rain the most and you can take a mitigation measure,"" he said. ""If you know it's going to rain a lot in a creek, then you can monitor it.""

Though the map is currently accessible for the public free of charge, the company will move to a subscription model in the future.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.”

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

He is currently serving 4.5 years, minus time already served for possession drugs, including fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking.

article continues below

The Squamish Chief wrote about Noel's charges and conviction, so we were interested in what he had to say for himself now, while behind bars.

When we spoke with him, Noel was in a room in Mountain Institution, a medium-security facility in the Fraser Valley where he is serving part of his sentence. A corrections officer dialed the phone and handed it to Noel, then he was left alone to speak with us.

What follows is a version of that conversation edited for length and clarity.

Q: Your issue was dealing drugs. There is an opioid crisis and people are dying. Do you think about that?

A: When I was into drugs, that is all you think about — getting drugs.

You are desensitized to all that. Now that I look back, it is not only the deaths, but it is also destroying families. Putting people in jail. It destroys lives all the way around. It destroys communities. It is bad stuff.

I was too deep in it. But now I look back at it and I understand.

Q: Some people are likely going to give us heck for talking to you. The argument would be why talk to you, given what you did and being in prison. What do you say to that?

A: I would say alcohol and drugs — I have been into them deep. And crack cocaine, I did that from 2003 to 2010.

Even when I restarted doing drugs I was doing meth.

Once you are stuck in that cycle, it is so hard to get out.

With the drugs, you will mess up your family. The drug is so strong that it destroys lives.

I am done.

I was clean for six years. I know I can do it.

The only way I made my way out the first time is to find God.

I messed up again, but I know that I have reconnected with God again and I know when I get out, I will be good with it.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about Mountain Institution and what it is like there for you?

A: It is a 120-man unit.

You eat in the cafeteria. You get yard-time four times a day, for one hour each time. But right now because of COVID-19, we are only getting one yard a day.

Basically, we stay on the units the whole day.

Q: What was it like to be in there and the pandemic sweeping the globe? Were you aware of it when it first started?

A: Yes. We aren't allowed to get newspapers, but we saw it on the news. The gym is closed, we couldn't get any visitors. I didn't get sick.

Q: Can you tell me about how you came to Squamish and when?

A: I came from Quebec. I was in Whistler in 1995 and moved to Squamish in 1996.

It was cheaper in Squamish. I was only 21 and I was working construction and after a few months, one of my friends said he lived in Squamish and was going to travel.

I stayed at his place until I found a place of my own.

Q: And you worked mostly construction?

A: We were doing drilling and blasting back then for a contractor.

I worked doing some salt masonry.

Then I worked running an excavator and loader for a landscaping company.

Q: Obviously, something in your life went sideways, given where you are. What is your perspective on that?

A: My emotions got the best of me. I had gotten married and it went sideways.

Q: Do you struggle with drugs?

A: I did.

Q: Why do you think that happens?

A: I think a lot of people have trouble dealing with their emotions.

I got out of jail in 2012 and I was clean for six years and a productive member of society and then in 2016 when my marriage when sideways, I went ""Frick It!"" and I threw everything away. I thought I would party for a weekend, but I ended up going back to the way I had been living.

Q: What was your upbringing like with drugs and stuff like that?

A: My parents are not drug addicts. My dad was a weekend drinker, had two companies, was a hard worker.

I wasn't raised in that kind of environment. I was raised well.

Q: Do you think there is enough support in the Sea to Sky for people who want to manage their substance use?

A: I think it is pretty good. There's people like Lisa Young at Sea to Sky Community Services, if people need help, they are good.

And there is harm reduction and people to talk to.

I think there is some good help, but when somebody is not ready, they are just not ready.

But I will tell you one thing, I am ready now.

Q: There is talk of the decriminalization of drugs, say as Portugal has done. What do you think of that? More harm reduction and less criminal prosecution, would you like to see that?

A: I am an extremist. Some people can be functioning addicts, but no. I couldn't do it. I don't know if it would be that good, personally. I would still be an extremist.

Q: Does prison give you the chance to reflect on why you hurt yourself in this way?

A: Yes. The federal system has good programs. I did the three-month program. If you really wanted, you can do a trade in here too.

Q: When you get out, what do you want for yourself?

A: I still have until 2022, I am going to a drug rehabilitation house for a few months. Then I can have a job. I will be in a halfway house after that.

When I am working, I hope to put money away and rent a place, get to have weekends there, slowly.

Q: If you picture your best future, what would it be?

A: I am going to be drug-free. I think I want to get into car detailing and slowly maybe sell cars and maybe get a dealer's license. Or maybe even mobile car detailing?

Q: What are you looking forward to the first day you are out?

A: Dairy Queen, coffee and donuts.

Q: Anything else you would like people to know?

A: I would like them to know that once people are on drugs, it changes them. That is not the real person. That is the drug that you are seeing. It is sad. If someone you know is struggling with drugs, maybe take them to the gym or for a hike. Help him slowly to get better. For myself, if I would have gone to the gym and saw some gains and would have been happier with myself, that might have changed things. When you are on drugs you become unhappy and depressed.

Q: There's a lot of writing and understanding now about how addictions are linked to trauma. So the addiction is a symptom of something else?

A: Yes, I would say so. Trauma, mental health issues. And some people also hurt their backs, end up getting prescribed medication and then end up on street drugs.

Q: Why did you agree to do this interview?

A: I don't know. I just wanted to be helpful.

Why it matters: The program brings cost relief to businesses hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and is intended to support employment.

article continues below

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

article continues below

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

330,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/news/about-that-squampton-saying-1.24168385,About that 'Squampton' saying,['Jennifer Thuncher'],,"It started with online posts June 28 condemning the term ""Squampton,"" which is seen on stickers and other items around town, and has been for two decades.

There is also the similar ""Straight Outta Squampton"" moniker that is a play on the 1988 U.S. rap album and song by N.W.A., ""Straight Outta Compton.""

article continues below

The recent posts about the term ""Squampton"" put out a call to action for people to remove the stickers if they have them and to educate others on ""why it is problematic.""

""Today, the town of Squamish, where a small population of Skwxwu7mesh people still live, is otherwise filled with affluent young families who are here for the beautiful scenery, endless adventure activities, and proximity to Vancouver,"" the post reads, in part.

""With the world taking a hard look at racism right now, this mocking of Indigenous peoples needs to stop, and banishing 'Squampton' stickers seems like an easy place to start.""

The reaction to the posts was swift and intense online and off.

At the time of this writing, there are 777 comments under the original post on Instagram.

Many resorted to name-calling and telling the poster to ""be quiet"" and to ""go back to Toronto where you belong."" Some joked of causing her harm.

The Squamish Chief has agreed not to name the poster, as she fears for her safety after the backlash.

Others chimed in that they also found the stickers troubling.

Several people contacted The Chief to say they found the stickers problematic in a 2020 context and many longtime locals who were in town when the term was coined contacted us to say it was a point of pride from a time when Squamish was the underdog.

Tantalus Bike Shop was selling the ""Squampton"" items, but has recently stopped after reflecting on the issues raised in the firestorm online. Store owner Al Ross said he didn't appreciate the way the issue was raised in a confrontational manner online by a newcomer, but added: ""Squampton was born during a time when Squamish was looked down upon by others. We do realize that times are changing, and what was once a message of community pride, might be offensive to some today. To keep peace in our town, we decided to retire the 'Squampton' brand,"" he said in an email.

Asked for comment on the name, the Squamish Nation sent this statement from Coun. Orene Askew, who is a Squamish Nation spokesperson and is Black.

""I know that many Squamish residents, particularly those who grew up there, have a strong connection to the nickname, and it's been a source of pride for their hometown. I don't think anybody is saying the nickname was created with racist intent. But there doesn't have to be intent for something to be perceived as racist or offensive by a marginalized group,"" she said.

""What the people of Squamish really need to think about is whether their attachment to a nickname is more important than the feelings of the Black people who are saying this causes hurt for them. At the end of the day, it's not up to non-Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) to decide what is or isn't racist or cultural appropriation. We're in 2020 now, and it's time we all listen to BIPOC folks, and learn and grow together.""

Annette Henry, a professor at UBC's Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice, says that ""Squampton"" is a problematic term.

She noted that Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, was subjected to racist headlines that used the same ""Straight Outta Compton"" phrasing — even though Markle, who is Black, was born and raised elsewhere in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

It is almost always those in the dominant group making assumptions about people who aren't in the dominant group when these sayings are coined, she said.

""Look at all these terms. It is always white people talking about Black people or brown people,"" she said, noting, for example, that Brampton, Ont. has been called ""Browntown,"" ""Bramladesh"" or ""Singhdale"" for its strong South Asian presence.

""It is definitely racism, no two ways about it. The people in Squamish wouldn't think that... but it is very much an uncritical way of thinking about race and what they are saying underneath. It is fun when you are in the dominant group. It is painful to those in the marginalized group.""

She said the term 'white fragility' may apply to this situation in that the word ""Squampton"" is part of what has come to define Squamish to some people, so the reaction to re-evaluating it is quite severe.

""It is the statues, too. This is what defines us, too,"" she said, referring to the many statues of Confederate generals, officers and the like that are being toppled for the racism they displayed and represent.

Henry, who is also Black, said it is isolating to be a person of colour in the Lower Mainland and especially outside Vancouver proper.

""I think Squamish, as Vancouver, Burnaby — even places that are 'more diverse' — there is work to do,"" she said.

Jorge Alvarez Bardavid says he does not find the sticker racist and his print shop in Whistler has agreed to print the items, if need be.

He has been in the Sea to Sky Corridor for 35 years and says he has never experienced racism here.

""Not all the way from D'Arcy to Lions Bay,"" he said.

As an immigrant from Chile, he says he has no problem with ""Squampton.""

""As a minority, or Hispanic, from my point of view, not only did I not think anything was wrong with it, I have always thought it was one of the coolest things.""

Jorge Alvarez Bardavid pointed to Compton stats, saying that the majority is Hispanic, like him. - From www.comptoncity.org

He added he has always admired the iconic font used for the name.

""It meant you are from Squamish. You are a local from Squamish and you like the outdoors, you like playing outside that is what it meant to me.""

Bardavid said there are bigger issues of racism such as how, when recently a white, armed military reservist drove a pick-up truck through the gates of an estate where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lives, he was arrested without incident, but when Athabasca Chipewyan Chief Allan Adam was pulled over for expired vehicle registration tags, he was beaten by police.

""So yes, we have a problem. But no, this [sticker] is not the problem.""

Origin story

Former Squamish resident Daryl LeDuke says ""Squampton"" was common vernacular in some circles when he was a kid in town.

His contribution to popularizing ""Squampton"" was getting it printed on stickers and clothing in the iconic old English font that was used by rapper Eazy-E on Compton hats. That was in 2003 when LeDuke was 18 years old.

""That particular era was very hard on Squamish,"" LeDuke said.

""From 2000 to 2005, industry packed up and left town. The pre-Olympic building boom had not yet started and the tourist mecca we know today was a decade or more away. Many families were forced to leave town to find work and housing prices were falling. Squamish had garnered some negative attention in the news for incidents where tourists were assaulted by locals, leading to a poor reputation in many ways,"" he added.

""At that time, 'Squampton' was most often used as a pejorative term by people from Vancouver and Whistler. I experienced this as a young teen racing mountain bikes on the BC Cup circuit with my friends. A significant portion of our fellow competitors came from Vancouver and Whistler. When we introduced ourselves, since kids have no filter, the reaction was often something like 'you're from 'Squampton'? that place is ghetto.'""

LeDuke said that at the time, locals really resented the way Squamish was looked down upon because this was the same era that produced stickers and slogans such as ""Think Fast Hippie,"" ""Fuck You I'm from Squamish, , and ""Whistler is That Way.""

""We were also fans of N.W.A and Eazy E. We understood the portmanteau and we decided to own it. One of the themes of the music is 'putting your home city on the map' and that really resonated with us.""

LeDuke's friend's parents owned a sign-making shop and so he created stickers for his friends and a few other members of the local mountain bike community.

""We went out and represented our pride in 'Squampton' in the only fashion we knew how. We went out there to races and events and became some of the best riders in the country.""

Other locals loved the ""Squampton"" merch, LeDuke recalled.

""I was often stopped by locals I knew and didn't know asking where they could get a hat or a sticker,"" he said.

""The popularity and longevity has been beyond what anyone could have ever anticipated.""

LeDuke has not lived in town for a decade and is not surprised by the current controversy.

""There is nothing 'ghetto' about Squamish in any way whatsoever. The 'new' residents probably resent it for its inaccurate representation of the area.""

To LeDuke, ""Squampton"" means cutting your own firewood, doing trail maintenance in the pouring rain, or supporting the coffee shop owned by your neighbour.

""There are no intentional racial connotations with the portmanteau, the connotation was intended to be interpreted as socioeconomic as Compton is, in reality, a multicultural community. I understand the concern and believe that it's important to have an open dialogue as social standards change,"" he said.

""Whatever happens moving forward, I hope when people look back at this situation they can agree it was the correct course of action. If this is the end, I hope it can be seen with nostalgia for a time gone by and not something contentious.""

The role of gentrification

For many long-time locals who chimed in with support ""Squampton"" the issue at its core is old-versus-new Squamish and have-not Squamish, not racism.

Spencer Craig, who was born and raised in Squamish, talked about how he perceives the opposition to the sticker as from those who are new to town, are wealthy and are likely from an urban centre.

The opposition feels personal and a way to sweep away the anti-establishment, free-wheeling, fun-loving, rough-around-the-edges crowd who have been here for decades. The sticker is symbolic of one more thing long-time locals are being asked to give up, in other words.

""I think it is I gentrification issue,"" said Feet Banks, who with Craig, met with The Squamish Chief in person on July 10.

""That goes back to the history. People, A: don't like being told what to do. B: don't like being told by people who just showed up — there's a lack of context; and C: there's a sense of loss here, where [old] Squamish is saying, 'We were something, everyone made fun of us about it'.... and there is a sense that like, 'You guys used to shit on us. We took it. We took the power back and now all of a sudden you all want to move here — you are driving up the property values and you are making it so that we can't afford to live in our own houses, our friends and neighbours are moving away — and then you, the haves are going to tell us we aren't allowed to say that thing that you started calling us in the first place.' I think that is the real issue.""

According to Craig, more than half his graduating class has left town due to the high cost of living here now. Most of his friends can't afford to live in the town they have known as home all their lives, he said.

Both Craig and others who wrote to the paper also expressed frustration with cancel culture, which abolishes something without real discussion.

""The world says that we are all entitled to our own opinion, but as soon as someone finds it offensive, we cave to their notion and lose our freedom of speech,"" Craig said.

Other viewpoints

Amber Grace is a white mother of a nine-year-old Black son who says that Squamish has a long way to go in understanding racism locally.

""It sucks, because I feel like my son is still going to be fighting this fight when he has kids,"" she said.

She tells the story of her son being made fun of by other kids for his 'different' hair and afterward, he wanted to wear a helmet/hat/hoodie to hide his hair.

She said she has often remained quiet about the inequity she has seen, but not anymore.

""I realize my own actions have been harmful in not speaking up about some of these issues,"" she said, noting white friends had previously vented to her about people of colour while she didn't say anything.

About the sticker, she said she respects the origin of it, but thinks it is not relevant to the wider conversation about racism in town.

""I don't understand how people are putting a sticker before a human being's experience,"" she said, adding she doesn't go so far as to call it racist.

""I don't go so far to give a sticker that much power over my son's experience — that said, as a white person, I don't get to decide that fully. That is my son's experience to decide for himself — and the rest of our Black, Indigenous and People of Colour community.""

What shocked her was the vitriol that came up defending the sticker and that it arose so quickly when the topic was raised on various forums in town.

""It hurts on so many levels. This has brought out also how OK our community is with violence against women,"" she said, referencing that some of those who opposed the sticker felt scared for their physical safety after online threats.

Grace said she had her own anti-racism work to do.

""I will be frank with you. At one point I, as a white mother of a Black child said 'All Lives Matter,'"" she said. ""My trauma was triggered when all this first started years ago. I was thinking 'Shit, I've been through the wringer too. I've been sexually abused, I've been homeless, I've been raising my child on my own.'..so I was like, ""What about my story?""

Acknowledging her own racism and trauma has helped her see things differently.

""Now I can be an ally. These past few weeks have shown me exactly how heavy this burden is to carry as an ally, but it's still nothing in comparison to the generational trauma that came from the systemic racism and oppression of the BIPOC community.""

She said she has had to accept that as a white person, racism is part of her story she had to address.

""It is 1,000% my belief that white people are somewhere on the racism spectrum. We have to accept that and stop being so afraid of that word,"" she said.

""Everything I have access to is based on racism — the support that I have — all of it was built to help white people. So when you are the sole benefactor of that, you're inherently a racist.""

She says ultimately, we need to have compassion for people on both sides.

""And move these conversations offline — because people say a lot of things they wouldn't say in person — then I think these conversations would be a lot more productive.""

She points to a reaction to a U.K. children's book as an example Squamish could emulate in this moment.

The book had the word 'idiot' in it.

There was an uproar about the word and then people came to the realization they had three choices: they could not buy the book; buy the book and not read the word; or ""we could choose to buy the book, read the word in the way it was intended and then have a conversation about it.""

""I loved the third option. The sticker is like the book. I'm not going to go around teaching my kid to pick the stickers off people's cars or anything, but it is a catalyst for conversation.""

Anti-racism work needed: a way forward

Squamish's Nadi Jones, an anti-racism educator, said the sticker discussion allows residents to discuss racism in general in town.

""There is some pretty deep-rooted systemic racism in this town. I have experienced it,"" said Jones, who has lived in Squamish for eight years.

""Squamish is undereducated in that area. I think the sticker isn't the big problem, but it did rip a Band-Aid off of a problem.

""But we are just waking up to this conversation and being able to talk about diversity and how our words and emblems and headlines and workplaces, how all these things are contributing to a systemic and racist foundation in this town.""

She said the backlash that has arisen from the post about ""Squampton"" is why she didn't previously want to speak up about such things.

""To speak up about racism in a racist town, you are met with people saying, 'I don't have privilege. I am not racist and then it gets gaslit into, 'You are too sensitive,'"" she said.

Jones said that the original poster could have approached the issue in a better way.

""Instead of being, 'I think we need to talk about this. I think this is a bigger conversation;' or, 'What are your thoughts?' It was, 'This needs to stop,' which when you are approaching a town with abrasiveness like that, the town is going to be abrasive, and come at you. It is going to bite back,"" she said.

""It is not about the sticker … It was about — wait a second, we are allowing something that is racist-implying and hurtful to people in our community and then when we try to talk about it, it turns into pointed fingers instead of process, listen, think, engage.""

Now that the conversation has been started, she hopes to help keep it going.

She is working on having a virtual anti-racism town hall.

""I am really inspired by the idea of having a panel of mixed race [people], business owners, predominantly people of colour to use our voice — to use these fundamentals of what people need to know, what they need to listen to and unlearn and commit to and relearn and what actions need to be taken. If we could open a conversation like that right open, that is a really amazing thing, because that is a great opportunity to end racism in our own town — I got goose pimples — that is something I never thought would happen.""

""We did the road trip across Canada and there was no one on the road. It was just the two of us. We got back on March 23 just in time. There was a huge snowstorm and we were freaking out.""

Fast forward a few short months and not only has so much changed globally, but the couple has also completely transformed the van in that time.

On Thursday, June 18, the van officially began to fulfill its destiny as a mobile recording studio as part of Bonding Beaver Media—St-Arnaud and Leveille's company that aims to foster and support the preservation of Indigenous languages through multimedia—when they travelled to the home of Lil'wat Nation elder Priscilla Ritchie to record.

""It's beautiful,"" Ritchie says about her first impression of the van. ""It's neat to have it come to my place instead of trying to find a way to get [to a recording studio].""

Mobile immersion

St-Arnaud first began working with the Lil'wat Nation around five years ago when she came on board as a contractor to help edit down 200 hours of film into a one-hour movie.

""I volunteered a lot of my time initially, so it created a really good connection, and meeting the elders was awesome,"" she says. ""They started realizing online resources and videos are the best ways to preserve language and culture. A lot of my [subsequent] contracts were focused on preserving language.""

The Lil'wat Nation has made a huge push in recent years to not just preserve its Ucwalmícwts language, but also help it flourish in the community and increase the current rate of fluent speakers, which sits at less than three per cent. A major concern with elders getting older was that the language could disappear along with them.

At the post-secondary level, Mount Currie's Ts'zil Learning Centre offers language skills classes; Ucwalmícwts is part of the curriculum at local elementary and high schools; and at the Xet'ólacw Community School, students from Kindergarten to Grade 3 can take part in an Ucwalmícwts immersion program.

The Lil'wat Nation also hosts the First Voices website as a community resource for language learners. Anyone can simply log on, click on various words and phrases and hear the Ucwalmícwts word as well as its proper pronunciation and English translation.

That latter online resource is what St-Arnaud's roving recording studio is contributing to.

""It's really in demand right now,"" she says. ""My end goal is not just for me to be able to drive the van around and record with elders, but also train the youth so they can go see their grandma and record the language. Our objective is to see more of those overall fluent speakers in their community and assist them to be able to do that.""

(St-Arnaud, who is not Lil'wat, has also taken language classes to learn Ucwalmícwts.)

Initially, she and the Lil'wat elders were holed up in the dedicated recording space at the Ts'zil Learning Centre to record. But it was tricky.

""It's so hard for them to travel around [and] they come to the community centre to record language, and you can hear everyone in the building,"" St-Arnaud says. ""We have this equipment that's high end, but you have trouble hearing the audio.""

One day, St-Arnaud was talking about her company, Bonding Beaver Media, and the language preservation work she was doing with Dawn Johnson, former executive director at Stewardship Pemberton, where she had done some volunteer video work in the past. By chance, Johnson had recently chatted with Verna Stager, the education director at the Xet'ólacw Community School, who had an idea.

""How cool would it be to have a van and travel everywhere and preserve language and [shoot] video?'"" Stager said to Johnson.

""She was laughing about it saying, 'There's a van for everything now,"" St. Arnaud recalls.

Immediately struck by the concept, St. Arnaud quickly followed up with Stager, who was keen to go head with the project.

When she first conceived of the idea, Stager imagined it would save time trying to arrange travel with elders and, on top of that, would allow elders with limited mobility or health issues to take part.

""The other advantage, of course, was being able to share it,"" Stager says. ""The cultural centre, the school, the band office, when they're doing work on inherent rights and wanting to record elders, it makes a lot of sense for sharing. I'm thinking that it's this little space everybody will come to know.""

She also believes it will add to the resources teachers at the school will have. ""At Xet'ólacw, we have an immersion program, so we're translating a lot of information and writing our own curriculum … We just finished some of that work,"" says Stager. ""So the staff are eager to get to have enough resources to do a really good job of teaching the language. It will be online and I think there's a number of ways that the teachers can use it in the classrooms, but it also can be used to improve the fluency of the language teachers.""

Overall, Stager was surprised to see just how quickly St-Arnaud turned the project around after that call.

""I was actually a bit shocked that Val jumped on the way she did,"" she adds. ""But I'm thankful she did.""

Lost in translation

Translating an entire dictionary is no quick or easy task.

In one session, St-Arnaud and the fluent Ucwalmícwts speaker she's working with can record 50 to 100 words per hour. But the challenge is some Ucwalmícwts words don't have direct English translations. (The written version of the language, in fact, was only created in 1974 by Simon Fraser University linguist Dr. Jan Van Eijk.)

One example of an English word without a direct translation they ran into was ""stewardship,"" so they settled on an Ucwalmícwts translation of ""keeper of the land.""

""Sometimes we could be there for hours until they have a proper translation for it,"" St-Arnaud says.

But for Ritchie, a Lil'wat elder who's been part of the project, the effort is well worth it. She learned Ucwalmícwts from her father, who university researchers would consult about the language.

""This is just another step towards what he was trying to do: preserving our language and our way of life,"" Ritchie says. ""I spoke the language growing up, but the more you don't use it, the more you lose. This way, it seems to be encouraging us to use our language more or try to find more ways to say things in our traditional way.""

Language isn't just spoken words, she adds. It's identity.

""A lot of words have personal meaning for us, especially our place names and river names and our own personal names that are handed down … It was getting lost.

""Here we have technology that can do these things now. We can record them and save them on the computer or even for people to be using them on their iPad nowadays. It's exciting.""

It's a fulfilling personal challenge too, Ritchie adds.

""I enjoy it. It challenges my vocabulary and my pronunciation. We do one word at a time or everyday sentences.""

St-Arnaud initially grappled with being a white woman coming into the community to work on a deeply cultural project. To that end, it was important for her to build relationships, try to learn the language herself, and, most importantly, mentor young community members so they could carry on the work.

""I'm so happy I get to do something so fulfilling,"" she says. ""At first I was like, 'Who am I to come in and do that?' But eventually, you realize you're helping and it's such a great community to work with … The difference between me and other companies that aren't located in B.C. is I can mentor. At the end of the day, it's their language, their community, it gives them the opportunity to record their own elders and create jobs.""

Eventually, St-Arnaud hopes to bring the van to other Indigenous communities that are also working on language preservation.

""For sure there's going to be a little bit of hesitation when we work with new nations,"" she says. ""If you work with that nation, you need to know where they're coming from and where that resistance comes from.""

Before COVID-19, Bonding Beaver had arranged to travel to a band near Chilliwack for recording, but that's been put on hold due to the pandemic.

""At the end of the day, I think we just have to go for it,"" St-Arnaud says. ""We just had such good feedback and we see such a need for it.""

It is exceedingly rare in B.C. Emergency Health Services to have the same partner on the road for so long. From chest pains to gunshot wounds, they’ve seen it all and it’s likely anyone who rode in the back of their ambulance benefited from the friendship.

article continues below

“You always work in twos so your partnership is everything. How good your partnership is sets the tone for how well the call goes, sets the tone for life after the call,” Block said. “You have to be able to get along with the person and obviously we did. We were just very good together. We honed our craft together.”

The two first met in 1987 when Block was working as a scuba instructor and Marklund was getting into the sport. They became fast friends, and in doing so, learned they both had aspirations to become paramedics.

Block was the first one to land a job in Whistler. Marklund joined him soon after.

“I was on a different career path. But a few months after hearing that he was doing well up there, I decided to come up and have a talk with the boss at the time, and then I got hired,” he said. “That man quickly learned that Randy and I would commute together. On our time off, we would exercise together. We were pretty much joined at the hip. So then we were scheduled together,” Marklund said.

Because Block was slightly ahead in seniority, he was always the first up for a new position closer to home in North Vancouver, where both men wanted to return. As their careers advanced, Block never had to wait more than a few months before Marklund would catch up with him and they’d be partners again.

Then 17 years ago, they both landed plum jobs on the North Shore, assigned to the same ambulance on the same day, which was “extremely rare” in emergency health services.

“Our management said that ‘This never happens, but you guys are moving together to start in West Vancouver,’” Marklund said.

The two would regularly debrief after a call, analyzing how it went and what they could learn to make the next one better.

Marklund was always the more serious member of the pair while Block characterized himself as easier going. But they had similar senses of humour, which would only strengthen their bond.

“We would sit back and laugh our heads off – laugh to tears sometimes, and just sit and enjoy the moment and relax for a little bit until it was time for us to return to duty and get into the next event,” Marklund said.

Together, they’ve hit the lights and sirens 26,268 times. Marklund had been counting. And over 30 years, they’ve seen it all, to the point that memories of calls tend to blur together. When the 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot happened, Marklund and Block were on the scene so fast, other emergency health services members joked they may have been the ones to start it.

Through it all, they never got sick of one another.

“It’s like a marriage, though. Isn’t it?” Marklund said. “You know, good days and bad days for everything, right?”

Marklund announced his retirement in May. It means Block has had to adjust to having someone new at his side.

“Dave will downplay this, but there’s no question in my mind. He’s one of the finest paramedics that our service has,” Block said. “Our friendship, you know, is locked in for life.”

Marklund agreed, at least about the friendship part.

“We joke that when we get old enough to live in a retirement facility, we’ll get a room together – put our beds in there and get a PlayStation and Xbox and play video games, and just laugh our heads off,” he said.",[]

Or flames sweep over the south slope of Mt. Collins and cut off traffic from the Legion northwards? How would we leave?

These are just some of the scenarios in Bowen Island Municipality’s recently released draft evacuation plan, soon to appear before municipal council for adoption. The plan is an 82-page guide of what to do in case it’s necessary to evacuate part or all of Bowen Island.

article continues below

“The plan is more meant to guide staff and responders rather than individuals,” said BIM’s emergency program coordinator Jennifer McGowan. “Because the different hazards or the nature of the emergency will change the way that [individuals] need to act.”

A wildland urban interface fire is the most likely threat to result in evacuation of Bowen said the plan.

“It’s hard actually to imagine what else would cause an evacuation of Bowen,” said McGowan. “We don’t have the industry that can sometimes require further evacuation planning.”

But where a fire strikes affects the evacuation––eg. a fire on Grafton Rd. could cut off the entire west side.

BIM worked with University of Washington researcher Fiete Krutein to investigate scenarios that could result in an evacuations and the locally available vessels that could help.

Krutein joined BIM and first responders for a simulation evacuation of parts of the island in February. “That was a big [lesson] also for me to see what kind of guidance is needed when you actually are in such a situation where you have to organize an evacuation and what the friction points usually are,” said Krutein.

Potential assembly areas by zone as proposed in BIM's draft evacuation plan. The island is divided into nine zones based on population and traffic requirements. BIM's emergency program coordinator Jennifer McGowan noted that islanders would be notified of assembly areas in the event of an emergency and where the areas are will depend on the emergency. - Screenshot / BIM's draft evacuation plan

They learned that parts of the island are more vulnerable than others or have circumstances first responders need to be aware of. Higher density areas will have traffic congestion while lower density areas may have fewer marine evacuation options. “Not that they’re insurmountable but the sooner you recognize that these problems might be coming, the faster you can address them earlier on,” said McGowan.

The plan outlines two types of evacuation: tactical (immediate, with little warning or preparation) and strategic or planned (more time, with formal documentation and with signoff from mayor) and the steps involved in each.

In the plan, the island is divided into nine zones based on traffic control points and population.

If it was decided the entire island needed to be evacuated, under the plan people would leave zone by zone. First, residents would be directed to an assembly area––an informational hub––and then responders would limit the number of cars leaving the zone (each car at maximum capacity). People could bring their pets but not their livestock. In an extreme scenario, there would be only people leaving (no cars) via foot ferry or mass transit.

In 11 hours, (assuming favourable weather, efficient loading and full capacity) the Queen of Capilano could completely evacuate the island’s 4,000 residents estimates the plan. Evacuation time rises to 27 hours to remove summertime highs of 10,000 people. In other scenarios, using marine services and islanders with boats as well as nearer drop-off points (like Keats or Pasley Islands), the plan estimates 500 to 1,000 people could be removed an hour.

Also included in the document are maps of possible assembly areas, critical infrastructure, alternate evacuation points and how to rearrange Snug Cove to fit three ferry loads of waiting cars.

Islanders don’t necessarily need to read the entire plan and memorize the assembly areas, “In an emergency, we provide this information to the residents and tell them where to go and how to get there,” said McGowan. But McGowan wants people to know it’s there. “I hope that it gives the residents comfort to know that some of the planning has taken place,” she said.

However, McGowan does want islanders to make sure they’re personally prepared for an evacuation: signed up to the emergency notification service (BowENS), have a grab-and-go bag ready and know the difference between an evacuation alert (informs of potential or impending danger, how to prepare and what to expect) and an evacuation order (people are ordered to leave an area; only valid after declaring a state of local emergency).

Buried in a slew of federal and provincial grant announcements this morning was news of $7.96 million coming to Bowen Island for a community centre.

article continues below

The announcement draws the decades-long endeavour to build a dedicated community facility one large step closer to fruition.

Following a local fundraising and awareness campaign, Bowen Island Municipality applied for the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program in January 2019. Friday morning, the community centre was among 92 projects that the federal and B.C. governments announced would receive funding.

“Local infrastructure is the bedrock of any community,” said West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler in a press release. “The Bowen Island Community Centre Project will build a top-notch facility that will serve as a hub for the community and provide access to recreational and arts activities on the island.”

“We are pleased that senior levels of government have recognized the value of investing in our community,” said Mayor Gary Ander in a press release. “This will enable us to achieve the long-term goal of a dedicated public building for Bowen Islanders.”

That’s not to say that the work is done for community centre proponents. The infrastructure grant is to cover half of the estimated $14.5 million needed to construct the multi-use facility––a Bowen Island Municipality and Hearth partnership. With this project funding, reserves and donations, there’s still a $4 million shortfall.

To that end, BIM will hold a referendum to ask for approval from electors to borrow up to $4 million (this referendum was initially scheduled for spring 2019 but was put off until the funding was announced.)

Of the $4 million needed, $2 million is ""tax neutral"" as the rent money the municipality pays (it doesn’t own any of its spaces) would be redirected to financing the hall. Borrowing the other $2 million would result in a two per cent rise in property taxes BIM staffers estimated in 2019.

In Friday's press release, BIM poised the project as an “economic stimulus…creating jobs in an uncertain economy, bringing traffic to local businesses, and ultimately creating our own facility that will develop community resiliency over the long term.”

In the economy of a year and a half ago, there were community members and councillors raising concerns about the number of capital projects the municipality is taking on, including the water treatment plant now under construction and the proposed fire hall on Lot 3 of the community lands.

The proposed community centre is to hold municipal offices, community gathering areas, recreation space and performing arts space. - Bowen Island Municipality

A community centre has long been a topic of local attention: as far back as 1993 islanders were trying to build a Community and Performing Arts Centre. Municipal council set aside a slice of Lot 2 of the Community Lands (beside the BICS soccer field) for a community centre in 2006. And BIM issued the building permit for the now “shovel-ready” project in 2018.

“This is excellent news for our community,” said Rob Gloor, chair of the Hearth. “We are now very close to realizing our dream of a place where the entire community can gather and re-connect in a myriad of ways.”

The facility itself is 16,000 sq. ft. and includes municipal offices, council chambers, multi-use rooms, a fitness room and recreation and arts space.

BIM is still collecting donations for the community centre––donations that’ve included million-dollar pledges in the past––through the project website.",[]

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when anxiety levels were high, Central Lonsdale resident Frank Wimberley donned his clan tartan, accented with a pink flourish, grabbed his bagpipes and joined the 7 p.m. nightly cheer for front-line workers.

article continues below

It started out with just Wimberley, who is also known as the Pink Pied Piper, and his wife and son. Gradually, neighbours began streaming out to 15th Street and Mahon Avenue for the nightly “parade” – especially kids.

“It's been quite an amazing little journey,” he said. “It caught on and so we were out every evening and through May and into June.”

Although there are philistines who don’t appreciate the sound of bagpipes, Wimberley said he’s been struck by the warm praise that’s come from the nightly morale booster in dark times.

“There's been a lot of folks are saying, ‘This is fantastic. This is wonderful. You've really done wonders for the community and for the health workers,’” he said.

Other members of the Docs and Socks pipe band he belongs to have had similar experiences outside their homes, Wimberley said.

Though he played rain or shine, there is a small asterisk on the 100. In mid-May, Wimberley wound up face to face with the health-care workers he’s played in praise of. He was in pain one evening but waited until after the parade before going to the hospital, where he was prepped for emergency gallbladder surgery.

While he was convalescing, his family filled in, playing pipe music through a speaker for the gathered neighbours. When Wimberley returned home, there was a stack of Get Well cards waiting for him, mostly from kids in the neighbourhood.

At the end of May, a neighbour snapped photos of all the folks who had been turning out for the nighty parades, compiled them into a book and got everyone to sign a birthday greeting for Wimberley.

“Which was fantastic because when you play the pipes - it's great, you're entertaining everyone - but you never get to meet anyone,” he said.

Since March, British Columbians have by and large done their part to “flatten the curve.”

New COVID-19 infections are averaging between 10 and 20 per day and the ICUs never ran out of ventilators as was feared in the worst case scenario. And, as of the last update from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, only 17 people in B.C. are in hospital with the virus.

With thing somewhat returning to normal, Wimberley has decided to scale things back. At first he thought Canada Day might be a good time for one final blowout performance. That would be his 99th night on the job – another number that holds a special place in the hearts of Canadians. But he thought to make it an even 100 on July 2.

Even now, though, Wimberley says he’ll keep the parades up on Friday and Saturday nights. He isn’t quite ready to walk away from what he’s started because he doesn’t want to seeing his neighbours stop coming together while staying six feet apart.

“They just got to come out in the evenings and see each other, and meet and greet each other, and get to know people from three houses away or four houses away,” he said. “It started out and still is the 7 p.m. tribute to the health workers. But somewhere along the way, we built a little community.”",[]

“Since the beginning of the pandemic, we only identified six lab-confirmed cases in the Sunshine Coast Local Health Area, and there are currently no active cases that we are following,” said McKee in a July 2 phone interview with Coast Reporter.

article continues below

On June 16, the Sunshine Coast COVID-19 Physician Task Force had announced there hadn’t been positive COVID-19 tests in the region in more than two months. McKee said the number of cases in the rural parts of the healthy authority made up three per cent of total VCH cases.

He said those six lab-confirmed diagnoses don’t include every case, since some may not have been tested, but “it shows the rural areas were less impacted than other urban areas,” as well as “the exceptional work done by everyone throughout the community to implement control measures.”

He said the health authority has “managed to follow up very quickly with contacts and reduce any likelihood of exposure, so when we have low numbers, I think it really does speak to the low level of community transmission that has occurred.”

He didn’t disclose whether any deaths occurred on the Sunshine Coast for confidentiality reasons.

Despite the low numbers, until a vaccine is found, there will always be a risk and it’s important to continue taking precautions, said McKee. He also said that in general, he was not aware of any particular breaches of public health orders that required enforcement.

McKee will be updating Sunshine Coast residents and answering questions on Tuesday, July 7 during a Facebook Live event scheduled for noon as the province enters its third week of Phase 3. “In the past the provincial government has led communication around COVID-19,” he said, “but we now have this opportunity to address specific questions at a local level.”

He expects questions from business owners and organizations as they work through their own protocols and safety plans.

For the Sunshine Coast, many of those local considerations revolve around tourism and the expectation of more visitors.

McKee said he also plans on discussing measures businesses, organizations and individuals can take to reduce risk, but that much of the messaging remains the same: staying at home if sick, maintaining good hand hygiene, finding ways to “enhance physical distancing,” and taking additional measure such as wearing masks, if needed.

McKee said he also plans to answer questions on how to be a good traveller. “It really is about everybody being respectful and taking appropriate precautions,” such as researching places in advance to understand the expectations of the community and its businesses, keeping visits short and staying as self-sufficient as possible by bringing supplies.

Even though the restart is safe, “we do still need to take precautions and listen to public health advice,” he said.

McKee also plans to provide more “nuanced” information about what it means to limit physical contact.

The Coldwater Indian Band, along with the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh already had the federal approval of the pipeline project overturned once in 2018, after successfully arguing in the Federal Court of Appeal that they were not adequately consulted, as guaranteed by the constitution.

article continues below

That led the federal government to restart the approval process and include more dialogue with the Indigenous groups before approving the pipeline for a second time, but that too fell short of what was required, the three First Nations argued in their latest court filings.

The decision by the top court, which never gives reasons for why it will not hear some cases, ends the legal challenge.

The three bands issued a release soon after the decision Thursday saying, despite being “extremely disappointed” by the refusal, they will “explore all legal options to protect their rights, land, water and climate.”

“This case is about more than a risky pipeline and tanker project. It is a major setback for reconciliation. It reduces consultation to a purely procedural requirement that will be a serious barrier to reconciliation,” said Tsleil-Waututh Nation Chief Leah George-Wilson in the release. “What I can tell you today is that this is not the end of the story.”

There was a high expectation that the court would hear the case, said Chris Lewis, Squamish Nation council member and spokesman, because it would have provided both the Crown and First Nations with more clarity around their constitutional right to meaningful consultation and accommodation.

“We were shocked to learn that the Supreme Court of Canada didn't see this as an issue of national importance,” he said. “And also that they didn't see that the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision to let the federal government basically be the judge and jury of their own consultation process was flawed.”

The federal government still has a duty to consult First Nations before issuing the regulatory permits for various aspects of the work. Lewis said the nation will continue to push the government to address concerns left lingering after the approval process - things like impacts on southern resident killer whales, underwater noise and cumulative impacts of the pipeline.

“We'll continue to let our voice be heard,” he said.

The Squamish Nation and Tsleil-Waututh Nation will soon be joining with the federal government on a study into the behaviour of diluted bitumen in water, which was a major unanswered question, Lewis added.

Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan issued a statement welcoming the decision.

“The government approved TMX because it is an important project for Canada,” the statement read. “Construction of TMX is underway and has already created more than 4,900 good, well-paying jobs, will help us gain access to new markets for our resources, and generate revenue to help fund clean energy and climate change solutions.”

O’Regan’s statement acknowledged the further rift that would come in reconciliation efforts.

“To those who are disappointed with today’s SCC decision — we see you and we hear you,” the statement read. “Canada will continue to engage with Indigenous groups at each step of the project in the months and years to come, and in the spirit of partnership, to make sure we get this right.”

Lewis said he would not be surprised to see the decision and construction on the pipeline inspire protests and civil disobedience. But, he added, the nation’s council will focus on its role in holding the government to a higher standard.

“Squamish will continue to assert our rights and continue to uphold our laws that we need to protect and care for our homelands and our traditional territories because it's our responsibility given to us by our ancestors that we need to pass on a better state of the world to the next generation,” he said.",[]

Ken Otter, a biology professor at the University of Northern British Columbia, whose paper on the phenomenon was published on Thursday, said most bird species are slow to change their songs, preferring to stick with tried-and-true tunes to defend territories and attract females.

article continues below

But the shift to this new tune went viral across Canada, travelling over 3,000 kilometres between 2000 and 2019 and wiping out a historic song ending in the process, he said.

""The song is always described as being 'Oh My Sweet Canada Canada Canada Canada — so that Canada is three syllables. It's a da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da sound. That's the traditional description of the song going back into early 1900s,"" Otter said in an interview Wednesday.

But now, the song has changed.

""The doublet sounds like Oh My Sweet Cana-Cana-Cana-da. They are stuttering and repeating the first two syllables and they are doing it very rapidly. It sounds very different.""

From British Columbia to central Ontario, these native birds have ditched their traditional three-note-ending song for a two-note-ending variant, he said, adding researchers still don't know what has made the new tune so compelling.

Otter drew a comparison to people picking up the accent, phrases and pneumonics of a new area they move into.

""This is actually the opposite,"" he said.

Male sparrows are showing up singing atypical songs but then others are starting to adopt that, and over time the dialect is actually changing within that site to the new type and replacing the old tune, he said.

""So it's like somebody from Australia arriving in Toronto and people saying, 'hey, that sounds really cool,' mimicking an Australian accent and then after 10 years everybody in Toronto has an Australian accent,"" he said.

""That's why, at least within the scientific community, it's getting so much interest. It is completely atypical to what you would predict around all the theories that you have about dialects.""

Otter and a team of citizen scientists have found that the new tune is not just more popular west of the Rocky Mountains, but was also spreading rapidly across Canada.

""Originally, we measured the dialect boundaries in 2004 and it stopped about halfway through Alberta,"" he said in a news release.

""By 2014, every bird we recorded in Alberta was singing this western dialect, and we started to see it appearing in populations as far away as Ontario, which is 3,000 kilometres from us.""

The scientists predicted that the sparrows' overwintering grounds were playing a role in the rapid spread of the two-note ending, he said.

Scientists believed that juvenile males may be able to pick up new song types if they overwinter with birds from other dialect areas, and take them to new locations when they return to breeding grounds, which could explain the spread, he said.

So they fitted the birds with geolocators — what Otter called ""tiny backpacks"" — to see if western sparrows that knew the new song might share overwintering grounds with eastern populations that would later adopt it.

""They found that they did,"" he said in the release.

Otter said he does not know what has caused the change, and his team found that the new song didn't give male birds a territorial advantage over others.

""In many previous studies, the females tend to prefer whatever the local song type is,"" he said.

""But in white-throated sparrows, we might find a situation in which the females actually like songs that aren't typical in their environment. If that's the case, there's a big advantage to any male who can sing a new song type.""

The new song can be chalked up to evolution, he said in the interview.

Otter said he prefers the two-note song because it sounds smoother.

""But I'm not a sparrow so it doesn't really matter which one I prefer,"" he said with a laugh.

But the tune may be continuing to change, he said adding scientists were supposed to study it this year but COVID-19 has put a damper on the field season.

""The two note is not the be all and end all because in the last five years we noticed a male that was singing something slightly different than the standard two note doublet song,"" Otter said.

""And when we recorded it we noticed he was modifying the amplitude of the first note. And more of them are doing it now. We could be seeing waves of these things that we just never noticed before.""

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and MP Terry Beech, parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries, announced that chinook retention has been closed for the majority of the South Coast and Vancouver Island from Port Hardy south to Victoria from April 1 to July 15 or Aug. 1, depending on the area.

article continues below

After that date until August 31, one chinook between 62 and 80 centimetres can be retained.

In an unprecedented move, an extensive area that includes portions of Howe Sound, the Southern Gulf Islands, Vancouver Harbour and the entire Fraser River mouth has been deemed a no-chinook fishing zone, even for catch and release, from April 1 to Sept. 1.

Jason Assonitis' voice shakes with anger and frustration when asked how he feels about the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations.

""Basically, the entire peak season has now been closed, not only to the retention of chinook, but also now been closed to targeting them — catch and release them, said Assonitis, who owns Bon Chovy Fishing Charters.

""This has basically destroyed not only the charter industry, but it has also destroyed the sportfishing businesses that rely on the chinook fishery, and it also destroys the integrity of fishing values and conservation values that are passed on from generation to generation.""

Dave Brown, a sport fisherman on the Sea to Sky Fisheries Roundtable, says DFO isn't addressing what is really causing impacts on troubled chinook stocks.

""It is not acceptable, there is no recovery plan, and it is devastating for people who enjoy access to the public fishery.

Brown points to 23 chinook gillnet openings that have taken place this year on the lower Fraser River as a sign that conservation of chinook is not the DFO's main focus.

He also points to what he says is a lack of action on seals and sea lions impacting chinook numbers.

""It is now clear that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Liberal government is making a political sacrifice in order to appease different stakeholders, and this has nothing to do with science,"" Assonitis said, adding he sees it as a bureaucratic maneuver.

Avid angler Perri Domm echoes Brown and Assonitis. Domm has guided and fished out of Tofino for 12 years and fished in Vancouver-area saltwater for 30 years on his 24-foot Grady-White.

He says these regulations ""could not be worse.""

DFO could be doing more to increase fish stocks and address gravel extraction, Domm says. They organization could also look into exploding seal populations, habitat destruction and agricultural runoff, he continued.

""It certainly does not fall on the single, small, little guy user,"" Domm says.

""We are just the simple, easy targets that look good but actually do nothing to improve the situation.""

Sea to Sky sports fishers plan a rally about this issue on July 6 outside the DFO office in Vancouver.

Sports fishery organizations weigh in

The Sport Fishing Institute of B.C. was quick to chime in the day the chinook measures were announced.

""Appreciating that there are abundant chinook stocks, both wild and hatchery, from other systems in our waters now and that the carefully developed Sport Fishing Advisory Board (SFAB) proposals identified times, areas and limits that reduced or eliminated pressure on Fraser River stocks of concerns, it is unclear why the health and well-being of communities and citizens is being forgone,"" read the institute's news release.

In an open letter to Fisheries Minister Bernadette Jordan, the BC Wildlife Federation called the measures ""some of the most draconian fishing measures in recorded history.""

""There is no transparency, no accountability, and no trust while there are fewer and fewer salmon. DFO is a failed agency that no longer manages for the well-being of fish or the public interest. Instead, DFO is now focussed exclusively on cutting back the public fishery to give the appearance it is doing something while managing for political benefit,"" reads the BC Wildlife Federation letter, signed by its president Bill Bosch.

""This management approach is unraveling the social fabric of the public fishery, dividing users and communities and bankrupting service providers.""

DFO on its regulations

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans says declining chinook stocks demanded strong action.

""Southern BC Chinook populations face a number of potential challenges, including declining numbers returning to spawn, reduced survival and productivity, habitat pressures and a changing climate,"" reads an emailed statement from the DFO.

The DFO points out that in November of 2018, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) evaluated seven Fraser chinook populations as endangered, four as threatened and one as special concern.

""We urgently need to address these declines, as well as the changes to marine life and ecosystems that are directly affecting salmon and our coastal communities,"" reads the statement.

In answer to Brown and Assonitis’ assertion that fishers can avoid stocks of concern and continue to fish for those still in abundance, the DFO said, ""It is true that endangered, threatened, and special concern Fraser chinook co-migrate with more abundant chinook stocks in marine areas and often represent a small proportion of the total catch. However, given the current low productivity and low numbers of at-risk chinook, and to limit further declines of these populations, and in order to allow most fish to reach their spawning areas, fisheries management measures which realize very low fishery mortalities are required.""

The fishery management measures are intended to reduce fishery mortalities to near five percent.

""Given current population sizes of at-risk Fraser Chinook, this would allow for very low fishery mortalities in the range of several hundred to just over 1,000 chinook for each group of at-risk Fraser chinook for all fisheries in Canada, including First Nations, recreational and commercial,"" the statement continued.

""Conservation is our first priority in the management of the salmon fishery, followed by First Nations food, social and ceremonial fisheries. These are difficult decisions that impact a wide range of communities. It is important that we make decisions that will ultimately lead to improved salmon populations so that we have healthy and abundant salmon runs in the future that will support Indigenous, commercial and recreational fisheries.""

According to the DFO, its staff will be working with the Integrated Harvest Planning Committee, which has representatives from each fishing sector, to implement targeted fisheries in areas where at-risk Fraser River chinook should not be encountered.

The DFO is also considering whether to expand the retention of hatchery-origin marked chinook and mass-marking of hatchery chinook production.

There are several issues that DFO says it is considering in making this decision.

Mass-marking of all hatchery fish would require Canada to significantly adapt fishery monitoring and stock assessment programs to maintain information on wild Chinook and support Pacific Salmon Treaty obligations, according to the statement sent to The Chief.

Marking significant numbers of hatchery-origin chinook would be expensive and in some areas would be logistically challenging, DFO says.

Producing additional hatchery-origin chinook to support fisheries must be carefully planned to ensure the carrying capacity of natural systems to support salmon and control potential competitive interactions between hatchery and wild salmon, the DFO says.

It also must be done in a way to ensure that the genetic diversity of wild origin salmon is maintained, and that marked fish do not adversely impact wild unmarked stocks of conservation concern.

The department is conducting a pilot project to mark Conuma River Hatchery chinook, off the coast of Vancouver Island, in conjunction with a project exploring the application of genetic tools over the next three years.

Sea to Sky MP response

MP Patrick Weiler says he met with Sea to Sky sports fishers before the recent DFO decisions and was set to meet with them again this week.

""I certainly understand the impact to the recreational fishing industry and I definitely sympathize with them and those businesses and communities that rely on this. It does limit salmon harvesting opportunities in a very significant way,"" he said, adding that the long-term goal of the closures is to sustain the fisheries.

""I know the proposals made by the Sports Fishery Advisory Board were very well thought out and several of those were taking into account with the decisions that were made for the chinook fishery,"" he said, noting, in particular, the pilot project areas of retention.

The Big Bar massive landslide in the Fraser River has exacerbated the stress on the Fraser chinook stocks, he noted.

As does loss of salmon-bearing habitat and the impacts of climate change.

""In many ways, it is a perfect storm. So the decision that has been made has been done with this in mind, knowing that even adding additional stress that really puts these stocks of concern in a really, really difficult position,"" he said.

Weiler said while recreational fishers say they would only have a 1% impact on the stocks, 250,000 licenses are held for the Pacific Region, which includes our waters.

""When you look in terms of the absolute numbers, it is a significant impact. And even when you have very experienced anglers who make up this industry, by and large, there still is the risk of mortality with catch and release and identifying the right fish that they are taking out.""

On not even allowing catch and release, Weiler said that mortality is an issue and that environmental and First Nations groups have expressed concern about the practice.

Weiler rejected the suggestion that the closures weren't based on science, but on politics.

""That is one of the reasons it has taken a little bit longer this year to come out with the decisions on the fisheries because it was really important to take into account how effective the measures were last year and to make sure that what is being proposed this year is based on the evidence that DFO has at its disposal.""

Weiler acknowledged that DFO could be ""more transparent with their science.""

""I know that there are some positive changes that have been made on this in the last few years, but it certainly has a long way to go and I continue to... make that case to the minister and the parliamentary secretary for fisheries and oceans.""

He said that committees have been set up to include stakeholders.

""But I do think it is important that DFO make more strides to be transparent.""

Weiler touted the more than $100 million invested in improving stock assessment in 2018 and funds allocated to implement Fisheries Act changes.

""These things are really important so we have a better sense of the evidence so we can make the best decisions on the basis of them.""",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Seemed odd at the time, considering the mayor a few months previous supported an 8.2% tax hike going into council’s 2020 budget deliberations; council ultimately agreed on 7%.

article continues below

But, as regular readers will recall, Stewart had an explanation for what seemed like an about-face on his property tax stance.

“Well, when budgets come out, I like to support staff,” he said in response to a question from Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung in February. “And so I have each year said that I support the staff’s initial recommendations, but then listen to council debates and make my final vote accordingly. So in this case, however, I think going through two years of this [debate] that an early cap is important.”

A couple weeks later, council went at it again over the mayor’s motion and eventually landed on directing staff to report back on a 5% scenario in time for a mid-year update on what the budget looks like for 2021.

Then the world turned upside down.

People continue to get sick with COVID-19 and die, people continue to lose their jobs and the City of Vancouver is still reeling from the pandemic’s effect, having for a stretch lost up to $5 million per week in revenues.

Now we’re in July and city staff has prepared that anticipated mid-year budget forecast. It goes before council next Wednesday.

The report runs 17 pages and is filled with numbers, percentages and scenarios, including what it would take to arrive at a 5% tax hike, even as the city grapples with its financial future.

Let’s take a look …

Off the top, a 5% increase would see the owner of a median single-family home assessed at $1.6 million pay another $146 in 2021. The owner of a median strata property assessed at $688,000 would be dinged another $64 in tax.

Those bills, of course, don’t include increases in utility fees, which are forecast to go up by six to 10%, according to the staff report.

For a 5% scenario to unfold, it would mean a $17 million gap would have to be filled. That $17 million, by the way, is equivalent to a 2% tax hike.

So that’s why staff has, so far, said a 7% increase is what makes more sense at this time, when considering fixed costs, collective agreements and infrastructure work for 2021.

Staff makes it clear that any budget adjustments must come from service areas that are funded by tax. And the biggest service areas are the police and fire departments.

A total of 78% of their budgets is funded by taxpayers. So it’s no surprise that cuts or delays to those departments’ budgets play a major part in arriving at the 5% tax hike scenario.

The police department would be hardest hit, with a $6 million budget decrease that would mean a delay in hiring 20 officers and 10 staff. The department would also have to hold off on replacing up to 55 positions left vacant from retirements.

The effect?

“Reductions would lead to slower response times to emergency calls, reduced service levels to citizens and businesses, limited ability to respond to non-emergency calls, greater risk of unsolved crimes and cases being lost in court and increased rate of officer burnout,” the report said.

The hit to fire and rescue services would be $3 million and mean no new hiring and a delay in hiring 25 new firefighters, which would “reduce the ability of the department to effectively respond to all incident types and lead to potential increased risk of delayed fire response.”

It would also mean a delay in hiring two new fire prevention staff, which would slow down the department’s efforts “to reduce the volume and severity of fire calls through targeted community risk reduction activities, especially in more marginalized communities in the Downtown Eastside and at single-room-occupancy hotels.”

Also on hold would be the hiring of an assistant chief and “lieutenant of diversity and outreach” positions to “build on culture and diversity, increase focus on critical social issues and expand efforts to attract and maintain a workforce that represents Vancouver.”

Other cuts or delays to people and projects would have to come in the parks department ($1.5 million), engineering and public works ($1.4 million), libraries ($1 million) and other service areas, including funding capital infrastructure.

Staff makes it clear these are just examples, but are placed against a backdrop of uncertainty, as the pandemic persists and economic forecasts remain fluid.

The mayor himself is worried that not all residents will be able to afford to pay their taxes this year or next. That includes owners of business properties, too.

So is a 5% tax-hike cap realistic in these times?

That question has become further unanswerable and complicated with movements to “defund police,” mounting evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 to come and more anticipated job loss.

The staff report also makes it clear that senior government support is needed to fully restart city operations and “is critical to the city’s recovery plans.”

Staff says the city is now looking at a $124 million revenue decline this year. More than 1,500 city workers remain laid off, pay cuts are still in effect and community centres remain closed, albeit two of them providing refuge for homeless people.

February, as all of us can agree, seems like such a long time ago.

Last year, when Research Co. and Glacier Media asked this question, there was near-total consensus about the flag, the Canadian Armed Forces and the domestic economy. Significantly fewer respondents felt great about the monarchy, Parliament and the justice system.

article continues below

One year later, after the COVID-19 pandemic altered the way we live and communicate, the perceptions on some on these institutions and features went through noticeable shifts. The biggest drop is observed on the Canadian economy, which went from making 80% of Canadians proud in 2019 to only 53% in 2020. This is not shocking, as economic activity slowed dramatically during the lockdown and the unemployment rate is now in double digits.

Two other items that are near the top in 2020 underwent double-digit declines from 2019: the Canadian Armed Forces (74%, down 15 points) and the Canadian flag (82%, down 11 points).

While 64% of Canadians admit that hockey makes them proud, this number represents an eight-point drop from 2019. It has been difficult to get as worked up about the national sport as last year, with leagues – professional, youth and beer – being forced to cancel or postpone contests.

Three in four Canadians (75%, down two points) say the health care system elicits feelings of pride. Quebec is partly responsible for this result. The province has traditionally been more critical about this feature of Canadian life than all others, and this year is no exception. While only 61% of Quebecers are proud of health care, the proportion in all other provinces and regions fluctuates between 79% and 81%.

A similar proportion of Canadians (66%) say they are proud of the state of democracy in Canada, down four points in a year. We went through a divisive federal election late last year, as the regional breakdowns outline. The two areas that elected the fewest Liberal Party candidates in last year’s election to the House of Commons are less likely to be satisfied: Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 63% and Alberta at 58%.

Once again, the lowest-rated item on our list is the monarchy, dropping seven points to reach 40% across the country. Quebec pushes the national average down (31%), while British Columbia emerges as the most monarchist province in Canada (50%).

Unless a vaccine against COVID-19 is found relatively quickly, we will not have any official visits from Royal Family members that could sway these numbers. We found out earlier this year that indifference towards the monarchy has risen across the country, and the prospect of Prince Charles becoming king is not particularly thrilling for many Canadians.

Still, not all institutions and features of the country fared worse this year than in 2019. More than half of Canadians say they are proud of the Canadian justice system (55%, up 15 points) and Parliament (53%, up eight points).

In the case of the legislative branch, Canadians who voted for the governing Liberal Party are more likely to feel proud (72%) than those who cast ballots for the Conservative Party (42%) and the New Democratic Party (NDP) (41%). This is not unforeseen. When I had the chance to ask this question during Stephen Harper’s tenure in Ottawa, Tory voters were consistently euphoric while Grit supporters were dismayed.

The past few months have brought a new emphasis on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, especially in light of discussions related to racism and fairness. Seven in 10 Canadians (71%, up five points) say they are proud of multiculturalism, while more than three in five feel the same way about Indigenous culture (62%, up six points) and bilingualism (61%, up six points).

As expected, Quebec boasts the highest level of pride for bilingualism (71%). On Indigenous culture, pride reaches 67% in both British Columbia and Ontario. Multiculturalism is regarded positively by 77% of Canadians aged 18 to 34, but falls slightly to 70% among those aged 35 to 54 and to 66% among those aged 55 and over.

The differences between men and women are only sizable on three topics. Women are more like to feel pride in the health care system and multiculturalism (79% and 75% respectively) than men (70% and 66% respectively). Men switch on the monarchy, where 45% of female respondents are proud, but only 35% of male respondents join them.

The past 12 months were far from perfect, and the challenges are shown in the way Canadians are re-evaluating their relationship with what is supposed to define us. Our economy is no longer one of the top items on the list. The increases in pride for multiculturalism, Indigenous culture and bilingualism suggest that the country is growing fonder of what can be accomplished with consideration and an open mind.

While 21% of Canadians feel the environment is better now than it was six years ago, the proportion rises to 28% among those aged 18 to 34. Middle-aged and older voters are more skeptical about Ottawa’s policies on this file. Some would like to do more and others believe enough action has been taken already.

On this issue, party allegiance also plays a role south of the border. As Americans prepare for a presidential election that may lack the convention pageantry of the past, prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden has his largest lead over incumbent Donald Trump on managing the environment. Almost half of Americans(46%) regard Biden as the best person candidate on this issue – a 20-point advantage over his Republican Party rival.

Earlier this month, we studied perceptions about climate change in Canada and the United States. Almost two-thirds of Canadians (64%) think global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities. This represents a four-point increase since we last asked this question in July 2019, at the height of discussions about a “Green New Deal” before the federal election.

While 23% of Canadians believe global warming is a fact and mostly caused by natural changes, only 7% refer to it as a theory that has not yet been proven – a proportion that rises to 12% among those who voted for the Conservative Party last year.

In the United States, a smaller majority (53%) believe climate change is real and caused by emissions. The proportion of Americans who regard global warming as “natural changes” is similar to what we find in Canada (25%). Finally, 14% of Americans claim that climate change is an unproven theory – including 26% of Republican Party supporters.

A follow-up question provides a similar outcome, with 62% of Canadians and 51% of Americans branding climate change as a minor crisis. While 7% of Canadians and 16% of Americans think global warming is not a crisis at all, the numbers jump to 18% among federal Conservatives in Canada and 27% among Republicans in the United States.

In spite of the skepticism of these two well-defined groups, a countrywide consensus emerges on two possible ways forward. Large majorities of Canadians and Americans want companies and corporations (75% and 59% respectively), governments (69% and 56%), and individuals and consumers (64% and 55%) to do more in order to deal with issues related to climate change that are now happening or impacting people directly.

When asked about the consequences of climate change in the future, support is equally strong for decisive action from companies and corporations (76% in Canada and 61% in the United States), governments (71% and 58%), and individuals and consumers (66% and 55%).

When Canadians are asked about their willingness to pay higher taxes to adequately address seven specific issues, climate change is at the top of the list with 60%. Canadians are more reticent about higher taxes in order to address homelessness (55%), schools (also 55%), forest fires (53%), transit improvements (51%), housing improvements (50%) and floods (45%).

The way Americans perceive these fiscal choices is slightly different. In the United States, more residents are willing to pay higher taxes for schools (62%) and homelessness (58%). Climate change is ranked third on this list (54%), followed by forest fires (53%), transit improvements (52%), housing improvements (51%) and floods (47%).

There was an expectation that the actions of young environmental activists would be replicated inside North America’s homes. When parents are asked if their children’s lobbying efforts have been influential in some of their decisions, the numbers are similar in the two countries.

Majorities of parents (67% in Canada and 56% in the United States) say they have been compelled to recycle more because of conversations with their children. The level of effectiveness is lower on concerns such as driving less than usual (38% in Canada, 32% in the U.S.), taking shorter showers (34% in Canada, 31% in the U.S.) and reducing the consumption of meat (24% in the two countries).

The COVID-19 pandemic has not dented the desire of Canadians and Americans to deal with climate change, and their views are not particularly polarized. Most residents believe global warming is real, caused by humans, and a crisis, but American Republicans and Canadian Conservatives are more likely to be on the outside looking in.

Results are based on online studies conducted from June 1 to June 3, 2020, among representative samples of 1,000 adults Canada and the United States.

I don’t flat-out condemn riots or blockades and here’s why.

article continues below

There is this small country that claims to be one of the best-organized countries in the world. Everything in the country is neatly kept and rioting seldom happens. Only two occasions come to mind: the Iconoclastic Fury of 1566, and the Amsterdam Coronation Riots of 1980. And the first “Fury” didn’t even happen in the country as we know it today, at the time the low-lands were part of the Habsburg Empire.

A peaceful orderly bunch those low-landers. Still, I wish they hadn’t been as peaceful on one more occasion. I wish they had rioted more, burned buildings, burned trains, had shown civil disobedience and general condemnation. As it turned out, it was this attachment to orderly conduct that would change the lives of 140,000 Dutch citizens forever.

That’s not to say protests didn’t happen when Jewish deportations by the Nazis started. The February Strike in 1941 broke out in reaction to the Nazis violently rounding up Jews. When the deportations turned more “orderly,” the public protests died down. From there on it was up to the Dutch resistance to deter the Nazis.

There were no protests or strikes when the Nazis ordered a civil servant who had designed the new Dutch citizens registration system introduced in 1936, to continue his work that lead to an ID card that every Dutch citizen, 14 years and older, had to carry. The Dutch dutifully responded to exchange their notification card for the new ID. The notification cards were centrally kept as duplicate registration. The ID was impossible to counterfeit and contained information about religious affiliation: it was part of the many small-step Nazi measures to separate Jews from non-Jews.

There were no protests, nor rioting when the Dutch police was ordered by the Nazis to help round up Jews for transportation. It was up to individual officers to resign, few did as they knew Nazi collaborators would take their place and so the police attended to this new task.

There were no protests when the Nazis ordered the Dutch National Railways to transport Jews to Westerbork - the camp from which Jews were sent to the different concentration camps in Germany and Poland. The railways responded, and in fact were so dutiful that during the 1944 railway strike, no trains ran except for the ones going to Westerbork.

That’s why I wish there had been rioting, torching of trains used for transporting Jews, torching of buildings containing public records. This would have made the difference for my maternal family and 100,000 Dutch Jews. The resistance did what it could, but it couldn’t break the Nazi fear most people lived in.

It all came to and end, and many years later I continue to be deeply grateful for the role Canadian soldiers played in liberating the Netherlands and defeating the Nazis.

Yet that gratitude doesn’t blind me from what Canada’s governments and their laws, their policing, embedded as they are in false ideas of racial supremacy, continue to cause to Indigenous people: hardship, suffering, material loss. Resources from Indigenous lands continue to be taken without Indigenous consent. More than 30% people incarcerated in Canada are Indigenous, although Indigenous people makeup about 5% of the country’s population. Sufficient compensation is still lacking.

And…most people in Canada, including myself, benefit from this twisted situation every single day.

With this knowledge, we must do better, we have no other choice and must make right what is wrong.

So what‘s our excuse? None.

The COVID-19 pandemic compelled Canadians to figure out certain things that few of us had considered before.

For instance, two-thirds of provisional home workers in Canada (65%) told us that they want to continue working from home at least some days after their regular offices are available again. Most Canadians were also paying more attention to news and information, making changes to their exercise routines and acknowledging challenges with their diet.

As the lockdown lifts, we have a unique chance to study the intricacies of the Canadian household. The data collected by Research Co. and Glacier Media since March has shown remarkable gender gaps on issues such as the best moment to ease restrictions. This time, we wanted to take a look at how things are going inside the “confinement pod” for those who have lived through the lockdown with a spouse or partner.

At first glance, the findings point to a high level of satisfaction. Across the country, 46% of Canadians who live with their spouse or partner claim the COVID-19 pandemic made them grow closer to their significant other. A similar proportion (47%) report no change.

Only 6% of Canadians who are living with a spouse or partner disapprove of the performance of their significant other during the COVID-19 pandemic. This does not mean that the rating for our spouses or partners is close to perfect. While 69% of respondents “strongly approve,” 22% only “moderately approve.” This means that more than one in five Canadians are looking at their significant other across the room and thinking that an improvement would be welcome.

Gender and age decidedly play a role in the way we feel about our spouses or partners. Men are more likely to give an undisputed thumbs up (73%) than women (65%). While 85% of Canadians aged 55 and over “strongly approve” of their spouse or partner, the rating drops to 58% among those aged 35 to 54 and 56% among those aged 18 to 34.

Another key differentiator is how long a relationship has lasted. While the level of strong approval is 77% among those who have lived together for more than 10 years, it falls to 58% for those who have cohabited from six to 10 years and only 46% among those who have been together in the same household for five years or less.

Regionally, the pandemic seems to have led to more blissful couples in Manitoba and Saskatchewan (83%), Atlantic Canada (80%) and Alberta (75%). Three other provinces are below the 70% threshold on strongly approving of their spouse or partner: Ontario (66%), British Columbia (64%) and Quebec (also 64%).

We can see that there is some hesitation about providing perfect marks to a spouse or partner that – in most cases – we chose. The difference between men and women being “very satisfied” with their partner is minimal in these areas: taking care of pets (57% from men, 58% from women), overall attitude and demeanor (57% from men, 52% from women) and making decisions on what to do (56% from men, 50% from women).

The needle starts to move on two other issues: personal hygiene (72% from men, 66% from women) and providing emotional support when you need it (57% from men, 50% from women).

Women become decidedly more critical of men on the remaining three aspects tested. While 62% of men are “very satisfied” with their partner keeping the home clean and tidy, only 46% of women provide the same glowing marks. Similar fluctuations are observed on taking care of children (63% of men are “very satisfied”, compared with 46% of women) and cooking meals (64% of men are “very satisfied”, compared with 48% of women).

Few people can say they began 2020 expecting to spend most of their time at home, unable to go to the office, gyms or restaurants, and slowly welcoming other persons into their social circle in the summer. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled Canadian couples to rely on their spouse or partner in new ways.

While very few Canadians are voicing outright dissatisfaction with what they have witnessed from their spouse or partner in a time of crisis, there are some aspects – such as child rearing, meal preparation and cleanliness – where women have done better than men. A 17-point gender gap on satisfaction with “taking care of children” during the pandemic is not a great thing for Canada’s dads to find out right after Father’s Day. •

For more than five years, concerns about housing, homelessness and poverty dominated the issue landscape, with residents aged 18 to 34 and Metro Vancouverites being significantly more worried than their non-urban and older counterparts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way we look at the challenges facing the province. British Columbians aged 55 and over are responsible for pushing health care to the top of the list of provincial concerns, while those aged 35 to 54 became increasingly troubled by economic matters. For those aged 18 to 34 and Metro Vancouverites, however, housing affordability remains the one issue that requires attention.

article continues below

In December 2019, most British Columbians endorsed the performance of the provincial government on housing. At the time, more than 70% of the province’s residents expressed some agreement with the fiscal policies designed and implemented by the BC New Democratic Party (NDP) administration, and 49% expected them to be “effective” in making housing more affordable.

Six months later, views on the taxes have not shifted drastically. Practically four in five British Columbians agree with the provincial government’s decision to increase the foreign buyer’s tax (79%) and expand it to areas located outside of Metro Vancouver (also 79%).

The introduction of a “speculation tax” in specific urban areas targeting foreign and domestic homeowners who pay little or no income tax in British Columbia, and those who own second properties that are not long-term rentals, is currently endorsed by 77% of residents.

Public support is also high for the introduction of a tax of 0.2% on the value of homes between $3 million and $4 million, and a tax rate of 0.4% on the portion of a home’s value that exceeds $4 million (76%) and an increase in the property transfer tax from 3% to 5% for homes valued at more than $3 million (72%). The 5% portion only applies to the value greater than $3 million.

There is movement on the perceptions of residents on what the taxes may ultimately accomplish. Across the province, 57% of British Columbians think the actions of the BC NDP government will be effective in making housing more affordable, an eight-point increase since last year.

Among British Columbians who voted for the BC Liberals in the 2017 provincial election, views of the government’s actions improved from 49% in December 2019 to 67% this month. These are remarkable numbers for one of the key policy planks that the opposition party focused on after the government transition, particularly in the Vancouver riding that is represented by BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson. The proportion of British Columbians who are disappointed with how this issue has been handled has become smaller over time.

In spite of these figures, there are some fears that have been brought up by the COVID-19 pandemic. If real estate prices come down severely in British Columbia, the market may become too attractive for foreign buyers who will outbid young people trying to upgrade or simply attempting to get into the market.

There are some examples abroad on how to deal with this conundrum. New Zealand passed legislation that bans most foreigners from purchasing real estate in the country. There are exceptions for those who hold residency status in New Zealand, as well as citizens from Australia and Singapore, due to existing free trade agreements.

When British Columbians are asked about implementing a similar regulation across Canada, more than three in four (78%) are in favour of following New Zealand’s lead, while only 15% disagree and 7% are undecided.

Support for a new kind of legislation that would effectively forbid most non-Canadians from purchasing real estate is endorsed by sizable majorities across all demographics. The numbers climb markedly among men (80%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (88%) and residents of Vancouver Island (also 88%).

Once again, there is political consensus. While 73% of BC Green voters are in favour of a Canada-wide ban on foreigners owning real estate, the proportion jumps to 81% among BC Liberals and 87% among BC NDP voters.

The level of support for the provincial government’s taxes has been remarkably consistent over the past year. Still, this does not mean that the issue of housing affordability will be settled before the next provincial election rolls around. The provincial government will need to cut some ribbons in the next 16 months to show that its fiscal plans have actually been turned into housing units that local residents can enjoy.

At the time, 30% of Canadians said they were exercising at home more often than before the COVID-19 pandemic, including 36% of British Columbians.

Changing our habits is usually difficult. The first days of the lockdown may have motivated Canadians to act differently, but new traits are hard to stick by. By mid-April, some confided about overeating (29%) and drinking too much alcohol (13%) during the pandemic.

Just last week, we talked about the appreciation of millennials for goods baked at home and saw 30% of Canadians acknowledge that they have gained weight during the COVID-19 pandemic. This time, our focus went back to exercise.

The Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that adults in Canada accumulate at least two and a half hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week. Across the country, more than a third of Canadians (36%) told us that they were able to meet this goal “every week” before the COVID-19 pandemic began, while 24% were able to do this “on most weeks.”

Almost two in five Canadians aged 18 to 34 (38%) and aged 35 to 54 (also 38%) claim to have met the desired exercise threshold every week earlier this year, along with 38% of Ontarians, 37% of Albertans and 36% of British Columbians.

What a difference a pandemic makes. With some adults working from home and taking care of children, and many gyms and fitness facilities closed or slowly reopening with limited time slots, the amount of calories burned across the country has dropped significantly. This month, only 29% of Canadians are exercising vigorously for two and a half hours each week, down seven points since the days when COVID-19 did not affect our plans.

The drop in exercise appears in all age groups, with millennials trying their best to maintain their exercise routines every week (34%, down four points). Generation X has been less successful (29%, down seven points). Baby boomers also plunged on this measurement, to 25% from 33%.

British Columbia shows a worrying fluctuation. Before March, only 19% of the province’s residents said they “never” met the desired threshold for vigorous exercise, tied for the lowest number in the country with Alberta. Now, almost three in 10 British Columbians (28%) have given up on exercising, the third highest level in the country after Atlantic Canada (33%) and Quebec (29%). Practically one of every 10 residents of B.C. – usually the fittest province – simply gave up on exercise.

The current state of affairs is forcing people to find new ways to work out. A few weeks, ago, 47% of British Columbians told us they would not go back to the gym without a vaccine for COVID-19 – a proportion that climbed to 54% among women.

In this latest poll, practically half of Canadians (49%) say their exercise routine has been affected by the pandemic. The biggest setback, affecting 33% of residents, is not being able to go to a gym or community centre. This is especially problematic for Canadians aged 18 to 34 (48%), as well as British Columbians and Ontarians (39% each).

There are other components of physical activity that we miss. One in five Canadians (21%) has stopped going to a pool for swimming, and smaller proportions are no longer participating in an organized sports league (15%), going to a yoga studio (13%) or playing pickup sports that are not part of a league (12%).

The confinement has made some Canadians more creative. One in four (25%) is following workouts or routines online, 17% decided to take up a sport that does not require equipment, 12% acquired weightlifting gear and 9% bought a cardio machine for their home, such as an elliptical, treadmill or climber.

The actions of Canadians are not uniform across the country. While 52% of Ontarians have chosen not to do anything new to get their workout fix, the proportion is higher in Alberta (54%), Quebec (56%) and British Columbia (61%).

The country is slowly reopening, with each province specifying the guidelines that will need to be followed to prevent a second wave of infection in the fall. The prospect of a summer with some form of outdoor activities remains alive, but organized sports and pickup games appear to be more of a risk. In any case, some Canadians are showing resilience in trying to recreate their gyms at home and figuring out ways to stay healthy. •

As British Columbia begins to reopen after the lockdown, we asked the province’s residents about their views on whether 10 different business sectors should be eligible for a government bailout in order to continue offering their services. Across the province, the highest level of support for government assistance is observed for agri-food companies (73%), individual municipalities (70%), retailers (67%) and news organizations (57%).

The federal government has been particularly active in supporting the agrifood industry, increasing the lending capacity of Farm Credit Canada by an additional $5 billion and launching a venture capital fund to help companies adapt to the challenges that lie ahead.

With two-thirds of British Columbians calling for financial assistance for retailers, the big question will be what to save and how. Before the pandemic, we had already seen corporations closing bricks-and-mortar stores and moving to an online model. Any additional assistance for retailers may have to focus more on avoiding layoffs and less in facilitating leases for large spaces.

On individual municipalities, there is a conundrum, as local governments are not allowed to run a deficit. In April, some mayors expressed satisfaction with the measures of the provincial government related to borrowing authority for local governments and tax deferrals for businesses. This, however, stopped short of being an actual bailout.

If the federal or provincial governments decided to take a different course of action to ensure that municipalities can meet the needs of residents, they would not face a political meltdown. Solid majorities of residents who voted for the BC Liberals (78%), the BC New Democratic Party (71%) and the BC Green Party (63%) in 2017 are in favour of bailing out individual municipalities.

The public is divided on some other components of the provincial economy. Just under half of British Columbians are in favour of allowing airlines (49%) and film and entertainment companies (45%) to be eligible for government bailouts.

Airlines appear to be the type of business that would benefit from federal action, especially as it has become patently evident that international tourism will not be coming back to British Columbia in its previous form any time soon. Help has been provided so far in an attempt to stave off job losses, but it has not been completely effective. Provinces are starting to reopen and will urge Canadians to act as international tourists this summer: visit restaurants, stay the night and spend on souvenirs. Domestic flights could take a prominent role if the push to restart economic activity embraces interprovincial tourism.

Regions of the province that are not touched as prominently by the film and entertainment industry are not as likely to support a bailout. But in Metro Vancouver, where productions were happening every day before the pandemic, half of residents (50%) are in favour of governmental financial assistance.

As was the case when we asked Metro Vancouverites in April, British Columbians are more likely to endorse a bailout of taxi companies (49%) than ride-hailing companies (39%). In both instances, men are more supportive of this course of action (53% for taxis and 48% for ride-hailers) than women (46% and 32% respectively).

Enacting a program to help a different component of the local economy appears to be more complicated. Across the province, 38% of residents think individual sports franchises should be eligible for a government bailout, and 34% would extend this possible benefit to professional sports leagues.

As British Columbia paces slowly to Phase 3 of the pandemic recovery, some sporting events are happening in other parts of the world, albeit without fans in the stands. Residents of this province do not currently perceive sports franchises and leagues as a priority that requires immediate attention.

As expected, there is a sizable gender gap on sports that is not present in other industries. While 46% of men would allow governments to buttress individual franchises, only 29% of women concur. Also, while 43% of male respondents think government funds should assist professional leagues, just 26% of their female counterparts agree.

There are also some nuances on all questions when it comes to age. British Columbians aged 55 and over are the least likely to support bailouts in the areas of transportation, information, entertainment and sports. There might be an ideological opposition to deficits from Baby Boomers, as well as growing concerns about present and future commitments.

Younger residents appear more optimistic. British Columbians aged 35 to 54 – with established careers and eager to return to life as it was before the pandemic – are more likely to want to save everything. B.C. residents aged 18 to 34 put news organizations ahead of sports leagues and franchises.

It was obvious through the early part of the pandemic that she was kind and compassionate, brilliant and brave, but the full force of her power didn’t hit me until a rare moment when she was not in control.

It was a press conference announcing, for the first time, concrete plans for the reopening of the province. Nearly two months earlier, the COVID concern had become a full blown COVID crisis basically overnight, shutting down the entire province, country and much of the world. There was a lot of anticipation about this press conference and the reopening plan.

For two months we had been given daily updates from Dr. Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix about coronavirus outbreaks, drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus along with mournful tallies of lives taken by COVID-19. Then, at last, a faint light at the end of the tunnel. This media update promised not to be instructions on how to stay alive, but a plan for how we could start living again.

Except, it wasn’t the reassuring, comforting, exciting press conference I was expecting. I didn’t quite understand immediately why, but as I processed that particular media update, it became clear. The reason it was odd for me was that Dr. Henry wasn’t the lead voice, even though she was there on the stage. She was on one side, Dix was on the other (he’s been great through all of this too), and in the middle was the man who did most of the talking: Premier John Horgan.

I don’t have strong feelings one way or another for John Horgan. He seems a decent and caring enough fellow, and I appreciate his unwavering commitment to dad jokes.

But he’s not a public health expert, he’s a politician, and in that press conference he started talking about, just for a few moments, what a remarkable job his cabinet had done in coming together and formulating plans and this and that. And I don’t begrudge a politician talking like a politician, but also, at that very mid-pandemic moment, I didn’t care one tiny bit about a politician congratulating other politicians.

After that press conference I spoke to some friends and colleagues and many were also confused about what we’d just seen. There were questions. That Sunday was Mother’s Day. Should we hug our moms or not? Horgan had a folksy answer to the question, but we didn’t want folksy, we wanted facts. Most of all, we wanted Bonnie.

It never feels quite right in those rare moments where Dr. Bonnie Henry is not the lead voice instructing B.C. residents, writes columnist Andy Prest. photo THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chad Hipolito

I didn’t fully grasp that feeling until the next day, when Dr. Henry was once again centre stage, leading the information session. The answers were clear, my anxiety receded. That one voice is what I needed to hear.

Credit should go to Horgan and the B.C. government – they, for the most part, have let Henry be the face of the pandemic response in almost every regard. So many other places across the country and around the world have had their message confused by multiple voices coming at them, often with multiple agendas at play. In the United States, for instance, highly qualified public health experts have shared the stage with a politician who has, among many other baffling things, mused about treating COVID-19 by the “injection, inside” of “disinfectant,” a treatment that “would do a tremendous number on the lungs.” Yikes.

I feel bad even mentioning President Orange Supremacy in the same sentence as Dr. Bonnie Henry, because they are basically the perfect examples of someone who scores 0% on a test and someone who didn’t just ace the test, but also led study groups and tutorials so that everyone else in her class could pass, with honours, as well.

The proof is in the numbers. By any measure, B.C. has been remarkably successful in suppressing COVID-19. As of Friday our death rate was 3.34 per 100,000 people, in comparison to the rest of Canada which has a rate of 20.45 per 100,000, or the United States, with a rate of 34.14. And our death rate is set to drop – we had no new deaths over the entire weekend.

There are many reasons for this, but I am convinced that Dr. Henry's calm, kind and concise leadership is No. 1. Contrast that with Ontario, where cases have spiked again, there were dozens of deaths in recent days, and people are griping about the confusing way information is getting to the public.

Not here. Our one voice has been remarkably consistent and remarkably inspiring. The world has noticed – in the last week both the Toronto Star and New York Times have run glowing features about our Bonnie.

She deserves every word of praise. This past weekend I played physically distant but socially awesome baseball in a park with friends, then a couple of days later I hugged my mom and dad for the first time since March. My little bubble is slowly and safely expanding, and I felt incredible happiness, and confidence, doing those things because of the way Dr. Henry led us all here. This voyage is far from over, but we can all feel safe knowing that our captain is literally one of the best in the world.

We are spoiled by Dr. Henry, and it’s hard to fathom anyone speaking an ill word of her.

Look around you and see how our province is healing, faster than most any other place in the world. That is leadership.

That is Dr. Henry, and I will never forget what she has done for us.

Canadians were told to stay at home as much as possible, minimize trips to grocery stores, sanitize everything and adapt how they prepare meals in their household. With 40% of Canadians saying in April that they were not ordering food from restaurants because of a fear of infection, figuring out what to make every night presented a new challenge.

Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about what they are eating, how long it takes for them to make dinner and whether the isolation of the lockdown has forced them to reach for ampler clothes insider their closets.

Earlier this year, the federal government updated Canada’s Food Guide, a document that proposes ways for residents to achieve a healthy diet. Across the country, two-thirds of Canadians (66%) say they are “very familiar” or “moderately familiar” with Canada’s Food Guide, a proportion that jumps to 75% among women.

This high level of familiarity would suggest that Canadians are following the government’s recommended guidelines. But, as is often observed with bylaws related to bike helmets, pet waste or alcohol in parks, they are not being followed intently. Only 41% of Canadians say they follow the recommendations of Canada’s Food Guide “all the time” or “most of the time.”

Canadians who have decided to discard specific foods from their diet (such as vegans, vegetarians and pescatarians) are more likely to abide by the recommendations of the guide (62%) than those who can be described as omnivores (37%).

Nobody should attempt to blame younger generations for the demise of government-endorsed nutritional habits. Canadians aged 55 and over are the most likely to say they “never” follow the recommendations of Canada’s Food Guide (35%). The proportion of rejecters is lower among those aged 35 to 54 (28%) and those aged 18 to 34 (22%).

Aside from the fact that many Canadians are not following the guide, there are some shifts in what we are consuming during the pandemic. One in five Canadians (19%) report eating less fish and shellfish, and a slightly smaller proportion (15%) are eating less meat. In contrast, similar proportions of Canadians are adding more legumes (14%) and poultry (13%) to their diets.

Practically one in four Canadians (24%) say they are eating more fruits and vegetables than before the pandemic began, a proportion that includes three in 10 of those aged 18 to 34.

For the past several weeks, social media posts have been overloaded with pictures of people baking. Ingredients such as flour and yeast were in short supply at one point, and conversations that included the phrase “sourdough starter” multiplied. In our survey, one in five Canadians (21%) say they are baking bread more often at home, and three in 10 (29%) are baking more cookies and cakes than before the pandemic began.

Once again, millennials are leading the way, with 30% of Canadians aged 18 to 34 baking bread more and 39% indulging more often in homemade desserts.

In July 2019, we looked at how much time Canadians spent making dinner on an average weeknight. At the time, 30% of residents said they were done in less than 30 minutes, 60% devoted 31 to 60 minutes to prepare a meal and 10% took more than an hour to make dinner.

With fewer Canadians commuting and many working from home because of the pandemic, we could assume that more time would be spent learning about ingredients and partaking in more challenging recipes. This is not the case. The proportion of Canadians who prepare dinner on a weekday in less than half an hour increased by six points to 36%, and those who spend more than hour are down slightly to 8%.

The final question looked at the effect of the lockdown on our waistlines. Just over three in 10 Canadians (31%) confide that they have gained weight during the pandemic, while a majority (52%) report no change and 14% say they have lost weight.

Women (33%) and Canadians aged 18 to 34 (36%) are more likely to acknowledge that they have gained weight recently. Regionally, the numbers are highest in British Columbia (33%) and lowest in Ontario (29%).

The pandemic has showed some fluctuations in the behaviour of Canadians when it comes to food. While familiarity with Canada’s Food Guide is high, not many Canadians are looking at it when designing their meals. Even after spending all day at home, few Canadians are staying in the kitchen for more than one hour. •

As our usual routines slowly return from the sluggishness of the COVID-19 pandemic, Research Co. and Glacier Media looked at current perceptions of criminal activity across British Columbia. The survey outlines specific parts of the province where the perception of a worsening state of affairs because of COVID-19 is patent, disturbing findings on questions related to theft and racism, and some shifts on what residents perceive as the triggers of criminal activity.

As an issue that requires attention, crime is nowhere near the levels currently observed for health care, the economy, the pandemic and housing. We would have to go back a few years to a time of constant shootings in Vancouver and Surrey to find public safety at or near double digits in British Columbia’s collective mindset.

Still, across the province, almost two in five residents (38%) believe that the level of criminal activity in their community has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roughly the same proportion (37%) report no change from what things were like before March, and 13% think crime has decreased.

The nuisance of unwanted telephone messages, which we discussed in September 2019, remains, but this time with the added twist of blackmail. Since March, one in five British Columbians (20%) say someone attempted to extort them in an email or text message, and 16% say someone attempted to extort them by phone.

In Metro Vancouver, the proportion of residents who have experienced other crimes is distressing. Roughly one in four Metro Vancouverites report that, since March, someone broke into their workplace or office (25%), someone broke into or stole something from their car (24%) and someone broke into or stole something from their home (23%). Other regions of the province have been luckier, and more effective, in avoiding these incidents.

The other issue that is decidedly worrying is related to race relations. Across the province, 11% of British Columbians say someone directed racial slurs at them. The proportion of residents who have endured this behaviour climbs to 24% among those of East Asian and South Asian descent, and drops to 7% among residents of European ancestry.

We have seen several examples of racial tension that was exacerbated by COVID-19, particularly in the form of actual assaults and possible hate crimes caught on video. What Metro Vancouver is experiencing is, thankfully, fundamentally different from what is transpiring in the United States at this time.

When asked about what is contributing to the current situation related to crime in their communities, there is some movement. As was the case in August 2019, British Columbians are more likely to place blame on addiction and mental health issues (45% then, 43% now) and gangs and the illegal drug trade (32% then, 38% now).

While blaming crime on immigrants and minorities is ranked at the bottom of the eight issues tested, it went from 9% to 19% as a factor for criminal activity. Men (34%) and British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (38%) are more likely to feel this way than women, people aged 18 to 34 and baby boomers.

The pandemic appears to have provoked a spike in criminal activity in Metro Vancouver. Other areas of the province have been spared. British Columbians continue to look at drugs as the main generators of criminal activity, but the proportion of residents who are losing faith in concepts like equality, fairness and education could signal the start of a depressing trend.

The staunchly anti-deficit Stephen Harper was compelled to send Canada’s federal budget into the red as prime minister, but only after the size of the 2008 global financial crisis became evident to all.

The way in which elected politicians have dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to review which leaders are living in the present, and which ones operate with a playbook that has not been updated. Brazil, Mexico and the United States are examples of national administrations whose response to the crisis can be described as flat-footed, ideologically motivated and excruciatingly unscientific.

When 2019 was about to draw to a close, most political discussions in Canada concentrated on a perceived lack of unity in the country.

Last December, 40% of Albertans and Quebecers told Research Co. that their provinces would be better off as independent countries – a significantly higher proportion from the Canada-wide average of 25%.

In that same survey, we outlined the problems of two premiers. At the time, 60% of Ontarians wished for someone other than Doug Ford to lead the provincial government and 57% of Albertans felt the same way about Jason Kenney. In addition, 50% of Canadians believed their province would be better off with a different prime minister in Ottawa, and only 38% disagreed with this statement about the capabilities of Justin Trudeau.

Six months and one pandemic later, the numbers are different for the prime minister and some premiers, but the zeal for a landlocked, sovereign Alberta has dwindled considerably.

Across the country, 38% of Canadians think their province would be better off with a different prime minister in Ottawa, 12 points lower than last year. There is still a gender gap on this issue, with more men wishing for a different head of government than women (42% to 34%).

In three of the four most populous provinces, the numbers for Trudeau improved markedly since December 2019. While last year 53% of British Columbians preferred someone else in Ottawa, the proportion has fallen to 37%. Animosity toward the prime minister also fell in Ontario (to 35% from 51%) and Alberta (to 54% from 65%). Quebec’s numbers are essentially the same (38% in December 2019, 37% now).

Ottawa’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic is changing the perception of residents on the federal government. We could assume that all premiers would be the beneficiaries of a similar bump in public affection, but not every area of the country is feeling the same way. The biggest change is observed in Ontario, where the proportion of residents who want someone other than Ford in charge fell by 22 points to 38%. Quebec Premier François Legault and British Columbia Premier John Horgan also posted better numbers, with their unfavourability rating on this question going to 29% from 44% and to 36% from 42%, respectively.

Alberta was immune to the COVID-19 bounce. In December 2019, 57% of Albertans yearned for a different premier than Kenney. This time around, 56% of the province’s residents feel the same way.

Kenney has been unique among Canadians premiers in his ubiquity during pandemic press conferences, his criticism of federal health authorities and his inability to temporarily shelve campaign platitudes. Premiers of all political stripes – a New Democrat in B.C., a Conservative in Ontario and a populist in Quebec – have seen their numbers improve after establishing a positive emotional connection with residents. Kenney has been unable to match them.

Albertans are starting to look at governments in a different light. The past six months have brought recovery for the prime minister and stagnation for the premier. Hatred toward Ottawa has indubitably subsided. We will have to wait longer to see if the ludicrous idea of Alberta’s secession becomes a welcome side effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. •

Just over three years ago, British Columbians went to bed after an exhausting election night without knowing who would form the government. There are still 20 months to go before we cast a ballot again, following a change that effectively ended our spring elections and moved them – unless a government is defeated or engineers its own demise – to the month of October.

Research Co. and Glacier Media looked at the current state of affairs in the province and found a unique political panorama. The pandemic has affected how residents perceive the most significant challenges that will come our way. The approval rating for the two main party leaders improved dramatically. There is also a certain level of hesitation from voters about casting a ballot for one of the two minor parties.

This month, British Columbians are deeply divided on issues for the first time in several years. Housing, homelessness and poverty – the perennial top concern – has dropped to 21%, but remains crucial for those aged 18 to 34. Health care is now first across the province with 28%, and jumps to 38% among those aged 55 and over. Residents aged 35 to 54 are more likely to be concerned about COVID-19 right now.

On voting intention, the BC New Democratic Party (NDP) holds an eight-point lead over the BC Liberal Party (41% to 33%). Both parties have gained slightly (two points for the New Democrats and three points for the Liberals) since we last checked preferences in May 2019.

The BC NDP is holding on to a high level of support among two key demographics: voters aged 18 to 34 (46%) and women (45%). A silver lining for the current government’s chances of securing a new term can be seen with voters aged 35 to 54, where the New Democrats are currently 10 points ahead of the BC Liberals.

The BC Liberals are neck-and-neck with the governing party among men and voters aged 55 and over. On a regional basis, the official opposition trails in Metro Vancouver, but keeps a solid base of support in southern B.C. The main hindrance for the BC Liberals is the apparent re-emergence of the BC Conservative Party, currently at 8% among decided voters and bringing some 2017 BC Liberal voters into their tent.

Over the past decade, the level of support for the BC Conservatives has tended to flow with the success of its federal namesake. This is a party that can “poll well” in the middle of a term, but whose ultimate success hinges on the arduous task of recruiting candidates for every constituency. A ray of hope for the provincial Tories is the approval rating of leader Trevor Bolin reaching 35%, but the exact same proportion of residents do not have an opinion of him.

The BC Green Party is rebuilding, with interim leader Adam Olsen posting an approval rating of 49%, one point ahead of the improved indicator for BC Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson. However, the numbers for the Greens are not as great as they were last year, and their level of support has dropped to 16% in their stronghold of Vancouver Island. Time will tell whether this is a lull brought on by the absence of a full-time leader. In any case, the party will need to reconnect with former voters and endeavour to grow in the Lower Mainland.

There is a noticeable jump in the approval rating of Premier and BC NDP leader John Horgan, from 51% last year to 73% in 2020. The shift is an unmistakable reaction to the provincial government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reached a level of satisfaction of 69% earlier this month.

The untrained eye could glance at Horgan’s numbers and assume that the New Democrats would enjoy a massive victory if British Columbians voted today. Aside from the fact that the election is still months away, it is possible to have an approval rating that borders on three quarters of residents and still see a party below the 45% threshold in voting intention. There are many reasons for this, including local connection with candidates and sitting legislators, issues and, of course, campaigns.

On the other side of the aisle, Wilkinson’s approach to opposition during the COVID-19 pandemic has been rewarded with an approval rating that his predecessor, in government, never reached. The challenge for the BC Liberals will be to make the party more attractive to women and young voters in the next 16 months. The announced retirement of the unpopular figures that are richly responsible for the repulsion of the past will only help.

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Team Canada was electric all weekend, beating three of the top-four ranked teams in the world as 74,560 fans packed BC Place for the annual event.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

“A District of Sechelt resident was observed impersonating a bylaw officer and issuing fake parking tickets over the weekend,” a July 13 post on the district’s Facebook page said. “The fake ticket is a photocopy of a bylaw infraction warning, which would never be issued with a fine.”

The district said one of its staff members was on the receiving end of one of the fake tickets and reported it immediately. The person responsible has “been spoken to [and] has agreed to not impersonate a bylaw officer or obstruct bylaw officers.”

The district is advising people that if they get a bylaw violation notice or ticket and aren’t sure if it’s legit to contact the bylaw enforcement office at 604-740-8480.

This isn’t the first time fake parking tickets have shown up on windshields in Sechelt.

In late 2018 several people reported returning to their vehicles to find a ticket for $142 from “Sunshine Coast Parking Authority.”

RCMP at first thought it could be a scam because the ticket gave a website people could go to make payment, but it was later confirmed to be a prank.

The offences on those tickets included the usual parking violations and obviously fake ones like “Thinking only of yourself/laziness” and “Not keeping a safe level of blinker fluid.”",[]

He is currently serving 4.5 years, minus time already served for possession drugs, including fentanyl for the purpose of trafficking.

article continues below

The Squamish Chief wrote about Noel's charges and conviction, so we were interested in what he had to say for himself now, while behind bars.

When we spoke with him, Noel was in a room in Mountain Institution, a medium-security facility in the Fraser Valley where he is serving part of his sentence. A corrections officer dialed the phone and handed it to Noel, then he was left alone to speak with us.

What follows is a version of that conversation edited for length and clarity.

Q: Your issue was dealing drugs. There is an opioid crisis and people are dying. Do you think about that?

A: When I was into drugs, that is all you think about — getting drugs.

You are desensitized to all that. Now that I look back, it is not only the deaths, but it is also destroying families. Putting people in jail. It destroys lives all the way around. It destroys communities. It is bad stuff.

I was too deep in it. But now I look back at it and I understand.

Q: Some people are likely going to give us heck for talking to you. The argument would be why talk to you, given what you did and being in prison. What do you say to that?

A: I would say alcohol and drugs — I have been into them deep. And crack cocaine, I did that from 2003 to 2010.

Even when I restarted doing drugs I was doing meth.

Once you are stuck in that cycle, it is so hard to get out.

With the drugs, you will mess up your family. The drug is so strong that it destroys lives.

I am done.

I was clean for six years. I know I can do it.

The only way I made my way out the first time is to find God.

I messed up again, but I know that I have reconnected with God again and I know when I get out, I will be good with it.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about Mountain Institution and what it is like there for you?

A: It is a 120-man unit.

You eat in the cafeteria. You get yard-time four times a day, for one hour each time. But right now because of COVID-19, we are only getting one yard a day.

Basically, we stay on the units the whole day.

Q: What was it like to be in there and the pandemic sweeping the globe? Were you aware of it when it first started?

A: Yes. We aren't allowed to get newspapers, but we saw it on the news. The gym is closed, we couldn't get any visitors. I didn't get sick.

Q: Can you tell me about how you came to Squamish and when?

A: I came from Quebec. I was in Whistler in 1995 and moved to Squamish in 1996.

It was cheaper in Squamish. I was only 21 and I was working construction and after a few months, one of my friends said he lived in Squamish and was going to travel.

I stayed at his place until I found a place of my own.

Q: And you worked mostly construction?

A: We were doing drilling and blasting back then for a contractor.

I worked doing some salt masonry.

Then I worked running an excavator and loader for a landscaping company.

Q: Obviously, something in your life went sideways, given where you are. What is your perspective on that?

A: My emotions got the best of me. I had gotten married and it went sideways.

Q: Do you struggle with drugs?

A: I did.

Q: Why do you think that happens?

A: I think a lot of people have trouble dealing with their emotions.

I got out of jail in 2012 and I was clean for six years and a productive member of society and then in 2016 when my marriage when sideways, I went ""Frick It!"" and I threw everything away. I thought I would party for a weekend, but I ended up going back to the way I had been living.

Q: What was your upbringing like with drugs and stuff like that?

A: My parents are not drug addicts. My dad was a weekend drinker, had two companies, was a hard worker.

I wasn't raised in that kind of environment. I was raised well.

Q: Do you think there is enough support in the Sea to Sky for people who want to manage their substance use?

A: I think it is pretty good. There's people like Lisa Young at Sea to Sky Community Services, if people need help, they are good.

And there is harm reduction and people to talk to.

I think there is some good help, but when somebody is not ready, they are just not ready.

But I will tell you one thing, I am ready now.

Q: There is talk of the decriminalization of drugs, say as Portugal has done. What do you think of that? More harm reduction and less criminal prosecution, would you like to see that?

A: I am an extremist. Some people can be functioning addicts, but no. I couldn't do it. I don't know if it would be that good, personally. I would still be an extremist.

Q: Does prison give you the chance to reflect on why you hurt yourself in this way?

A: Yes. The federal system has good programs. I did the three-month program. If you really wanted, you can do a trade in here too.

Q: When you get out, what do you want for yourself?

A: I still have until 2022, I am going to a drug rehabilitation house for a few months. Then I can have a job. I will be in a halfway house after that.

When I am working, I hope to put money away and rent a place, get to have weekends there, slowly.

Q: If you picture your best future, what would it be?

A: I am going to be drug-free. I think I want to get into car detailing and slowly maybe sell cars and maybe get a dealer's license. Or maybe even mobile car detailing?

Q: What are you looking forward to the first day you are out?

A: Dairy Queen, coffee and donuts.

Q: Anything else you would like people to know?

A: I would like them to know that once people are on drugs, it changes them. That is not the real person. That is the drug that you are seeing. It is sad. If someone you know is struggling with drugs, maybe take them to the gym or for a hike. Help him slowly to get better. For myself, if I would have gone to the gym and saw some gains and would have been happier with myself, that might have changed things. When you are on drugs you become unhappy and depressed.

Q: There's a lot of writing and understanding now about how addictions are linked to trauma. So the addiction is a symptom of something else?

A: Yes, I would say so. Trauma, mental health issues. And some people also hurt their backs, end up getting prescribed medication and then end up on street drugs.

Q: Why did you agree to do this interview?

A: I don't know. I just wanted to be helpful.

363,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/opinion/the-drive-to-preserve-the-lil-wat-language-1.24166970,The drive to preserve the Lil’wat language,['Alyssa Noel'],,"In mid-March, Valerie St-Arnaud and her husband Dave Leveille found themselves hurtling cross-country in a large, black RAM Promaster van during not just a snowstorm, but also a burgeoning pandemic.

The couple had just purchased the van from Ontario and were in the process of bringing it back home to Pemberton.

article continues below

""We were at our family's house in Quebec and heard about social distancing, but we had to bring the van in 10 days because our registration was expiring,"" St-Arnaud explains. ""We did the road trip across Canada and there was no one on the road. It was just the two of us. We got back on March 23 just in time. There was a huge snowstorm and we were freaking out.""

Fast forward a few short months and not only has so much changed globally, but the couple has also completely transformed the van in that time.

On Thursday, June 18, the van officially began to fulfill its destiny as a mobile recording studio as part of Bonding Beaver Media—St-Arnaud and Leveille's company that aims to foster and support the preservation of Indigenous languages through multimedia—when they travelled to the home of Lil'wat Nation elder Priscilla Ritchie to record.

""It's beautiful,"" Ritchie says about her first impression of the van. ""It's neat to have it come to my place instead of trying to find a way to get [to a recording studio].""

Mobile immersion

St-Arnaud first began working with the Lil'wat Nation around five years ago when she came on board as a contractor to help edit down 200 hours of film into a one-hour movie.

""I volunteered a lot of my time initially, so it created a really good connection, and meeting the elders was awesome,"" she says. ""They started realizing online resources and videos are the best ways to preserve language and culture. A lot of my [subsequent] contracts were focused on preserving language.""

The Lil'wat Nation has made a huge push in recent years to not just preserve its Ucwalmícwts language, but also help it flourish in the community and increase the current rate of fluent speakers, which sits at less than three per cent. A major concern with elders getting older was that the language could disappear along with them.

At the post-secondary level, Mount Currie's Ts'zil Learning Centre offers language skills classes; Ucwalmícwts is part of the curriculum at local elementary and high schools; and at the Xet'ólacw Community School, students from Kindergarten to Grade 3 can take part in an Ucwalmícwts immersion program.

The Lil'wat Nation also hosts the First Voices website as a community resource for language learners. Anyone can simply log on, click on various words and phrases and hear the Ucwalmícwts word as well as its proper pronunciation and English translation.

That latter online resource is what St-Arnaud's roving recording studio is contributing to.

""It's really in demand right now,"" she says. ""My end goal is not just for me to be able to drive the van around and record with elders, but also train the youth so they can go see their grandma and record the language. Our objective is to see more of those overall fluent speakers in their community and assist them to be able to do that.""

(St-Arnaud, who is not Lil'wat, has also taken language classes to learn Ucwalmícwts.)

Initially, she and the Lil'wat elders were holed up in the dedicated recording space at the Ts'zil Learning Centre to record. But it was tricky.

""It's so hard for them to travel around [and] they come to the community centre to record language, and you can hear everyone in the building,"" St-Arnaud says. ""We have this equipment that's high end, but you have trouble hearing the audio.""

One day, St-Arnaud was talking about her company, Bonding Beaver Media, and the language preservation work she was doing with Dawn Johnson, former executive director at Stewardship Pemberton, where she had done some volunteer video work in the past. By chance, Johnson had recently chatted with Verna Stager, the education director at the Xet'ólacw Community School, who had an idea.

""How cool would it be to have a van and travel everywhere and preserve language and [shoot] video?'"" Stager said to Johnson.

""She was laughing about it saying, 'There's a van for everything now,"" St. Arnaud recalls.

Immediately struck by the concept, St. Arnaud quickly followed up with Stager, who was keen to go head with the project.

When she first conceived of the idea, Stager imagined it would save time trying to arrange travel with elders and, on top of that, would allow elders with limited mobility or health issues to take part.

""The other advantage, of course, was being able to share it,"" Stager says. ""The cultural centre, the school, the band office, when they're doing work on inherent rights and wanting to record elders, it makes a lot of sense for sharing. I'm thinking that it's this little space everybody will come to know.""

She also believes it will add to the resources teachers at the school will have. ""At Xet'ólacw, we have an immersion program, so we're translating a lot of information and writing our own curriculum … We just finished some of that work,"" says Stager. ""So the staff are eager to get to have enough resources to do a really good job of teaching the language. It will be online and I think there's a number of ways that the teachers can use it in the classrooms, but it also can be used to improve the fluency of the language teachers.""

Overall, Stager was surprised to see just how quickly St-Arnaud turned the project around after that call.

""I was actually a bit shocked that Val jumped on the way she did,"" she adds. ""But I'm thankful she did.""

Lost in translation

Translating an entire dictionary is no quick or easy task.

In one session, St-Arnaud and the fluent Ucwalmícwts speaker she's working with can record 50 to 100 words per hour. But the challenge is some Ucwalmícwts words don't have direct English translations. (The written version of the language, in fact, was only created in 1974 by Simon Fraser University linguist Dr. Jan Van Eijk.)

One example of an English word without a direct translation they ran into was ""stewardship,"" so they settled on an Ucwalmícwts translation of ""keeper of the land.""

""Sometimes we could be there for hours until they have a proper translation for it,"" St-Arnaud says.

But for Ritchie, a Lil'wat elder who's been part of the project, the effort is well worth it. She learned Ucwalmícwts from her father, who university researchers would consult about the language.

""This is just another step towards what he was trying to do: preserving our language and our way of life,"" Ritchie says. ""I spoke the language growing up, but the more you don't use it, the more you lose. This way, it seems to be encouraging us to use our language more or try to find more ways to say things in our traditional way.""

Language isn't just spoken words, she adds. It's identity.

""A lot of words have personal meaning for us, especially our place names and river names and our own personal names that are handed down … It was getting lost.

""Here we have technology that can do these things now. We can record them and save them on the computer or even for people to be using them on their iPad nowadays. It's exciting.""

It's a fulfilling personal challenge too, Ritchie adds.

""I enjoy it. It challenges my vocabulary and my pronunciation. We do one word at a time or everyday sentences.""

St-Arnaud initially grappled with being a white woman coming into the community to work on a deeply cultural project. To that end, it was important for her to build relationships, try to learn the language herself, and, most importantly, mentor young community members so they could carry on the work.

""I'm so happy I get to do something so fulfilling,"" she says. ""At first I was like, 'Who am I to come in and do that?' But eventually, you realize you're helping and it's such a great community to work with … The difference between me and other companies that aren't located in B.C. is I can mentor. At the end of the day, it's their language, their community, it gives them the opportunity to record their own elders and create jobs.""

Eventually, St-Arnaud hopes to bring the van to other Indigenous communities that are also working on language preservation.

""For sure there's going to be a little bit of hesitation when we work with new nations,"" she says. ""If you work with that nation, you need to know where they're coming from and where that resistance comes from.""

Before COVID-19, Bonding Beaver had arranged to travel to a band near Chilliwack for recording, but that's been put on hold due to the pandemic.

""At the end of the day, I think we just have to go for it,"" St-Arnaud says. ""We just had such good feedback and we see such a need for it.""

It is exceedingly rare in B.C. Emergency Health Services to have the same partner on the road for so long. From chest pains to gunshot wounds, they’ve seen it all and it’s likely anyone who rode in the back of their ambulance benefited from the friendship.

article continues below

“You always work in twos so your partnership is everything. How good your partnership is sets the tone for how well the call goes, sets the tone for life after the call,” Block said. “You have to be able to get along with the person and obviously we did. We were just very good together. We honed our craft together.”

The two first met in 1987 when Block was working as a scuba instructor and Marklund was getting into the sport. They became fast friends, and in doing so, learned they both had aspirations to become paramedics.

Block was the first one to land a job in Whistler. Marklund joined him soon after.

“I was on a different career path. But a few months after hearing that he was doing well up there, I decided to come up and have a talk with the boss at the time, and then I got hired,” he said. “That man quickly learned that Randy and I would commute together. On our time off, we would exercise together. We were pretty much joined at the hip. So then we were scheduled together,” Marklund said.

Because Block was slightly ahead in seniority, he was always the first up for a new position closer to home in North Vancouver, where both men wanted to return. As their careers advanced, Block never had to wait more than a few months before Marklund would catch up with him and they’d be partners again.

Then 17 years ago, they both landed plum jobs on the North Shore, assigned to the same ambulance on the same day, which was “extremely rare” in emergency health services.

“Our management said that ‘This never happens, but you guys are moving together to start in West Vancouver,’” Marklund said.

The two would regularly debrief after a call, analyzing how it went and what they could learn to make the next one better.

Marklund was always the more serious member of the pair while Block characterized himself as easier going. But they had similar senses of humour, which would only strengthen their bond.

“We would sit back and laugh our heads off – laugh to tears sometimes, and just sit and enjoy the moment and relax for a little bit until it was time for us to return to duty and get into the next event,” Marklund said.

Together, they’ve hit the lights and sirens 26,268 times. Marklund had been counting. And over 30 years, they’ve seen it all, to the point that memories of calls tend to blur together. When the 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot happened, Marklund and Block were on the scene so fast, other emergency health services members joked they may have been the ones to start it.

Through it all, they never got sick of one another.

“It’s like a marriage, though. Isn’t it?” Marklund said. “You know, good days and bad days for everything, right?”

Marklund announced his retirement in May. It means Block has had to adjust to having someone new at his side.

“Dave will downplay this, but there’s no question in my mind. He’s one of the finest paramedics that our service has,” Block said. “Our friendship, you know, is locked in for life.”

Marklund agreed, at least about the friendship part.

“We joke that when we get old enough to live in a retirement facility, we’ll get a room together – put our beds in there and get a PlayStation and Xbox and play video games, and just laugh our heads off,” he said.",[]

It started out with just Wimberley, who is also known as the Pink Pied Piper, and his wife and son. Gradually, neighbours began streaming out to 15th Street and Mahon Avenue for the nightly “parade” – especially kids.

“It's been quite an amazing little journey,” he said. “It caught on and so we were out every evening and through May and into June.”

Although there are philistines who don’t appreciate the sound of bagpipes, Wimberley said he’s been struck by the warm praise that’s come from the nightly morale booster in dark times.

“There's been a lot of folks are saying, ‘This is fantastic. This is wonderful. You've really done wonders for the community and for the health workers,’” he said.

Other members of the Docs and Socks pipe band he belongs to have had similar experiences outside their homes, Wimberley said.

Though he played rain or shine, there is a small asterisk on the 100. In mid-May, Wimberley wound up face to face with the health-care workers he’s played in praise of. He was in pain one evening but waited until after the parade before going to the hospital, where he was prepped for emergency gallbladder surgery.

While he was convalescing, his family filled in, playing pipe music through a speaker for the gathered neighbours. When Wimberley returned home, there was a stack of Get Well cards waiting for him, mostly from kids in the neighbourhood.

At the end of May, a neighbour snapped photos of all the folks who had been turning out for the nighty parades, compiled them into a book and got everyone to sign a birthday greeting for Wimberley.

“Which was fantastic because when you play the pipes - it's great, you're entertaining everyone - but you never get to meet anyone,” he said.

Since March, British Columbians have by and large done their part to “flatten the curve.”

New COVID-19 infections are averaging between 10 and 20 per day and the ICUs never ran out of ventilators as was feared in the worst case scenario. And, as of the last update from provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, only 17 people in B.C. are in hospital with the virus.

With thing somewhat returning to normal, Wimberley has decided to scale things back. At first he thought Canada Day might be a good time for one final blowout performance. That would be his 99th night on the job – another number that holds a special place in the hearts of Canadians. But he thought to make it an even 100 on July 2.

Even now, though, Wimberley says he’ll keep the parades up on Friday and Saturday nights. He isn’t quite ready to walk away from what he’s started because he doesn’t want to seeing his neighbours stop coming together while staying six feet apart.

“They just got to come out in the evenings and see each other, and meet and greet each other, and get to know people from three houses away or four houses away,” he said. “It started out and still is the 7 p.m. tribute to the health workers. But somewhere along the way, we built a little community.”",[]

“Since the beginning of the pandemic, we only identified six lab-confirmed cases in the Sunshine Coast Local Health Area, and there are currently no active cases that we are following,” said McKee in a July 2 phone interview with Coast Reporter.

On June 16, the Sunshine Coast COVID-19 Physician Task Force had announced there hadn’t been positive COVID-19 tests in the region in more than two months. McKee said the number of cases in the rural parts of the healthy authority made up three per cent of total VCH cases.

He said those six lab-confirmed diagnoses don’t include every case, since some may not have been tested, but “it shows the rural areas were less impacted than other urban areas,” as well as “the exceptional work done by everyone throughout the community to implement control measures.”

He said the health authority has “managed to follow up very quickly with contacts and reduce any likelihood of exposure, so when we have low numbers, I think it really does speak to the low level of community transmission that has occurred.”

He didn’t disclose whether any deaths occurred on the Sunshine Coast for confidentiality reasons.

Despite the low numbers, until a vaccine is found, there will always be a risk and it’s important to continue taking precautions, said McKee. He also said that in general, he was not aware of any particular breaches of public health orders that required enforcement.

McKee will be updating Sunshine Coast residents and answering questions on Tuesday, July 7 during a Facebook Live event scheduled for noon as the province enters its third week of Phase 3. “In the past the provincial government has led communication around COVID-19,” he said, “but we now have this opportunity to address specific questions at a local level.”

He expects questions from business owners and organizations as they work through their own protocols and safety plans.

For the Sunshine Coast, many of those local considerations revolve around tourism and the expectation of more visitors.

McKee said he also plans on discussing measures businesses, organizations and individuals can take to reduce risk, but that much of the messaging remains the same: staying at home if sick, maintaining good hand hygiene, finding ways to “enhance physical distancing,” and taking additional measure such as wearing masks, if needed.

McKee said he also plans to answer questions on how to be a good traveller. “It really is about everybody being respectful and taking appropriate precautions,” such as researching places in advance to understand the expectations of the community and its businesses, keeping visits short and staying as self-sufficient as possible by bringing supplies.

Even though the restart is safe, “we do still need to take precautions and listen to public health advice,” he said.

McKee also plans to provide more “nuanced” information about what it means to limit physical contact.

As a millennial, I've never really had cable. But I do have a bit of a streaming subscription problem––at one point or another I've been subscribed to Crave (+HBO), Amazon Prime (+Stack, Super Channel and Starz), Disney+ and Apple TV (ask me and I'll rate them for you)––but I also like a nice dose of (legal) free TV. In Canada, there are several options for free streaming content (if you can put up with a few ads). If you’ve worked your way through Netflix’s selection, here are some more options:

There’s of course CBC Gem. It has paid and free plans and has movies, documentaries and TV. The app and site has newer CBC shows like Burden of Truth with Smallville’s Kristen Kruk and Rookie Blue’s Peter Mooney (my grandmother and I have been known to binge-watch this one) or Anne with an E but also “retro favourites” like The Newsroom (this one has nothing to do with Aaron Sorkin), Made in Canada, Kids in the Hall and Due South. The free app also has non-CBC shows like Luther (with the incomparable Idris Elba), Wallander and Ronny Chieng: International Student. Or, you can also watch the news (but you have to pay for the 24/7 CBC News Network live stream).

On its website, CTV often has the most recent episode of a TV show with the back catalogue available through a TV service provider (right now my guilty watch on this site is Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, which is filmed in Vancouver). But, in CTV’s movies section, all sorts of free gems pop up. The selections are ever-changing so don’t delay if you see an intriguing movie. Among the current selection (which is quite large), you can catch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, After Earth, A League of Their Own, Serving in Silence, The Fifth Element, Bad Boys, Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla (and other Godzilla films), Hidden Figures and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. There’s also a “Throwback” section on CTV, which has shows like The Larry Sanders Show, Barney Miller, Strong Medicine, The Beast (starring Patrick Swayze shortly before he died), Community, 227, Charlie’s Angels, Dawson’s Creek, Fantasy Island, Justified, Just Shoot Me and T.J. Hooker.

There’s the ad-supported free streaming service Tubi. It has an impressive selection of TV shows and movies ranging from classics to more modern hits. One can watch TV shows like the Australian drama McLeod’s Daughters (season three is a tear-jerker), the classic western Bonanza, Blood Ties, Heartbeat, Tucker’s Witch, Family Affair, The Doris Day Show and Bridget & Eamon (the ribald Irish sitcom that is not suitable to watch with your grandmother). Movies range from Into the Wild, The Longest Yard and Blades of Glory to Pandemic, War of the Worlds 2 and the Excalibur Kid.

APTN has a limited selection of shows, movies and documentaries including Mohawk Girls (a comedy-drama series about four Mohawk women in their late 20s trying to find their place in the world), Blackstone and Hard Rock Medical (some also come in both English and French) on its website but more are available on its app (APTN lumi). The app costs $4.99 per month but there is a five-day free trial if something piques your interest.

Global TV has the most recent episodes of its current TV shows available but mostly everything else requires a sign-in through a TV provider. Among the shows you can watch week to week on Global are Carol’s Second Act, MacGyver (the reboot), Will and Grace (the last season of the reboot) and the NCIS franchise. Folded into the Global app are History, Food Network, HGTV, Women’s Network, Slice and Showcase.

While CityTV’s website seems to mostly require sign-in through a service provider, if you download its app, you can stream live TV and the most recent episodes of TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Mom (featuring Allison Janney and Anna Faris), General Hospital, Chicago Fire, Hudson & Rex, Lincoln Rhyme and the Bachelor.

The National Film Board has more than 3,000 films one can stream on its website. There are shorts, like the recently released Stories are in our Bones, older films like My Urban Garden (1984), sports films like Gone Curling (1963), animated films like The Tesla World Light (2017) and obviously thousands more. For a fee, one can also rent or buy films to download (rather than stream).

The sport’s provincial organization announced Monday the opening of the Tennis BC Hub through an agreement with the Richmond hotel, owned by Northland Prosperities Corporation. The goal of the new public facility is providing accessible and inclusive tennis programs, indoor court bookings, and tournaments for all ages and levels.

The news comes in the wake of many recent historical moments in Canadian tennis including Ontario’s Bianca Andreescu winning the 2019 US Open and Team Canada finishing runner-up at the Davis Cup Finals last year.

The trend is continuing into 2020 with British Columbia adding to this unforgettable time in Canadian tennis history. For the first time in BC’s history, Tennis BC will operate a facility. This milestone marks a major accomplishment for Tennis BC in its mission to inspire and enable the sport of tennis in British Columbia.

“This is a significant event for tennis in BC and in our organization’s 100-plus year history. Our vision for this facility is to be a leader in creating innovative tennis pathways that support health and well-being in our communities,” shared Mark Roberts, Tennis BC’s CEO.

“We are grateful to Northland Properties for providing us with this opportunity, and we look forward to continue working with our partners such as Tennis Canada and viaSport moving forward. Tennis BC and Tennis Canada will continue to work together to bring a Western Canada Tennis Centre to BC in the future to provide more year-round tennis facilities, accommodate participant demand and to further develop tennis players in BC.”

The facility, located at 10251 St Edwards Drive, is currently undergoing an update, including resurfacing of the three courts. Tennis BC Hub will open its doors to the public on March 1.

“We are excited to support Tennis British Columbia with this facility and their vision,” said Tom Gaglardi, President & CEO of Northland Properties Corporation. “We have strong company and family roots in Vancouver and look forward to further helping the development of tennis in BC.”

At the beginning of the conference, the welcome to the territory was given by a young woman who spoke and sang beautifully in Maori about her homeland. An Elder sitting next to me burst out laughing during the speech. When I asked her what was funny, she replied “I haven’t a clue what this young one is saying. I love that she speaks her language.” The revival of Maori means now they young people are fluent and their Elders, who can’t understand them, couldn’t be more proud.

Khelsílem is a young Squamish man who had a similar epiphany on a trip to New Zeland to study how Maori people were increasing fluency in their language. With only seven current fluent speakers of S k w x wú7mesh Sníchim (Squamish language), he was curious for ideas to increase that number.

article continues below

Using a novel set of language learning tools, including playing games and working with sign language, he began offering fluency classes in Squamish communities throughout the Squamish territory which runs from North Vancouver, all around Howe Sound and up the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers. People loved the energy of the game nights and they began acquiring beginner levels of fluency much more quickly than in the more standard classroom-based language courses.

Within a couple of years, Khelsílem had created a Squamish language immersion house and an organization to support his work called Kwi Awt Stelmexw, (disclosure: I’m an advisory board member). One of the more popular projects that Kwi Awt Stelmexw initiated was www.ohtheplacesyoushouldknow.com, a website and a map that collects and places Squamish place names back on the map of Howe Sound.

Among those places names are three that refer to Bowen Island. Kwemshenám’ is the name for Hood Point and is the source of the “fast drumming ground” translation that many people have heard about. It actually refers to ‘thumping’ or ‘stomping’ feet and relates to the story of how the blacktailed deer was created there when X áays, the Transformer brothers, visited the island and changed a hunter into the deer. It’s said that if you put your ear to the rocks as the tide is coming in over the bar between Hood Point and Finnistere Island, you can still hear the man’s footsteps, running from the Transformers.

Another name that comes from historical sources is Kwil’á k m or Xwlil’ x wm, which has been used for the name of Snug Cove, Deep Bay or indeed the whole island. Over the years that name has also been mis-translated as “fast drumming ground” and also “calm bay” but there is confusion about that meaning. It is almost certainly derived from the name Ne x wléle x m .

The name Ne x wléle x m is referenced in different forms by both Louis Miranda and August Jack Khatsahlahno, two 20th Century elders who shared knowledge of their place names with historians. It’s the one everyone wants to know about because that is the name that refers to the whole island.

“Uncle Louis Miranda was the one that remembered the name ‘Ne x wléle x m,” Khelsílem told me in a recent interview. “It’s an old name that comes from an older version of our language.”

It’s unclear what the name means or refers too, in much the same way that the original meaning of “Canada” has been confused over the years. Nevertheless, Ne x wléle x m appears to be the most reliable modern day spelling for the land mass that is now called Bowen Island.

But how do you say it?

Many Squamish language sounds are not found in English, but they are found in other European languages. The “ x ” is pronounced like the like the gutteral “ch” Yiddish word “chutzpah” or the Scottish word “loch.” When there is a “w” after the “ x ” you round your lips. Given that pronunciation, Ne x wléle x m is roughly pronounced “Nech-lei-lechum.” You’ll be forgiven if you say it “Neck-lele-coom.”

I asked Khelsílem why he thinks we should be using these names.

“It’s important because if the horrible effects of colonization hadn’t happened, these are the names we would be using to refer to these places. When we use these names we are re-imagining what this country would have looked like if tremendous harm hadn’t happened. Using the names is an act of healing the damage,” he says.

In short, it’s a simple step everyone can take towards advancing reconciliation.

“The invitation is to adopt a new normal and make these names just part of the vernacular that Islanders use to describe their home,” Khelsílem says. “So far the Squamish Nation hasn’t asked for the name of Bowen Island to be changed, but if they did, it would be nice if Islanders were the ones to petition for it to happen because they’d been using the names.”

I asked if Khelsilem would make a short video to teach the pronunciation of the most ancient names for Bowen Island. He’s squeezed it in to his schedule - after teaching a Squamish language immersion course at Simon Fraser University 6 hours a day, 5 day a week. Fifteen students with an average age of 21 have devoted eight months of their lives to becoming fluent in their language. In doing so, Khelsilem says, he’s significantly increasing the base of fluent speakers within the Squamish People.

“At the end of the year, we will have doubled the number of mid level novice speakers of this language,” he said. “In three years, we will have 45 young people well on their way to everyday fluency.” He has plans to build a language centre to support Squamish language learning and activities, modelled on a cross between traditional Squamish longhouses and the Maori maraes he saw in New Zealand.

It’s a remarkable vision and an inspiring commitment to increasing the use of the language of people in whose land we live. Robert Bringhurst once described our original Squamish place name as “a stony protuberance of meaning cloaked in a forest of evergreen consonants.” Just as we have come to love the forest and the rocks of this place perhaps we can come to love the original names too.",[]

There are what the government calls ""exposure events,"" at places such as the No. 5 Orange strip club, where people who were in attendance on July 1, 3, 4 and 7 are being told to monitor symptoms and to self-isolate if they believe that they have symptoms, such as a dry cough and fever.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 990 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1610 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 202 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

There was one new COVID-19-related death recorded in the past day, for a total of 187.

Of the 187 people actively fighting off the disease, 16 are in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

The recovery rate has dipped below 87%, as 2,679 people have recovered.

""As we continue through summer, simple steps will help us to keep COVID-19 low and slow in British Columbia,"" Henry and Dix said in their statement.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others. We know that the more layers of protection we use, the safer we will be. Let's all 'layer up' by washing our hands regularly, using barriers, staying a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is challenging.""

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

""The bodies are hurting but the crowd did it for us,” Jones said after Canada withstood a late barrage from South Africa to seal the podium finish. “[The crowd] pushed us in the final few minutes to hold on. It was amazing.""

Team Canada was electric all weekend, beating three of the top-four ranked teams in the world as 74,560 fans packed BC Place for the annual event.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

She’s the administrator of the Bowen Island Hikers Facebook group. The Undercurrent caught up with Olena to ask her some questions for those islanders itching to lace up their boots.

What is Bowen Island Hikers? A local community group for hikers of all levels to explore, connect, share, learn and preserve.

article continues below

Why did you start the group? I have started the group to unite, support and share experiences for all Bowen Island hikers in exploring hiking trails locally as well as off island. As an accomplished long-distance hiker, I am passionate about inspiring and motivating others in enjoying the magical outdoors, educating about backcountry safety, leave no trace, respect for nature and our land.

What sort of adventures have you gone on so far? We have explored the Valhalla Ridge trail cross island, ending at the golf course as well as enjoyed the Mt. Gardiner trails during the first snowfall. As an introduction to new members we have a short meet and greet hike up to Dorman Point every Friday morning with a coffee social post-hike.

What’s the level of difficulty for the hikes? From slow nature healing walks to adventurous Mount Gardener climbs. From locals to visitors – everyone is welcome.

What should participants bring? Basics for day hiking: daypack, water, snacks, headlamp, extra socks, hiking poles, dress in layers, wear comfortable hiking boots or runners. All other gear unique for each specific hike is listed in each event description. The most important is always: smiles and positive attitude.

Is there a cost? All events are free and run on a volunteer basis. Exception: hikes off island will be a normal ferry fee plus carpool share.

How frequent are the hikes? I try to have at least two to three hikes per week on a regular basis. Rain or shine, year around.

Are the hikes always on Bowen? The hikes are local as well as off island. Carpooling is a great affordable way to explore other beautiful hiking areas off-island.

If someone doesn’t have Facebook can they still participate in hikes? Most communications, event postings etc. are done through Facebook and Messenger. However, if people are interested in participating, I am happy to copy and email the information to everyone who is not on social media.",[]

“You don’t need to book a tee time. It’s free, and it’s available whenever you want,” says its creator Sam Nosek.

article continues below

All one needs is a disc.

The grand opening of Bowen’s first and only disc golf course is Nov. 3. The 5.7-acre nine-hole course in Veterans Park came to fruition through sponsors, donations, grants, volunteer time and Nosek’s tenacity.

Sam Nosek (left), Tobyn Ross and Dan Roden at the island’s new disc golf course in Veteran’s Park. The grand opening for the course is set for Nov. 3. Read all about it in next week’s Undercurrent. - Tobyn Ross

A few years back, some friends introduced the Bowen-raised Nosek to the game while he was living on the mainland. However, in 2012, he moved back to Bowen and found it to be disc deficient.

“I just started getting into it and then we moved to the island and there was no disc golf course,” he said. “I made a makeshift course around the yard but it just wasn’t quite the same.”

So began Nosek’s mission to build Bowen a disc golf course.

“I thought it’d be a good fit for the island,” he said.

Nosek’s initial proposal was a Crippen Park course, but when that didn’t work out the plan was shelved for a few years before the hills behind Bowen’s other golf course beckoned.

Council approved the current project location on the north side of the municipally owned Veterans Park in summer 2018 and volunteers got to work. Over the winter the course received funding from BIM, the Community Foundation, and Knick Knack Nook and organizations and businesses sponsored holes.

The course and holes themselves (“holes” are baskets mounted on a metal pole) were largely built through volunteer work on the part of Nosek, Tobyn Ross, Gareth Holden, Matt Ritchie, Dan Roden, Scott Bassendale, Steven Young, Bronwen Young, Jesse Milstead, Colin Mahoney and others.

The game, played with frisbees (discs) is basically the same concept as golf: one throws the frisbee from where it landed last, trying to get the disc in the “hole” in the fewest throws. Like in the other kind of golf, there are putters and drivers, they’re just discs with rims of various thickness.

While not even officially open yet, the course has received some official recognition.

Premier John Horgan sent a letter to Nosek in September commending the islander for his hard work creating the Veterans Park Disc Golf Course and promoting healthy outdoor education.

“As one who enjoys disc golf, I was very happy to hear of the success of your project,” wrote Horgan.

Nosek said that the letter came as a happy surprise.

“I was really appreciative,” said Nosek. “It was a nice gesture.”

For islanders who want to try their hand at disc golf, the course is fully operational. But this weekend the grand opening will have coffee, hot chocolate, cookies and discs for people to borrow if they just want to try out the game. In a nod to the municipal contribution to the course, sets of putters, mid-range and long-range drivers with the Bowen mascots will be for sale at the grand opening.

The opening starts at noon Nov. 3 and professional disc golfer Leanne Fulton will be providing lessons.",[]
387,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/sports/bowen-s-slopitch-ballers-represent-at-provincials-1.23953546,Bowen's SloPitch Ballers represent at provincials,['Henry Campbell'],,"As the Bowen Ballers took the field under the lights at MacLeod Athletic Park for their first game Friday night, more than one player remarked that it felt like they were playing in the “Show” (the big leagues).

And no wonder: the players and teams at the SPN Provincial Tournament were not messing around. From custom rolling luggage, full graphic team jerseys (the “Winnipeg Snow Cheetahs,” who hailed from Squamish, were a highlight), $1,000 bats, and extremely thick necks, these teams lived and breathed softball…and it proved to be an education for our hometown heroes.

The biggest adjustment for most players was the field itself. The Snug Cove diamond is about 220 feet at its longest point. The nearest fence in Langley is around 300. Over the fence home runs on Bowen became routine fly balls in Langley. Couple that with every team having ladies who could crush the ball and guys who could send it into space, the Ballers had their work cut out for them.

No one felt the hitting power of provincials players more than Rich Ralph and Rachel Klingler who were sitting in their car when it was impacted by a ball from what must have been close to a 340 foot jack. No one was hurt, but the car was dinged, and the Ballers were on notice that they were not on Bowen anymore.

The Ballers went 0-3 and were mercied (losing by more than twelve runs going into the fifth inning) twice in the seeding round.

After being worked over 15-2 by the Hot Pockets (who only played nine players and still destroyed them), the Ballers sat in the stands under drizzling rain trying to regroup. Though still all smiles and high spirits, to a player everyone resigned themselves to the very real possibility that they would be eliminated in the first game Sunday morning, going 0-4 on the trip and returning to the island without a lot to show for their efforts except going three for three on coin tosses.

But, as Yogi Berra said, “It ain’t over ‘till it’s over.”

As manager George Zawadzki finally arrived for the 8 a.m. game against the Black Knights, coach Spencer Grundy put the finishing touches on his lineup. Grundy and Zawadzki held true to their word: “everybody plays” and stuck with the agreed upon roster…though Grundy made some shrewd adjustments, most notably moving Robbie Clayton to the outfield and locking Andrea Layzell to first base.

Maybe it was George, maybe it was having nothing to lose but the Ballers started turning things around.

One asset the Ballers had over other teams was foot speed and they never passed up a chance to use it, always pushing for the extra base. This forced the Black Knights to make a play and seemed to surprise them. And then, finally, the Ballers’ bats caught fire. They racked up consistent hits and pulled off their first win with their tournament on the line, notching up a tonne of flesh wounds against the Black Knights and sending them home with a 14-8 defeat.

As the Ballers prepared for their second elimination game against the Hound Dogs, veteran player Brad “Ripper” Rypien (best summarized by his own maxim: “Back in the day, women wanted me and men wanted to be me”) noted of the playing conditions: “this is the worst I’ve ever seen.” The deluge continued and the infield looked more like a map of the great lakes than a reasonable ball diamond. Ground balls became completely unpredictable, often dying in puddles or ricocheting off of them at impossible angles.

The Ballers weren’t the best power hitters but one thing they could do was keep it on the ground, confounding infielders and taking advantage of footspeed to rack up runs.

An entire article could be written about the incredible catches of Robbie Clayton but the highlight was in the game against the Hound Dogs. They pounded a deep shot straight down the left field line for what looked like a sure extra base hit. Clayton was more than fifty feet from where the ball would land when it was struck. Sprinting at full speed, Clayton laid out and appeared to be flying without the restrictions of gravity, snatching the ball out of the air and pulling off the greatest catch this writer has ever seen in person. The Ballers cruised to a 14-8 victory and were headed to the semis against the Sweet Spot.

The Sweet Spot, the team of tournament organizer and president of the largest SloPitch league in Canada Peter Zeller, had made it to the finals every year since they started playing in the tournament and looked poised to do it again. But the Ballers were not going down without a fight.

As the sun came out, strong winds from the west pelted the field and also neutralized the power hitters of the Sweet Spot, forcing, again, the players to hit ground balls or fly out.

It is difficult to imagine a more exciting game. Back and forth play and tight fielding saw the Ballers tied after six and going to extra innings. In SloPitch, you start extra innings with a runner on second and one out. It’s a system that’s designed to put the game to bed quickly.

The Ballers, the away team, squeaked out a run before the Sweet Spot came up to bat. They tied the game, forcing a second extra inning. Incredibly, the same thing happened, forcing a third extra inning. Again, the Ballers scored one only to have their opponents match them, thus forcing a fourth extra inning that saw the Ballers put up two runs.

With the tying run on third and a runner on first, the batter hit a hot ground ball to ace pitcher Ben Sunderland. In the heat of the moment, he sent the ball to first instead of going for the lead runner. Andrea Layzell caught the throw, making the second out, with the opposing player sprinting for home. Seeing that the runner was safe on second, she fired a bullet to a perfectly positioned Jessie Perry who caught the ball a half second ahead of the runner for a game ending double play.

The Ballers erupted in cheers (and were joined by the Hot Pockets who, sitting in the stands, were now rooting for the underdogs from Bowen) and elation. George, sitting on the bench, smiled like the Cheshire cat. Everyone hugged and high fived as real life became a Disney movie. The Ballers were going to the finals in their first tournament ever away from the island. You couldn’t write this stuff.

Though strong for the first two innings, the Ballers were overmatched by Jersey City and the Cinderella run came to an end in the final game. As the Ballers gave their opponents three cheers, they gave themselves a much-deserved cheer.

You could not wipe the smiles off the faces of the runners up as they said their goodbyes and walked off the field. Those who love sports know that, at its best, there’s little that compares to a team coming together and being there for one another. It’s the same qualities that make families work and the same thing that makes for the best parts of life. It’s a kind of love that’s difficult to understand without being a part of it. But the Ballers felt it a on a glorious September day in Langley. Bowen Island, they did you proud.",[]

In practice, there is.” The words of baseball sage Yogi Berra ring more true than ever as the Bowen Island Co-Ed SloPitch league prepares to send a team of its best, and “best of Bowen,” players to compete against teams from all over British Columbia in the SPN Provincial Tournament in Langley this coming weekend (September 13 through 15).

George Zawadzki, president of the Bowen Island Co-Ed SloPitch league and coach of the provincials team, says: “[t]he Ballers are a talented and well-balanced squad that will play hard, and represent the league and Bowen Island with pride.” Drawing as equally as possible from the six teams in the league, George and the executive have put together a team that, on paper, has no weaknesses—but will they be able to execute in crunch time?

Made possible by extremely generous contributions from Ed Weismiller and J & E Backhoe, Bowen Island Pub, and the First Credit Union, the Ballers would love to have a few familiar faces in the stands at McLeod Athletic Park in Langley (should any islanders feel compelled to cross the water to watch some extremely…enthusiastic…softball).

Whatever the outcome, the Ballers will heed the immortal words of Jimmy Dugan: “there’s no crying in baseball!”

Team roster: Andrea Layzell, Ben Sunderland, Brad “Ripper” Rypien, Bruce Lyne, Casey Grundy, Courtney Morris, Duy Son, Gillian Drake, Henry Campbell, Iain Mitchell, James Lafferty, Jessie Perry, Kevin Manning, Lee Vincent, Rachel Klingler, Randi Topp, Rebecca Lyne, Rich Ralph, Robert Clayton, Spencer Grundy.

Ballers’ game schedule: first is Friday 7:40 p.m. vs. Sitters and Hitters at McLeod Athletic Park. Second is Saturday at 10:40 a.m. vs. Mariners at Ron Ralph Field.

Coach of the Year Iain Mitchell and his first year team, The Blu’s, took the field against the Mad Batters in the 9 a.m. game. The Blu’s play was unrecognizable compared to the start of the year. To a player, their game was excellent. They played the Mad Batters to a very respectable 14-12 loss and, deservedly, walked off the field with their heads held high. You can bet that Most Valuable Player Rachel Klingler and her crew will be ready to do some damage in 2020.

Considered by many to be the best precision hitting team in the league, the Mad Batters came to play and had a fun time doing it.

Led by the fielding of Gillian Drake, the speed of Bruce Lyne, the highlight reel catches of Andrew Monaghan, and the shrewd coaching of Jay Cottrell, the Batters had the 4 p.m. championship game in their sights all day long.

The 10:30 a.m. game saw the Cruisers take on the Loggers. As a nod to the injured, Most Sportsmanlike, lead singer of Ginger 66, and all around badass Michelle Harrison, the Cruisers sported faux black eyes as they took on a Loggers team many considered the strong favourite.

Led by the Most Fun Couple, Scott and Sheana Stevenson, and the Most Outstanding Pitcher, Ben Sunderland, the Loggers enjoy their well-earned reputation as the most lubricated and vocal team in the league. They treated the Cruisers to an incredible back and forth battle that ended in a “walk off” home run. Though disappointed by a season cut short, the Loggers took up residence in the bleachers and channelled their energy into boisterous cheering.

The Sluggers, perennial regular season champions, finished second in the overall standings this year and faced the lower-ranked Mad Batters in the 12 p.m. game. The veteran squad, led by Most Valuable Player Spencer Grundy and coached by league president George Zawadzki, gave the Mad Batters all they could handle for the first few innings but started squeezing the bats a little too tightly as the game approached the seventh. The Batters prevailed in the second upset of the day.

Led by the dynamic and Most Dedicated duo of Jared Brown and Andrea Layzell, the Phoenix were regular season champions and the only team to play five women and five men in every game—a trend they continued in the playoffs. The Phoenix took on the underdog Cruisers in the 2 p.m. game. Lead off hitter and crowd-favourite Daniel McGregor started the Cruisers off with a bang but Phoenix ultimately prevailed in a hard-fought contest.

The 4 p.m. game was the Batters versus Phoenix for the whole she-bang. Tight defence from both teams yielded a low-scoring affair that saw both teams get blanked in one inning…and run up five runs in another. The game ended in a 12-11 nail-biter. The Phoenix became the league’s first back-to-back champion.

The league accurately proclaimed this the “best season ever” and it ended with the best “wrap-up party ever.” Some hard work from a hardworking executive (including Bowen Superstar Casey Grundy) enabled players to eat tasty tacos at Doc Morgan’s while watching video montages assembled by Clive John Scarff. In a surprise twist, President George announced that he was stepping down and proposed league Treasurer, Chief Umpire, Most Sportsmanlike Player, and off the charts good guy Lee Vincent to step into the role. Will he accept? Only time will tell.

As the party took off, Ginger 66 rocked the house with a well-curated set of bangin’ cover tunes to the delight of a packed dance floor. At the end of the night, six teams of weary ball players found their way safely home. One can’t help but be comforted by the wisdom of the Bad News Bears: “there’s always next year.”

“There was lots of green with leprechauns and glitter and pots of gold,” laughs pro shop manager Les Meszaros. (Islanders might remember last year’s disco-themed “stayin’ alive” fundraiser.)

The club raised tens of thousands of dollars through silent and live auctions, donations, sponsorship and more. The tournament had 80 golfers with a further 40 people up for dinner at Montgomery’s Grill.

“The community supported us tremendously,” says Meszaros. “Everyone was very pleased.”

The event kicked off with the drop of an axe and good tunes. Enthusiastic spectators showed up in droves to support participants as they set out to run up, down and around some of Bowen’s best and most challenging trails. There were 112 racers in the open category and seven relay teams of three.

While the event brought a majority of runners from off-island, including the North Shore, Squamish, Vancouver, Coquitlam, Canmore, Courtenay, Brazil, England and even Australia, it was nice to see a strong contingent of Bowen Islanders.

Thirty-five islanders partook in this year’s race. This increase in local runners really livened up the trails as families cheered from the sidelines. Kids with musical instruments and big smiles created music in the forest, while bells ringing made for an encouraging atmosphere at some of the most challenging stages of the race.

The course is certainly not for the faint of heart, taking runners from the ferry dock in the Cove, through Crippen Memorial Gardens and the Meadow Trails out to and around Killarney Lake. The course is then routed up and around the north side of Mount Gardner on the Handloggers Trail, returning back to the Cove along the Mid-island Trail via Grafton Lake, through Camp Bow-Isle, back through Crippen Park, to Deep Bay, and finally to the stunning finish on the causeway.

All finishers earned something a little extra special this year as they crossed the finish line: a handcrafted Cocoa West chocolate bar with a customized Handloggers Half Marathon finishers label. In addition to the chocolate awards and other prize donations, the top finishers also earned custom-made axe-head medallions crafted with Bowen-sourced arbutus wood by local artist Bob Schultz. The effort and energy contributed by all organizers, families, friends and the community volunteers is so greatly appreciated in making the event a success.

Every year the race organization improves in response to its growing popularity and reputation. This year we’ve added a little something special for every participant that will leave them wanting a bit more of Bowen and we’ve got an added touch planned for the podium finishers as well. The race grows more complex and requires a greater volunteer commitment the larger it becomes, and we’re grateful to say that we always manage to get amazing support from the local community. Despite the growth of the event we’re striving to keep the experience very organic, leaving no trace and avoiding the temptation to give away swag that will end up being future waste. If you are interested in lending a hand on race day this year please let us know. There are often opportunities for another trail marshal here or there to keep runners on course.

Our primary purpose continues to be the support of the Bowen Island Trail Society (BITS). We can’t think of a better way to advocate for self-propelled recreation on our island than a mountain trail race like this. BITS came about as something of a by-product of Handloggers Half Marathon and reports from other trail users when it was recognized that our trails need maintenance and improved wayfinding. Funds from Handloggers Half together with donations from the Bowen Island Fire Department and other generous sources are being used for a large navigation improvement project on Mount Gardner Trails as well as some upcoming upgrades to a lot of the drainage challenges along sections of the Handloggers Trail on the north side of Mt. Gardner. In the past year more than 300 volunteer hours have gone into the project to improve trail blazes and the project in the coming year will require another large effort to implement signage at major intersections",[]

I had come across a photograph of the 1976 Bowen Island men’s baseball team, which I had been given as a member of the team. The photo has a special meaning in Bowen’s baseball history. Under the sponsorship of the Bowen Island Legion, the team was part of the first formal baseball league involving the participation of Bowen Island––complete with brand new, blue and gold uniforms bearing the Royal Canadian Legion crest.

I carefully framed the photo and brought it to the tournament to present to Eddie Weismiller, the venerated baseball pioneer and league hall of fame inductee who was a part of it all from the beginning, and is synonymous with the game on Bowen Island.

I showed the photo to players and coaches, which caused much interest and a variety of emotions––ranging from enthusiastic responses from those who recognized some of the players to nostalgic reminiscences from old timers like myself. Glen McGregor, another baseball icon and hall of fame inductee, took a keen interest in closely examining the photo. There ensued various animated discussions regarding the members of the team and many dutiful attempts at remembering the names of players who had long left the island. I could not help but marvel at the lively scene caused by that single photo––a delightful confirmation of how huge baseball is on our island!

When I spotted Eddie on the field after the game and walked over to present the photo to him, something rather remarkable occurred. Apart from Eddie and myself, George Helenius and Nelson Riley––the only other islanders in the photo who still live on Bowen––were also there! There is a shared humanity in the game of baseball which defies description, and the level of emotion became decidedly nostalgic at that moment.

Needless to say, it was particularly sweet for the four of us to be there as I presented Eddie with the framed photo. The moment was not lost on any of us, including a tournament team member who was very happy to take a picture of the four of us around the photo of Bowen’s fledgling “Boys of Summer.”

As we gathered for the picture, Eddie was visibly moved as were all of us––warmly and proudly reunited on Bowen’s “field of dreams.”",[]

But while scattered showers stopped some fans from attending the drizzle did not stop the Diggers from playing winning baseball.

Again.

Lead by the arm of pitcher Adam Woodward, the Digging crew beat the Cruisers in the final, 4-3, to take the coveted Scott Helenius Trophy, emblematic of the local fastpitch supremacy. The same two teams met in the final last year with the Diggers winning that game, too.

The Diggers have won four times in the last five years, five times since 2011.

The game was won in part on the strength of a two-run home-run from veteran Dan Cowper in the third inning. Cowper’s club carried a 4-0 lead into the sixth when Cruiser Jamie Weismiller manufactured a run with daring baserunning, narrowing the gap to 4-1.

In the seventh Clayton Hunter-James smacked a line-drive single for the Cruisers and with two out Robbie Watson connected on a Woodward fastpitch for one of his patented blasts to make it a one-run game.

But Woodward got a deep fly to right-center and the season was over.

The tourney was highlighted by a slew of close games, including the Cruisers edging the Fireman with a dramatic sixth inning home-run, 8-7 in a game that helped knock the Fireman, 2019 regular season champs, out of the tournament without making it to the semi-finals.

In another nail-biter the Shakers, lead by pitcher Noah Pryce-Jones, beat the Brewers, 5-4, in a game that saw the Brewers take the lead in the top of the seventh only to have the Shakers score twice to win it in the bottom of the inning.

The Brewers finished last in 2018 but vaulted up to second this year, rarefied air for the surging club, bolstered by the addition of pitcher Steve ‘the Mound of’ Baskerville and consistent hitting from the likes of James Strang, Derek Sinke and Robert Clayton.

Along with the Fireman, the rebuilding Twins did not make it to the final four, going the tournament without winning a single game. The result saw the two perennial league powerhouses literally sitting on the sidelines for the semi-finals.

In the best of Bowen baseball tradition, players from the Twins and Fireman, along with many of their families and friends, stayed to watch the rest of the tournament.

In one semi-final the Brewers were only down 7-6 heading into the seventh and were fighting to make to the final for the first time since 2009, when they were known as the Celtics. But it was the Diggers they had drawn and Michael Dawson, Eric Ander and teammates broke it open and won, 12-6.

In the other semi-final the Cruisers needed an extra inning to beat the Shakers, 14-11. That game featured a gutsy performance from Cruiser Spencer Grundy. Back from injury, the tournament was the first time the veteran Grundy has ever played baseball without an appendix, having had his removed last month.

At the ceremony at the end of play, ‘El Presidente’ Grundy handed out awards. Highlights included Digger Marlon Strang winning Rookie of the Year (the rich got richer) and Duy Son taking home the Greg Cope Award for sportsmanship, the second straight year a Twin won the award, a shocking development to some league vets.

Diggers Adam Woodward and Dan Guillon shared tournament MVP. A list of trophy winners will be up on the league’s Facebook page.

Once more the tournament featured a beer garden, food, amusing, cute-as-button children (Dylan, Owen, Griffin, Mikayla, Sophia etc.), many chasing homers and foul balls for a buck. There were also many dog fans (Kula Scrivens, Rufus, Duke, Coco and Pasquale Deegan among them).

Yet again there was outstanding work from the stats division and from announcers in the scorers booth (“The next batter: Jesus” for the long-and-thick-bearded Alex Lipsey-Ouimet, a.k.a. A-Lo).

The imported professional umpiring crew of Frank Hall (27th season), Colin Thompson (30th season) and Glen Keen (new) were consistent and made dramatic and fair calls. The umps have become honorary members of the Bowen baseball family.

When the 34th season was over and officially in the books, Cruiser owner/manager/third base coach and pitcher Eddie Weismiller, who has played in each of those seasons, announced his retirement.

There have not been a lot of surprises in the 2018-19 season. The Fireman and Diggers were expected to battle for first place and that has been happening from opening day to the latest standings, posted on the league’s Facebook last week.

article continues below

Led by their usual crew including the McEachern and Franklin brothers, along with pitcher Kurt Stuart, The Fireman, at press time sporting a 14-3 record, have pulled away and all but clinched first, winning not just the season but the right to choose a more favourable draw in the tourney.

The club finishing second also gets a more favourable draw in the tourney and there is a surprise in the battle for that position. The Brewers, 11-6, a team yet to win the tournament that usually sits at or near the bottom of the standings, are fighting for second with the Diggers (11-7).

The Diggers have won three of the last four tournaments.

Helped by an off-season trade that saw them acquire both pitcher Steve “the Mound of” Baskerville and utility fielder Brad Rypien from the Shakers for the rights to Donnie Nicholson and Terry Cotter (neither of whom came out of retirement to play), the Brewers haven’t relied solely on a bolstered pitching staff.

The club, managed this year by the artful baseball mind of Ben Roocroft, has been hitting its way to wins, led by Derek Sinke, James Strang, Calvin Hagge, Robert Clayton and Connor McLeod. Younger Brewcrewers like Wilson ‘the Willing One’ Dives have upped their game, too, and their defence continues to be led by fleet-of-foot centre-fielder Jackson Miller.

Miller’s father, Scott, remains with the team.

The Diggers continue to get their wins on the strength of an experienced pitching staff, led by Dan Guillon and Adam Woodward, and a line-up chock full of beefy power-hitters such as Aaron Johnstone, Brandon Speight, Charlie Barbour and a newly-minted father, Daniel Cowper.

The rest of the league standings have the Cruisers in fourth at 9-9, the Shakers in fifth at 6-12 and the rebuilding Twins at the bottom with just two wins.

Those Twins, historically the league’s winningest franchise, are an example of how regular season standings don’t have meaning in the tournament: two years ago the Twins came from the back of the pack to win it all, again.

The final scheduled league game goes Friday, August 2 (Cruisers v. Brewers). Big Jim Gibson, manger of the Cruisers, guarantees a win in that one. “If we don’t win that game,” Big Jim promised, “I’ll buy the Brewer who gets the winning hit a beer at the pub afterwards.”

In the days following that match-up any uncompleted rain-outs will be played and then a draw will occur for the tournament, first game going Friday, August 9 at 6:30 p.m.

From July 8 to 12, the club held its first high performance summer camp featuring several former BIFC players as well as current members. The week-long camp was coached by Morgan Quarry and Deidre Farah and was extremely successful as it involved a number of young Bowen players who have shown a high skill level and commitment to the sport.

article continues below

Sessions were focussed on skill development, ball possession, evasive dribbling, shielding and passing while encouraging proper technique and soccer awareness.

The second one-week camp was a skills camp coached by Tobi Volkmann, provided fundamental coaching for younger and newer players to the sport. It proved to be very popular.

The club also introduced its first summer adult coed drop-in games (Monday and Thursday evenings) as well as an adult skills clinic coached by Morgan on Wednesday evenings for those relatively new to the sport and/or eager to improve their skills.

The club will replicate its high performance and skills camp from August 26 to 30 with spots still open for the skills camp.

Finally, the club will be rolling out a new adult soccer program this fall aimed at new or experienced players who wish to play at a gentler pace than the current co-ed league. The club has been gathering feedback from a number of people and will be finalising details of the structure of this new adult program in the coming weeks. While the popular adult co-ed league will continue in the fall, the club is committed to expanding its programming to serve the needs and demands of a wider community here on Bowen Island.

She is dedicating the run to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. She was kind enough to answer some questions for the Undercurrent.

How long have you been running?

article continues below

I have been running since I was 16 years old, and my first marathon (42 kms) was at 18 in Montreal. Since then I have run 28 marathons in Canada, the U.S. and a few in Europe. I run six days out of seven, usually first thing in the morning, an hour a day. Running has become a moving meditation for me, a way of entering a space of prayer, of gratitude, and a way of connecting with something greater. In some way it is a celebration of life for me. I believe the poems I write are first born when I am running. These last few years I only run in the forests and trails.

What is the Knee Knackering North Shore Trail Run?

It is a 50 km ultramarathon trail run that takes place in B.C., on the second Saturday of July each year. This year it is happening on July 13. The route comprises of about 8000 ft of vertical climb and descent, and generally follows the Baden Powell trail through the North Shore Mountains, starting in Horseshoe Bay and ending in Deep Cove.

What makes this run different from any run you’ve done before?

It is entirely in the forest and very steep. Only a small part of the Knee Knacker course is flat. It’s nearly constant ups and downs, with jutting roots, rocks, and boulders. It can become a bit treacherous in the damp of the forest, especially as one gets tired. Less than 1.5 miles of this race is on tarmac, with the vast majority technical singletrack. I learned recently that Running Wild Magazine has recognized this race as one of the 25 toughest races in North America. Needless to say, I do feel a bit nervous about the day. I absolutely love forest and mountain running but this will be my first time doing an ultramarathon completely in this setting. I hope to go easy and slow and keep the energy of meditation and gratitude throughout the run. It’s all about having a little fun and the privilege of running in beautiful British Columbia.

Why are you dedicating the run to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society?

Every marathon I have run becomes a dedication to an environmental or social cause that is important to me. This year’s ultramarathon is being dedicated spiritually and financially to Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Like so many people everywhere, I am deeply concerned about our oceans and marine wildlife and in this time of climate change. Now more than ever we need to do everything we can to care for our oceans. Bowen Island is blessed to have whales returning to our waters and we all get so excited when we see them from our shores! But we must not become complacent. There is so much work to be done to keep Howe Sound healthy. Established in 1977, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is an international non-profit marine wildlife conservation organization. Their mission is to end the destruction of habitat and slaughter of wildlife in the world’s oceans in order to conserve and protect ecosystems and species. They have offices all around the world as well as in Vancouver and are very active and involved in the marine health of our region.

How can Bowen Islanders support you?

Please consider a donation to Sea Shepherd Conservation Society though my fundraising page on Facebook. Just go to my page and click on the donation button or follow the link. Even a small donation like 10 or 20 dollars makes all the difference. Plus, you will be supporting my 50 km run on July 13. I will be using the run as a long meditation and prayer for our oceans and our planet. How lovely it will be to know that I have your support and can bring you with me on this run. If you are not on Facebook, please feel free to contact me (lisa.shatzky@gmail.com) if you wish to make a donation and we will figure out another way. For the oceans! Join me.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

When thinking about the region’s future and concerns about housing affordability and livability more generally, a useful starting point is demographics. B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

article continues below

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians.

405,bowenislandundercurrent,https://www.bowenislandundercurrent.com/sports/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Given that B.C. has an estimated population of about 5,190,000 people, that translates into one case for every 1,735 residents, or 0.579 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 37,491 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 203 people, or 4.92 people per 1,000 residents.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said. ""Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,018 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,589 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

""Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time,"" said Henry and Dix.

I’m at the bottom of Tunstall Boulevard, in my granny-gear, staring upwards at an endless incline.

article continues below

Everything in my body tells me to stop peddling.

Above me, a turkey vulture hovers, curious about whether or not I’m going to make it, or whether I’d make a nice meal.

And just then, a plucky man with grey hair passes me smiling, comments jauntily on the sunny weather. I watch his pedals disappear ahead, rounding a corner into the sunshine.

I get off my bike and push it to the top of the hill.

Even for a regular rider like me — I’ve done the Whistler GranFondo three times, in three years — moving to Bowen, and conquering the island’s hefty hills, well, it kind of terrified me at first.

The angles on this island are steep.

The road shoulders? Non-existent.

The potholes are deep.

And there’s often no one else on the road except for you and a few unsympathetic deer, rolling their eyes at your cardiovascular shortcomings.

So even though this 52-square-kilometre island has glorious views, plenty of sunny days, and stretches of seriously nice pavement, I didn’t bike here at all my first summer.

I took the ferry over to the mainland, looped Stanley Park or even headed out to Iona Beach in search of blessed flats.

But last summer, I broke down for some on-island adventuring on wheels.

My first attempt at road biking Bowen was a complete bust.

The endless inclines and sharp corners bested me.

I had to unclip, walk up a bruiser of an incline on Bowen Bay Road, and then repeat the process trying to get home in one piece.

Forty minutes later, I was red in the face, had tire grease crisscrossing my legs, grass matted in my cleats and felt emotionally and physically defeated.

“Never again,” I told my husband.

“This island is for e-bikes and scooters only!”

Eventually though, I found people who ride locally and learned ways to move my wheels more successfully around “the rock.”

Like how Mount Gardner Road past Killarney Lake is a nice ride full of rolling hills with minimal traffic and great views.

Now I love a good island spin.

Here’s some of what’s helped me get on the roads here. Hope it helps you to get out there and bike Bowen.

The Raptors, who'd been based in Naples, Fla., for the past two weeks, but limited in practice to one player per hoop, took the floor for the first time Saturday at Walt Disney World for the NBA's restart after the team passed its COVID-19 tests.

article continues below

It felt partly like the first day of training camp, they said. But also a little like the NBA champions had never been apart.

""For the most part it was really good . . . the trust factor really, really showed up,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""A lot of guys are doing a lot of things that we normally do, just right from the get-go here which was great.

""Obviously there was some rust and some things that stick out that you have to keep an eye on, or that we're going to have to change, but from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us.""

The defending NBA champions made the two-hour trip from Naples on Thursday in style, pulling into Disney World in two black buses that, unique to the Raptors, had ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in huge white block letters.

They were immediately tested upon arrival in the NBA semi-bubble, which is home to 22 teams. They were tested again at 7 p.m. local time on Friday, then got the all-clear Saturday at 10 a.m.

Nurse said the testing protocol has become the new normal.

""I think the first couple times we did it here and certainly going way back to March 11 (the day the league suspended play), when we went off and got tested, your level of anxiety was a lot higher then for sure,"" Nurse said. ""But I think it's always: cross your fingers, knock on wood, good thoughts, all that stuff every time.""

The Raptors, who tip off the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, could be at Disney World for the next three months. Nurse packed his guitar. Marc Gasol arrived with his own Nespresso coffee machine. The players checked into rooms decorated with family photos — courtesy of Raptors staff.

Pascal Siakam said he spent the 36 hours of hotel quarantine playing video games, and thinking about ""being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team.

""We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere, and that's all I really care about.""

Nurse said he felt his way through the first practice he'd coached in four months.

""I had some thoughts about what the structure of the practice would look like and we did it totally different than we normally would,"" he said. ""Again just based on the situation I think it's important for us to play, but I also think it's important to kind of ease in or taper in a little bit because we're conscious of health in general.""

The coach, who'd raved last week about the fitness level of his players, went heavier than he'd expected to, and ""I just told the guys to please self-monitor and let's not let's not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.""

Siakam said while there was some rust, the Raptors, who were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shut down, were all excited to be back on the floor together.

""That's what you wanna see, you wanna see people wanting to play,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how long you were off, once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that's what you wanna see from a team.""

Fred VanVleet said there was a ""first day of school type"" feeling for the entire team.

""We've got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we've still got a long way to go,"" the guard said.

In Naples, the Raptors hadn't left the hotel grounds except for practice. They had gotten in a few rounds of golf and tennis games on the hotel grounds.

Siakam got a new appreciation for tennis.

""I love tennis. I watch tennis all the time. Even back home, I used to watch tennis a lot,"" he said. ""I thought it was fairly easy to be honest until I got there. They're definitely some tough athletes in the things that they do. I definitely respect it more. It's hard. I don't think it’s for me. Marc is pretty good, actually. I feel like Marc is definitely the best that I have seen play.""

The Raptors will have a chance to explore their new digs in the next few days.

""I think there will be a little bit more stuff for us to do as time goes by, and everybody gets tested and safe and locked in, I think we'll have more things to do,"" VanVleet said.

Florida has been ravaged by COVID-19 in the past few weeks. The Sunshine State has topped 250,000 cases with about 10,300 new cases reported on Saturday.

VanVleet said there's a greater sense of safety in the NBA bubble.

""When we were in Naples, we couldn't control everybody else,"" he said. ""I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that's probably the biggest difference.""

We rarely get off the rock, and it seems to take a village to get us abroad, but at the last possible minute, it came together: we were all going to go to town to buy new running shoes.

I am loathe to spend money on sports equipment. The Knick Knack Nook has gotten our two children through roller hockey, soccer, basketball, volleyball, baseball, skiing and that wonderful, bi-annual freezing of Josephine Lake – I don’t see why I should cheat on her now. But Vonda, of Runners and Rackets says that the tools of the trade are important. Vonda makes me think of a chef and her knives, a carpenter and her hammer, a financier and her abacus…. These are all important investments. If you want to commit to something, you have to invest in the tools that will make you successful, and, importantly, the ones that keep you from getting injured.

Vonda gave the first presentation to our Sun Run Training Group in Week Three. She started with feet, subtly segued into “bits” (for men – who knew?) and closed with “the sisters” (apparently it’s all about ligaments). She left us with memorable gems such as: “A sports bra should never celebrate its one year anniversary”.

She also announced that she would be hosting a Shoes and Bits and Boobs party (at least that what I called it) at her store on February 19th and we were all invited to come. And she promised that there would be wine.

So it happened. With all the kids taken care of (Kate at roller hockey, Jade at gymnastics, Eli at basketball, Rhys at the Credit Union, and Evan and Jacob both making their own way back from their rugby practice in town) we made it to Vonda’s store. It was packed with runners- from those (like me) who were still trying to distinguish a pump from a trail-runner, to those who were training for the New York marathon. There was a “bits” corner for the boys, a “boobs” corner for the girls, and, for those of us with foot fetishes there was a shoe corner where a guy named Kevin would take your calf in his hand, un-lace your old, nasty, dirty, bad, shoe, take it off and place your foot on a block. The guy named Kevin talked to you about you: where you run, how you run, why you run, your favourite colour. He asked to see your old shoes. He let you dump out the bag of old shoes that you brought with you so that he could “diagnose” what your gait is. He noted whether you were under pro-nating and needed a shoe to support that. He re-filled your wine glass for you to enjoy while he went to find the shoe that was just perfect for you. He came back and laced your shoes up.

The guy named Kevin lets you walk around in your shoes for a bit to feel them out – and that is when you realize that there is a speech going on in this store packed with wine and runners. A woman named Allison Tai has come to the event to share her story.

She started running to lose weight, and it was just a thing. Then she got hooked on goals. She ran competitively and then was hit by a truck. Broken pelvis, broken arm, she was hospitalized for four months. She recovered, and ran again, then had a baby, then another. She ran with an infant on her back. When Allison was 8 hours into what was going to be a 24-hour World’s Toughest Mudder competition she wanted to give up but her husband wouldn’t let her. “It is not about you, anymore,” her husband whispered holding her shoulders. “It’s about us, now. We have supported you throughout this. You have to do this. You have to do this for us.”

She came in second in the World’s Tough Mudder competition. Allison did it. With her babies, and her broken pelvis, she did it.

Suzy is in the corner crying. Seanna, our driver with an eye on the ferry, is paying for all of our gear. I still owe her money.

It almost didn’t happen – our trip to the big city to buy new running shoes for our training - but it did. We raced back through the city lights singing to Paolo Nutini and eating Oysters Rockefeller and laughing about how shaggy and despicable our run would be the next day, if it even happened. But we did it – we did that, too! We met the next day at twelve and we ran for 37 minutes in our new shoes. With just tiny, little, itty, bitty breaks in between!",[]

The Blue Jays announced that Guerrero would be moving from third base to first on Friday, platooning with Tellez who was the presumptive starter at first heading into the season. Tellez said the next day that he doesn't think much will be changing for him despite the competition at his position.

article continues below

""Having him over there is just as beneficial as having him at third,"" said the 25-year-old Tellez. ""I think we just want as many bats as we can have in the lineup.

""Him being right-handed, me being left-handed, it plays into that platoon situation. I think having all of us in the lineup is going to be beneficial and we're just here to win.""

Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo agreed, noting that he wants to put out the best possible lineup every day in the shortened 60-game season.

""I'm a big fan of Rowdy Tellez, I've always been a fan of the kid,"" said Montoyo. ""He's having a good — if you want to call it this — spring training. His approach at the plate looks really good.

""I don't think anything has changed when it comes to him. He can rotate into that designated hitter spot, he can also play first. If he keeps swinging the bat the way he has, he's going to see a lot of playing time.""

Tellez hit .227 with 21 home runs and 54 runs batted in 2019, his first full season in Major League Baseball. He was hitting .238 through nine spring training games before the break.

Guerrero made his MLB debut in 2019, hitting .272 with 15 home runs and 69 RBIs. He hit .286 with three homers through 12 exhibition games in March.

Tellez said he has been helping Guerrero adapt to the new position, working with the 21-year-old on the intricacies of fielding at first base, especially foot work.

""He's always asking questions, he wants to learn, he's always trying to be better,"" said Tellez. ""He's a great teammate to start with so he's not too worried about certain things like playing time or any of that, he just wants everyone to be happy and at their best.""

Tellez stayed with his father and sister in California when spring training was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he's neighbours with his trainer, who has a gym in his garage. Tellez also built a batting cage at his house to keep working on his hitting in the down time.

""Nothing's changed with the swing or the mentality,"" said Tellez, who said he worked with teammate Bo Bichette and Bichette's father, former MLBer Dante Bichette. ""Just coming back I'm feeling really good. I liked where I was when I left spring training, I was very confident with the work I put in during quarantine.""

It helped that it rained Friday morning in Florida, making for cool conditions.

article continues below

""We trained relatively light, did some things tactically and then the guys just had some fun,"" said Vanney. ""We did a finishing game. There was a lot of laughing, guys were relaxed a little bit and settled in.

""For me that was really kind of a great moment in an environment that at times can feel a little bit tense and obviously very sterile ... It was nice for guys to just kind of let their guard down for a little bit out on the soccer field and just enjoy themselves. Because that's what it's all about in many ways.

""So I feel good with where we're at. I think guys are getting excited to play.""

Toronto opens the World Cup-style tournament Sunday morning against D.C. United. New England defeated Montreal 1-0 in the first Group C game.

Striker Jozy Altidore, always willing to share, took to social media Saturday to dump on the kickoff time.

""These 9 a.m. games are not the way. Way too hot out here for all that,"" he tweeted.

The forecast calls for 28 C at kickoff, feeling like 32 C (rising to 30 C and 37 C at 11 a.m.) at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex near Orlando.

It's the first game for Toronto since a 1-0 home win over New York City FC on March 7. The league ground to a halt five days later due to COVID-19.

Since then, the players suffered through the pandemic lockdown before gradually resuming training — first individually, then in small groups and finally as a full team.

The world has changed in the interim, with the death of George Floyd triggering a worldwide response to racism and police brutality.

Toronto has helped lead the way on the MLS front, will fullback Justin Morrow executive director of the newly former Black Players for Change group. Altidore, Richie Laryea and the injured Ifunanyachi Achara are among the TFC players who have spoken out eloquently.

GM Ali Curtis has also played a significant role behind the scenes while assistant coach Jason Bent's voice also carries weight.

""It'll be difficult to be playing these games with everything that's happened but I'll be honoured to be out there as always representing Toronto, which is such a great city, and I've felt incredible support from them,"" said Morrow.

On the field, Toronto FC fans are looking forward to a first glimpse of winger Pablo Piatti, the Argentine designated player whose start to the season was delayed by a hamstring injury.

The combination of Piatti and Spanish playmaker Alejandro Pozuelo could be mouth-watering.

For Michael Bradley, Sunday will mark his first action since Nov. 10 when he injured his ankle in the MLS Cup final loss in Seattle. The 32-year-old skipper underwent surgery in January after the ankle failed to respond to rehab.

Altidore may well still be a work in progress, however. The burly U.S. international forward spent most of the lockdown at his Florida home and had to self-quarantine, training on his own, upon returning to Toronto.

With Toronto scheduled to play again Wednesday, against Montreal, Vanney is likely to dig deep into his roster.

There is plenty to choose from. Toronto retained 17 of the 18 players that dressed for the MLS Cup final, missing only French winger Nicolas Benezet, now with Colorado.

The reserves are young, however. Ten members of Toronto's tournament roster are 22 or younger.

While all 24 remaining teams at the tournament — FC Dallas and Nashville SC were forced to withdraw after COVID-19 ripped through their rosters — remain works in progress given lack of serious preparation time, Toronto is a known quantity.

""You know you're going to get quality,"" said D.C. United coach Ben Olsen. ""And you know you're going to get a team that, in some ways, is less a work in progress because of the lack of turnover that that team has had over the last few years.

""There's a lot of returning players and a lot of returning players of quality. So that part is an exciting challenge for our group.""

D.C. United also remembers the 5-1 first-round playoff loss to Toronto last season. After sending the game to overtime with a stoppage-time equalizer, Olsen's team conceded four goals in rapid fashion at BMO Field.

""Not that we need any extra motivation but we certainly wouldn't mind getting back at them,"" said Olsen.

D.C. United says veteran playmaker Federico Higuain, who signed in March as a free agent after eight seasons with Columbus, is ready to play after recovering from knee surgery.

Peruvian international midfielder Edison Flores is also one to watch.

""He's a special player,"" said Olsen. ""He's exciting, he's dynamic, he can score, he can provide. He will help us in the way we attack.

""Now the trick is with him is we got to find him the ball, because when he has the ball at his feet good things happen and he makes real plays.""

That vision will be welcome to a team that lost offensive weapons up front with the departure of Wayne Rooney, Lucas (Titi) Rodriguez and Luciano (Lucho) Acosta.

Teams will play three group games at the tournament, which will count in the regular-season standings, with the top two from each of the six pools plus the four best third-place finishes advance to the knockout round of 16.

Toronto went 1-0-1 in the first two games of the season while D.C. United was 1-1-0.

Being in a bubble is nothing new to Toronto, thanks to trips to hostile territory in the CONCACAF Champions League — albeit without the threat of COVID-10.

""It wasn't like we were getting out of the hotel much when we were in some of those places in Mexico,"" said Bradley. ""None of this fazes us.""

B.C. government projections point to a significant increase in the combined population of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley regional district over the next couple of decades, rising from almost three million today to 3.8 million by 2040 – an increase of 800,000 people. The expected rise is even larger than the 700,000 people added to the region’s population over the preceding two decades. Most of this increase was due to immigration. It is reasonable to expect this pattern will continue, especially considering the Justin Trudeau government plans to sharply boost immigration numbers in the coming years.

Given the steadily increasing population coupled with a constrained and limited land supply, it doesn’t take a graduate degree in economics to recognize the price of land in the Lower Mainland will continue to rise at a pace well ahead of inflation. Yes, there will be periods of softening prices, as currently evident in the real estate market. But over the medium and longer term, land prices are going only one way: higher.

How then to address the challenges of housing affordability, congestion, longer commute times and a declining quality of life for many residents?

Higher taxes on residential real estate to discourage non-resident demand and a greater focus on the supply of purpose-built rental housing may help, but realistically they won’t do much over time. If we are honest, there has been an inordinate amount of talk about the need to improve housing affordability with no substantive, longer-term solutions emerging from all the chatter. Instead, it is time for some bold and strategic action. It is time to develop infrastructure that supports regional connectivity, provides workers with tolerable commutes and allows for a broader array of more affordable options for would-be homeowners.

A new Fraser Valley “innovation corridor” anchored by a commuter rail system running from Chilliwack to the city of Vancouver would help address many of the region’s most pressing issues. It would also offer new opportunities for regional economic development and growth.

A rail system, perhaps like Greater Toronto’s GO train, would have many important benefits. By providing decent and predictable commute times, it would vastly expand the potential supply of more-affordable housing options. It would help alleviate traffic congestion. Sure, some degree of congestion will always plague the region. But if a rail system delivered an effective alternative to driving, policy-makers could then reasonably talk about tolls and other forms of road pricing to help manage congestion. More trips on transit and less road congestion aligns with the province’s greenhouse gas plans.

It would also provide an opportunity for some regional vision and “out-of-the-box” thinking. A well-designed rail system supports the development of a second urban business centre, something the region desperately needs if it is going to remain competitive as downtown Vancouver becomes increasingly cost prohibitive for more businesses.

Careful consideration should also be given to developing the “innovation corridor.” Rather than picking a particular industry sector to champion, government should focus on building infrastructure that enhances the benefits that will flow from having a larger and more robust regional urban agglomeration.

A new commuter rail system, of course, comes with a hefty price tag. But there are good reasons to consider making such a large and bold investment at this time. Most importantly, the long-term economic returns from this kind of transportation infrastructure are virtually certain to exceed the cost of money borrowed to finance the project, particularly when borrowing costs for the province are likely to be below 3 per cent.

It should also be noted the province’s current debt load is manageable; the government could absorb $7 billion to $9 billion in debt to help finance capital costs without pushing its debt-to-GDP ratio up to levels that would concern rating agencies.

The federal government would also participate, and a strong case can be made that it should make a substantial contribution because a disproportionate number of new immigrants will settle in the Lower Mainland.

Such a large undertaking should also embrace creative financing options. Private pension funds are looking to invest in infrastructure. There is also the opportunity for government to capture some of the resulting increase in land value to help finance capital costs. From our perspective, financing the project is manageable.

A bigger challenge may be having sufficient capacity to build the project. But the greatest hurdle of all is political will: the project will need to be conceived and implemented by the provincial government but will also require co-operation and planning across numerous municipalities. •

At the hopping Glowbal Grill in Yaletown, they forged a friendship out at the sautée and satay stations, respectively. Now, as new owners of Rustique Bistro here on Bowen Island, the two chefs are happy to be taking on the challenge of running their own place – a life-long dream for both.

Most recently, both Chahal and Law worked at the Central City Brew Pub in Vancouver. Last spring, Chahal had just come back paternity leave and started in on a project to bring a more interesting menu to the burger and pizza-oriented restaurant.

Law, who grew up in Richmond, says he has often enjoyed day trips to Bowen, and ate at Rustique a few years ago. In May, he happened to be perusing Rustique’s menu on-line and saw that the business was for sale.

“I called Sunny right away, and we scheduled a trip to Bowen,” says Law.

Once here, Chahal fell in love.

“I was living in Surrey at the time, which is where I grew up, and I felt like it is really not the best place to raise a child,” he says. “And then after we visited the restaurant, we sat on the beach and I said to Owen, you know if we bought this restaurant we could do this all the time!”

Chahal’s wife supported the idea, and from there the two chefs devoted their energy towards purchasing Rustique. Chahal took five months off work to make it happen, and Law took four months off.

They moved on to Bowen in early December. They started working with former co-owner of the restaurant, Thierry Mohrbach, to get up to speed on the menu. Both Chahal and Law have experience with French cooking, and say they will maintain consistency in the current menu.

“We know we have big shoes to fill, the food here is great and everyone loves Céline and Thierry, but our goal is to blow people’s socks off with the food,” says Chahal. “We are really looking forward to the challenge.”",[]

“I’m not a professional photographer or anything, and I made that clear, but I thought that if everyone involved took a photo with a Santa hat, it shows us all coming together to say thank you for shopping local,” says Neys. “I’ve learned a lot about photography since launching this, having taken more than 2,500 photos with my phone.”

Neys says she learned a lot about the island’s businesses, as well.

“I knew that Kate Hartle had a hair studio, for example, but I didn’t know about all the new products they carry,” she says. “Or The Sweet Stand, I know they made cakes and other treats, but I did not know about their syrups and other products they offer. The thank you campaign really morphed into a marketing campaign where the different businesses got to show off what they have to offer.”

Neys says that she hopes this inspires local business to work together more often.

“I’ve really noticed how businesses do this in other communities,” Neys says. “I was in Steveston in the fall, and it really looked as though the businesses worked together to decorate their shops and it made for a lovely experience being on the street. When I was in Austin, there was a campaign where the businesses had chalkboards with cheeky and creative slogans on them, and in Napa there are permanent signs with arrows that say, ‘Bakery, 0.2 miles.’ It provides a nice sense of cohesiveness, and I get the feeling the here on Bowen, businesses are really craving a greater sense of community.”

Neys says that some business owners have actually asked her if she would be interested in starting a local business association.

“It’s certainly something I would consider, but I have to get my own businesses up and running first,” she says.

Marie Neys, Emilie Kaplun and Pauulet Hohn will be launching the Catching Stars Gallery in the corner shop below the new pub building in the New Year. Marie will also moving her framing business, Marie Neys Fine Art and Framing, into the space as well.",[]

“Getting outside used to be something I did on weekends,” says Redhead. “Now it’s something I do every single day because there is so much nature right outside our door.”

Their interest in the outdoors, and adventure in particular, led Redhead and Cardinal to launch the Bowen Island Adventure Film Festival in 2016.

“The Festival connected us with nature lovers and sporting devotees and introduced us to various communities such as scuba divers and trail runners, and the different people on Bowen making adventures happen,” says Redhead. “We wanted to see how we could help bring their work forward. So, Bowen Island Adventures is about doing that.”

The company is Redhead’s fourth, and she says they did a “soft-launch” this summer.

“We wanted to get a sense of what we didn’t know,” says Redhead. “What surprised us, were the number of families that showed up from international locations. A lot of people did kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding through Bowen Sea Kayaking. There was a lot of interest in foraging, led by Stephanie Carruthers. Baz and I taught slack-lining, and of course there were people hiking.”

Redhead adds that her intention with this company is not necessarily to attract more visitors to Bowen, but to build infrastructure for those visitors that are already coming.

“We want to make a minimal impact,” says Redhead.

Her connection to Bowen is such that, when the Bowen Island Marina, which was undeveloped back then, came up for sale in 1985, there was no question in her mind that she would love to run it. The purchase of the Marina took her family from being long-time summer residents, to permanent residents of Bowen Island.

From the deck of her home overlooking The Pier, she recently delved into her personal history with the place.

article continues below

“When my Dad was a little boy, as far back as 1913, he would row over to Bowen and camp at Cape Roger Curtis with his uncle,” says Norma. “And then, when I was a kid we would boat over and he would moor right over there in Snug Cove, it was so different then - with just a little dock and no ferry bumpers. I would run up the hill to the restaurant, which was where we are now, and buy ice cream.”

Until the 1950s, she says, “this place was booming.” The construction of the upper levels highway and the creation of so many more recreational opportunities for people in Vancouver changed that, leading to the closure of the hotel and subdivision of Union Steamship properties in 1956. For Norma, though, Bowen remained home away from home.

“I was about 19 and staying with my Aunt Lena in her cabin at the top of Seven Hills. She said she was going to a party and I should come, so I said yes and ended up carrying a case of beer all the way down the dirt road to a cabin over by Dorman Point,” she says. “We got to this little cabin where Rolf Harris was playing, the place was completely packed. There was this guy sitting down who invited me to sit beside him, well that was Dennis, and he became my husband.”

Dennis owned property at the end of Taylor way that would become the family’s Bowen-base, and when it came time to build the marina (which was delayed, in part because of the death of a son) they used trees selectively logged from the property, and milled locally, to build the whole thing.

“All the labour was local too, except for one person, who was a friend of my son’s. As soon as it was done, Brian Biddlecomb said, this is a perfect place for a dance! So we held the first Dock Dance in 92’ and Minnow Davies held his annual fishing derby before the decking on the pier was even finished,” she says. “My priority was an ice-cream shop. I called it the Sugar Shack.”

“The more people came, the more they enjoyed it,” she says. “Which is what I’ve always wanted - for people to love this place as much as I do.”

At some point, she says she brought down a big bucket of toys from the Knick Knack Nook, mainly to distract small children from the edge of The Pier and the ramp down to the dock, but also to create a space where parents could relax.

The past few summers, says Norma, business has been really good and while this summer got off to a slow start because of the weather, she’s not concerned.

“Summer always comes, and when it does, the business comes,” she says. “I would love to get some buskers down here more regularly, to make it even more lively - like it used to be when we had water-slides and live performances at Sandy Beach. There used to be so much going on here all the time, we had so much fun.”

Norma Dallas is ready to move on, and take a break herself, which is why she’s put the Marina up for sale.

“I’ve always wanted this place to give a feel for the old Bowen, and for people who come here to take an interest in the community’s heritage,” she says. “I hope to sell it to someone local, someone who also wants to holds a belief in community, and keeps The Pier as a place with really good vibes.”

She adds that she plans to move back to her roots in Kitsilano.

“I look forward to becoming a tourist on Bowen myself,” says Norma. “Having coffee at the Snug Café and just relaxing.”",[]

Their criterial were: beautiful, natural, sense of community, veterinarian, free parking, affordable homes and a special quality of life. Nelson and Salt Spring were top choices, she says. On July 6, the delicious business they set up, Cocoa West, turns 15.

“It’s an amazing feat really, if you consider the resident population of 3500 people,” says Mogridge. “Statistically a business like ours needs at least 15,000 people in order to get by. Yet we’ve managed to survive and to thrive, we’ve grown from a one-person sole proprietorship company to one with eleven employees.”

She says that achievement has taken a phenomenal amount of work, dedication, perseverance, stamina, diversification and creativity.

“And a huge amount of loyalty and support form our employees and community,” adds Mogridge. “Without all of you we would not be here, no matter how much sweat and tears were poured into it.”

In honour of the community that’s held up Cocoa West, Joanne, Carlos and their daughter Eden are throwing a community and chocolate fundraiser:

Upon arrival, they asked one another where they had traveled from and both responded, “the North Shore.” Further prodding revealed that Avery had come from Bowen, and Tourand was just months away from moving to Bowen. The two have been working on a large project together ever since, and have launched a regular “night out” for island professionals in the green building industry.

Avery sells high-tech glazing for the windows of large buildings. The product improves energy efficiency and comfort for the people working inside. Tourand is an engineer by trade, but now works in project management and capital planning for a property management firm. He says he made the career shift because it would allow him to have a greater impact on the built environment, working directly with clients to make better decisions about energy efficiency and quality.

“Both of our jobs have the potential to make a large scale impact,” says Tourand. “And when we realized that we both had this connection to Bowen, we started talking about how the island actually seems to be something of a hub when you’re in the building industry.”

Tourand offers another example: at one point he was working with an LED contractor in Calgary who then connected him with another Bowen Islander. Through this, the two islanders are now working with to reduce utility rates for Tourand’s company’s buildings in Alberta.

“I feel like living on Bowen, there is this common thread. Even if the person you are working with isn’t from here – they’ll likely have a friend who is. And there is also such a strong connection to environmental values here,” says Avery. “Lindsey and I just kept talking about this, and on a flight back from Memphis, we came up with the idea to bring other islanders who are working in the field together. It’s just an obvious way to make a bigger impact.”

Tourand and Avery recently held their second “Green Beer” night (not to be confused with Bowen In Transition’s “Green Drinks” night). They hope these evenings can continue on a monthly basis. Anyone who works in the building industry and is interested in pushing for large-scale “green” change, is welcome.

“As we are up for a Community Impact Award, we had to answer questions about how we measure ourselves in that regard,” says Scott. “This, and some of the other questions forced us to look at our business in a new way. We’re not running a shelter, we’re a sports organization, but I think that we help people grow an appreciation for being outside and in the water. With that there’s an increased awareness of what’s around us based on where we live.”

Scott adds that one aspect of Sea Hiker’s work is to help people who are anxious in the water overcome their fears.

“That aspect of the job is really gratifying,” he says.

Mary McDonagh, with Bowen Island Massage Therapy, says that being in the running for a Premier’s Peoples Choice Award is incredibly meaningful to her.

“When I started my clinic back in 89’, Alicia, who is now my colleague, was just a baby in my arms. There were maybe 1,200 people on Bowen, and there was no healthcare whatsoever,” says McDonagh. “I am still working full-time and loving what I do. I’ve worked on an intimate level with hundreds of people, and to hear people come together collectively to show their appreciation is incredibly rewarding.”

McDonagh says the People’s Choice Award is recognition for going above and beyond in the community.

“I think all of us at the clinic have an immense appreciation for the hardships, challenges and joys of every single person that walks through our doors,” says McDonagh. “I stand in awe of my community and the people I’ve had the honour of working with.”

With his first job as a sculptor, technicially speaking, at a mascot studio in Toronto and then a shift to the world of artificial rock when he moved West, Hutton says he hopes the completion of his first piece of public art helps to launch his career into more purely creative work.

Last Friday, Hutton’s 21 foot, ground-level sculpture of a frog emerging from a lake was unveiled last Friday at the opening of the new Lafarge Lake-Douglas Station in Coquitlam.

The work was one of four pieces commissioned for various skytrain stations.

“TransLink, the province and the City of Coquitlam had objectives they wanted to meet about connecting to the communities and their histories,” says Hutton. “Lafarge Lake jumped out at me immediately, in part because they are a manufacturer of concrete which is connected to my medium. In the 1980s, the company gave a gravel pit to the city that was successfully redeveloped into a hundred acres of public parkland that’s now home to many wildlife species, including frogs.”

Hutton says his piece is a celebration of humans, nature and transformation. It took more than 120 hours to complete, and Hutton has named it, TransLake. He adds that it is meant to be playful, even if that means people climbing all over it.

Hutton’s other work can be found in and around private residences on Bowen Island and the lower mainland, as well as at the Vancouver Aquarium, Science World and YVR.

“Yes, this is creative work but it tends to involve other designers, artists and fabricators. What I really enjoyed about this project is the opportunity to start creating from my own concept,” says Hutton. “Since my idea was chosen, I’ve had the chance to speak with many artist doing this kind of work. It is very competitive, and I feel lucky to have this kind of exposure.”",[]

Ralph also recently received second place in The Georgia Straight’s Best of Vancouver Best Nutritionist category.

Ralph launched his business six years ago. “When I graduated as a nutritionist, I was working full-time for an Internet company and intended to build my business slowly,” he says. “Then, the company laid off my whole department and I was faced with the choice of looking for a new job or diving in and starting my business. My wife Crystal and I decided that the second choice was the better option.”

He says that his business grew quickly, in part because he worked with kids. “I think that among mothers, word spreads really fast,” he says.

Moving to Bowen three years ago was a challenging transition and one that is on-going, he says. “I was nervous about setting up shop here, because it is such a small community and in a way, the goal of my work is to make it so that people don’t need me any more,” says Ralph. “But I’ve put that behind me and I now work out of an office in the Cove every other Saturday alongside seeing clients in the city three days per week.”

As Ralph is a nutritionist and loves to cook I’ve thrown The Undercurrent’s “kitchen questions” his way and asked for a recipe. See below!

Question: What’s your comfort food?

Answer: Strangely, I don’t really have a comfort food! If I had to choose my favourite food it would probably be my homemade pizza. I make a delicious sprouted spelt crust and my favourite toppings are pesto, raw milk cheese, prosciutto, pear and kale (recipe below).

Question: If you could only have one cookbook…

Answer: In all honesty, I haven’t read too many cookbooks. With technology at our fingertips it’s hard not to scroll through food blog after food blog. And why not? The Internet is full of incredibly creative ideas! If I had to pick just one website, I might choose AllRecipes.com. I look there for inspiration and then modify the ingredients to make the

recipes healthier.

Question: Who’s your biggest culinary influence and what did they teach you?

Answer: My mom. This may sound cliche, but she influenced me in a different way to develop my love for cooking. My mom didn’t enjoy cooking even though she did it for our family every night. She did her best and I’m thankful for her efforts. She was also not very adventurous with respect to food. I didn’t get my first taste of sushi until I was 19 years old. I think that my lack of exposure to a wide variety of foods fostered my curiosity in the kitchen. Thanks mom!

Question: When did you realize you loved to cook?

Answer: My love for cooking evolved over time. I can’t really pick a moment when I realized I loved it. My first real experience cooking for others was when I was 20 years old living in Australia. I was hired by a scuba dive company to cook on a boat for passengers. I didn’t know what I was doing, but I sure learned a lot (I even had to learn to bake apple pie on a barbecue since the boat didn’t have an oven!)

Question: Tell me about a culinary challenge, and how you overcame it. For example, when you had to adapt to a particular diet or allergy, or when you had to learn a totally new cooking style.

Answer: My wife used to be severely intolerant to gluten, dairy, eggs, soy, sugar and several other things. Although I don’t have any food sensitivities myself, it was necessary for us to have a completely gluten- and dairy-free kitchen. It was challenging to learn alternatives to many of these cooking staples, but once the changes were made and the kitchen was stocked with proper options, it became quite easy to make just about anything. Six years ago Crystal completely healed all of her allergies and sensitivities. This experience led to me becoming a registered holistic nutritionist, where I specialize in helping adults and children overcome their allergies.

Question: How has living on Bowen inﬂuenced your cooking?

Answer: In some ways it has made it easier, and in some ways it has been more challenging. Before moving to Bowen, my family lived in Vancouver’s West End. Everything was easily accessible any time of day. Out of an ingredient at 9 p.m.? No problem. There’s a store open with my needs. I’ve had to learn to plan ahead more but living on Bowen has also given me the opportunity to have a larger kitchen. I enjoy the extra counter space to prepare daily meals for my family.

Rich’s spelt-crust pizza:

1 1⁄2 cups sprouted spelt flour

1 tablespoon baking powder (non-aluminum)

1⁄2 teaspoon sea salt

1⁄2 cup filtered water

2 tablespoons olive oil

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Put the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in the liquid ingredients and start kneading. Transfer to a floured surface and knead for five minutes. Set aside in an air-tight container while you prep the pizza toppings (10-15 minutes).

On a floured surface, roll the dough out (I like mine quite thin). Now use your favourite sauce and toppings. A few of mine were listed above.

Cook at 400 for about 20 minutes. I usually check it at 15 to see if the thin crust is brown and crispy.",[]

Living on Bowen and hoping to avoid daily ferry trips was a key part of the motivation for starting the company, which focuses on creating on-line courses for educators hoping to reach a wider audience. Through this venture, the Hammonds say they realize that it is Bowen, and its wealth of creative professionals, that has allowed them to reach an audience well beyond the happy isle.

“On Bowen, we can get help on just about any kind of creative endeavor,” says Neil. “We work with at least three Bowen film people, two animators, two sound engineers, several photographers as well as now employing a small graphics and tech team off island. What’s especially great though, is the fact that if we have some kind of question, we can just go down to the Snug or Artisan Eats where we are more than likely to bump into someone who can answer it for us.”

One such random run-in helped Learnbase through one of its major technological hurdles – how to make videos really interactive for learning.

“We were trying to figure this out, and then I happened to bump into Kat Hayduk at the BICS playground and she told me that Mozilla had just released some new open-source code that could help,” says Neil. “It was exactly what we needed, and I’m not sure I would’ve heard about it so soon otherwise.”

One of Learnbase’s first, and key clients is an artist named Crista Cloutier, originally from Pheonix but now based in the South of France. Over the course of three years, they’ve helped Cloutier launch two to three courses per year helping many artists kickstart their art careers. Neil says that as one of Learnbase’s first client’s, The Working Artist has grown with them.

“I’d say we’re almost more like partners at this point,” says Neil. “All of us have realized that the creation of the course is just the tip of the iceberg. Coming up with the business side, the sales and marketing – we’ve learned all of it together.”

Learnbase, in collaboration with courses like The Working Artist and more tech-based programs for clients in the US and the UK have impacted people in more than 60 countries.

“It does mean a lot of meetings over Skype” says Keona. ‘So it’s also great to get to work with clients here on Bowen too.” They are excited about the recent launch of islander David Shadbolt’s online learning program, Peak Symmetry. Shadbolt’s idea started as a fitness and nutrition program but working together, the three honed-in on what Shadbolt could offer best: a path to mastering addiction and recovery. Another recent launch for long-time Bowen Islander Val Ostara, is Sound Mind, a practical guide for families of children struggling with anxiety.

In total, they’ve created 10 learning sites as well as branching out into software and materials design projects, and are starting to turn the corner in the struggle to take a business from being small, to established.

“I think the biggest milestone is the point when you go from being happy for any work request you get to when you get to select what clients to work with from the requests coming in,” says Neil. “That has just started to happen the last few months or so...”",[]

“You all Bowenize your businesses,” Johnson said. “People work with you because they know they can’t get that feeling anywhere else.”

And what would a Bowenized business look like? It’s all laid out in the Bowen Best Business Practices Handbook.

After less than a year, she found she did not have the resources or time to put into the Soap Box (at Artisan Square) to keep it running. Fortunately, two of her best customers loved the store enough to buy it off her and move the concept forward.

“We moved here and March, this place opened in February, but we were so happy to be moving somewhere that had this kind of store,” says Cassandra Mazzner, the new owner of the Soap Box alongside her partner Michelle. “We were disappointed to hear it would be closing, so talked to Sarah about the possibility of taking over.”

Cassandra and Michelle say that they appreciate the concept, which allows them to reduce their footprint of plastic waste, as well as the sourcing - which aims to be as local as possible.

“I’ve started researching other products I would like to get on the shelves here, and it is a surprisingly huge undertaking requiring a lot of research,” says Michelle. “There are a lot of companies that say they are natural and good, but they just are not.”

Michelle adds that her research has brought up some interesting statistics. For example, only 17% of plastic that goes into the recycling actually gets recycled.

Cassandra, Michelle and Sarah have not yet sorted all the details of handing over the store, but say they will announce their new-opening date as soon as possible.",[]

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In an email to workers Wednesday night, the company said that since January it has had fewer than 10 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 that were transmitted in the workplace.

article continues below

But the email from Laurie Shelby, Tesla’s vice-president of environmental, safety and health, also confirmed reports that Tesla is looking into more than 130 positive tests among employees, including those who contracted the virus outside of Tesla facilities. She said less than 0.25% of employees worldwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, which equals just over 137 workers.

Her message came in response to a report by Electrek.co that over 130 Tesla employees or contractors have tested positive, and hundreds more are waiting for test results. The website said it based the report on internal company data.

Shelby wrote that the story referred to data ""that was in the process of being validated"" and included employees worldwide who may have been infected but never entered a Tesla site, or were infected at home while Tesla's operations were shut down earlier in the year. A Tesla spokesman would not comment on the report or the email, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

""Nearly all — more than 99.99% — of these occurrences were not cases of virus transmitted at work,"" Shelby wrote in the email. ""Most of the positive cases resulted from an individual living with or travelling with someone with COVID-19 and have returned to work after recovering from home.""

Shelby wrote that Tesla doesn't have any employees in serious condition anywhere in the world because of COVID-19.

A message was left Thursday seeking comment on the numbers from the public health department in Alameda County, California, which includes Fremont, the location of Tesla's only U.S. assembly plant. The factory employs about 10,000 workers.

Some workers have refused to return to the plant out of fear of catching the virus. They did so after CEO Elon Musk in May defied Health Department orders not to restart production under shutdown orders due to the virus.

Some Tesla workers and labour activists say the company is threatening to fire employees who haven’t returned, but Tesla officials have said claims about firings are not true. Workers say they've heard about COVID-19 cases at the plant but they don't know numbers. They have called on the company and health department to release the figures.

However, Shelby wrote in the email that an employee survey found the vast majority of workers feel comfortable with the safety measures being taken by the company.

Among the measures are increased cleaning, limiting access to facilities, temperature checks for employees before they enter buildings, staggered shifts to keep workers apart, additional barriers between employees and providing protective equipment, Shelby wrote.

She urged workers to wear masks or face coverings to stay healthy and save lives and warned that failing to wear masks where required, or not wearing them properly, will bring disciplinary actions. She also wrote that workers should stay home if they're sick.

Musk reopened the Fremont plant May 11 in defiance of county orders. The health department had deemed the factory a nonessential business that can’t fully open under virus restrictions, but Tesla contended it was essential under federal guidelines.

The next day, however, the Health Department announced that the plant could return to manufacturing as long as it delivers on worker safety precautions that it agreed to.",[]

Asa Hutchinson issued an order Thursday requiring people to wear face masks in public throughout the state, which has had a surge in coronavirus cases over the past several weeks.

The Republican governor had resisted a statewide mask mandate and opposed issuing a stay-at-home order earlier in the pandemic, but he signed the order requiring masks when social distancing isn't possible in the hopes of slowing the disease's rapid spread in the state. The order takes effect Monday.

article continues below

Hutchinson’s decision comes amid growing support for mask requirements from business and health leaders and a day after Bentonville-based Walmart said it would require customers to wear masks in all of its U.S. stores. The state’s largest newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, also called for a statewide requirement on Thursday.

Hutchinson previously encouraged people to wear masks and allowed cities to pass ordinances requiring their use, but he stopped short of requiring them statewide. He’s the latest Republican governor to relent on the mask issue in the face of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Alabama's governor issued a similar mask mandate on Wednesday.

Arkansas' coronavirus cases have dramatically risen since May, when the state began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen despite warnings from national health officials about the risks of doing so too soon. Arkansas was one of a handful of states that did not issue a broader stay-at-home order that kept most businesses closed.

Hutchinson previously questioned how a mask mandate could be enforced in a rural state such as Arkansas, but this week he left open the possibility of such a requirement. The chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences called for a statewide requirement last weekend.

Hutchinson's order was expected to face criticism from some conservatives in the state. Hours before he issued the order, a Republican legislator urged people to call Hutchinson to oppose any mask directive.

A poll by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business suggested tensions are flaring between workers and employers, with around 27 per cent of 3,389 employers polled indicating some of their laid-off staff have refused to return to work.

article continues below

Of the nearly 870 businesses that provided the reasons their employees gave for refusing to return to work, 62 per cent reported workers ""prefer the Canada Emergency Response Benefit."" Employers could choose more than one explanation for why a worker refused to return, and respondents also selected options such as concern for health (47 per cent), childcare obligations (27 per cent) or lack of hours in return offer (16 per cent).

CFIB president Dan Kelly said it's ""clear"" that CERB ""created a disincentive to return to work for some staff, especially in industries like hospitality."" Other sectors where conflicts are arising include child care, dental offices, home health care, amusement parks, gambling and spectator sports, the study suggested.

""CERB was created as emergency support for workers who had lost their job due to the pandemic, not to fund a summer break,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But Ian Robb, Canadian director of the Unite Here union that represents hospitality workers, disagrees. He said workers are impatient to return to work — for what is usually the lucrative summer season — but employers are the ones failing to adopt measures like frequent cleaning and wage subsidies. The union previously estimated that average wages in cities like Toronto are around $20 per hour for hospitality.

""A number of our members in the U.S. have gone to work and contracted (COVID-19),"" Robb said.

""There's just not enough safety in front of service. Nobody wants to stay home and make two grand when they can make double that by working.""

The survey suggested that the hospitality sector had the biggest share of employers, 45 per cent, who had trouble recalling workers. CFIB defines hospitality as including hotels, restaurants and bars.

The CFIB study suggests that in the hospitality sector, 56 per cent of hard-to-fill positions were ""unskilled, entry-level jobs"" that pay ""at or around minimum wage,"" although across sectors, skilled and semi-skilled jobs were harder to fill.

Employment and human rights lawyer Neena Gupta says she has heard of tradespeople unable to perform jobs because workers failed to return.

She said the reason an employee is refusing the work matters. Lack of childcare, like daycare and camps, can be a job-protected reason for staying home, as can disabilities such as being immunocompromised, says Gupta, a partner in Gowling WLG's Waterloo Region and Toronto offices.

The federal government's website states that workers seeking CERB, which offers $500 per week over a limited period, ""should be seeking work opportunities and/or return to work when their employer makes a request for their return, provided they are able and it is reasonable to do so."" The government's COVID-19 guidelines also provide for employees to refuse to do a dangerous job, although the worker must already ""be at work"" to refuse such a task.

However, notes Gupta, general apprehension about the pandemic is likely not enough to merit a job refusal. She said workplaces must comply with health and safety guidelines, and that a ministry inspection must find some sort of violation to justify a job refusal.

Managers should give workers a written ""come back to work"" recall and an indication that it will be treated as job abandonment if the worker doesn't return, says Gupta. After that process is completed, the employer could consider that worker terminated for cause, and hire a replacement.

While reporting misuse of CERB by a former employee might appear to give an employer some moral satisfaction, Gupta says it’s unlikely to help with staffing concerns or worker morale.

""I do ask people to be reasonable. You can’t call someone at noon on a Thursday and expect them in at 7 a.m. on Friday,"" she says.

West Vancouver’s Harry Jones was front and centre for Canada during the tournament, scoring a try in the bronze medal match as Canada topped South Africa 26-19 to earn the team’s first ever World Rugby Sevens Series medal on home soil. The team’s previous best finish at the Vancouver tournament was a seventh-place showing in 2018, and this was Canada’s first Sevens Series podium finish since winning gold in Singapore in 2017.

Canada went undefeated on Day 1, beating France and Fiji – ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively – as well as Wales to finish first in their pool. They then blanked Spain 21-0 Sunday to open the playoff round, booking a berth in the semifinals where they’d take on Australia.

In the semis Jones opened the scoring with a fifth-minute try, making an easy catch on the goal line after a long run from Nathan Hirayama, but the Aussies battled back with three straight scores to take a 19-7 lead. Canada’s Mike Fuailefau scored late in the game to set up a dramatic finish that saw Theo Sauder tackled at the goal line, stretching to score what could have been the match-winning try. The play went to instant replay, however, and the decision was that the ball touched down just before crossing the line.

""I wish my arm was one inch longer,"" said Sauder, a Vancouver native.

In the bronze medal game against No. 3-ranked South Africa, Jones finished off a quick team attack with no time left in the first half to tie the score at 14-14. In the second half Justin Douglas scored his second of the match and Hirayama added a try to open a 12-point lead, but Australia attacked hard to score a late try and was pushing for another to earn a tie or win when the final whistle went, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

""We've been on a path since last August,"" said Team Canada coach Henry Paul. ""It's going in the right direction. We're still finding out a little bit about ourselves.""

In the final top-ranked New Zealand beat Australia 17-14.

Jones and Hirayama were two of the seven players named to the HSBC Dream Team for the tournament, joining New Zealand’s Tim Mikkelson and Caleb Clarke, Australia’s Lachie Anderson and Lachie Miller, and South Africa’s Miller Du Plessis.

Next up for the men will be London May 23-24 and Paris May 30-31.

While some experts worry that fast vaccine timelines are unrealistic, a vaccine by the fall with mass inoculations early next year could ease investor concerns, said Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.

""If we know that there's a life for this virus of only the next five months and then everything should be in the rearview mirror after that, I think that's a pretty powerful thing going forward,"" he said.

Moderna is starting Phase 3 trials later this month involving 30,000 people.

The vaccine news was followed by ""blowout"" quarterly results from Goldman Sachs, the latest U.S. bank to report good results on strong trading activity despite higher provisions for loan losses.

""Today is one of those positive days where everybody's focusing on the ups instead of the negativity,"" said Small.

He said the overall performance of banks supports the idea of the economy bouncing back even though July may be soft because of rising infections that prompted some states to restrict community activities.

""The banks are telling us that the economy is definitely getting better, stronger,"" he said, noting people are getting back to work.

""Things are looking obviously a lot brighter overall.""

The S&P/TSX composite index gained 154.88 points to 16,063.33, the highest level since March 6.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 227.51 points at 26,870.10. The S&P 500 index was up 29.04 points at 3,226.56, while the Nasdaq composite was up 61.92 points at 10,550.49.

The Canadian dollar traded for 73.89 cents US compared with 73.44 cents US on Tuesday after the Bank of Canada's announcement it would keep its key interest rate on hold.

Materials was the lone sector on the TSX to fall in a broad-based rally led by health care, consumer discretionary and energy.

The August gold contract was up 40 cents at US$1,813.80 an ounce and the September copper contract was down 4.75 cents at nearly US$2.89 a pound.

Health care rose 5.1 per cent as cannabis producers Cronos Group Inc. surged 9.1 per cent and Aphria Inc. was up 7.7 per cent.

A 12.9-per-cent gain by Sleep Country Canada Holdings Inc. pushed consumer discretionary up 2.6 per cent.

Energy increased more than two per cent on higher crude prices as U.S. oil reserves were down amid talk from OPEC about easing on the production cuts amid increasing global demand.

Vermilion Energy Inc. rose 7.2 per cent while Whitecap Resources Inc., MEG Energy Corp. and Cenovus Energy Inc. each climbed by about 4.4 per cent.

The August crude contract was up 91 cents at US$41.20 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 3.2 cents at nearly US$1.78 per mmBTU.

The industrial sector was helped by Air Canada shares soaring 13.8 per cent on increased investor sentiment caused by vaccine hopes. The trend also helped cruise lines and the airline industry as a whole, said Small.

""If some of these airlines can hang on, can survive, don't go bankrupt, can maintain their business, imagine when (there's) a vaccine... I've got to believe these airlines are going to go significantly higher, just on speculation alone.""

The ruling to invalidate Privacy Shield will likely complicate business for around 5,000 companies, and it could require regulators to vet any new data transfers to make sure Europeans' personal information remains protected according to the EU's stringent standards.

It will no longer simply be assumed that tech companies like Facebook will adequately protect the privacy of its European users' data when it sends it to the U.S. Rather, the EU and U.S. will likely have to find a new agreement that guarantees that Europeans' data is afforded the same privacy protection in the U.S. as it is in the EU.

Privacy activists hailed the court ruling as a major victory, while business groups worried about the potential to disrupt commerce, depending on how the ruling is implemented. Companies like Facebook routinely move such data among their servers around the world and the practice underpins billions of dollars in business.

""It is clear that the U.S. will have to seriously change their surveillance laws, if U.S. companies want to continue to play a major role on the EU market,"" said Max Schrems, an Austrian activist whose complaints about the handling of his Facebook data triggered the ruling after years of legal procedures.

He first filed a complaint in 2013, after former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the American government was snooping on people’s online data and communications. The revelations included detail on how Facebook gave U.S. security agencies access to the personal data of Europeans.

Though the legal case was triggered by concerns over Facebook in particular, it could have far-reaching implications not only for tech companies but also businesses in sectors like finance and the auto industry.

Things like emails or hotel reservations between the U.S. and Europe would not be affected because there is no way to conduct that business without data crossing the border. But in other cases, such as with Facebook, for example, messages between Europeans would have to stay in Europe, which can be complicated and require their platform to be split up, Schrems said.

Companies use legal mechanisms called standard contractual clauses that force businesses to abide by EU privacy standards when transferring messages, photos and other information. The clauses — which are stock terms and conditions — are used to ensure the EU rules are maintained when data leaves the bloc.

The Court of Justice of the EU ruled Thursday that those clauses are still valid in principle. However, it declared invalid the Privacy Shield agreement between the U.S. and EU on data transfers over concerns that the U.S. can demand access to consumer data for national security reasons.

It said that in cases where there are concerns about data privacy, EU regulators should vet, and if needed block, the transfer of data. That raises the prospect that EU regulators will block Facebook, for example, from transferring any more European data to the U.S.

The European Commission said it was studying the ruling and stressed that a system is needed to allow data transfers while also protecting privacy. It said it was in touch with its counterparts in the U.S. on how to proceed.

""I see it as an opportunity to engage in solutions that reflect the values that we share as democratic societies,"" European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said the U.S. was ""deeply disappointed"" by the ruling and we ""hope to be able to limit the negative consequences to the $7.1 trillion trans-Atlantic economic relationship.""

Experts said the full impact on businesses will largely depend on how authorities respond.

""EU regulators will need to adopt a pragmatic approach to enforcement, allowing businesses a period of grace in which to implement alternative arrangements,"" said Bridget Treacy, data privacy partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP in London.

Government surveillance of personal data is something the U.S. in its turn accuses China of doing through tech companies like Huawei. And it highlights the growing importance of data as the basis of modern business and politics.

Data drives much of the world’s largest companies, like Facebook, Google, Alibaba and Amazon, and is also prized for national security to prevent extremist attacks, for example. Mining large sets of people’s data has also become crucial to winning elections, such as the use of Facebook data for Donald Trump’s presidential victory in 2016.

Alexandre Roure, a senior manager at Computer & Communications Industry Association, said the decision ""creates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic that rely on Privacy Shield for their daily commercial data transfers.

""We trust that EU and U.S. decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the trans-Atlantic economy.""

The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that U.S. industrial production rose 5.4% in June, the second straight monthly gain after a 1.4% uptick in May. But it was still 10.9% below the level in February before the economy virtually shut down in the face of the coroanavirus.

The June performance was better than economists had forecasts and reflected the reopening of many parts of the U.S. economy after lockdowns in the spring.

Despite the gains in May and June, industrial production dropped at a 42.6% annual rate in the second quarter, worst since the American economy demobilized in the aftermath of World War II. Industrial production had plunged a record 12.7% in April.

Factory production jumped 7.2% in June. Production of cars and auto parts surged 105%. Still, auto industry output remains nearly 25% below February levels.

Production at utilities climbed 4.2% last month as a rebounding economy drove up demand for power. But mining output sank 2.9%, the fifth straight drop, pulled down by plummeting oil and gas production.

The rebound in industrial production may not last. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases is forcing governors in the South and West to pause or reverse the economic reopening.

""The road to a full recovery will be much slower compared to the initial strong bounce of the past two months that was prompted by the relaxation of social distancing measures,"" Oren Klachkin and Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note. ""The virus’ resurgence in many states in recent weeks has already led to the re-imposition of social distancing measures that will drag on the recovery and bolster already significant headwinds facing the industrial sector.''",[]

The Calgary-based company announced it has received written notice from Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd. that it is no longer prepared to enter into a lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for the project as agreed in March 2019, although it is willing to provide the services on other terms.

Pieridae is considering options including legal action in response, but has already had discussions with other firms willing to replace KBR, said CEO Alfred Sorensen.

""There are other reputable and experienced firms who have the expertise to provide these services, with some already indicating a willingness to replace KBR,"" he said in a news release.

""We have had discussions with several of them to gauge their interest.""

In an emailed statement on Monday afternoon, KBR said it doesn't comment on individual contracts but ""will vigorously defend any accusation of breach of contract.""

In a report on Monday, analyst Darrell Bishop of Haywood Securities said the news represents a ""fairly material setback"" for the project because a fixed price contract is considered a ""critical stage"" before construction.

In May, Pieridae announced a delay until June 2021 to make a final decision on proceeding with the project to export liquefied natural gas from Canada's East Coast, citing technical obstacles created by COVID-19.

Also in May, the Alberta Energy Regulator put Pieridae's natural gas supply in question when it refused to transfer licences for production assets purchased from Shell Canada because the application would have split liabilities for cleaning up the sites, especially two gas-processing plants.

Shell and Pieridae are trying to work with the AER to win its approval.

Sorensen says the project is ""solid"", however, with most of its key permits in hand, a 20-year contract with a German energy company to buy half of the LNG and a potential loan guarantee from the German government.
