Matthews told reporters about the positive test as the Maple Leafs opened their training camp Monday, adding he was mostly asymptomatic.

""I mean, obviously didn't really enter my training. I was able to do stuff at home, obviously wasn't able to leave or skate or anything,"" Matthews said.

""That's really the only thing that took a hit for me. I was skating beforehand, and having to take 2 1/2, three weeks off the ice catches up to you, but pretty much asymptomatic, felt for the most part pretty normal for the two weeks. I did my quarantine and I'm feeling healthy now, so it's all good.""

The Toronto Sun first reported on June 19 that Matthews contracted the virus while at home in Scottsdale, Ariz., and was in quarantine to get healthy before the start of training camp.

WATCH | How safe are hub city bubbles?

As NHL hub cities Edmonton and Toronto prepare to host hundreds of players practising for the resumption of the season, there are concerns that ""bubble"" preparations don't go far enough to prevent COVID-19. 2:05

The Maple Leafs declined to confirm the report at the time, citing the privacy of players' medical records.

Arizona is among the U.S. states that has seen a recent spike in positive tests for the novel coronavirus.

""It was not a hotspot for like two months,"" Matthews said. ""It was like the safest place to be and then obviously things flipped pretty quickly there. I don't really find it too different than it is here. Lots of stuff, for the most part, closed other than outside seating and essential services and stuff like that.""

Matthews participated in Monday's practice.

The Maple Leafs are set to open a best-of-five playoff qualification series with Columbus on Aug. 2 in Toronto.

NHL says 30 positive tests in Phase 2

The NHL says 30 players tested positive for COVID-19 in testing during Phase 2 of the league's return-to-play plan, with another 13 testing positive outside of the league's protocol.

The league said in a statement Monday that over 600 players reported to their club's training facilities for Phase 2 — which began June 8 and allowed players to train in small groups at their teams' facilities — and 4,934 COVID-19 tests were administered to that group.

Phase 3 of the plan, the opening of training camps, started Monday.

The NHL said players who tested positive were or are currently self-isolated and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health Canada protocols.

Information on the identity of the players or their teams is not being provided by the league.

The league suspended its season March 12 due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The players in question were potentially exposed to an individual who had contact with a person who tested positive. The players will not be allowed to practice until they are deemed safe following further test results based on NHL protocols.

All teams opened camps Monday in preparation for the NHL's 24-team playoffs, scheduled to open in two hub cities — Toronto and Edmonton — on Aug. 1. Players had until Monday evening to elect to opt out of competition without penalty.

He strongly believes it will work.

Speaking to the media for the first time since the NBA shut down on March 11 due to COVID-19, the Toronto Raptors veteran was feisty. He chastised one reporter for having bad WiFi. He pretended not to hear another. He said the best thing about the four month layoff was not having to ""talk to any of you guys.""

But the 34-year-old guard was serious when it came to the coronavirus, which is raging across the U.S. like a prairie grass fire. He's confident in the safety of the NBA's campus at Walt Disney World.

""Protocols are unbelievable, I think our protocols and our health and safety measures have been top-notch, I think this thing will work perfectly,"" Lowry said. ""I think the league, the players' association has done a phenomenal job of making sure that we're doing everything that we can possibly do to make sure that we're healthy, we're safe and we're in an environment where we can be successful and to do our jobs at a high level.""

In the time since the NBA chose to play at Disney World, Florida has become a COVID-19 hot spot, setting a record by topping 15,000 new cases on Sunday.

Major League Soccer also chose Disney World for its MLS is Back tournament, but stumbled out to a rocky start, with two teams withdrawing due to positive tests, and numerous game delays.

Grind now, shine later. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Klow7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Klow7</a> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WeTheNorth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pfAmNTkjOB"">pic.twitter.com/pfAmNTkjOB</a> —@Raptors

Lowry is a ""big fan of how everything has come together"" for the NBA, and said the weeks spent on a cruise ship with the U.S. basketball team at the 2016 Rio Olympics — the team opted not to stay in the athletes village — helped prepare him for the Florida campus and its restrictions.

""That experience was pretty awesome, being around those guys, but it kind of really prepared me for this type of living,"" said Lowry, wearing a backwards blue baseball cap on a Zoom call Monday. ""To live on a boat and be in a smaller room and not have as many amenities, that time really prepared me for this.""

He has no complaints about the living arrangements, which could be home to the Raptors for nearly three months.

""Listen, I'm living good,"" he said. ""I'm healthy, my family is good, I get to play basketball, I can't really complain. I get meals and I'm happy. I'm able to do my job and provide for my family and to get out there and entertain and try to give some enthusiasm back into the world with our basketball abilities.""

Setting the example

Raptors coach Nick Nurse said the fact Lowry was a big part of the team's restart plans trickles down to the rest of the team.

""Having him as the guy who's kind of setting the example, he'll say to these guys, 'Take this stuff seriously, take these protocols seriously, let's be smart and let's do it,' and I think it certainly resonates with the rest of the team,"" the coach said.

""Let's be smart"" will be key to the restart's success. New broke Monday that Houston Rockets forward and former Raptor Bruno Caboclo inadvertently broke quarantine and must now self-isolate in his room for eight days.

Nurse praised Lowry both for his leadership in the restart and on the court.

""It's clearly Kyle's team. His care factor is way up there, his intelligence factor is way up, we're in good hands with him being the leader of this team,"" Nurse said. ""When a guy plays the way he does, the leadership by example — that phrase is probably over-used, but it's certainly the case. For basketball in general, the way you play is like the first kind of characteristic of being a great leader.""

'Dad has to go to work'

Lowry, who has two young sons Karter and Kameron, said it will ""suck"" to be away from them for the next few weeks — families aren't permitted at Disney World until the second round of the playoffs.

But he said his boys understand the sacrifices required right now to play basketball.

""They understand that their dad has to go to work,"" Lowry said. ""The one thing I always say is FaceTiming technology, as you guys see on this Zoom thing, it's changed the game, so I can talk to my kids every single day. They can FaceTime me, they call me to talk, it's kind of interactive, we make sure that I know what's going on with their day, they're consistently asking me questions, and asking me to buy them Roblox [an online game].

""That's all they really care about is Roblox, and my money and spending it.""

The four-month break gave Lowry the rare chance to be home with his sons, and he cherished the time with them, and the opportunity to be able to tuck them into bed at night.

""That was the longest time I've ever been able to enjoy my actual home [in Philadelphia], my family, my friends,"" he said. ""But it was different. Times were different. You wanted to be more careful, you wanted to be in a situation where you want it to be safe, and understand that you have to be safe with your family.

""But right now, it feels great to be able to get back on the basketball floor with your guys, your teammates, getting the camaraderie back together, and knowing that you're about to do your job.""

The Raptors know that loneliness will be one of the biggest challenges of these unprecedented next few weeks, and so the team put up family photos in each player's room. They've all be appreciative, including Lowry, who said it was reminiscent of the family wall in the Raptors' locker room at Scotiabank Arena, which is plastered with photos of players' kids, spouses, parents and grandparents.

""That's just one thing that the Raptors organization has always kind of implemented is family, your family,"" Lowry said. ""So it's cool. Nice gesture.""

A theme of the NBA's restart will be social and racial justice. The Raptors arrived at Disney World in two buses painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" in big block letters. Lowry participated in a huge protest last month in Philadelphia.

""We are in a time where we need to keep that conversation going. We need to be heard from. We need to speak loud and clear,"" he said. ""We need to understand that things need to be done for the situation to be changed, laws to be changed.

""For me to be a part of that, that's who I am. I grew up a Black man in America. It's definitely a tough thing to grow up that way, because you never know what could possibly happen to you. You never know if you're going to make it out. For me to be able to talk to you guys is a blessing. So for me to be able to do that, it's my right, my duty and my honour to represent the Black culture.""",[]

But a late collapse, with 10-man D.C. United scoring the tying goal in stoppage time, proved different as Toronto had to settle for an unsatisfying 2-2 tie when the teams finally took the field Monday morning at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida.

""We're angry with ourselves, we're frustrated,"" sad Toronto captain Michael Bradley. ""For a team that wants to be as good as we do and for a team that holds ourselves to the standards that we do, there's no way that you should let a team like that back in the game today.""

""We were in position to win the game, we should have won the game and we collapsed,"" echoed Toronto coach Greg Vanney.

Ayo Akinola, in a rare start, scored twice in the first half to give Toronto a 2-0 lead.

WATCH | Toronto FC's Ayo Akinola flashes skill in 1st half:

Toronto FC homegrown product Ayo Akinola of Brampton, Ont. scored two first half goals, before a late collapse led to a 2-2 draw against D.C. United. 2:12

D.C. United played the second half down a man after midfielder Junior Moreno received a second yellow for going through the back of Marky Delgado in first-half stoppage time.

Toronto used its man advantage in the second half, stroking the ball around the field, and seemed cruising to a commanding win until the bottom fell out.

It started in the 84th minute when D.C. United scored against the run of play.

'Gutsy performance'

Substitute Federico Higuain, in his D.C. United debut after knee surgery and a decorated career in Columbus, cooly chipped the ball over Quentin Westberg after the heart of a reshuffled Toronto defence was sliced open by a pass from Brazil's Felipe.

Defender Frederic Brillant completed the comeback in the 91st minute, heading in the tying goal from a Felipe free kick.

Akinola came close to restoring the Toronto lead in the 96th minute but Bill Hamid got a hand to his header.

""Overall, just in general, a gutsy performance from what I think is a mentally tough group,"" said D.C. coach Ben Olsen. ""It has not been an easy 10, 11 days since we got here. A lot of moving parts, a lot of cancellations and games being moved. So to get something out of that game, I think, says a lot about our group.

""Yes we can get better. But this is a marathon and the trick at these tournaments is to keep pushing and getting better throughout the tournament.""

WATCH | Toronto salvages draw after coughing up lead:

Despite playing down a man in the second half, D.C. United's Federico Higuain scored in the 84th minute and Frederic Brillant scored in stoppage time, as D.C. salvaged a 2-2 draw with Toronto FC. 2:31

Vanney shuffled three-quarters of his backline in the second half, changes he said were due to physical issues he did not want to exacerbate in the Florida heat and humidity.

Fullback Justin Morrow came off at halftime after experiencing some Achilles tendinitis. Centre backs Omar Gonzalez and Chris Mavinga were replaced in the 64th minute after both started cramping.

Replacement centre backs Eriq Zavalata and Laurent Ciman were victimized on both goals.

Toronto wins shots, possession battle

On the first, D.C. could have driven a fleet of Mack trucks down the centre of the pitch without hitting anything after a Ciman giveaway at midfield triggered the counter-attack.

Substitute Richie Laryea then gave away an unnecessary free kick just inside the Toronto half that led to the tying goal. Steven Birnbaum rose high to beat Zavaleta, who protested he had been fouled, and sent the ball to Brillant, who got between Bradley and Ciman to head the ball home.

Toronto outshot D.C. United 18-8 (7-5 in shots on target) and had 66.4 per cent possession — helped by its second-half numerical advantage.

There was some bad blood after the final whistle of a game that saw some ugly tackles. Bradley said some of it seemed to come from D.C. players blaming them for the match postponements.

The two teams were originally scheduled to meet Friday night but that was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto's late arrival (July 6), caused by the need for additional COVID-19 testing after a member of the travelling part reported symptoms.

Sunday's game was called off minutes before the 9 a.m. ET kickoff in the wake of a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player.

All other players tested negative in a round of new testing. The two players in question, neither of which were identified by their clubs, were isolated pending receipt of a second negative test.

The tournament, which marks the league's first action since it shut down March 12 due to the global pandemic, has already lost FC Dallas and Nashville SC due to a rash of positive COVID-19 tests.

Akinola splits defenders

The game finally kicked off at 9:08 a.m. in 28 C heat. Both teams arrived wearing masks and Black Lives Matter T-shirts, taking a knee before kickoff.

There was no evidence of rust as Toronto pressed D.C. and attacked on multiple fronts despite the absence of star striker Jozy Altidore.

Akinola scored in the 12th minute, beating one defender and then splitting two more before hammering in a right-footed shot from the edge of the box. The goal came after Hamid's goal kick went straight to Bradley in the D.C. end, with an Alejandro Pozuelo pass eventually finding Akinola.

The 20-year-old scored again in the 44th minute after Pozuelo beat Brillant to the ball following an 11-pass Toronto sequence. Pozuelo floated the ball to the far post where an unmarked Akinola tapped it in.

Akinola came into the match with one goal in 12 career MLS appearances (including two starts) spread over three seasons. It was his first MLS game action since June 29, 2019, and first start since May 8, 2019.

Westberg made a remarkable one-handed save to stop Ola Kamara's header from point-blank range in first-half stoppage time.

On the plus side, Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti looked sharp in his Toronto debut, showing a good rapport with Pozuelo and Brazil's Auro on the right flank. Akinola also made the most of his opportunity.

And Bradley, in his first outing since injuring his ankle in the Nov. 10 MLS Cup final, was a force in midfield.

Reds face Impact on Thursday

""I thought he was fantastic,"" said Vanney.

Toronto has not lost a regular-season game since Aug. 3, 2019, when it was beaten 2-0 by the New York Red Bulls. Vanney's team has gone 5-0-8 since.

Toronto's next Group C game is Thursday against the Montreal Impact, who lost their opener 1-0 to the New England Revolution last Thursday.

The three group games count in the regular-season standings with Toronto now at 1-0-2 and D.C. United at 1-1-1.

Altidore did not make the matchday 23. He was late joining the team after spending the lockdown at his Florida home and had to train on his own while fulfilling quarantine.

Canadian midfielder Jonathan Osorio didn't dress due to a quad strain.

Vanney said Altidore could get some minutes against Montreal with the third game targeted for Osorio.

With that firmly in mind, The Canadian Press takes a look at some of the hockey-related themes as the six clubs from north of the 49th parallel prepare to gather together as full groups for the first time since the schedule was suspended March 12.

Calgary Flames

The Flames will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the only all-Canadian matchup of the best-of-five qualifying round that leads into the usual 16-team playoff bracket. Calgary is slated to be without Travis Hamonic after he opted out of the return plan due to ""family considerations.""

Calgary will miss the steady defenceman against Winnipeg's firepower up front, but perhaps even more pressing will be the need for Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan to find their offensive games against Vezina Trophy candidate Connor Hellebuyck in the Jets' goal following sub-par regular seasons. The Flames will also need a big performance from winger/leading scorer/general pest Matthew Tkachuk after Calgary was stunned by Colorado in the first round of last spring's playoffs following a 107-point campaign.

Edmonton Oilers

Led by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers are set to take on the Blackhawks in the qualifying round. Edmonton sat 11 points clear of Chicago at the time the NHL suspended its schedule. Draisaitl won the regular-season scoring race with 110 points, 13 ahead of the second-place McDavid. Edmonton has the benefit of not having to travel to its hub city, and knows Rogers Place well, but that's where the advantage of playing in the Oilers' home rink probably ends.

WATCH | Toronto, Edmonton chosen as hub cities:

The NHL is officially returning to the ice this summer as the league and its players' union ratified an agreement on Friday. 2:19

They also won't have Mike Green, who was acquired at the trade deadline from the Detroit Red Wings, after the blue-liner also chose to opt out, citing ""deeply personal family health reasons."" The Blackhawks were all but eliminated from playoff contention back in March, but were handed a lifeline by the NHL's return-to-play plan. The series looks like a mismatch on paper, but don't discount the pedigree of a team led by three-time Stanley Cup champions Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane.

Montreal Canadiens

Like the Blackhawks, the Canadiens were playing out the string back in March, but now find themselves with an opportunity to write an incredible story. Montreal will take on the Pittsburgh Penguins, who sat 15 points clear of the Habs at the time the league shut down, in the qualifying round.

The Canadiens suffered through two excruciating eight-game losing streaks this season, and were also cut down by a number of injuries. And while they'll be heavy underdogs against Pittsburgh's battle-tested group led by Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, Montreal has playoff experience of its own in Shea Weber, Brendan Gallagher and Carey Price.

Toronto Maple Leafs

The Leafs were experiencing a roller-coaster season before the pandemic struck. From off-ice controversy, to finally naming a captain, to a coaching change, to playing well below expectations, Toronto's 2019-20 was never dull. Now the club will take on the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for the right to make the playoffs. Auston Matthews took a big step forward, having already set career-highs with 47 goals and 80 points when the schedule was halted.

WATCH | League, players approve NHL return to play plan:

CBC News' Raffy Boudjikanian outlines the NHL's return-to-play plan, including the decision to use Edmonton and Toronto as the two ""hub cities."" 2:31

But after The Toronto Sun reported last month the star centre tested positive for COVID-19, there are obvious questions about his ability to play at the highest level when the games start to count Aug. 1. Toronto has plenty of firepower apart from Matthews, including Mitch Marner, John Tavares and William Nylander, but the play of netminder Frederik Andersen could be the difference against a bruising Columbus team that will get a big boost with the return of a healthy Seth Jones on its blue-line.

Vancouver Canucks

Another contrast in styles sees the Canucks take on the Wild in the qualifiers. Vancouver is led by its young core of Elias Pettersson, Quinn Hughes and Brock Boeser. Hughes and Pettersson both said recently they felt physically refreshed after the long break forced on the league by the coronavirus.

Both can expect plenty of attention from Minnesota's veteran roster and strong defence corps led by Ryan Suter. How they deal with that could be the difference. Vancouver goalie Jacob Markstrom is the main reason the Canucks looked primed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2015 before the campaign was shut down. Vancouver's thin on post-season experience, but that could be a good thing in a scenario like no other.

Winnipeg Jets

After the Jets lost some massive pieces on their blue-line last summer, Hellebuyck stepped up and kept Winnipeg in the fight. The netminder was 31-21-5 with a 9.22 save percentage and a 2.57 goals-against average in 2019-20 and is the main reason the Jets found themselves in a playoff spot back in March.

Winnipeg and Calgary played just once in the regular season, and that was an outdoor game in Regina, so neither team has much to go on in terms of recent head-to-head play. Kyle Connor scored 38 times for the Jets this season, while Mark Scheifele (29), Patrik Laine (28) and Blake Wheeler (22) also cracked the 20-goal mark.",[]

In a brief statement on the federation website, Yevgeny Yurchenko didn't give a reason for stepping down.

He said he wished his successor could ""move forward to resolve the nearly five-year-long difficulties in relations with World Athletics and also make it possible to attract enough funding to develop the federation.""

The federation, known as RusAF, missed a July 1 deadline to pay the $5 million fine and $1.3 million in costs. Yurchenko said at the time it couldn't afford to pay.

When Russia missed the deadline to pay, World Athletics froze procedures allowing top Russian athletes to compete internationally as ""authorized neutral athletes"" during Russia's suspension, ahead of a July 29-30 council meeting. That could prevent some top Russians competing when the Diamond League restarts next month.

""We are aware of this news,"" World Athletics said in a statement, ""but this is obviously an internal matter and we will wait to hear from RusAF.""

Accusations of forged documents

The fine was imposed after Yurchenko admitted wrongdoing on behalf of RusAF under its previous leadership. The federation had been accused of providing forged documents to give an athlete an alibi for being unavailable for doping testing. RusAF has been suspended since 2015 for widespread doping.

Before Yurchenko was elected unopposed on Feb. 28, he was best known as a businessman with a seat on the board of a majority state-owned aircraft manufacturer. He also briefly served as a regional deputy governor.

Also Monday, the president of the Russian Olympic Committee said in comments reported by state news agencies that an audit of the country's anti-doping agency's finances revealed irregularities.

The allegations could not immediately be verified, but ROC president Stanislav Pozdnyakov was quoted as saying the audit would be made public. The agency's supervisory board will consider the findings from the audit, Pozdnyakov said in comments reported by the RIA Novosti agency.

Russian Anti-Doping Agency CEO Yuri Ganus denied any financial misconduct on Friday. He was speaking in response to allegations published anonymously on the social media and messaging platform Telegram.

The Russian agency, known as RUSADA, is challenging the World Anti-Doping Agency over its decision to bar Russia's name and flag from major events including the Olympics. WADA ruled last year that Russia manipulated doping laboratory data to cover up past offences.",[]

The crash happened Saturday night during a race on a dirt track in Grain Valley.

Balcaen, 28, was sent to hospital but tweeted shortly afterwards that, despite the injuries and a ""very sore body with limited mobility,"" she was doing well.

Here’s the clip of the flip since many of you have been asking. It’s right at the end, you can slow it down to see it better. I’m not sure what happened prior to it. <a href=""https://t.co/99FMXl2GXf"">pic.twitter.com/99FMXl2GXf</a> —@amberbalcaen10

""I'm in the mend,"" she posted, thanking everyone for their concern and suggesting she might be released from hospital on Monday.

Balcaen, who grew up in Winnipeg and now lives in North Carolina, made history in the fall of 2016, when she became the first Canadian-born woman to win a NASCAR-sanctioned race in the United States.

Struggles to land sponsorships have kept her from jumping fully into the NASCAR stock car racing circuit. In the meantime, she has been tearing up oval dirt tracks as part of the National Powri Series, racing in the open-wheeled midget class.

It was in one of those vehicles that flipped high in the air on Saturday, rolling numerous times before hitting the ground and rolling several more times.

In a Twitter post that shows video of the crash, Balcaen said she is not sure what caused it.

On Sunday, she tweeted an update, noting a new round of X-rays showed her lung ""is looking much better.""

I’m feeling better by the hour guys! Doing some more xrays this afternoon and hopefully be let out of here by tomorrow! Thank you to the racing community/family & my crew for being there for me last night & the nurses & doctors here in Missouri for all you guys have done♥️ —@amberbalcaen10

Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman responded on Twitter to Balcaen's original post about being in the hospital, sending her well wishes.

""From all of your friends back home in Winnipeg, get well, @amberbalcaen10!"" he wrote.

After Balcaen's historic win in 2016, Bowman held a ceremony at city hall where he presented her with the Outstanding Achievement Award.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld City's appeal against the UEFA ban, but imposed a 10 million euro ($11.3 million US) fine on the club for failing to co-operate with independent investigators.

Some UEFA allegations accusing City of finance rules violations dating back several years were not proven and others were ""time-barred,"" the court said.

CAS plans to publish a detailed written verdict within days. That could help explain why UEFA's case did not comply with its own internal rules, and show how other evidence was weighed.

Man City joins Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Galatasaray in beating UEFA in appeal cases related to finance monitoring rules in the past two years.

The decision by the three CAS judges clears the team coached by Pep Guardiola to play in the group stage of the Champions League next season. The case does not affect City's place in this season's competition, which resumes next month.

City's win guarantees tens of millions of dollars in UEFA prize money next season. It also protects against players leaving to seek Champions League action with another club.

Guardiola had pledged to stay in Manchester ""no matter what happens"" in the courts.

City denied wrongdoing

""The club welcomes the implications of today's ruling as a validation of the club's position and the body of evidence that it was able to present,"" City said in a statement.

UEFA punished Man City in February for ""serious breaches"" of finance monitoring rules and failing to co-operate with investigators. The allegations included that City, owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family, misled UEFA over several years to meet financial integrity rules — known as Financial Fair Play — required to enter European club competitions.

City denied wrongdoing, and said it had ""irrefutable evidence"" the claims were not true.

""The CAS award emphasized that most of the alleged breaches reported by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the (UEFA club finance panel) were either not established or time-barred,"" the court said.

City's win will raise doubts about the future of the UEFA Financial Fair Play program, created in 2009 after the global financial crisis.

The system was used to ban several clubs, including Galatasaray in 2016, from one season of UEFA competitions. City was the first club to be banned for two years.

In a statement, UEFA pointed blame at its own club finance investigators and judges for ""insufficient conclusive evidence to uphold all of the (panel's) conclusions"" and not meeting a five-year statute of limitations.

UEFA could choose to challenge the CAS ruling at Switzerland's Supreme Court. Federal appeals in CAS cases rarely succeed and only consider narrow grounds of legal procedure.

The urgent ruling came one month after a three-day hearing held by video link between Switzerland and England. A full verdict detailing the evidence, expert witness testimony and the judges' reasons is due within days.

Accusations of overstating sponsorship deals

UEFA-appointed investigators opened a case after leaked club emails and documents from City officials were published by German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018. They were likely obtained by a hacker from Portugal.

The published evidence appeared to show City deceived UEFA by overstating sponsorship deals from 2012-16 and hid the source of revenue linked to state-backed companies in Abu Dhabi.

City never disputed the documents were authentic, but argued the evidence was stolen and reported out of context. It was unclear Monday what part the leaked documents ultimately played in the case.

UEFA had previously signed off on City's submitted accounts since 2014. That year, UEFA fined City 20 million euros ($22.6 million) of its Champions League prize money in a first wave of assessments of European clubs' finances. French champion PSG got the same fine in a similar case.

UEFA decided to create the FFP system 11 years ago to stabilize the soccer economy by monitoring finances of 200-plus clubs which qualify each year for its competitions. Clubs must approach break-even on commercial income and spending on transfers and salaries. Sponsor deals linked to wealthy owners must be set at fair market rates.

Critics of FFP argue it protects storied clubs with a huge fan base from being challenged by ambitious rivals with state support, like Man City and Qatar-owned PSG.

UEFA said Monday it and the European Club Association ""remain committed to its principles.""

The UEFA rules will be challenged again at CAS this week. Turkish title contender Trabzonspor is appealing against a one-year ban for failing to abide by an earlier settlement deal.

The fine to be paid to UEFA will benefit other clubs, including City rivals Liverpool and Manchester United. UEFA rules require that Financial Fair Play fines -- in most cases, prize money deductions -- must be redistributed among other clubs who play in the Champions League or Europa League that season.",[]

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

'The momentum will grab'

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change. - Brendan McLeod

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""",[]

Phase 2 of the NHL's return-to-play protocol featured voluntary on- and off-ice workouts with plenty of social distancing and, at least to start, no coaches. The players were basically on their own to set up drills, push each other and prepare for a potential league restart that was far from certain.

Toronto's general manager came away impressed by what he saw, and hopes that commitment pays off when the games matter.

""We had been on them from the beginning about their conditioning level,"" Dubas said Sunday of the conversations with players since the season was suspended in March because of COVID-19. ""Their fitness is going to be really important for us as we begin rolling. That was something that we hammered home to them on every Zoom call and conference call.

""That's been a real positive.""

The Leafs and 23 other teams are primed to get an unusual summer training camp going Monday morning, the next sign post in the league's plan to resume its pandemic-halted campaign.

Auston Matthews 'is fit to play'

Dubas expects his roster, which has been in town for at least the last week, to hit the ground running.

And Auston Matthews — the star centre who The Toronto Sun reported last month had tested positive for COVID-19 in Arizona — is among them and ready to go.

""Auston is fit to play,"" Dubas said in his shortest answer of a 40-minute video conference call with reporters.

The Leafs, who were in a playoff spot at the time the NHL schedule was stopped in its tracks, are preparing to take on the Columbus Blue Jackets in the best-of-five qualifying round for a right to make the usual 16-team playoffs.

WATCH | NHL hub cities to be Edmonton and Toronto:

The NHL and its players' union formally signed an agreement Friday that would see hockey return to action in 2 Canadian cities on August 1. 3:37

Even though Toronto now has to win three more games than the usual 16 to reach its ultimate goal, there won't be any griping.

""I don't think it's unfair,"" Dubas said. ""The NHL has done a great job of building out its plan and trying to execute this as safely as possible.""

That includes the naming of Toronto, along with Edmonton, as a hub city that will host 12 clubs in a so-called ""bubble"" away from the general public.

""The only advantage is that we don't have a flight to get here,"" Dubas said. ""We'll just take a bus.""

Salary cap an issue for Leafs future

The NHL's return-to-play plan to resume the season was tied to a new collective bargaining agreement that spelled out some of the harsh economic realities facing the league, its teams and players in the coming years.

One aspect that could impact the Leafs is the fact the $81.5-million US salary cap will remain stagnant for the foreseeable future. Some observers believe that means there's even more pressure to win now, but Dubas doesn't see it that way with the likes of Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander signed long-term.

""If we were facing a situation where some of our core players' (contracts) were up at the end of this year ... I would feel a bit differently,"" he said. ""But with everyone signed going into this off-season, we're going to have some space to take care of our restricted free agents that we have and potentially look at some of our own UFAs.

""I don't feel this season there should be any added expectation. The players have an expectation and we have an expectation that we're going to be competitive and that we're trying to contend.""

Toronto's script was already a page-turner before the coronavirus knocked hockey, and the rest of the sports world, off its axis. There was Marner's contract resolution, off-ice issues that grabbed headlines, a coaching change, an embarrassing loss to emergency backup goalie and Zamboni driver David Ayres, and maddeningly inconsistent performances from a talent-rich group.

Dubas expects to learn plenty about his team in the coming weeks and months.

""This is so different and it's a major challenge,"" he said. ""It's an opportunity to win the Stanley Cup by being able to be focused on what we're doing each day, and our commitment to one another, our commitment to the protocols that are in place to keep each other healthy and keep each other safe and keep our community safe.

""If we're willing and able to get uncomfortable and accept some of the differences that we're experiencing, and in the way that we normally do things, and embrace those differences and embrace the uncomfortability of what we're dealing with, I think it's a great growth opportunity.""

That path, which now requires 19 victories, starts Monday.",[]

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID-19 situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

Jays home opener is July 29

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

""My understanding right now is that's your group, so you've got to manage your group,"" Flames GM Brad Treliving said Sunday in a conference call with reporters.

Knowing their first games after training camp won't be pre-season warmups, but a best-of-five elimination series against the Jets in Edmonton, Treliving says Flames coaches might have to pull on the reins the first few days of camp.

""I think they're going to come out hot,"" Treliving said. ""You want to get your work done, but you've got to be smart about it.

Calgary (36-27-7) ranked third in the Pacific Division, four points back of the second-place Edmonton Oilers, when the NHL halted play.

Winnipeg (37-32-8) was fourth in the Central and held down the first wild-card berth in the Western Conference.

Theirs is the lone all-Canadian matchup when the play-in round starts Aug. 1 in the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto.

Each team is limited to 52 people, including 31 players, upon arrival in each hub city where they're to be walled off from the public.

Treliving says what keeps him awake at night is the Flames staying virus-free before arrival in Edmonton.

""What we've learned about this virus is it's not a dirty little secret. You don't have to be doing something wrong to attract it,"" he said. ""It's still out there.""

Team trying 'to be as safe as we can to get to the hub'

The Flames will enter Scotiabank Saddledome one by one wearing masks, the GM said, and be subject to daily temperature checks and COVID-19 tests.

Dressing rooms will be sanitized after use and players will physically distance from each other during dryland training, he added.

""Where you are susceptible is when you leave the rink,"" Treliving acknowledged. ""As an organization, we've given them all the instruction they need.

""We're as on lockdown as you can possibly be right now, to try to be as safe as we can to get to the hub.""

Hamonic was among half a dozen NHL players as of Sunday who had opted out of returning to play.

In a statement, he cited his infant daughter's respiratory illness earlier this year as his reason for sitting out the rest of this season.

The 29-year-old Manitoban is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of this season.

""Contractual status and all that stuff is a discussion for another day,"" Treliving said. ""As I told him, I respect his decision.

Still three shots behind Justin Thomas with three holes to play, Morikawa made only one birdie and it was enough for a 6-under 66 to force a playoff.

The other time, Morikawa had to make a 25-foot putt to keep playing.

The only dull moment Sunday at the Workday Charity Open was the end, when Morikawa took two putts for par from just inside 10 feet to beat Thomas on the third playoff hole and win for the second time in his career.

""Amazing,"" Morikawa said when asked how he would sum up the day to someone who only saw the result.

That covered a lot of territory.

Morikawa never looked like the winner until it was over.

Costly mistakes

Thomas had 10 straight one-putt greens, the last one a 25-foot eagle putt on the par-5 15th for the three-shot lead with three holes to play. And while he made two bogeys for a 69 that allowed for a playoff, he had reason to think it was over when he made a 50-foot birdie putt from the back of the 18th green.

""I never assumed it was over,"" Thomas said. ""Percentages would say that it heavily is close to being that way. … I just tried to keep my head down and think he's going to make it, but hoping he's not, selfishly, but he did.""

Thomas missed a 10-footer for par in regulation, and a putt close to that same line for birdie on the second extra hole. He was done in by a tee shot on No. 10 that wound up in the rough behind a tree, forcing him to pitch out 102 yards short of the green. He missed his 15-foot par putt, leading to Morikawa's two-putt par and the win.

It was a wild ride for Thomas, too. He started with a two-shot lead, trailed by three after just five holes, made four straight birdies and was ahead by three shots 10 holes later, and ultimately lost in a playoff.

""It's completely unacceptable to give up a three-shot lead with three to go,"" Thomas said. ""I'm upset, I'm disappointed in myself. But at the end of the day it's over with now, and I just need to take some time this afternoon and tonight to build on it and figure out what I can do better going into next week.""

They return in four days for the Memorial on a Muirfield Village course expected to be as fast as a U.S. Open.

This was a big win for the 23-year-old Morikawa, who in his 13 months since graduating from Cal already has established a reputation for a high level of consistency. His only victory was at an opposite-field event last summer. He beat a field at the Workday Charity Open that featured five of the top 10 in the world.

""This is a huge kind of stepping stone,"" said Morikawa, who goes to No. 13 in the world, one spot ahead of Tiger Woods. ""We got No. 1 out of the way. We got No. 2. Let the gates just open and let's keep going.""

Missed eagle putt

It was his second playoff since the PGA Tour returned June 11 from the COVID-19 pandemic. Morikawa lost on the first extra hole at Colonial by missing a three-foot putt. He had a two-foot putt in regulation on Sunday that caught the left edge of the cup and swirled in. ""My heartbeat must have skipped a billion times,"" he said.

The only thing missing was a handshake from Jack Nicklaus. He'll be there next week for the Memorial, as the PGA Tour stays at Muirfield Village.

Viktor Hovland of Norway had a 71 and finished alone in third. He was in the final group of three young stars, all of whom had the lead at some point during the final round.

Hovland's hopes ended with two shots — finding a bunker from the 10th fairway for bogey, and a driver on the reachable 14 that only missed by about five feet, enough to slowly tumble down the bank and into the water.

Morikawa also hit driver on the 14th that rolled 12 feet away. He narrowly missed the eagle putt, while Thomas hit a splendid wedge with side spin to three feet for birdie to stay one ahead. That's when it appeared the tournament turned in Thomas' favour.

Favourable bounce

Morikawa was in thick rough right of the fairway on the par-5 15th, unsure he could get over the slope to the next section of fairway. It came out heavy, just through the fairway into light rough 190 yards away. By then, Thomas hit 3-wood to 25 feet. Morikawa went through a bunker to the steep slope by the green, and did well to chop that chip high in the air to five feet. Thomas made his eagle putt. Morikawa made his par to stay alive.

""A three-shot cushion with three to go is a lot different than four with three to go,"" Morikawa said. ""And then him hitting somewhat of a poor tee shot on 16, I knew this was my window of opportunity.""

Thomas missed a 10-foot par putt. Morikawa caught a good bounce with an ordinary 8-iron to the 17th and made a 10-foot birdie. Thomas found the fairway bunker off the tee at the 18th, played short of the green and couldn't make his par.

The starting times were moved up to avoid a forecast of thunderstorms, so the final round was broadcast on a delay, available live only on streaming.

With no fans on the course, it was the wildest finish that hardly anyone saw.",[]

Pendrith, from Richmond Hill, Ont., shot a 6-under 66 in the fourth round to finish 21 under for the tournament, four strokes behind winner David Lipsky of the United States.

Pendrith, who tied for third at last week's TPC Colorado Championship at Heron Lakes, is projected to jump to 12th from 26th in the tour standings after this week's result.

Chip Ganassi Racing just kept rolling along.

Felix Rosenqvist overtook Pato O'Ward on the next-to-last lap and earned his first career win Sunday in the second half of an IndyCar doubleheader at Road America. Rosenqvist became only the second driver to win an IndyCar event this year after Dixon posted three straight victories to start the year.

Rosenqvist and Dixon, who finished 12th, are Chip Ganassi Racing teammates.

The race turned into a duel between Rosenqvist and O'Ward, who were both chasing their first career victories. O'Ward pulled ahead on the 43rd of 55 laps, but his margin steadily decreased before Rosenqvist finally passed him.

Spectators were allowed in

""You're never really too confident,"" Rosenqvist said. ""But when I saw the gap with Pato decrease the last four or five laps, I only had one thing on my mind and my crew also had only one thing on my mind, and that was winning the race.""

This weekend's doubleheader marked the first time spectators were allowed during this pandemic-delayed season. IndyCar organizers are allowing fans on a case-by-case basis, relying on local and state health guidelines wherever the races are held.

Those fans got to see quite a finish.

Rosenqvist went to O'Ward's left and passed him on Turn 7 of the 14-turn road course that is just over 4 miles long. Rosenqvist took over from there and won by 2.8699 seconds.

O'Ward, who had the pole position for the first time in his career, said he was struggling with his rear tires down the stretch. O'Ward also was affected by traffic involving lapped drivers, including Conor Daly. Those two drivers had made contact Saturday in move that wrecked Daly's Chevy and knocked him out of that race.

""We were just unlucky at the end,"" O'Ward said. ""We couldn't make it happen. But I'm proud of myself. I gave it absolutely everything I had.""

Rosenqvist became the first Swede to win an IndyCar race since Kenny Brack's 2002 victory at Mexico City. Rosenqvist had two second-place finishes last year.

'Nightmarish start'

Alexander Rossi, who won at Road America last year, finished third for the best result of what has been a disappointing season for the Andretti Autosport driver. Rossi ranked second in the point standings in 2018 and was third last year, but he hadn't finished higher than 15th in any of the first three races this season.

""It's been a pretty nightmarish start I think, for this whole team,"" Rossi said. ""But the work ethic never wavered and the confidence in what we were capable of never changed. It was just a matter of coming out and having a smooth day, and we were able to do it today.""

Rosenqvist's victory at least temporarily ended Dixon's season-long dominance. Dixon was the first driver to win three straight IndyCar events since Simon Pagenaud in 2006.

Dixon started the year with victories at Texas and Indianapolis before winning Saturday at Road America.

But he was never much of a factor Sunday.

'I guess you can't win them all'

""I guess you can't win them all, but we sure tried to with the start to the season we've had,"" Dixon said.

The only other drivers to win as many as three straight races to begin a season are A.J. Foyt (seven in 1964), Sebastien Bourdais (four in 2006) and Al Unser Sr. (three in 1967).

Will Power finished second to Dixon on Saturday and created some commotion at the start of Sunday's race.

On the opening lap, Power's Chevy hit Ryan Hunter-Reay from behind and also made contact with Graham Rahal in a separate incident, knocking both Hunter-Reay and Rahal out of the race after they went off course. Power was penalized for avoidable contact and got sent to the back of the pack on the restart.

""It's disappointing to see desperation moves like that, that early in the race,"" Rahal said. ""I've made them before so I know them well.""

Rahal's Honda was knocked off course, and the left side of his Honda hit the end of a concrete railing. Rahal and Hunter-Reay both were checked and released from the infield care centre.

Power's tough day continued a few laps later when he spun and hit a sign on Turn 13. He recovered and briefly took the lead on the 17th lap before eventually finishing 11th.",[]

But even as Major League Baseball prepares to open its season next week, far later than normal, the much-smaller Intercounty Baseball League has announced it's cancelling the 2020 season.

The IBL began in 1919 and has gone ahead every year ever since. It even continued through the Second World War, ""even though many players joined the armed forces,"" says the league in its online history.

But now it has become a temporary casualty of COVID-19.

On Thursday, five of the league's eight teams said they were abandoning any hope of having scheduled play this year. The other three teams had already done so back in March.

""I wish we were still playing, but I understand why they've cancelled,"" said Cleveland Brownlee, a major hitter for the London Majors.

He said many players in the league, who come from the United States and other countries abroad, weren't able to come into Canada because of COVID restrictions.

""You know, we want to be playing, but I get to spend more time with my family this summer.""

The cancelled season means the London Majors will not get to play this year in the city's Labatt Park, newly-crowned as the best ballpark in the IBL by fans.

""There remained a myriad of obstacles to operating in 2020 because of COVID-19,"" the league said.

""Many aspects of life in the province are returning to some sense of normalcy, albeit slowly and cautiously. However, a clear path for team sports — that includes fans, is not imminent... (and) a meaningful season (is) no longer viable.""

Many players in the IBL come from other countries, which would complicate quarantines.

Several clubs said may hold events and activities if restrictions are further lifted, and fans who have already bought tickets will be informed about how their tickets will be honoured.

As for Brownlee, he's excited to get to watch Major League Baseball when a truncated season comes back July 23.",[]

""I made a mistake in not recusing myself. I am sorry,"" Trudeau told reporters.

He said he should never have been part of the cabinet talks, given his family's close personal ties to the charity.

The apology comes after CBC News and Canadaland reported that his mother, Margaret, and his brother, Alexandre, were paid in excess of $300,000 by WE and its entities for speaking engagements over the last four years.

Trudeau said he knew his mother and brother were employed as public speakers but he didn't know just how much his family members were paid by WE.

""I deeply regret that I have brought my mother into this situation. It's unfair to her, and I should have been thoughtful enough to recuse myself from this situation,"" Trudeau said, referencing his mother.

Watch | 'The mistake that we made was on me': Trudeau apologizes for WE Charity furor

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau admitted Monday that he made a mistake when he took part in the government's decision to use the WE charity to run a student volunteer program. 2:54

Trudeau said the public service first recommended WE as the best pick for the contract, given its nationwide reach and its experience connecting students with volunteer opportunities.

Trudeau said he still should have known that his involvement in talks to award the contract would be problematic, given how closely associated his family is with the organization.

""When it came to this organization and this program, the involvement that I had in the past, and that my family has, should have had me remove myself from these discussions and I'm sorry that I didn't,"" Trudeau said.

He said he regrets that his failure to recuse himself from contract discussions has derailed a program that was set to help thousands of young people find work.

""I'm particularly sorry because not only has it created unnecessary controversy and issues, it also means that young people who are facing a difficult time right now, getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer before getting those opportunities to serve, and that's frustrating,"" he said.

Watch: Trudeau is asked how he can convince people his apology is genuine

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau admitted Monday that he made a mistake when he took part in the government's decision to use the WE charity to run a student volunteer program. 2:15

Conservative MP Michael Barrett, the party's ethics critic, said Trudeau's apology was an attempt to stop this story from ""spinning out of control.""

""We know that Justin Trudeau is only sorry when he gets caught and that's what the apology was all about today,"" he said.

""As the weight of this comes to bear down on him, he is sorry, but that doesn't mean that the investigations won't continue and they certainly should.""

Barrett said Trudeau should appear before the House of Commons finance committee to field questions from MPs, and should waive cabinet confidentiality for all documents related to the contract.

The opposition Conservatives are also calling for an emergency meeting of the Commons ethics committee to study the government's decision to award the contract to the charity.

In a letter to the committee's clerk, Conservative MPs Barrett, Damien Kurek and Jacques Gourde say the committee should be recalled and an order should be issued demanding that Speakers' Spotlight — the agency that arranged for the Trudeaus to speak at WE events — produce receipts for the appearances.

The MPs say the committee also could review ""the safeguards which are in place to avoid and prevent conflicts of interest in federal government procurement, contracting, granting, contribution and other expenditure policies.""

The federal ethics commissioner, Mario Dion, already has said he will review the government's decision to award the contract to administer the $912-million program to WE. The Conservatives have said the RCMP should investigate the deal for possible criminality.

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said he's tired of hearing apologies from the prime minister on ethical scandals. He said Trudeau hasn't learned anything from incidents like the SNC-Lavalin scandal or the trip to Aga Khan's private island.

""There comes a time when we do not trust anymore and when being sorry is not something you believe in anymore,"" he said.

""So perhaps there's something else to be done and the inquiries which have been asked by the Conservatives seem to be a good idea. (Trudeau) should come forward and tell the whole truth.""

WE Charity co-founders Craig and Marc Kielburger offered their own mea culpa in a statement published in a full-page ad in today's Globe and Mail.

The brothers said the fallout from the botched partnership with the federal government has been ""extremely difficult"" and they understand why questions have been asked about their financial dealings with members of the Trudeau family.

""The charity's integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters, and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret,"" the Kielburgers said in the statement.

""It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization. In the days to come we will have more to say on these matters and about the organization's future. For now, we wanted to set the record straight, take responsibility for our part, and refocus on the mission that started twenty-five years ago.""

The charity also has faced a backlash from some people — notably former NHL star Theo Fleury and R&B singer Jully Black — who have agreed in the past to speak at WE events for free.

The co-founders said honorariums were provided to certain individuals ""who committed to speaking at multiple WE Day cities and many additional events while in the city, requiring significant time commitments.""",[]
43,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservatives-investigation-we-charity-controversy-1.5646823,Conservatives call on Trudeau to appear before committee studying WE controversy,"['Raisa Patel', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Opposition Conservatives are demanding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau testify before the House of Commons finance committee as it prepares to study how much the government spent in awarding a now-cancelled contract to the WE Charity.

""I will be adding Justin Trudeau's name to the list of witnesses. I will be calling on him to appear and testify under oath before being sworn in,"" Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said during a news conference on Sunday. ""Normally, prime ministers don't appear before parliamentary committees, but these are not normal times.""

Poilievre successfully passed a motion on Tuesday calling on the committee to hold four meetings this month to examine the matter.

The Liberal government is under fire for its decision to award a $19.5 million sole-sourced contract to WE Charity, a partnership that would have seen the organization administer more than $900 million for student work this summer under the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG).

Poilievre said Sunday that he would also be adding Finance Minister Bill Morneau to the witness list, given that both he and Trudeau have ties to the WE organization and did not recuse themselves from cabinet discussions about the contract.

""The prime minister can agree voluntarily to show up and attend and respect the invitation of a parliamentary committee,"" Poilievre said. ""Or, Parliament can compel him to appear — something that would take longer but could be done and should be done if the prime minister hides from accountability.""

If there is disagreement over Trudeau's willingness or ability to testify, Poilievre said, his party would simply present a motion, which would require the support of other opposition parties.

The NDP declined to answer whether it would back such a motion but told CBC News that the party believes in ""getting to the bottom of this, and the more answers we get (including from Trudeau and Morneau), the quicker we can get those answers for the Canadian public.""

Poilievre said he would have ""news in the days ahead"" about whether his party would also ask WE co-founders Craig and Marc Kielburger to testify.

Opposition MPs continue to exert pressure

Poilievre's Tuesday motion previously called for least four witnesses to provide testimony, including Clerk of the Privy Council Ian Shugart, Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth Bardish Chagger, a senior deputy minister from Employment and Social Development Canada and a representative from Volunteer Canada.

His motion passed alongside a separate one from NDP finance critic Peter Julian, demanding that the government produce all documents, memos, briefing notes, correspondence and other documents regarding the creation of the program.

On Sunday, the NDP's Charlie Angus also called for Parliament's ethics committee to study ""ethical conduct and avoidance of conflicts of interest within the Prime Minister's Office,"" requesting that PMO Chief of Staff Katie Telford testify, among other witnesses.

I am requesting a meeting of Ethics to investigate the culture of ethical permissiveness in the PMO. <br>After two guilty ruling against <a href=""https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@JustinTrudeau</a> wy were no measures put in place to follow the law?<br>Will be requesting Katie Telford and PCO to appear.<a href=""https://t.co/Etln2CBTFa"">https://t.co/Etln2CBTFa</a> —@CharlieAngusNDP

Should his motion pass, Angus wants the committee to release recommendations to ""better permit the Prime Minister's Office to conduct the business of government with public confidence in its integrity.""

Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is already investigating Trudeau's involvement in awarding the contract. CBC News learned last week that Trudeau's mother, Margaret, and brother, Alexandre, have been paid tens of thousands of dollars to appear at WE Charity events.

In June, the prime minister said federal public servants had identified the organization as the best fit for the job.

Parties take aim at Morneau

The Conservatives and NDP have also asked Canada's ethics watchdog to investigate Finance Minister Bill Morneau after his connections to the organization came to light.

""One of Minister Morneau's daughters is a current employee of WE Charity. It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single source contract,"" Angus wrote Friday in a letter to Dion.

Grace Acan, who was born in Uganda but joined Morneau's family in 2010, has worked for the charity's travel department since 2019. Morneau's other daughter, Clare, has also been involved with WE Charity, speaking at several WE Day events.

Morneau's office said Acan's role in the organization is administrative and not linked to the work WE does with the federal government. The spokesperson said Clare Morneau's involvement has been strictly voluntary.

WE lays off workers involved in deal

WE Charity has laid off hundreds of contract workers intended to administer the CSSG after the partnership with the organization was terminated earlier this month.

According to the Toronto Star, WE Charity had hired 465 contract workers before the project was pulled. The organization has laid off 450 of them while giving the other 15 full-time positions, the Star reported.

""WE Charity made the decision to not take any of the funds that were allocated to pay for the work delivered for the CSSG program. All sunk costs and remaining payments to contractors and vendors are being paid for by WE Charity,"" the charity said in a statement to CBC News Saturday.

The initiative, which the Conservatives argue could have been achieved through an expansion of the Canada Summer Jobs program, is now being taken over by the federal government.",[]

What impact could it have on public opinion?

Twice already, Canada's conflict of interest and ethics commissioner, has found the prime minister violated ethics rules. The first occasion was in 2017, when former commissioner Mary Dawson ruled on Trudeau and his family accepting a vacation on the Aga Khan's private island in the Bahamas.

The second occasion was just last year, when the current commissioner, Mario Dion, found that Trudeau had tried to influence then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould to overrule a decision not to grant a deferred prosecution agreement to SNC-Lavalin.

Dion already had announced he would be looking into the decision to grant the WE Charity a sole-sourced contract to administer the Canada Student Service Grant when the charity revealed it and its affiliates had paid the prime minister's mother and brother about $300,000 for speaking engagements over the last four years.

It takes time for the commissioner to complete an investigation. His office tweeted Friday that it usually takes about seven months. But if this scandal does any political damage to the prime minister and his party, it's likely to inflict it now — and not when the commissioner finally releases a report.

That's what happened the last two times, at least.

The vacation on the Aga Khan's island in 2017 effectively ended Trudeau's post-election honeymoon. His party had racked up huge leads in the polls after its 2015 victory, surging to between 45 and 50 per cent support. According to the CBC's Poll Tracker , the Liberals had about 43.2 per cent support before the story about the vacation was first reported.

There was an immediate impact on Liberal support, with the party falling to 37.3 per cent over the subsequent six weeks. Those 5.9 percentage points were never entirely recovered — to this day, the Liberals have never hit 43.2 per cent in the Poll Tracker again.

But with a solid majority government, the Liberals had time on their side. By the beginning of February 2019, the party was still polling at 37.5 per cent support and in a decent position heading into an election year.

The SNC-Lavalin affair was a bombshell. Support for the Liberals plummeted, hitting a low of 29.6 per cent by the beginning of May. That loss of 7.9 points was not recovered in time for the October election, which saw the Liberals take 33.1 per cent of the vote.

Rebounds can take months — if they happen

Both of these ethics violations contributed to a segment of the Liberal Party's support base peeling off — some of it temporarily, some of it for good.

It was easier for the Liberals to bounce back from the public opinion hit caused by the Bahamas trip. After just over four months, the Liberals were back up to 42.3 per cent support in the Poll Tracker — a recovery of all but 0.9 percentage points of the initial 5.9-point loss. The Liberals were able to retain their lead over the Conservatives for another year — until the prime minister's trip to India .

Making up the party's SNC-Lavalin loss was more difficult. After the story initially broke, the Liberals' polling peak came only eight months later, when the party hit 34.3 per cent support with just two weeks to go before voting day in October. By then, the Liberals had recovered just 3.2 points of their 7.9-point loss.

It took a global pandemic to push the Liberals above their pre-SNC-Lavalin level of support.

What kind of controversy will this turn out to be?

It wasn't until the beginning of April 2020 — over a year after the Globe and Mail broke the SNC-Lavalin story — that the Liberals surged past the 37.5 per cent support they had at the beginning of 2019.

The latest polling estimate gives the Liberals 40.4 per cent support and a 12.5-point lead over the Conservatives. With those kinds of numbers (drawn from polls conducted before the latest ethics controversy), the Liberals would be nearly assured of winning the majority government they failed to secure last year.

The question is what kind of impact this week's news will have on Liberal support — an especially delicate question in a minority Parliament.

If the Liberals experience the same six-to-eight point slide, by the late summer or fall the party would find itself roughly back where it was last election night. All of the political capital the Liberals have gained over their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak would be gone. The odds of the Liberals calling an election on their own would be slim to none, and it would be up to the opposition parties to decide whether to take advantage of it by forcing another election themselves.

Not all controversies have the same impacts, however.

When photos were published in the midst of the last campaign showing that Trudeau had worn blackface on multiple occasions before entering politics , there was enormous potential for a career-ending blow to the prime minister.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for wearing blackface before he entered politics. The scandal did not significantly dent his party's support during the 2019 federal election.

Instead, the Liberals saw their support hold steady. The party was polling at 34.2 per cent when the story broke. It only dropped by less than a percentage point a week later — a loss the party made good two weeks after that.

The dynamics of the election campaign played an important role in the resilience of Liberal Party support, but polls and the party's own research suggested that Canadians didn't believe Trudeau was racist and felt he had made a sincere apology.

It's too early to plot the political ramifications of Trudeau's WE controversy. Canadians might not be paying attention to the same degree as they would if it weren't summer — or if there wasn't a global pandemic to worry about. Nevertheless, the Bloc Québécois is calling for the prime minister to step aside and the Conservatives want the police to investigate .

But in the court of public opinion, the decisive factor might prove to be whether — after blackface and two prior ethics violations — Canadians are still willing to give Trudeau the benefit of the doubt.",[]

The province's plan will allow for activities such as indoor dining in restaurants, live performing arts shows and the reopening of movie theatres and playgrounds — albeit with significant health and safety measures in place, including physical distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and Plexiglas barriers.

""Every corner of our province is getting back to work,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a Monday news conference.

""Today, we are ready to take the next step.""

The province says it will allow indoor gatherings of up to 50 people in Stage 3 and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people. However, according to the plan, physical distancing remains a requirement for all people who are not from the same household or established social circle.

Work colleagues, including performers and crews, do not count toward gathering limits, according to the province.

The following public health units will remain in Stage 2 for the time being:

Durham Region Health Department.​​​​​​

Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit.

Halton Region Public Health.

Hamilton Public Health Services.

Lambton Public Health.

Niagara Region Public Health.

Peel Public Health.

Toronto Public Health.

Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.

York Region Public Health.

""These regions entered Stage 2 later on, so we need just a little more time,"" Ford said. ""I want the people in these regions to know we won't leave anyone behind.

""We will keep working until every part of this province gets to Stage 3.""

WATCH | Premier Doug Ford outlines what Stage 3 of reopening in Ontario will look like:

Dine-in restaurants, bars, movie theatres and gyms are among the businesses allowed to reopen in parts of Ontario on Friday, according to Premier Doug Ford. 3:25

The plan also says that people gathering inside for religious services, weddings or funerals can continue to fill up to 30 per cent of a room's capacity in Stage 3.

It also dictates that sport facilities and gyms can reopen but notes that physical distancing still must be maintained, ""except if playing a team sport or as needed for personal training.""

Amusement parks and water parks are not being allowed to reopen in Stage 3 at the moment.

Health measures still in place in Stage 3

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that health measures such as wearing face coverings, hand washing and physical distancing remain key to ensuring that Ontarians can ""safely enjoy the loosening of restrictions.

""We expect the province will remain in Stage 3 for the foreseeable future,"" Elliott said.

She also said that health officials will be monitoring for any COVID-19 outbreaks and can tighten restrictions if there are flare-ups. Provincial Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said Monday that he is hoping the entire province will be able to be in Stage 3 by the end of July.

Elliott also said social circles for people in Ontario will remain capped at 10 for now. The province can gradually expand them, but ""just not right yet,"" she said.

Finance Minister Rod Phillips said Ontario is in a ""strong position"" to reopen right now, especially compared to areas in some other countries being hard hit by COVID-19.

""We're in this position because we have made the choice to act responsibly and treat each other with respect,"" he said.

He said that respect is key in Stage 3 to ""avoid taking a step backwards.""

Provincial officials pointed to the situation in the United States as a cautionary tale Monday. Canada's southern neighbour opened the week grappling with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world after Florida shattered the national record for a state's largest single-day increase in new confirmed cases.

The World Health Organization warned that the pandemic is worsening globally and that ""there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.""

Williams said it seems the U.S. opened too quickly and is now having to backtrack.

""We do not want to repeat or have anything like that,"" he said.

116 new cases reported Monday

The loosening of restrictions comes as the spread of COVID-19 continues to slow in Ontario, with new daily case numbers having steadily declined over the last five weeks.

Ontario reported 116 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 today.

In a series of tweets this morning, Elliott noted that 29 of Ontario's 34 public health units reported five or fewer additional cases today, while 21 of those 29 confirmed no new cases at all. There are currently fewer than 1,500 active cases provincewide.

Further, the number of patients in Ontario hospitals with infections of the novel coronavirus also continues to fall, she said. There were five times as many people being treated in hospital for COVID-19 at the beginning of June than there are now.

""Having seen a continued decline in the number of new [COVID-19] cases as the province entered Stage 2, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we're providing details about Stage 3 of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,"" Elliott wrote.

Twenty-four public health units entered Stage 2 on June 12, and seven more on June 19. Toronto and Peel, the province's most populous health units, then proceeded into Stage 2 five days after that. The move included reopening patios and hair salons.

The president and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association is already expressing some hesitations at the prospect of entering the third phase.

""Given that hospitals continue to act as the anchor of Ontario's response to COVID-19, [the OHA] will be giving this announcement some serious scrutiny,"" Anthony Dale wrote on Twitter.

""We can't have hallway health care in a pandemic.""

Nearly 89% of confirmed cases resolved

The additional cases of COVID-19 reported today mean that Ontario has now seen a total of 36,839 infections of the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began in late January.

Of those, 88.7 per cent are considered resolved by the Ministry of Health.

The province's official death toll from the illness grew by three in today's report and now sits at 2,722. A CBC News count based on data provided directly by public health units, however, puts the real toll at 2,756 as of yesterday evening.

About three quarters of all deaths were residents in long-term care homes. Health officials are currently tracking ongoing outbreaks in 23 facilities.

Meanwhile, Ontario's network of about 30 community, commercial and hospital labs processed some 20,896 test samples for the virus since the last update. Another 7,837 are in the queue waiting to be completed.

That coincides with the start of the province's two-week construction holiday, when tens of thousands of Quebecers take their summer vacation.

""It's better to wear a mask than to be confined at home,"" said Premier François Legault in making the announcement Monday afternoon. ""It's not fun wearing a mask, but it's essential.""

The regulation applies to everyone age 12 and up, although Legault said even children as young as two could be encouraged to wear a mask. People with a medical condition that precludes them from wearing one will be exempted.

Legault said the government took time before making masks mandatory to get people used to the two-metre distancing rule, which he said is the most important one to follow.

""I am asking all Quebecers to collaborate. We need to respect the two-metre [rule],"" Legault said.

He also stressed the importance of keeping gatherings to a maximum of 10 people.

The indoor mask regulation will apply to retail stores, malls and recreational centres and any other enclosed public space, including restaurants, whenever someone is not seated at a table.

Business owners are responsible for applying the new regulations. If they fail to, they could face fines of between $400 and $6,000.

To start, only businesses will face fines

As of Aug. 1, individuals who refuse to wear masks could also face fines. For now, that won't happen, but people without masks could be denied entry to indoor establishments.

Dr. Karl Weiss, a microbiologist and the head of infectious diseases at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital, said wearing a mask is a temporary measure that has to become as much of a habit as stopping for a red light.

""It's not a debate. It's something that everyone has to use,"" said Weiss. ""It has to be apolitical.

""The day we have an effective vaccine, the mask will disappear.""

Weiss said several studies have proven the effectiveness of using a mask to limit the spread of coronavirus micro-droplets.

Last week, Dr. Horacio Arruda, the province's public health director, said he was evaluating the possibility of making masks mandatory after Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said she planned to do so.

As of today, wearing a mask or face covering is mandatory on public transit across the province.

Financial impact worries businesses

In a news release, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said although its members understand that asking customers to wear masks is important to contain the spread of COVID-19, they are concerned about the cost.

""Only 20 per cent of Quebec businesses are earning their usual income for this time of year,"" said the CFIB. ""Many cannot afford to lose customers and will bear the additional costs of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE).""

The federation is asking for financial assistance to purchase PPE for workers.

The last thing Quebec's merchants want is to close up shop because of an outbreak of COVID-19, said Stéphane Drouin of the Quebec retail council.

He said shop owners will apply the new regulations responsibly, and he has faith customers will comply.

""In Montreal, many people accept that they have to wear the mask,"" Drouin said. ""I can understand that in the regions, where there hasn't been a case for two or three months, it may require a greater social acceptability.""



For Étienne Cummings, director of public relations and government affairs for Quebec City's chamber of commerce, the new regulation was a logical next step, although it will not be easy for merchants to turn away customers who refuse to wear mask.

He said he hopes the new rule won't discourage Quebecers from continuing to support local businesses.",[]

It may not be getting colder but it's certainly now much more polluted than before.

The Arctic town, built on the site of a former gulag, is the site of a massive fuel spill that environmentalists have compared to the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster.

On May 29, an aged fuel tank at the Norilsk Nickel plant lost pressure and released 21,000 tonnes of diesel into the Arctic subsoil and the waters of the nearby river Ambarnaya.

""In modern history, this is the biggest spill that I have ever seen,"" said Alexey Knizhnikov, a leader with the World Wildlife Fund in Russia. It's the biggest on-land spill in Russia since 1994.

""The scale of the damage to Arctic waterways is unprecedented,"" said Dmitry Kobylkin, Russia's ecology minister, in a statement.

The incident is an embarrassment for a Russian government that has tried to pursue an environmental agenda in some places while also aggressively expanding industrial operations in the Arctic.

It's also a devastating blow to an already withered landscape and the people who rely on it for their way of life.

""If you look at the country around Norilsk, it's a real dead zone,"" said Rodion Sulyandziga, an Udege Indigenous advocate and director of the Centre for the Support of the Indigenous People of the North. ""It's affected … people's river, reindeer, lakes [and] soil.""

Historic amount of 'voluntary compensation' requested

The fallout from the spill has been swift. On June 10, Russian state investigators arrested three plant managers. A few days later, the mayor of Norilsk was charged with criminal negligence for his delayed response.

Even before the arrests, Russian President Vladimir Putin scolded the region's governor in a live television address for learning of the incident only days after the fact, on social media. He also castigated Norilsk Nickel's executives in a widely-televised conference call.

""If you had changed [the fuel tank] on time there would not have been this ecological damage,"" he said to a grim-looking quartet of executives, speaking from a field in Norilsk. ""Study this as closely as possible inside the company.""

Norilsk Nickel is the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium. It has made its majority shareholder, Vladimir Potanin, the richest man in Russia.

Facing Putin's public disapproval, Potanin said his company would cover clean-up costs, which he estimated at nearly $200 million.

But Russia's regulator, Rosprirodnadzor, came in with a higher estimate: $14 million for soil restoration alone, plus a further $2.8 billion for cleaning up the waterways.

""This is definitely a huge amount. We've never got such penalties for other environmental violations,"" said Knizhnikov.

The company is contesting the request for ""voluntary compensation"" — which is equivalent to about one-third of one year's profits. There is precedent they may succeed.

""Very often companies go to the court, and unfortunately, very often, [the] company wins,"" said Knizhnikov. ""It's very likely this huge amount will not be paid.""

Kobylkin said the company had ""every right"" to contest the fine in court. But for Knizhnikov, it may be in the company's long-term interests to take a bigger hit.

""If they refuse to pay big money, they will get [an] even worse image, not only in Russia but on a global scale,"" he said.

Spill undermines Russia's development agenda

One reason the spill has attracted such a severe response, experts say, is its consequence for Russia's own image.

Small spills are a chronic issue in the Russian Arctic, according to Laura Henry, a Russia expert at Bowdoin College — just yesterday, Norilsk Nickel reported another one, of 45 tonnes of aviation fuel, from a pipeline to the west of Norilsk. But Henry says, more often than not, they are covered up before they make the headlines.

The magnitude of this spill meant images were spreading on social media before Russian authorities were even informed, attracting international attention and marring Russia's environmental image.

Vladimir Chuprov, the campaign director for Greenpeace Russia, says it also ""hit Putin's image personally.""

Russia will chair the Arctic Council again next year and Putin has publicly stressed environmentally sustainable Arctic development as a key part of its mandate, he said.

The spill has domestic consequences as well. Putin has suggested the economic opportunity posed by a warming Arctic means climate change is ""maybe bad for the world but not so bad for Russia,"" Henry said. The spill — originally blamed on thawing permafrost — has undermined that message.

It has also thrown into relief Putin's complex relationship with oligarchs like Potanin. Henry said many already complain that Potanin's ""special relationship"" with the Kremlin has allowed Norilsk Nickel to escape close environmental scrutiny, even as it makes public commitments to sustainability.

""Potanin is making an incredible fortune off of this company,"" Henry said. That such a lucrative company failed to update such basic infrastructure ""is probably frustrating"" for Putin, she said.

Russia's other oligarchs may also balk at this setback to their country's environmental image.

Bruce Forbes, a researcher at the University of Lapland's Arctic Institute who studies Indigenous land use in Western Siberia, said many companies working in the Russian Arctic are actively increasing the amount of Indigenous consultation and environmental review they perform.

""They're doing a job like Western countries would have to do if they went into the Arctic [National Wildlife] Refuge,"" he said.

""The kinds of processes that need to go on, remarkably, have been going on. But that isn't counting the spills.""

Indigenous groups bear the brunt of disaster

For the Indigenous people of the region, this spill can be seen as another indication of the ""gap between declarations and reality,"" Sulyandziga, the Indigenous advocate, said.

""On the one hand, the Russian constitution guarantees Indigenous people's rights but in terms of implementation … it's poor. It's nothing,"" he said.

The Dolgans, Nenets, Nganasans, Evenki and Enets all hunt, fish, and herd reindeer among the lakes and rivers north of Norilsk. But the land has long been poisoned by industrial waste.

In 2016, local Indigenous groups noted with alarm that the waters of the nearby river Daldykan had turned blood red , which Norilsk Nickel suggested was natural . They later acknowledged a spill of industrial wastewater was responsible.

The waters of that river eventually flow into Lake Pyasino — now so toxic it is almost entirely devoid of fish. The waterways downstream are crossed by the world's largest wild reindeer herd, which has shrunk by more than 40 per cent since 2000.

""The legacy of the past, it's very destructive,"" said Sulyandziga. ""It is still very dangerous to hunt, to eat.""

Sulyandziga said once the scale of the environmental damage is clear, work should start on a ""working plan for Indigenous people … [to address] access to traditional food, access to traditional activity.""

But Indigenous people's power to advocate for their interests is weakening. Government crackdowns on foreign-funded NGOs led to Sulyandziga's own Centre for the Support of the Indigenous People's of the North being deemed a ""foreign agent"" and liquidated by the courts last year.

Indigenous activism, as a form of ethnic activism, can be interpreted as separatism, said Sulyandziga.

""We should be very careful.""

But in light of this latest spill, he said, Indigenous advocacy is even more important.

""I believe nature already is avoiding us because something is wrong,"" he said. ""Indigenous people should continue fighting, not only for our cultural heritage but also for our natural heritage.""",[]
48,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wage-subsidy-extension-1.5647520,Federal wage subsidy for businesses to be extended to December: Trudeau,"['Ryan Patrick Jones', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said today the federal government is extending the emergency wage subsidy program to December of this year.

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for workers at eligible companies and non-profits affected by the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

""This week we'll be announcing an extension to the wage subsidy program until December, to give greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy,"" said Trudeau.

The wage subsidy program is the centrepiece of the government's plan to get Canadians back to work following several months of restricted economic activity — but the program's uptake has not been as robust as the government had hoped.

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the budget of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion.

Trudeau wasn't saying today how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program — rules which critics have claimed act as a barrier to receiving the aid.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as a key tool to help cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers while businesses remained closed due to the pandemic.

Instead, the amount of money spent on the program lagged behind the funds being spent on the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB), which was designed to help people who had lost their jobs or nearly all their hours to pandemic restrictions. The $500-a-week CERB benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to close in the fall.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau spent weeks leading up to the July 8 fiscal update getting input from businesses, labour groups and other stakeholders on how to reshape the wage subsidy program.

The government has hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds that may discourage companies from growing.

""We need to reduce disincentives to growth,"" Morneau said last week. ""We need to make sure the subsidy is appropriate for the challenges facing enterprises in actually rehiring and getting people back to work.""

Today, Trudeau also promised more details on federal financial support for provinces as they seek to restart their economies.

""We've also been working very hard, with Deputy Prime Minister [Chrystia] Freeland and I, on the safe restart program with the provinces, and we will have an update on that later this week"" said Trudeau.

So far, the government has pledged $14 billion to help the provinces and territories reopen their economies. Premiers have complained that isn't enough money to meet their needs and that it comes with too many strings attached.

Trudeau said he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this morning about the Canada-U.S. border closure, the new NAFTA agreement, Trump's threats of aluminum tariffs and the Black Lives Matter movement.

An agreement to close the land border between the two countries to non-essential traffic is set to expire on July 21.

""We recognize that the situation continues to be complex in the United States in regards to COVID-19,"" Trudeau said. ""Every month, we have been able to extend the border closures to all but essential goods and services, and those discussions are ongoing with the United States right now as we are a week from the next deadline for closures.""

The number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the U.S. has topped 3.3 million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The daily rate of new cases there continues to rise swiftly, even as Canada seems to have its outbreak largely under control.",[]

The Public Health Agency of Canada is adding on-site employees at 36 points of entry, including New Brunswick crossings in St. Stephen, Woodstock and Edmundston.

Tammy Jarbeau, a Health Canada spokesperson, said the ""increased presence"" of officials is at the points of entry — including air and land — that see 90 per cent of travellers.

""PHAC officials, including quarantine officers, clinical screening officers and screening officers will be on-site to screen travellers entering Canada at these ports of entry,"" she said.

The news follows a surge in new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., with large daily increases in some of the country's most populous states. That uptick is paired with an increase in traffic across the international border at airports and land crossings, as restrictions are loosened.

Travel across the border has been linked to a new cluster of cases in Prince Edward Island tied to an individual who came from the U.S. with a student visa.

The number of passenger cars crossing the border at Calais, Maine, fell to 5,400 for the month of April. In January 106,000 cars entered the U.S. there. (CBC)

Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Toronto, said medical screening for the virus falls outside the job of Canada Border Service Agency officers.

""That's a problem,"" he said. ""We just assume that we can just charge the customs and immigration folks with essentially doing public health work.""

Furness said he believes the health officials will be used for secondary screening if there is an issue, which could be a question that creates cause for concern. He thinks the decision might have been prompted by the recent increase in cross-border travel.

Land crossings nearly double

Traffic between the U.S. and Canada has dropped since the border closed to non-essential travel on March 21. But recent exemptions have allowed for traffic to enter, including immediate family members, who are required to stay in the country for a minimum of 15 days, with 14 days in quarantine.

Cross-border travel is also permitted for work and study, medical care, health reasons and to maintain the flow of goods and services for essential supply chains.

Two government orders currently restrict travel into Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first blocks entry to foreign nationals except for certain circumstances, while the second closes the U.S.-Canada land border to non-essential travel until July 21.

The volume of people crossing the land border has increased since restrictions began in March, from about 115,000 a week from late April to early May to 175,000 a week in late June. The CBSA says those figures include commercial and non-commercial traffic.

The number of non-commercial highway travellers entering Canada has nearly doubled over that time period, going from about 3,300 a week to about 6,500.

Secondary health screening

Mark Stuart, an agency spokesperson, said officers ask all travellers about their purpose of visit and state of their health and look for visible signs of illness.

""CBSA officers remain vigilant and are highly trained to identify travellers seeking entry into Canada who may pose a health and safety risk,"" he said.

Officers will refer any traveller suspected of being ill to a Public Health Agency staff member for further assessment, regardless of how they responded to questions. They also consider if a person is able to properly self-isolate or quarantine.

The health agency said all ports of entry, including land borders, always have access to quarantine officers through a tele-health system. Only the 36 high-traffic sites will have that staff onsite.

All travellers entering Canada are required to isolate if they have symptoms or quarantine for 14 days without signs of the virus. International arrivals must also complete a contact-tracing form and provide information to allow for physical checks that they are following isolation rules.

People 'want it shut down'

St. Stephen Mayor Allan MacEachern said he believes residents in his border community will feel safer with the new measures.

""People knowing that is put in place, how people will try to bend the rules and try to sneak through even though they could be arrested, you don't know — they won't take that chance now,"" he said.

The mayor said his town is in a ""tough situation"" with the shutdown with families divided and daily life disrupted. St. Stephen also relies on a steady flow of American tourists at its businesses.

Despite close ties with neighbouring Calais, Maine, fears over COVID-19 are prompting calls for the closure to continue.

""Walking on the street or reading comments on Facebook, you can definitely see people want it shut down, they really do want it shut down,"" MacEachern said

Travel restrictions helping

Furness said travel restrictions — despite some flare-ups — have been largely effective at preventing the spread of the virus from the U.S. and internationally. But the risk remains.

""It doesn't take that many people to cause a lot of COVID,"" he said. ""I mean one person can spark a whole outbreak.""

In February and March, CBSA officials began asking screening questions, while airlines began passenger temperature checks.

Those measures do little to catch asymptomatic individuals. Furness said he'd like to see the use of pulse oximeters, a device that checks how much oxygen is dissolved in blood. That level could indicate decreased lung capacity and the possibility of having COVID-19.

The infection control epidemiologist said the key measure of how well governments are managing the crisis is looking at the response when a case gets through.

""The one thing to be afraid of is someone presents at the hospital, they've got COVID, and they have no idea how they got it,"" he said. ""That's what's scary.""",[]

On Monday, police spokesperson Sgt. Ann Mathieu said officers are now focusing on the heavily wooded area around Rang Saint-Lazare, a country road in Saint-Apollinaire, southwest of Quebec City.

Mathieu said the officers found objects in that area Sunday, leading them to believe Carpentier is nearby. They are looking at the possibility Carpentier might be dead or unable to move.

""It's not impossible that he's still alive, but we have to consider that, with the time passing by, maybe he's not,"" Mathieu said.

""We're still searching. We never saw Martin Carpentier. We never had any contact with him. The information that we possess is related to the citizens that report having seen him.""

Martin Carpentier was last seen with his two daughters last Wednesday. The bodies of the girls were found Saturday but Carpentier is still missing. (Facebook)

They are hoping to find him alive, as he is the only one who can clearly explain the progression of events leading up to the death of 11-year-old Norah and six-year-old Romy.

Carpentier was last seen Wednesday with his daughters in a convenience store in the Saint-Nicolas neighbourhood of Lévis, Que.

His car, badly damaged and abandoned, was found about five kilometres west of that store on Highway 20, just an hour later.

On Thursday, police issued an Amber Alert for the girls. It ended when their bodies were discovered in the forest on Saturday.

They were taken to hospital and later declared dead.

Mathieu said that all evidence so far leads them to believe that Carpentier was in the car with his daughters at the time of the crash, but the only one who could tell them that for sure is Carpentier himself.

""Martin Carpentier is the key to understanding the entire event,"" Mathieu said.

The dense forest in the area as well as the humid and rainy weather over the weekend have made the search particularly challenging, Mathieu said.

Though police had previously used the help of volunteers in their search for the girls, Mathieu is now calling on residents to stay away from the area so as not to slow down the investigation.

She is also asking that Quebecers avoid misinformation and rumours that have been circulating about the case online.

Canadian soldiers helped the officers with their search of the area over the weekend but have since left. Mathieu said they can be called back if the need arises.

Premier François Legault said Monday that, like the rest of the province, he is shocked and saddened by the death of the two girls. He urged anyone in crisis to get help.

Parents, he said, can call Ligne Parents at 1-800-361-5085.

Deaths from the virus have been rising in the U.S., especially in the south and west, though they are still well below the numbers reached in April, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday attributed the current surge in coronavirus cases to the United States not having shut down completely to snuff out outbreaks of the disease.

""We did not shut down entirely and that's the reason why when we went up,"" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with Stanford Medicine.

""We started to come down and then we plateaued at a level that was really quite high — about 20,000 infections a day. Then as we started to reopen, we're seeing the surges that we're seeing today as we speak in California — your own state — in Arizona, in Texas, in Florida and several other states.""

In Florida, where parts of Walt Disney World reopened Saturday, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded, according to state Department of Health statistics reported Sunday.

The numbers come at the end of a record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day.

Researchers expect deaths to rise in the U.S. for at least some weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring because of several factors, including increased testing.

The coronavirus was also affecting Americans abroad.

In Japan, more than 30 Marines tested positive at the Futenma U.S. air station on Okinawa, where infections among American service members have rapidly risen to more than 90 since last week. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan.

Confirmed cases also have been found at three other Okinawa bases: 22 at Camp Hansen, one at Camp Kinser and another one at Camp McTureous. Officials said the movements of people at Futenma and Camp Hansen have since been restricted and large-scale virus testing is being conducted.

Here's what's happening around the world

In Asia, two WHO experts were in China for a mission to trace the origin of the pandemic. The virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing had been reluctant to allow a probe but relented after scores of countries called on the WHO to conduct a thorough investigation.

China has argued that the virus might have originated outside of China and has angrily denied allegations that it covered up the scale of the outbreak as infections first began to spread.

Meanwhile, India — which has the most confirmed virus cases after the United States and Brazil — on Monday reported a record daily surge of 28,701 new cases reported in the past 24 hours.

Greece was seeking a ban on church and village fairs and tighter tourism-related checks following a recent increase in confirmed coronavirus cases.

In Spain, a judge has overturned a decision by the Catalan regional government to confine over 140,000 people to only leaving their homes for work and other essential activities, arguing that only central authorities can issue a lockdown that restricts freedom of movement.

South Africa, which accounts for over 40 per cent of all the reported coronavirus cases on the continent, is also reinstating a nighttime curfew to reduce the number of traffic accidents and has made it mandatory for all residents to wear face masks in public.

David Hartman warned against giving the Huawei executive's lawyers unredacted copies of documents from Canada's spy agency in an affidavit sworn as part of a proceeding that will be heard in federal court later this month.

The affidavit was filed in late June in support of the attorney general, who is fighting to keep from public view communication about Meng's arrest between CSIS and the FBI.

""Generally speaking, such disclosure would inflame tensions between the governments of Canada and China, and would, necessarily, provoke a response harmful to bilateral relations and Canadian interests,"" Hartman's affidavit says.

""Given the consular considerations, disclosure could also risk causing harm to individual Canadian lives.""

Hartman served as Global Affairs' executive director for greater China until August 2017.

He and CSIS intelligence officer Michel Guay both filed affidavits in the federal court case, which will be heard during four days of hearings at the end of the month.

The first day of proceedings will be held in public on July 27; the remaining three days will be behind closed doors.

The fight centres on six heavily redacted CSIS documents the attorney general disclosed to Meng's lawyers after an order from the B.C. Supreme Court judge overseeing her extradition case.

The U.S. wants the Huawei chief financial officer sent to New York to face fraud charges in relation to an allegation that she lied to an HSBC executive in August 2013 about her company's control of a firm accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.

Prosecutors claim Meng's alleged lies put the bank in danger of violating the same sanctions themselves, risking prosecution and loss as a result.

Meng's lawyers plan to argue that the FBI and Canadian authorities mounted a ""covert criminal investigation"" against their client, sharing technical information about her electronic devices and conspiring to have Canadian border officers detain and question her without a lawyer for three hours before RCMP placed her under arrest.

'Perception of influence'

The CSIS documents include an email, operational notes, a report and three so-called ""situation reports"" written before and after Meng's arrest at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018.

The situation reports state that CSIS received word from the FBI the day before Meng's arrest and that the U.S. agency would ""not be present in an effort to avoid the perception of influence.""

The reports say the RCMP recognized the ""highly political nature of the arrest"" and predicted from the outset that Meng's detention would ""be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally.""

Large portions of all the documents have been redacted.

In their affidavits, both Hartman and Guay stress that they have not viewed the unredacted portions of the documents themselves, so that they won't be at risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive information during the public proceeding.

Hartman describes the damage Meng's extradition case has already caused Canadian-Chinese relations, including the suspension of canola seed imports and the arbitrary detentions of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor have been held in Chinese prisons since the days immediately following Meng's arrest. Last month, the Chinese formally charged them with spying. Canada hasn't had consular access to either man since January.

Souring public opinions

Hartman says the COVID-19 pandemic has only ""underlined the necessity"" for Canada to engage in bilateral relations with China.

""China has been an important supplier of personal protective equipment and pharmaceutical products in global supply chains and accounted for a significant portion of medical supplies procured by the Government of Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Hartman wrote.

He says ""Canadian media coverage and public opinion on China has grown increasingly negative, reflecting public opinion trends globally.""

The affidavit traces the change in sentiment to the introduction of a new national security law in Hong Kong, ""reports of Chinese intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders in China as well as in Canada"" and a ""Chinese disinformation campaign around the origins of COVID-19.""

A still from a video of Meng filed as part of a defence application for access to documents. The video was taken during her first few hours in custody. (Court proceedings)

As a result, Hartman says ""it is in Canada's interest to ensure that the management of our necessary but complex engagement with China is not negatively affected even further by the public disclosure of sensitive information.""

Guay's concerns about the redacted material are related solely to the impact it might have on national security. He writes about the importance of maintaining confidential sources and of the need CSIS has to share information on the understanding it will be kept confidential.

""If foreign agencies were to lose faith in the commitment of the service to protect confidential third party information, there would be significant impact on the willingness of those agencies to provide information to the service in the future,"" he says.

'An ongoing role in her arrest'

In federal court documents, Meng's lawyers say the unredacted portions of the CSIS documents make it plain that ""not only was CSIS involved in communicating with the FBI and others regarding the planning of Ms. Meng's arrest prior to December 1, 2018, but that CSIS had an ongoing role in the arrest.""

As such, they are also seeking emails, texts, telephone logs and briefing notes from CSIS as well as the identity of the authors of the reports.

Meng's lawyers hope to use that information in upcoming B.C. Supreme Court hearings to argue that she was the victim of abuses of process and breaches of charter rights so egregious that the extradition proceedings should be tossed.

The 48-year-old's case is predicted to extend well into 2021. Meng has denied all the allegations against her.

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours after the two rented a boat, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. PT news conference was scheduled.

The lake, an hour's drive from Los Angeles, was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help above from helicopters, drones and all-terrain vehicles.

Search crews made the discovery in the northeast area of the lake, and the body would be flown 64 kilometres to the coroner's office in Ventura, said Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow.

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy Glee.

Her family has been notified of the discovery, said Buschow.

""I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,"" he said. ""It takes an emotional toll on the search teams, too.""

Son found on drifting boat

The actor had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said. Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life-jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification. Rivera is believed to have drowned ""in what appears to be a tragic accident,"" the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

Trudeau, who said in a news conference he had spoken to the U.S. president earlier in the day, told him that with the North American economy getting back up to speed, Canada's aluminum smelters would soon be back producing value-added specialty products for the American auto sector.

The spectre of new tariffs emerged last month after Canadian producers, unable to shut down production and with their usual customers hamstrung by the impact of COVID-19, were forced to make a more generic form of aluminum and ship it to warehouses in the United States.

That alarmed certain U.S. smelter owners and operators, who have been urging the U.S. trade representative's office to slap fresh levies on imports from Canada.

The pandemic ""caused certain disruption in the aluminum sector that is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,"" Trudeau said after his call with Trump.

""I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we're celebrating NAFTA and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible.""

Canada has been on the outside looking in when it comes to the coming into force of NAFTA's successor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took shape in 2017 and 2018 before a backdrop of steadily worsening relations between Trump and Trudeau.

While Trump welcomed Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a celebratory event at the White House last week, Trudeau kept his distance, citing the tariff dispute and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic among his reasons.

A readout from Monday's call said the prime minister ""expressed regret"" for being unable to attend.

The U.S. trade representative reportedly gave Canada a deadline of July 1 to impose export restrictions — the very day the USMCA took effect.

U.S. cases spike

That deadline has come and gone without a hint from either the White House or U.S. trade ambassador Robert Lighthizer about what happens next.

Trudeau said he and Trump also discussed the Canada-U.S. border, where non-essential travel has been curtailed since March in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The 30-day bilateral agreement to limit discretionary cross-border travel without restricting trade or essential workers has been extended three times and is now set to expire July 21.

Since the last extension, however, the public health crisis in the U.S. has exploded. More than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases were identified over the weekend, particularly in southern states that reopened early, with Florida emerging as the new epicentre. Canada has had 108,000 confirmed cases in total, compared with more than 3.3 million cases and 135,000 deaths in the U.S. to date.

A closed border

Hospitals in major urban centres across the United States are again nearing capacity and health care workers face another critical shortage of personal protective equipment like masks and respirators.

Recent polls suggest Canadians remain unequivocally opposed to reopening the border any time soon — a predictable symptom of the accelerating crisis in the U.S., said Kathryn Friedman, a University at Buffalo law professor and Wilson Center global fellow.

But there could be other lingering foreign-policy irritants at play, she added.

""I wonder if the United States had treated our dear neighbour, friend and ally a little bit better over the last three-and-a-half or so years, if the reaction would be as harsh,"" Friedman said. ""Maybe people are just like, 'Well, too bad, I don't care if you want to open the border.""'

Friedman is among several Canada-U.S. experts, border community leaders, northern state lawmakers and others who want to see a plan for when the time comes to lift the restrictions.

""I think we have to have this conversation,"" she said. ""I think we have to engage the right people now, so that when the border restrictions are eased, whenever that's going to be, they are done so responsibly.""

It's less a question of when and more a question of how, Friedman said — what sort of controls, testing and screening measures and other tools will need to be in place even after the emergency has passed.

""I'm more concerned that the climate will change, and some relevant government officials won't have given any thought to how this border opening is going to take place,"" she said.

""We have to get our act together and really think more clearly about how we're going to handle these kinds of situations in the future, and really use science-based data — an evidence-based, science-based approach — to health screenings when it comes to border restrictions and border policies.""

The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism and the Canadian Association of Urban Financial Professionals announced the plan, dubbed the BlackNorth Initiative, on Monday.

The plan advocates for companies to work with the coalition to hire more Black students for their internship/co-op programs and to ensure business succession planning strategies include a Black talent strategy to help build a pipeline of employees for future leadership positions.

It is also asking that businesses disaggregate their employee race data and publish it annually, including data on executive representation and/or employee mobility statistics for each Black, Indigenous and person of colour group.

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy Mischief, 1986's Space Camp and her breakthrough, 1988's Twins. Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film The Experts, about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance?"" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

The pair were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television, starring opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film For Love of the Game. In 2003, she starred in What a Girl Wants and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat. The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved.

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in Jerry Maguire as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

Russell Crowe tweeted that he met Preston ""first in late '92 I think,"" adding that while he hadn't seen Preston much, ""when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Actor Daniel Dae Kim recalled Preston's kindness to him early on in his career.

""I was lucky enough to work with her on one of my very first films, For Love of The Game. We were shooting on cold days in Colorado, but she couldn't have been warmer or kinder to a young, nervous actor trying to make good,"" he posted online.

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, although the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb Battlefield Earth in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy Old Dogs, also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

Death of son Jett

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas.

The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million US from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time but decided to stop pursuing the case, and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, The Last Song, which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010.

Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

They last starred together in the 2018 film Gotti, with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram.

""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

She Can Be Reached At', 'Elizabeth.Thompson Cbc.Ca.More Elizabeth Thompsonfollow Elizabeth Thompson On Twitter', 'Elizabeth Thompsonsenior Reporter', 'Senior Reporter']",,"Reports of online sexual exploitation of Canadian children have soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as abusers take advantage of the fact that kids are spending more time online.

Stephen Sauer, director of Cybertip.ca, said his organization saw an 81 per cent spike over April, May and June in reports from youth who had been sexually exploited, and reports of people trying to sexually abuse children.

""It seems to be an epidemic right now online,"" he said.

Sgt. Arnold Guerin of the RCMP's National Child Exploitation Crime Centre, which coordinates investigations into child sexual exploitation online and child pornography, said his unit also has seen an increase in reports of sexual exploitation of children.

At the outset of the pandemic, he said, his unit saw offenders on livestreaming sites, social media and on the dark web looking for children to chat with online, or to meet in person so that they could sexually assault them.

Where predators gather online

""In March, when everything started, we weren't immediately seeing an increase of child sexual exploitation reports being made from big companies like Microsoft, Google and Facebook,"" Guerin said.

""Since then, we have seen increased reports from referrals made to Canada from all of those companies and from others.""

When online companies see child abuse or child pornography on their platforms, they refer the information to police in the country where the abuser lives, Guerin said.

""So every referral that we get — and we're getting them in the thousands per month — are Canadians who are sharing child pornography actively on all of those social networks,"" he said.

While Guerin's unit has seen a steady increase in child sexual exploitation online over time, he said the latest increase appears to be the result of the pandemic.

""Our feeling is that the increase is definitely related to COVID,"" he said. ""Because more people are at home. More people are online and children are spending an inordinate amount of time in front of screens, whether those are computers or mobile devices.""

In Alberta, 18 men from across the province are facing a total of 65 charges related to online child exploitation. Alberta's Law Enforcement Response Team (ALERT) Internet Child Exploitation unit received 243 reports instances of online child exploitation in Alberta in March — well above the average of 110.

""This is a level of activity that has been unparalleled in the existence of the ICE unit,"" Supt. Dwayne Lakusta said in a media statement.

Canada is not alone.

A report last month by Europol — the EU's central law enforcement agency — also found an increase in the sharing of child sexual abuse material online during the pandemic.

""This harmful sharing and re-sharing of content that victimizes children has been repeatedly detected at record levels during the COVID-19 pandemic within Europe,"" said the report.

According to the U.S National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, ""there has been a 106 per cent increase in such activity across the globe,"" the report added.

A surge in child porn

Europol found messages in one dark web forum for ""cappers"" — people who capture livestream videos of children being forced or coerced into producing videos of a sexual nature. The number of such messages and threads tripled from 500 between December and February to 1,500 between March and May.

The report also predicts the surge of activity during the pandemic will fuel an increase in sexual abuse of children and child pornography available online.

""We may expect to see a further increase of this material being spread and children being victimized in the coming months,"" the authors wrote.

While such activity has increased during the pandemic, Guerin said his unit hasn't seen a change in the types of crimes it sees happening online.

""We are seeing images and videos of very young children. We have seen images as young as infants and newborns being sexually assaulted all the way up to the age of 17,"" he said.

""The majority of the content that we investigate and review is largely pre-pubescent, so before puberty, of very young children. They are often of sexual assault or in some cases violent in nature.""

Guerin said the abusers and those seeking to exploit children sexually can be found wherever children hang out online.

""They're hanging out on all of them,"" he said. ""So it's Omegle. It's Facebook. It's Microsoft. It's Google, Snapchat — any platform where you're going to find children, you're going to find this kind of material being reported.""

Sauer said he is also seeing reports of abusers hanging out on sites like Omegle and Chatroulette, which allow users to chat with strangers.

Sauer said kids should make sure they know who they're really dealing with online.

""You would want to make sure that you're cautious about engaging with individuals that you don't know online,"" he said. ""That you are wary of individuals asking sexual questions, or for sexual pictures or images. Anything that appears to make you feel uncomfortable.

""Also, for youth, if a situation has gone too far, find a safe parent or a safe adult to talk to about the situation. Someone in your life that you know that will help you through the situation. That's the way to go about it.""

Guerin agrees.

""The really important thing is to be involved in your child's life online as much as you would in the real world,"" he said. ""I would have honest conversations about them ... to tell them that if anything happens to them online that makes them fear for their online safety, that it's okay to seek out the help of a parent and that they won't be in trouble for asking for help.""

58,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/mars-missions-2020-1.5647214,Mars is about to be invaded by robots from planet Earth,"['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Mars is about to be invaded by planet Earth — big time.

Three countries — the United States, China and the United Arab Emirates — are sending unmanned spacecraft to the Red Planet in quick succession beginning this week, in the most sweeping effort yet to seek signs of ancient microscopic life while scouting out the place for future astronauts.

The U.S., for its part, is dispatching a six-wheeled rover the size of a car, named Perseverance, to collect rock samples that will be brought back to Earth for analysis in about a decade.

""Right now, more than ever, that name is so important,"" NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said as preparations went on amid the coronavirus outbreak, which will keep the launch guest list to a minimum.

Each spacecraft will travel more than 483 million kilometres before reaching Mars next February. It takes six to seven months, at the minimum, for a spacecraft to loop out beyond Earth's orbit and sync up with Mars' more distant orbit around the sun.

Scientists want to know what Mars was like billions of years ago when it had rivers, lakes and oceans that may have allowed simple, tiny organisms to flourish before the planet morphed into the barren, wintry desert world it is today.

""Trying to confirm that life existed on another planet, it's a tall order. It has a very high burden of proof,"" said Perseverance's project scientist, Ken Farley of Caltech in Pasadena, Calif.

Near-simultaneous launches aren't a coincidence

The three nearly simultaneous launches are no coincidence: The timing is dictated by the opening of a one-month window in which Mars and Earth are in ideal alignment on the same side of the sun, which minimizes travel time and fuel use. Such a window opens only once every 26 months.

Mars has long exerted a powerful hold on the imagination but has proved to be the graveyard for numerous missions. Spacecraft have blown up, burned up or crash-landed, with the casualty rate over the decades exceeding 50 per cent. China's last attempt, in collaboration with Russia in 2011, ended in failure.

Only the U.S. has successfully put a spacecraft on Mars, doing it eight times, beginning with the twin Vikings in 1976. Two NASA landers are now operating there, InSight and Curiosity. Six other spacecraft are exploring the planet from orbit: three U.S., two European and one from India.

The United Arab Emirates and China are looking to join the elite club.

The UAE spacecraft, named Amal, which is Arabic for Hope, is an orbiter scheduled to rocket away from Japan on Wednesday, local time, on what will be the Arab world's first interplanetary mission. The spacecraft, built in partnership with the University of Colorado Boulder, will arrive at Mars in the year the UAE marks the 50th anniversary of its founding.

""The UAE wanted to send a very strong message to the Arab youth,"" project manager Omran Sharaf said. ""The message here is that if the UAE can reach Mars in less than 50 years, then you can do much more.... The nice thing about space, it sets the standards really high.""

Controlled from Dubai, the celestial weather station will strive for an exceptionally high Martian orbit of 22,000 kilometres by 44,000 kilometres to study the upper atmosphere and monitor climate change.

NASA aiming to touch down in Jezero Crater

China will be up next, with the flight of a rover and an orbiter sometime around July 23; Chinese officials aren't divulging much. The mission is named Tianwen, or Questions for Heaven.

NASA, meanwhile, is shooting for a launch on July 30 from Cape Canaveral.

Perseverance is set to touch down in an ancient river delta and lake known as Jezero Crater, not quite as big as Florida's Lake Okeechobee. China's much smaller rover will aim for an easier, flatter target.

To reach the surface, both spacecraft will have to plunge through the hazy red skies of Mars in what has been dubbed ""seven minutes of terror"" — the most difficult and riskiest part of putting spacecraft on the planet.

Jezero Crater is full of boulders, cliffs, sand dunes and depressions, any one of which could end Perseverance's mission. Brand-new guidance and parachute-triggering technology will help steer the craft away from hazards. Ground controllers will be helpless, given the 10 minutes it takes radio transmissions to travel one-way between Earth and Mars.

Hunt for hints of life

Jezero Crater is worth the risks, according to scientists who chose it over 60 other potential sites.

Where there was water — and Jezero was apparently flush with it 3.5 billion years ago — there may have been life, though it was probably only simple microbial life, existing perhaps in a slimy film at the bottom of the crater. But those microbes may have left telltale marks in the sediment layers.

Perseverance will hunt for rocks containing such biological signatures, if they exist.

It will drill into the most promising rocks and store a half-kilogram of samples in dozens of titanium tubes that will eventually be fetched by another rover. To prevent Earth microbes from contaminating the samples, the tubes are super-sterilized, guaranteed germ-free by Adam Stelzner, chief engineer for the mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

""Yep, I'm staking my reputation on it,"" he said.

1st helicopter on Mars

While prowling the surface, Perseverance as well as China's rover will peek below, using radar to locate any underground pools of water that might exist. Perseverance will also release a spindly, 1.8-kilogram helicopter that will be the first rotorcraft ever to fly on another planet.

Perseverance's cameras will shoot colour video of the rover's descent, providing humanity's first look at a parachute billowing open at Mars, while microphones capture the sounds.

The rover will also attempt to produce oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the thin Martian atmosphere. Extracted oxygen could someday be used by astronauts on Mars for breathing as well as for making rocket propellant.

NASA wants to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 and send them from there to Mars in the 2030s. To that end, the space agency is sending samples of spacesuit material with Perseverance to see how they stand up against the harsh Martian environment.

The tab for Perseverance's mission, including the flight and a minimum two years of Mars operations, is close to $3 billion US. The UAE's project costs $200 million US, including the launch but not mission operations. China has not disclosed its costs. Europe and Russia dropped plans to send a life-seeking rover to Mars this summer after falling behind in testing and then getting slammed by COVID-19.

Perseverance's mission is seen by NASA as a comparatively low-risk way of testing out some of the technology that will be needed to send humans to the Red Planet and bring them home safely.

""Sort of crazy for me to call it low risk because there's a lot of hard work in it and there are billions of dollars in it,"" Farley said. ""But compared to humans, if something goes wrong, you will be very glad you tested it out on a half-kilogram of rock instead of on the astronauts.""",[]
59,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-fears-pittis-economcis-1.5645404,The inflation threat hasn't gone away as governments borrow and spend: Don Pittis,"['Don Pittis', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"If economics were as exact a science as some economists might like us to think, the debate about inflation would be over.

Currently, the mainstream view as gleaned from many credible economists and reports from financial journals is that inflation remains off the table — and 40 years of stable prices will continue.

In many ways that is reassuring; but there is another view. While the idea that we are nearing an inflationary turning point will be seen by many as contrarian, the arguments are by no means preposterous and are worth hearing even if just to confront and disprove.

If we do see a return to inflationary pressure and the rising interest rates that will be needed to contain it, Finance Minister Bill Morneau's plan to borrow now for the long-term at low current rates may have other consequences.

Prices falling not rising

As the pandemic kills off jobs and spending power, as companies such as Brooks Brothers and David's Tea last week joined many others in bankruptcy protection, most economists say the big worry right now is not inflation but its opposite, deflation.

Certainly in the short term, there are plenty of strong arguments for fearing falling prices — a trend considered ominous because it makes consumers hold onto their cash in expectation prices have even further to fall.

A decline in consumer demand from people staying home or living on reduced incomes should in theory lead sellers to hold prices down. Similarly a sharp decline in employment weakens the power of workers to bid up wages. Both are disinflationary.

Canada's Minister of Finance Bill Morneau answers a question about the Economic and Fiscal Snapshot in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill on July 8. If the economy picks up faster than expected, fiscal stimulus could help drive inflation. (Patrick Doyle/Reuters)

Finance Minister Bill Morneau presented his fiscal snapshot last week, but his is not the only government borrowing to spend.

One fresh bit of independent evidence has arrived from the market in something called inflation-linked bonds; they have recently earned record gains compared to regular bonds.

""The performance is owed mainly to investors seeking protection from price pressures that may emerge from stimulus efforts and a return to economic growth,"" reported business news service Bloomberg last week.

In other words, rather than just talk, some investors were laying down their cash in anticipation of a switch to rising prices.

Gains in those inflation-linked securities were especially remarkable because, for all the reasons mentioned above, consumer prices have actually been falling . That means economists who insist inflation is on its way are effectively looking through the current downturn to what comes next.

""The current recession is deeply deflationary for the next few quarters, but our analysis points to higher and more volatile inflation in the long-run, and we think the market is not priced for it,"" said a report on inflation by the Man Institute, a subset of the British finance giant best known outside the financial world for its contributions to the Man Booker Prize.

'Responsibly irresponsible'

The report, summarized in the Financial Times Alphaville with the unambiguous title Inflation is coming , makes the case that a confluence of factors, abetted by massive government coronavirus spending, means inflationary pressures will return after a 40-year absence.

The inflationists say that unlike the surge of money added to the economy in 2008 which mostly went into the financial sector and stayed there, this time the cash is ending up as fiscal spending in the regular economy as governments bail out consumers.

They say fear of the dire effects of deflation means governments and central banks will be willing to put up with inflation to avoid the greater risk of its opposite.

""They will attempt to be 'responsibly irresponsible' now in order to shock inflation expectations higher,"" said the Man Institute report.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau talks to CBC chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton about the $343-billion deficit largely created by emergency spending during the COVID-19 pandemic and how the government plans to recover. 3:53

Friday's Canadian job creation numbers came in well above expectations, hinting at what could happen if the economic recovery kicks in more quickly than expected while all that additional fiscal stimulus is still active in the economy.

But inflationary pressure does not mean inflation. Central banks can raise rates to stop it, but as strategists with the asset manager Blackrock suggested in a recent report, that is something they may wish to avoid.

Rising interest rates would have disruptive effects on heavily indebted businesses and consumers. If governments are forced to renew existing debt at higher rates, the so-called ""rollover risk,"" high rates could also make borrowing costs on large debt untenable.

""It may eventually have to be dealt with through austerity, default or inflation,"" said the Blackrock investment outlook . ""Inflation could be seen as the most politically palatable solution.""

The inflationists may not have it right, but if rising prices or rising interest rates due to an increase in inflationary pressures come to pass over the next decade, the Man Institute economists are likely right in saying it will be ""messy.""

""We think it is possible that financial markets are on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation regime change that could create havoc for savers and investors.""",[]

St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish is offering a mixture of online and in-person classes in the fall semester.

The university's board of governors sent the waiver to students. By signing, students give up the right to sue the university for any ""loss, damage, illness, sickness, expense or injury including death … as a result of COVID-19 risks.""

It applies to all activities and locations at the campus, as well as any off-campus locations where St. FX activities — like research, recreational activities or sporting events — take place.

But fourth-year psychology student Juliana Khoury said many students are feeling pressured since they must sign the waiver by Aug. 1 or have their student account suspended, and class registration also just began.

She said St. FX isn't offering enough classes online for those who are not comfortable going back to campus, so the waiver is essentially forcing all students to sign it or take a gap year.

I've been holding my opinions on re-opening campus in Fall 2020 - mostly because I have mixed opinions myself.<br><br>Today, I am extremely disappointed in StFX University following the release of this document. <a href=""https://t.co/MICPPtoANR"">pic.twitter.com/MICPPtoANR</a> —@tiffmaclennan

Khoury said she's heard from many students who are immunocompromised or have loved ones who are, and they would prefer to learn from a distance.

""I would really like to see more online options so that students can make a real choice. And then the waiver wouldn't be a problem, because it would be a true choice made by the students,"" she said.

""And so then, like any other waiver, the students would be signing it acknowledging that the choice they have made comes with elevated risk.""

To graduate, Khoury herself needs 10 courses next year and only one is being offered online.

Waivers not always 'airtight'

Halifax law expert Wayne MacKay has observed that such waivers seem to be popping up more and more.

""It seems that's now becoming a more common thing,"" said MacKay, professor emeritus at Dalhousie University's Schulich School of Law.

""And, obviously, the risks are particularly difficult to deal with because there's still so many things we don't know about COVID-19.""

MacKay said it's a way for the university to get some legal protection, but he said the document is not necessarily ""airtight"" if someone tries to take the university to court.

""The starting assumption is that you're bound by the contract,"" he said. ""But in most waivers of liability, the courts would be very reluctant to interpret that to include a situation where there was negligence or bad conduct on the part of, in this case, the university.""

Wayne MacKay is professor emeritus at Dalhousie University's Schulich School of Law. (Nick Pearce)

The waiver has a clause specifically referring to negligence. MacKay said broader language means better protection for the university, but that doesn't make it unlimited.

""But in spite of that fairly clear language, I think a court could still, in an extreme case, say that the waiver doesn't cover it,"" MacKay said.

The Halifax Regional Municipality has also included a liability waiver for summer camps , but MacKay said there's a ""big difference"" when adults sign waivers for themselves.

""The courts have been much more willing to go beyond the waiver partly because it's parents acting on behalf of their children, not the children themselves making the choice,"" he said.

MacKay said it's crucial for the person signing the contract to read it in full to understand what they're giving up.

'A choice for students'

Andy Hakin, St. FX's president, sent an email to the school community Sunday. It addressed concerns about the waiver and provided more context.

The waiver, he said, is just one piece of the university's overall risk-management approach during the pandemic.

The university was told by its insurers that insurance companies will not provide pandemic-related coverage by the end of the year.

Hakin said reopening campus would never be a ""zero-risk scenario"" when it comes to COVID-19, and the university is working hard to prepare for the fall semester with new protocols in place.

""The waiver, by no means, absolves the university of doing everything it can to meet the standards expected by public health.… If, at any time, we believe we cannot maintain the health and safety standards prescribed by our public health experts, we will not proceed,"" he said.

These types of waivers are not unusual at the university, Hakin said. They do not impact any student's existing health coverage.

Students must sign the waiver in order to return to campus, but Hakin said there are other ""mandatory behavioural expectations"" for students related to COVID-19.

""Ultimately, this is a choice for students.… These documents are extraordinary measures implemented due to the extraordinary times we are navigating,"" he said.

Student union proposes two-way agreement

Sarah Elliott, president of the StFX Students' Union, said she's heard from many students frustrated about the waiver and few number of online classes.

She said their union is meeting with the school's vice-president academic to make sure online or different styles of learning can be accessible for students.

Elliott also said the union has begun the process to draft a memorandum of understanding involving expectations for both students and the St. FX administration.

It would not be a legal document like the waiver, but would hold the school accountable as they ask students to do the same, Elliott said.

""So instead of being kind of a one-sided thing, it will be both of us working together to make sure that we'll be upholding the safety measures,"" she said.

After the memorandum is signed, Elliott said their next step is making sure there's more consultation of all students across campus so ""no student feels like their voice isn't being listened to.""

André Audet, 62, of Boucherville was charged originally in December with incitement of hatred and wilful promotion of hatred in the same investigation, but now faces two new charges in connection with the alleged threats.

""The charges stem from a brief investigation conducted by the RCMP integrated national security enforcement team (INSET) after receiving information about disturbing online posts,"" said an RCMP statement released Monday morning.

""For example, the accused called for the death of Justin Trudeau and encouraged the eradication of Muslims.""

Audet made hundreds of posts: RCMP

Police said further review of the evidence and the execution of search warrants led them to lay new charges: advocating genocide and intimidation of a justice system participant. The ""participant"" in this case, said RCMP Cpl. Charles Poirier said, was the prime minister.

Police said they believe Audet used a variety of pseudonyms on a number of social media networks.

""The investigators identified approximately one hundred hate posts, threats and/or posts inciting violence in the targeted accounts,"" the statement went on.

The National Council of Canadian Muslims issued a statement Monday applauding the RCMP's move, while recognizing ""that the RCMP itself has systemic issues to deal with.""

""Advocating for genocide is egregious and an extreme form of hate speech. Statements directing violence towards our community, or any community, cannot be tolerated,"" said the organization's director of legal affairs, Sameha Omer.

""These charges, laid for the first time in Quebec's history, send an important message.""

In Monday's news release, the RCMP encouraged people to report threats they come across.

""Violent statements will not be tolerated,"" it said. ""The perpetrators may face criminal charges involving significant sentences.""

Charges follow Rideau Hall incident

The new charges come more than a week after a man allegedly breached the grounds at Rideau Hall with multiple loaded firearms.

Corey Hurren, 46, faces 22 criminal charges, including uttering a threat or conveying a threat to ""cause death or bodily harm"" to Trudeau, according to court documents.

That investigation is also being led by INSET, which — according to Public Safety Canada's website — was created to ""track, deter, disrupt and prevent criminal activities of terrorist groups or individuals who pose a threat to Canada's national security.""",[]

Depp said the fight came after Heard's 30th birthday party, and hours after he had learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a ""haymaker"" at him.

Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

""A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch, effective if it reaches the target,"" Depp said.

""I have come across it,"" noted the judge.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard's 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had attended a meeting and been told that his former business managers had ""stolen my money.""

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said ""this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it's quite embarrassing — apparently I had made $650 million (all figures US)"" much of it through his involvement with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million he was ""$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.""

Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

Depp testified for 5 days, denied hitting Heard

During five days in the witness box, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He called the relationship ""a crime scene waiting to happen."" But he denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

Following Depp's testimony, his former personal assistant Stephen Deuters was in the witness box. He contradicted Heard's account of an incident during a flight by private plane from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014. Heard alleges the actor went into a rage, slapped her and kicked her in the back because he believed she was having an affair with actor James Franco.

Depp has denied assaulting Heard or being out of control.

Deuters, who is now the European head of Depp's production company, said Depp was quiet and ""introverted"" on the plane. He said the couple had ""an argument of sorts,"" but ""it didn't seem to be a screaming-obscenities slanging match.""

In a written witness statement, Deuters said the actor ""made a playful attempt to tap (Heard) on the bottom with his shoe"" but didn't kick her.

Deuters acknowledged in court on Monday that he sent Heard a text message after the flight saying Depp was ""incredibly apologetic and knows that he has done wrong,"" but denied that meant he agreed with her version of events.

In the text, which was read aloud in court, Deuters wrote that ""when I told him he kicked you, he cried.""

While testifying, Deuters said he used the word ""kicked"" because Heard had used it and he was trying to calm her down. He said Depp did not kick Heard.

""I was seeking probably to deflate the situation. It wasn't my job to be a relationship counsellor,"" he said.

In his written statement, Deuters also alleged that Heard ""was the abuser in the relationship. She had subjected Mr. Depp to years of abuse.""

Marriage broke down for good after birthday party

Depp has strongly denied all of Heard's allegations, including a claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia, where Depp was appearing as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film.

Deuters agreed that the couple had an altercation, which ended up with their house being trashed and Depp's fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Depp said Monday that he had surgery on the severed finger when he returned to the U.S. and developed a ""painful"" superbug infection, MRSA.

He said the marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed after the April 2016 birthday party, a mishap Heard blamed on her Yorkshire terriers.

His Special Interests As A Journalist Include The Criminal Justice System"", 'Investigative Reporting.', 'Thomas Rohnerreporter', 'Thomas Rohner Is A Reporter Based In Iqaluit', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Ct']",,"Inuit in Nunavut are dying during interactions with police at a rate significantly higher than in Yukon, Northwest Territories and Ontario, according to data collected and analyzed by CBC and a statistical expert in criminology.

That trend is especially apparent since 2010, with a rate of police-related deaths in Nunavut more than 14 times higher than both Yukon and Ontario and more than three times higher than the Northwest Territories.

Police-related deaths in this story refer to deaths in police custody, detention or during or after interacting with police.

CBC collected data on police-related deaths from 1999 to 2020 from the coroner's offices in the three territories and the Special Investigations Unit in Ontario. Data from Canada's most populous province provides a comparison outside the North.

These include all deaths where police were on the scene but may not have been directly responsible for a fatality.

It looks like there's something systematic here. - Anthony Doob, University of Toronto professor

""What the statistics show in this case is that it's pretty unlikely that this is a chance phenomenon,"" Anthony Doob, a professor emeritus of criminology at the University of Toronto with 40 years' experience analyzing crime statistics, told CBC News.

""It looks like there's something systematic here.""

The RCMP serve all three territories, while Ontario is policed by roughly 60 agencies ranging from municipal to First Nations police services.

16 deaths in 21 years in Nunavut

Between 1999, when Nunavut was created, and 2009, there were three police-related deaths in the territory, according to Nunavut's chief coroner's office.

Between 2010 and July 2020, there have been 13 police-related deaths in Nunavut, the office said, including nine deaths since 2013. That's a total of 16 deaths in 21 years.

Anthony Doob is a professor emeritus of criminology at the University of Toronto with 40 years' experience analyzing statistics. (Submitted)

In Yukon, there have been five police-related deaths, while the Northwest Territories has seen six such deaths since 1999, the territorial coroner's offices said.

Because the territories' population sizes are relatively small, the distribution of deaths over time can be misleading, Doob said.

""Any given year, you can say, well, that's an anomalous year. But when you take 20 years [of data], it's kind of hard to make that argument,"" he said.

With a much larger population than the territories, Ontario has had an average of about 31 such deaths every year since 1999.

When adjusted for the different population sizes of all four jurisdictions, Nunavut's overall per-capita rate of police-related deaths since 1999 is more than nine times higher than Ontario's and about three times higher than both Yukon and the Northwest Territories.

""The rate [in Nunavut] is clearly higher than the other two territories and clearly higher than Ontario's,"" Doob said.

But it is the trends since 2010 that are most significant, he said.

Since 2010, Nunavut's rate of police-related deaths is 14.35 times higher than Ontario's, 14.23 times higher than Yukon's and 3.27 times higher than the rate in the Northwest Territories.

""It's obviously worth looking into as to why these events seem to be more likely to be happening [in Nunavut] now than they were 10 years ago,"" Doob said.

'Very unlikely' trends are a fluke: expert

The professor said he performed a number of statistical tests on the data to determine how likely the apparent trends occurred simply by chance.

Those test results provide the percentage chance that the trend is a fluke rather than significant.

Doob said the test results show that these trends are ""very unlikely"" to have occurred simply by chance: The chance that these trends are random ranges from 0.7 to seven per cent.

Analyzing data allows statisticians to identify trends from what may seem to be unconnected events, he said.

""We have a consistent problem here,"" Doob said of the trend in Nunavut.

His analysis, he said, showed there's less than a one per cent chance that Nunavut's high rate since 1999, compared with the other three jurisdictions, is a fluke.

""Nunavut is the jurisdiction that stands out among the four,"" Doob said.

Officials cite high rates of violence, lack of funding

The RCMP in Nunavut and the Nunavut Justice Department denied CBC's interview request for this story but provided written statements.

Both pointed out Nunavut's high rates of violence as a factor in these statistics.

The RCMP said the combination of increasing calls for service, easy access to weapons and alcohol, and high rates of suicide make violent encounters between Nunavummiut and police a reality.

""The RCMP in Nunavut are successful in the de-escalation and safe conclusion of thousands of high-risk encounters every year,"" Cpl. Jamie Savikataaq said in an email.

Nunavut's Justice Department said such data analysis requires a review of historical experiences, crime rates and social indicators.

The department has struggled with adequate funding and resources to address the root causes of criminality and social inequality, director of policy Jessica Young wrote in an email.

Specifically, she referred to the lack of access to the federal government's First Nations Policing Program, which is run by Public Safety Canada to support culturally sensitive policing in Indigenous communities.

In a resignation letter addressed to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Sunday, Alleslev said she wanted to free herself to participate in the party's leadership race.

""The Conservative Party of Canada is in the process of choosing a new leader that will guide us through the nation's next chapter,"" Alleslev wrote.

""This is a decision that is too important for me to stand to the side.""

Today, Alleslev tweeted her support for MacKay, the former Progressive Conservative Party leader and cabinet minister in Stephen Harper's government.

Alleslev, who represents the riding of Aurora—Oak Ridges—Richmond Hill, was elected as a Liberal MP but crossed the floor and joined the Tories in 2018.

The former Royal Canadian Air Force member and business owner cited the Trudeau government's handling of the economy, tax reform and foreign affairs, along with ""inadequate"" military spending, as her reasons for crossing the floor.

One of MacKay's leadership rivals, Durham MP Erin O'Toole, was among the politicians who helped woo Alleslev to the Conservatives.

Scheer chose Alleslev as his deputy leader in November 2019 following a bruising defeat in the federal election, when the Conservatives failed to defeat a Liberal Party weakened by Justin Trudeau's blackface scandal.

Alleslev quickly caused a stir when, asked about Scheer refusing to march in Pride parades, she equated participating in Pride events with taking part in St. Patrick's Day parades.

In her resignation letter, Alleslev praised Scheer for his leadership and thanked him for the opportunity to hold the high-ranking position.

""In this role, you gave me the opportunity to influence the direction not only of our party but also of our country,"" Alleslev wrote.

""Together, our Conservative team has held the government to account and challenged them to address critical policy flaws that they had failed to consider or deliberately neglected.""

Four candidates are in the running to become the Conservative Party's next leader: MacKay, O'Toole, rookie MP for Hastings—Lennox and Addington Derek Sloan and Toronto lawyer Leslyn Lewis.

The party had planned to elect its new leader at a convention on June 27, but that plan was put on hold because of COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings.

Instead, Conservative Party members will vote by mail-in ballot by August 21.

MacKay campaign says no deal was made for endorsement

Should MacKay win, he'll have to appoint someone to lead the party in the House of Commons in his stead, as he does not currently have a seat.

Given Alleslev's past role within caucus, many asked whether she already has been tapped for that job.

MacKay's campaign said today that Alleslev wasn't promised a high-profile position in the House of Commons in exchange for supporting MacKay for the leadership.

""Absolutely not,"" MacKay campaign spokesman Chisholm Pothier said in an email.

""Those are decisions for once he's leader.""

Alleslev was billed by Scheer as sharing some valuable political qualities with the party's former deputy leader, Lisa Raitt — another female MP from a Greater Toronto Area seat.

Alleslev was held up as proof the party did still have support in the area and could win more in the next election.

MacKay's campaign said much the same about Alleslev on Monday.

""She's a great person to have supporting us. Served the country in the military, accomplished in her career after that and before politics, and was elected as a Conservative in a suburban Toronto riding, where very few did and we need to next election,"" Pothier said.",[]

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is embroiled in a new ethics investigation, and now there are revelations about members of his family receiving payment for their appearances at WE Charity events.

The close race followed a bitter campaign between Duda and Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski that was dominated by cultural issues. The government, state media and the influential Roman Catholic Church all mobilized in support of Duda and sought to stoke anti-Semitism, homophobia and xenophobia in order to shore up conservative support.

Duda celebrated what was seen as a mandate for him and the right-wing ruling party that backs him, Law and Justice, to continue on a path that has reduced poverty but raised concerns that democracy is under threat.

""It was a very sharp campaign, probably too sharp at times,"" Duda told supporters in Odrzywol, a town near Warsaw. ""If anyone is offended by my words, please forgive me. And give me the chance to improve in the next five years.""

Duda received slightly more than 51 per cent of Sunday's vote with 99.98 per cent of voting districts reporting, the state electoral commission said. Trzaskowski got slightly less than 49 per cent.

Duda told supporters in Odrzywol that he was grateful and moved by winning the support of more than 10 million voters. He said that with the race now over, it was time to turn to the difficult job of returning the country to strong growth after the economic blow of the coronavirus.

Liberal rival concedes

Trzaskowski conceded defeat and congratulated Duda. He thanked his supporters and said his strong showing would be the catalyst to fight to keep Poland from becoming a one-party state.

""This is just the beginning of the road,"" Trzaskowski said.

But Adam Michnik, a prominent anti-communist dissident and the founding editor of the liberal Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, said the result bodes badly for Poland's young democracy.

""Andrzej Duda's victory will be understood by his voters, and first of all by those in power, as a permission for the kind of politics that Law and Justice has been pursuing for almost five years, and that is a policy of the destruction of the democratic system, of isolating Poland in Europe, of homophobia, of xenophobia, nationalism and of using the Catholic Church as a tool,"" Michnik said.

""I would not even rule out a situation in which this policy is continued and we will see an attempt on the free media, culture and science, there could be another `Maidan,' "" he said, referring to the bloody 2014 pro-Europe protests in Ukraine.

Critics and human rights groups worry Duda's victory will boost illiberal tendencies at home and in the European Union, which has also struggled to halt an erosion of rule of law in Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

Orban posted a picture of himself on Facebook shaking hands with Duda in the Hungarian parliament with ""Bravo!"" and graphics of a hand showing a ""V"" for victory and a Polish flag.

Czech President Milos Zeman though a spokesman said: ""Long live Poland!""

Duda got an apparent endorsement from U.S. President Donald Trump with a last-minute White House invitation in late June. Trump praised Duda, saying: ""He's doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him.""

Sunday's vote was originally planned for May but was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Turnout was very high at 68.1 per cent, close to a record set in 1995, in a sign of the huge stakes for Poles.

Trzaskowski, a former European Parliament lawmaker who jumped into the race late, said he wanted to protect the country's democratic values and unite the divided society, while preserving the popular welfare policies. He represented the centrist opposition Civic Platform party, which held power from 2007 to 2015. It oversaw strong economic growth but is now blamed by many for allowing the gap to grow between the rich and poor.

Cash bonuses

Duda's campaign focused on defending traditional family values in the predominantly Catholic country of 38 million people, and on preserving social spending policies.

The party's policies include hugely popular monthly cash bonuses of 500 zlotys ($172 Cdn) per child to all families irrespective of income. They have helped alleviate poverty in rural regions, and given all families more money to spend.

Duda and the party, both in power since 2015, also solidified support among older Poles by lowering the retirement age and introducing a yearly cash bonus called a ""13th pension.""

Many credit Law and Justice, under party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, for making good on promises to reduce the economic inequality that came with the country's transition from communism to a market economy three decades ago. There is a strong sense among them that the economic help is restoring a sense of dignity to their lives after many decades of hardship caused by war, communism and the economic dislocations of capitalism.

The party has also stoked conflict with the EU with laws that have given it vast new powers over the top courts and judicial bodies. Officials in Brussels have repeatedly expressed concerns over the rule of law in both Poland and Hungary, which were for many years hailed as the most successful new democracies to emerge from behind the Iron Curtain.

Poland's populist politicians have in the past two years frequently used rhetoric discriminating against LGBT people and other minorities, and the party has turned public television into a propaganda tool used during the campaign to praise Duda and cast Trzaskowski in a negative light.

As the race tightened in recent weeks, Duda turned further to the right in search of votes. He denounced the LGBT rights movement as an ""ideology"" worse than communism.

Meanwhile, party leader Kaczynski denounced LGBT rights as a foreign import that threatens Polish identity.",[]

The Oxford English Dictionary definition of objective is ""to not be influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts.""

However, Candis Callison calls objectivity ""the view from nowhere"" and considers it potentially harmful. She has worked as a journalist in the United States and Canada for television, the internet and radio, including at the CBC. At CTV, she launched the first news and current affairs program focused on Indigenous issues. Callison now teaches at the University of British Columbia in two departments: in journalism, as well as in the Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies.

Here are some highlights from Callison's conversation with The Sunday Edition's host, Anthony Germain, condensed and edited for clarity.

Is it possible to be objective?

I would say it's really impossible since everyone comes from somewhere. That's not to say that you can't use good methods for evaluating evidence, for establishing facts. In terms of thinking you can adopt a view that doesn't include where you come from, I use one of my co-podcasters Kim TallBear 's shorthand all the time: ""We all have mud on our feet from somewhere.""

Oftentimes, how we think about what's true reflects where we're coming from, reflects our perspectives. And I think journalists really have a tall order and that they need to establish a sense of what happened from multiple perspectives.

The book is thinking about how journalism contributes to social orders by often repeating dominant narratives or dominant points of view, and that's one of the ways in which journalism can also cause harm. Harm in the profession of journalism has really only emerged in the last couple of decades, believe it or not. Thinking about minimizing harm has just made it into ethical codes.

How does objectivity contribute to harm?

Objectivity, [has been] interpreted in most newsrooms as a view from nowhere, as a way of not acknowledging your social location as a journalist, that there has been reporting on certain topics and certain communities in the past that may have caused harm.

Recognizing that the individual journalist has a view from somewhere, and that journalism has been doing all kinds of work in the past, allows you to have clarity about what you're contributing as a journalist, about whose social order you're maintaining.

It's been a very interesting few weeks on social media. And especially on Twitter, where you have Indigenous journalists and Black journalists talking about what's happened to them in the newsroom. Those kinds of narratives really illustrate the ways in which journalism is absolutely a work of interpretation, and recognizing journalism as contributing to a social order is a first step in seeing it as a tool that might do good in the world.

How many times have journalists been sent out the door to cover a story with a sense already of what they think the story is, why they think it's news and why they think it should be covered?

Indigenous journalists, in particular, Black journalists as well have been saying this, that when they go to cover a story or an issue related to their community, they're seen to be having bias when, in fact, what they have is a form of expertise. - Candis Callison

How would reporters go about ""locating"" themselves?

That's, I think, something that requires a certain amount of experimentation. There's a lot of possibilities for thinking about how to situate yourself and whether or not that informs what your story is going to be and who you search out. And I think one of the most important aspects of locating yourself is recognizing that, in some areas, you're going to have expertise.

If you think about some of the narratives on Twitter that are coming from Indigenous journalists, in particular, Black journalists as well have been saying this, that when they go to cover a story or an issue related to their community, they're seen to be having bias when, in fact, what they have is a form of expertise.

There's a limit to how much you can put yourself in, but when you begin to think in terms of your place in society, what your relative privilege is, what social orders have benefited you and where they have not benefited you, I think this is where you're thinking about a news story. [It] shouldn't just be about a news story as an event, but how it's an intersection of systems and structures.

The work I see that's transformational is really when journalists are recognizing that they are located somewhere, and that makes them accountable in particular ways.

What social media platforms have ushered in is a sort of a real time response to when journalists get it wrong, when there are ethical missteps. - Candis Callison

You cited a Gallup poll that shows audiences perceive more bias in mainstream media…

We quote that because we're also trying to recognize that audiences have driven a lot of the change in how journalists think about themselves. I mean, what social media platforms have ushered in is a sort of a real time response to when journalists get it wrong, when there are ethical missteps. The bias poll is super-interesting in that I think audiences recognize that journalists are coming from somewhere. The next questions would be about which media you trust, which media you find credible and why you find them credible.

One of the great books this year on journalism is by Desmond Cole , talking about his experience working at The Toronto Star, what it is to be a Black journalist and how it is that objectivity props up white supremacy.

Where and how do we draw the line between activism and journalism?

This is a super-interesting question. When I first did research, it was about climate change and it was about the way that journalists and scientists have struggled with how to both maintain professional roles related to objectivity, related to providing information to society.

I came up with this notion of near advocacy as a way of talking about how they navigated their position ethically as journalists, and as scientists, on an issue where action needed to happen. And so how do you begin to think about advocacy in relation to communities that have been misrepresented, not represented or harmfully represented?

There's, again, this long scholarship that talks about how media has in particular represented Indigenous communities quite badly and caused a lot of harm right up until the present. If you look at how media reported on Tina Fontaine's death, a 15-year-old girl in Manitoba who suffered in the foster care system: that wasn't the first thing that the media reported on. They didn't use it as a way to open up the way that the foster care system had failed this young girl, and really engaged in some victim blaming. And some news organizations were called out on Twitter. So I think we have to really think again about having clarity about whose social order you're contributing to and how you're repeating dominant perspectives and a dominant narrative.

Edmonton short story writer and novelist Lynn Coady — who won the Scotiabank Giller Prize in 2013 for novel Hellgoing — is originally from Nova Scotia. Coady finds the funny and the absurd in family life — and both are front and centre in her latest novel, Watching You Without Me. It's about a woman named Karen who, after the death of her mother, goes back home to Nova Scotia to care for Kelli, her sister, who is disabled and requires a caregiver.

The work of a caregiver

""I grew up in Cape Breton. When I was a kid, my parents were in a situation where they had to look after my aging grandparents. At first, they would come up from Margaree every summer to stay with us in Port Hawkesbury. They stayed down in our basement. They would also bring my uncle, who was developmentally disabled — like the character Kelli in the book — and who always needed care.

When I was a kid, my parents were in a situation where they had to look after my aging grandparents.

""My grandfather died when I was about 14. My grandmother was with us a lot longer and almost made it to 100. She was home with us the whole time, along with my uncle who needed somebody with him all the time. It wasn't always easy. My dad had a bitterness about the fact that we couldn't take vacations or go anywhere due to this caregiver situation. Sometimes, I wondered why it had to be the way it was.""

A time to care

""When my parents retired, they moved to Dartmouth. They now have caregivers coming in regularly and, these days, there's a little bit more access to that kind of help. I started writing Watching You Without Me around the time my brother and I were giving each other those looks, understanding that it's going to be on us now as our parents are in decline.

""It's a sad stage that we all get to. My mind just started going to a dark place because I didn't want to think about all the ramifications of the situation. I thought I'd write a scary novel as a result — perhaps to find a nice metaphor for everything that scared me at this stage of life.""

Caregiving benefits

""Kelli was the character who got me through writing the book, which wasn't fun to write at times. People would ask me what my book was about, and I felt I couldn't reduce it to being about infirmity, death, grieving and housework — even though that's what the book is about! But then I would think about Kelli and I loved her as a character. I feel incredible affection toward her in the same way I feel toward my uncle, who is very similar.

In the book, Karen is regretting the idea that she convinced herself that caregiving is a way of cancelling yourself out.

""In the book, Karen is regretting the idea that she convinced herself that caregiving is a way of cancelling yourself out. What she's starting to realize, now that she's spending time with Kelli, is caregiving can be incredibly rewarding, and it's a way of being human. She's been denying herself, for all of her adulthood, and telling herself that's bad. To bond with Kelli feels good.

""This is, in a way, awful because she's denied herself that her entire adulthood. She's denied herself a relationship with her mother.""

As the pandemic continues, questions have persisted and evolved, as Canadians mull their approaches to summer activities and plans for returning to school.

Dr. Susy Hota, director at the University Health Network in Toronto, and Dr. Srinivas Murthy, a pediatric critical care and infectious diseases specialist in Vancouver, have reconvened the COVID-19 AMA panel.

Here are some of their responses for listeners and guest host Rosemary Barton.

Is it safe to go back to school?

After months of at-home schooling and taking courses online, a limited number of students returned to class part-time in June.

Tamara Maxim of Burnaby, B.C., is a school teacher herself and had a lot of questions about what classrooms will look like this September.

""I was in schools. I was with kids. I've seen how it went. I experienced a lot of discomfort but being mandated to do what I needed to do by my school district,"" she said.

According to Murthy, who is a parent and a pediatrician, every region's community-level spread will help determine when or whether it will be safe to go back to five-day classes at full capacity for students and staff.

Even if a region sees ""a reasonably flat curve,"" he said there will be many things to decide, including how far students will need to sit apart, how to protect adult staff who are immuno-compromised and whether further accommodations may require major renovations on school grounds.

""Fundamentally, I think it's a priority to get kids back in school … from the parents' perspective and their perspective. We just need to make sure all of those things are lined up as much as possible,"" he said.

Should I be worried about surface transmission?

Robert Brewster from Vancouver Island asked about concerns about surface transmission — specifically, whether liquor stores are justified in limiting or cancelling their empty bottle return policies.

Many Canadians have furiously wiped down and sanitized high-traffic surfaces at their homes like doorknobs and even packaged goods in their grocery hauls amid fears that the coronavirus may survive in a transmissible state on various surfaces.

But on Thursday, the World Health Organization said there have been ""no specific reports"" of COVID-19 directly from contact with contaminated surfaces.

""I think the risk of recycling, specifically, is incredibly low from you to your recycler,"" said Murthy.

Should I be worried about airborne transmission?

Loretta Amundsen from Georgina, Ont., is one of many Canadians with questions about whether COVID-19 can spread via airborne transmission.

She expressed worries about having friends over to her house, which has a lakeside dock and deck if the breeze from the swift water current might also be carrying the virus.

More than 230 scientists signed an open letter in early July calling on WHO to declare the virus can be spread through the air. The UN agency has resisted this, saying that while there is some evidence emerging, none of it is definitive.

Dr. Susy Hota is the medical director for infection prevention and control at University Health Network in Toronto. (Submitted by Susy Hota)

Hota said that as it's currently understood, transmission via smaller droplets known as aerosols ""are not the main driver"" of infections. Further, she said that if some of the fears about airborne transmission were founded, indoor infection rates in particular would likely be much higher than they currently are.

She added that as long as everyone maintains physical distance guidelines outside, the flurry of air currents should protect them against infection rather than present a threat.

How strict is my social bubble?

As municipalities gradually reopen their economies, Bernice Chaplin of Toronto wondered how difficult it will be to maintain their social bubbles.

""Some of use are going to daycare or getting a haircut, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you can be in the bubble if you are doing those things,"" she said.

Hota advised people to be as aware of what others in their social bubble may be doing as possible and inform others of what they are doing themselves in return.

Hota added that as reports of community transmission goes down, people may begin to think about slowly increasing the size of their bubbles.

""I think it's more about how responsibly people are behaving, right. You have to be able to trust those in your bubble that they're doing what they need to be doing,"" she said.

How to keep safe in public washrooms?

Dr. Bruce Aylward, who led WHO's COVID-19 mission in China, expressed concerns about using a public washroom on Checkup back in March.

Checkup listener Barbara Finlayson was similarly concerned about possible hot spots, especially high-powered hand blow dryers and toilets without seat covers.

""It's a tough question,"" said Hota. ""You don't really know who's been in there or what the situation is.""

She recommended following the usual protective measures, such as thorough handwashing and avoiding contact with as many surfaces as possible.

She advised paper towels for hand-drying over blow dryers.

""If you happen to be in a washroom with one of those old-school towel-pull type dryers, I would avoid that by all means,"" she added.

Mathematicians, physicists, materials experts and a barista have joined forces to improve our lives by figuring out how to brew a more consistent cup of espresso.

Christopher Hendon from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon in Eugene and his colleagues were interested in improving their favourite beverage. They'd previously studied water chemistry in coffee and the science of grinding coffee beans.

Espresso with a shot of math. (Christopher Hendon)

In their latest study, they challenged current espresso wisdom, in particular, the idea that using a very fine grind and lots of beans results in a desirable drink. Hendon's team found that this technique is unpredictable and difficult to reproduce with any consistency, meaning that making espresso taste exactly the same from one cup to another is next to impossible.

Paper in Matter

What the team found was that grinding as fine as possible, then adding a lot of hot water under pressure tends to lead to tightly packed clumps of coffee in the espresso basket that water doesn't penetrate. As a result, there's little extraction of coffee flavours from the coffee in these clumps.

This not only wastes coffee, it creates variation in taste as some grounds are brewed and some are missed entirely.

Hendon making sure the math is right. (Christopher Hendon)

Espresso gets a shot of math

After a lot of modelling and many shots of espresso, this team came up with a recipe that succeeds in both maximizing extraction yields and producing a cup of espresso that tastes similar cup after cup.

They used a coarser grind, and despite using a smaller amount of coffee and less water, were able to increase the extraction yield and make the flavour more consistent from cup to cup.

Bolsonaro confirmed on Tuesday he tested positive for the virus, as the country topped 1.7 million confirmed cases — the second highest in the world, behind only the United States.

The Brazilian president has been dismissive and even mocking of COVID-19, at one point calling it ""a little flu.""

Muggah, co-founder and director of think-tank Igarapé Institute based in Rio de Janeiro, said Bolsonaro's administration was already on the verge of collapse before the pandemic hit.

Here's part of his conversation with Day 6 guest host Peter Armstrong.

Do you think there's a chance, a possibility, that President Bolsonaro might have a change of heart or a change in his approach to the pandemic now that he's tested positive?

I wish there would be, but I'm afraid there's virtually no chance that he's going to change course.

This is a president who thrives on disunity, polarization and volatility and has, in fact, managed to sustain his leadership by continuing in this form of governance.

So despite having contracted COVID-19, which was really expected by virtually everybody, I don't expect to see him change course one iota.

There is even that moment when he was addressing the press, when he announced that his test result was positive, and then he stepped back and sort of took off his mask. What did you think when you saw him do that?

The president delights, like perhaps other pandemic populists around the world, in exciting his base and essentially frustrating his liberal opponents.

And I think that gesture was calculated and planned to set off a firestorm among the media — the liberal media, the fake news, as he calls it — [to] keep another media cycle rolling, focused more on his antics than on the pandemic or the crimes that he is standing accused of committing.

How are most Brazilians feeling about or reacting to the president's behaviour?

It's a really tough question. So right now in Brazil, roughly 30 per cent of the country stands behind him. The majority of the country does not support him.

We've seen his support, especially among the middle and the centre-right, declining. And that decline's accelerated since the pandemic.

So right now, I think people are frustrated. The media, including the more centrist, even the right-leaning media, has turned against him. Parties across the spectrum are increasingly consolidating at one level to try to push him out of power.

There are more than 48 impeachment requests right now for him to be ousted. And there's a general sense of frustration on the street that we're seeing increasingly with protests mounting around the country.

But with that 30 per cent that stands behind him, have they doubled down, or is that support bleeding as well?

No, there's a sense that that support if anything, it's intensifying. This is a base that didn't come out of nowhere. This has been a group, mostly middle class, often white, even some upper class or upper-middle class who have been cultivated over the last decade or so by Bolsonaro and his supporters, and formed a really hardcore and quite united alliance.

They've been fed a systemic and sustained stream of misinformation through something that's been described as the hate cabinet, which is being run and orchestrated by the president's youngest son Carlos for which he now stands accused of committing hate crimes.

(Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty Images)

So this is a group that has been fed a steady stream of vitriol, including related to COVID-19 and who are even coming onto the streets and, in some cases, invading hospitals at the bequest of the president's sons in defence of the president.

The president understands that he's got this support, many of whom also, by the way, are associated with the police and the military and is seeking to agitate them, to bolster his own support.

Back in May, before we even saw this positive COVID test, you had said that Bolsonaro and his government could be the first to be toppled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Why is that? What do you see there?

You know, I think that this has been building for a while. It's important to recall that Bolsonaro is the democratically elected leader of Brazil. He garnered over 50 per cent of the vote in the second round.

What's happened in the last couple of months is … not just a massive health crisis, making Brazil the second worst affected country in the planet, but it's also facing a really searing economic crisis.

So while some big businesses have done reasonably well out of this, including the soy industries and the cattle industries in Brazil, most Brazilians are really suffering.

And then finally, you've got a political crisis, which is really embroiling the entire Bolsonaro family. At the centre of it, of course, is the president.

But his three sons, who are also elected officials, are each of them involved in accusations and charges of impropriety and criminal activity.

What is the risk that Bolsonaro's positive COVID test might actually end up distracting from the seriousness of all those other investigations?

I do think that this COVID-19 diagnosis, in a way, marks the beginning of the end of what I think counts as one of the most chaotic administrations in Brazilian history.

I think it underlines, in a way, the recklessness, the incompetence [of the government's response] and in fact, the pervasiveness of this virus. And that's a reality, I think, that's starting to sink in across Brazil.

If you talk to most Brazilians today in the street, especially in the north and northeast, which have been more dramatically hit than the wealthier southern part of the country, virtually everybody has a story of a relative or friend who's contracted the disease and may have come close to dying or has died.

And the fact that their own president is one of just four leaders globally who's contracted it, I think is just essentially driving home the point that this is not something to be taken lightly.

A photo of a cormorant diving into a school of sardines has won the grand prize at the 2020 Audubon Photography Awards, to the shock of the photographer who says she didn't set out to capture the sea bird's image that day.

Joanna Lentini, who specializes in underwater and aerial outdoor adventure photography, travelled to Bay of La Paz, Mexico, from her home in Greenwood Lake, N.Y., last November.

She was leading a group trip to encounter and photograph the California sea lions that use that area on the Baja Peninsula to mate, give birth and rest.

""The sardines and the cormorants was quite a bit of a surprise. I had seen the sardines before, and I had seen the cormorants but hadn't seen the two together underwater,"" Lentini told As it Happens guest host Nil Köksal.

""A lot of it was just being patient [and] understanding the way that the light was falling on the underwater terrain.""

'It kept pulling me back'

The school of sardines was so thick that at times Lentini was surrounded and couldn't see anything, she said.

But Lentini captured the winning image on the last dive of the trip, just as the others were telling her it was time to go.

""It kept pulling me back,"" she said. ""I kind of, you know, turned around for another moment and then captured it, and it was just so special.""

Lentini said she had a sense in the moment that this particular image was a memorable one.

""There's rare moments where you're, like, 'Wow, this is a great shot.'""

""It's basically a bird turning into a fish. It's quite amazing, and something that I have always wanted to document.""

Nevertheless, Lentini said she was surprised to learn her image had won the prestigious award.

""It was the first time I was entering the competition, and I think it was the only image that I entered.""

Unfortunately for the double-crested cormorants, the quest for a meal was unsuccessful.

""It was really interesting because you would see the cormorants hunting … occasionally a sea lion would zip by trying to nip at its feathers. And these poor birds, they're so hungry, and I didn't see one bird capture a fish. I felt for them.""

The Audubon Photography Awards, now in its 11th year, is run by the U.S.-based National Audubon Society, which uses research, advocacy and education to call attention to threats to bird habitats.

The contest honours ""the ingenuity, resilience and beauty of birds,"" according to a statement on the organization's website, while also celebrating some of the photographers who work hard to capture them in their natural environments.

""I think, as photographers … it's quite lonely and, you know, especially with wildlife photographers. So, yeah, this little bit of recognition is quite nice.""

Lamont Dozier shares true stories behind Motown hits,"['Cbc Radio', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Motown defined the sound of the 1960s and produced some of the most powerful hits of the era. Lamont Dozier, named one of the greatest songwriters of all time by Rolling Stone, is one of the minds behind those songs.

Dozier first hit it big as a part of Motown's in-house songwriting team known as Holland-Dozier-Holland, who co-wrote You Can't Hurry Love, Heat Wave, Baby Love and dozens more.

In his new memoir, titled How Sweet It Is, Dozier remembers the inspiration for those songs. He joined q guest host Talia Schlanger to share some of those stories.

The Supremes, Stop! In the Name of Love

The first time the words ""stop in the name of love"" came out of Dozier's mouth, he was at a motel where he was ""being a little naughty."" When his main squeeze found out, she showed up at the motel to confront him.

""Well, she found out where I was and was knocking on the door, loud and shouting about who was it that I was with in this motel. I let her in after the other girl left, going out the back door,"" said Dozier.

""She came in and naturally I lied about it, saying I was there sleeping. ... I finally said, 'Please, there's nothing happening here and nothing is going on. Please, just stop in the name of love.' And she said, 'What? That's not funny.' I said, 'Wait a minute, did you hear what I said? Stop in the name of love. Did you hear the cash register?'""

Dozier's line in the motel would become the inspiration for Stop! In the Name of Love, one of 10 number one hits he co-wrote for the Supremes and the group's first number one song on the pop charts.

Four Tops, Bernadette

The song Bernadette by the Four Tops was also inspired by a real person from Dozier's life — a girl he knew from school when he was about 11 years old.

""She was my first muse, you might say. She was an Italian girl and a beautiful Italian girl, and I fell in love with her. You know, puppy love,"" said Dozier.

""She was somebody I remembered every time I sat down to write a song. And in later years, I thought about her, and the way I felt, and I was able to conjure up those feelings to write other songs, thinking about Bernadette. She was very instrumental in a lot of love songs.""

Martha and the Vandellas, Nowhere to Run

In his memoir, Dozier talks about writing the song Nowhere to Run by Martha and the Vandellas after attending a going-away party for a man who'd been drafted and was shipping off to Vietnam.

""That night, this friend of a friend of mine had this young guy who was being shipped over in the Vietnam War,"" Dozier told Schlanger. ""He was frightened about it. He had a premonition of sorts and he felt like he wouldn't be coming back.""

""And so I was trying to make him feel better and give him all kind of inspiration about being positive and whatnot. ... He was gone a couple of months, six months or something like that, and sure enough, on the battlefield, he was killed. I was just really destroyed by it because he was so afraid.""

Dozier's new memoir, How Sweet It Is: A Songwriter's Reflections on Music, Motown and the Mystery of the Muse, is out now.

""My family would go to our friend's cabin in the summertime; there's a picture of me doing the dishes with one hand and reading a Harry Potter book with the other.

""The first book that had an impact on me, in terms of the style that I like reading today, was this book. It was the first book that revealed my love of out-of-the-box narration and poetic writing styles. That's a theme through so many of the books that I find myself loving. Just like with Small Game Hunting at the Local Coward Gun Club, the narrative style in this book is not just the 'beginning, middle and end.'

The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell

""It's a unique narrative style where it bounces between past and present. And I've never before read a book where the book opens telling you everybody is going to die — and yet you go through the entire book and you fall in love with every single character. It breaks your heart when they're gone.

This book questioned being a religious person in such an open, beautiful, nonjudgmental and non dogmatic way. - Alayna Fender

""The whole book is a feat. The style of the writing was incredible to me. But then, also on a more personal note, it's an exploration of religion. I'm a member of the LGBTQ community and I grew up in a very religious place. There was a point in my life where I had a lot of anger toward religion.

""This was a book that softened that anger because it explored spirituality and questions of morality. This book questioned being a religious person in such an open, beautiful, nonjudgmental and non-dogmatic way. That's one of the reasons this book has a really special place in my heart.""

The kitchen has remained open for takeout orders, and after Ontario moved to Stage 2 of the reopening process, he's been able to add a few tables to the patio.

But Hynes said revenue has been ""decimated"" to about 20 per cent of normal levels — and the federal government's attempts to support businesses have fallen far short of his expectations.

""It's not helpful. It's not even close to being enough,"" he told Checkup.

Hynes has kept a skeleton crew of full-time workers thanks to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS).

What grade do you give the Trudeau government on COVID-19? Have your say Sunday on Cross Country Checkup.

The Auld Spot's patio has been open for business since Ontario started to ease restrictions for public spaces, but owner Nathan Hynes says revenue is still down to about 20 per cent of a normal season. (The Auld Spot/Toronto)

But the longer the pandemic goes on, the less certain his future — and the future of thousands of small businesses across Canada — becomes.

""Two thousand dollars a month to give somebody to live on in Toronto, when the average price of a one-bedroom apartment is $2,100, is obscene,"" he said of the CERB.

Hynes said the government made two ""major, major blunders"": first, by waiting until May to introduce the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program.

He's thankful that his landlord applied for the rent relief program but said he knows many other merchants whose landlords did not do the same.

Second, he argues that the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA), which offers up to $40,000, should be a bailout rather than a loan.

As a loan, Hynes said, business owners are simply given a lifeline of a few weeks to a month at a time, doing little to ease fears of bankruptcy looming beyond the horizon.

""Shouldn't the bank have to take some sacrifice? Shouldn't all these big businesses with these wealthy shareholders and billions of dollars of profit — they don't have to suffer? While I'm at risk of losing my home?"" he said.

""Frankly, it shows the absurdity of the Western economic culture.""

Rent relief 'a tremendous administrative process': landlord

Michael Cooper, president of a Toronto-based office and residential developer called Dream, has used the CECRA program to help offset a portion of the rent for his tenants, which include commercial properties.

He calls the process of applying for rent relief, which includes absorbing 25 per cent of the rent from his clients, ""a tremendous administrative process,"" but he's happy to do it.

""These are really tough situations, and it's not their [tenants'] fault. So I'm really pleased that they're getting support,"" he said.

Michael Cooper is president and CRO of DREAM, an office and residential developer. He says the government’s CECRA rent relief program worked out well for him and his tenants. (Submitted by Michael Cooper)

According to business advocates and even the federal government's own numbers, landlords like Cooper are in the minority.

As of June 8, Ottawa had paid out $39 million in rent relief. That's less than two per cent of the nearly $3 billion the Department of Finance budgeted for the program.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has repeatedly warned that the government's actions may either come too late or not provide enough to save small and medium-sized businesses that have closed their doors — often by provincial orders.

Cooper said he gives the federal government a ""so-so"" grade for its COVID-19 response. He acknowledges that putting everything together so quickly is hard and wonders if there's a more direct way to allocate the money.

But he also worries that the longer the pandemic goes on, the more difficult it will be for governments to get the money.

Artists continue to wait for green light

As a musician with no fixed business address, Renee Cingolani said she and her husband, who works in construction, wouldn't be able to survive without the CERB.

Her jobs included directing theatre productions and performing music at weddings, as well as teaching music from out of her home near Barrie, Ont. They all stopped ""almost instantly"" in March, she said.

""It is terrifying.... CERB is not close to what I would be making in my job. We've also had to use our savings to cover our daily bills and mortgage costs.""

Cingolani gives the federal government credit for the support it's introduced so far, considering how quickly the pandemic upended people's daily routines.

""I don't think there's any way they could have planned for a situation like this. I do feel like they've done a pretty adequate job considering they, too, are flying by the seat of their pants,"" she said.

But she's worried how much longer she'll be able to go on, as the arts and entertainment sector remains a low priority for the economy's gradual reopening.

Reassurances ring hollow

Hynes is less forgiving. He said he would give the government a D grade for its overall pandemic response.

He upgraded that to a C only when compared to the United States, whose case numbers have skyrocketed as some districts reopen their economies while flouting health officials' recommendations.

Reassurances from public figures have rung hollow, as his and other businesses worry they're hanging on by a thread.

""Doug Ford making the cheesecake. John Tory sitting on the patio. Trudeau looking us into the eyes and telling me he's got my back, that we're the backbone of the economy. And then all the actions proving otherwise,"" Hynes said.

80,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/from-geronimo-to-avatar-wes-studi-s-path-to-historic-oscar-1.5333577,From Geronimo to Avatar: Wes Studi's path to historic Oscar,"['Kyle Muzyka', 'Posted', 'Oct', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Originally published on October 25, 2019.

Cherokee actor Wes Studi's favourite role he's played so far is ""the next one.""

Despite being in the business for more than 30 years, Studi is far from slowing down. In fact, he's about to make history.

On Oct. 27, Studi will become the first Indigenous actor to receive an honorary Oscar for his body of work, from cult classics to Academy Award winners.

Studi has appeared in films like Powwow Highway, Dances with Wolves, The Last of the Mohicans and Mystery Men, but acting wasn't his first job.

When he was 14, he asked his parents to send him to Chilocco Indian School, the same one his dad had attended.

It was there he saw the National Guard, and he felt compelled the join in his senior year. ""I would see all the girls come out and just start checking them out,"" Studi said. ""[I thought], 'Hey, those guys marching around in uniforms are kind of cool to those girls.'""

'War ... changed my view of life in the U.S.A.'

After graduating, he stopped attending meetings and training camps for the National Guard. But during the height of the Vietnam War, Studi was thrust into action and activated into the army. The idea of going to war excited him, he said.

""There's truth to the fact that war is hell, and I think I saw the worst in men and the best in men,"" he said. ""It certainly changed my view of life in the U.S.A., and a lot of it had to do with the fact that Vietnamese people, they're brown like us.""

He and another Indigenous person serving spoke frequently about their conflicting feelings. That man later died by suicide in Vietnam, Studi said.

It didn't change him, but Studi said those conversations and the death of his friend kickstarted an awakening.

After returning from the war, Studi said he spent time adjusting to life at home. He later joined the American Indian Movement's 1972 protest at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C., and was at Wounded Knee the following year.

This turn to activism is often painted as a response to what he experienced in Vietnam, but Studi said that wasn't the case. ""What I was involved in in Vietnam, I wouldn't give that up,"" he said. ""I learned something there.""

But activism was also something Studi felt proud to be a part of. ""You feel like you are doing something that is bigger than yourself,"" he said. ""It's a good thing to feel like you are doing the right thing, that you're on the right side of history, that what you're saying is true.""

Next adrenaline rush

Always searching for the next adrenaline rush, Studi eventually turned to acting, where he saw some similarities to his experiences in combat.

""What if I fail? What if I mess up somebody else's lines? It's almost like I'm not watching this guy's back, like I would in combat,"" he said. ""Performing in front of an audience is, at first, one of the scariest things in the world and overcoming that fear produces that adrenaline that my mind or body craved at the time.""

His breakthrough role, playing the Toughest Pawnee in Dances with Wolves, was one of the first movies to portray Indigenous people with a level of empathy that landed in the mainstream. It spun into a five-year stretch where filmmakers were interested in more than what the American Indian had typically brought to films.

""There was an effort made by filmmakers to humanize the character of the American Indian,"" he said. ""Some films did it and some didn't. But everybody was at least trying.""

With that brief heightened interest, he and a few of the other Indigenous actors in Los Angeles would often see each other competing for the same roles. Once that interest slowed, Studi would audition for parts not linked to his Indigeneity. He landed one as Sphinx in Mystery Men.

People of colour landing roles not rooted in race is something Studi noticed wasn't happening enough at the time.

""We need a lot more of those kinds of things and in show business right now,"" he said.

Throughout his many, many roles, Studi has always been proud of who he is. In 2017, on stage at the Oscars, Studi spoke Cherokee to the crowd. It wasn't a political statement, or something he felt he needed to do. It felt normal for him.

""I think it was very ordinary for me to speak Cherokee on that stage,"" he said. ""A lot of Indians appreciated the fact that they heard a language other than English or European language that came from that stage.""

He hopes that speech, and many of his movies, will make a difference for the next generation of Indigenous kids who are watching.

""There's a certain validation of our existence when something like that happens,"" Studi said. ""I know as a youngster it certainly did me no harm to see somebody who was a real Indian play the Indian.

""I just hope he's not watching Powwow Highway.""",[]

While we might feel like we can't remember enough, there's nothing wrong with relying on technology, says researcher Evan Risko.

""Most of us are familiar with the experience of forgetting and it can be frustrating at times,"" the University of Waterloo associate professor told Spark host Nora Young.

""The fact that we forget is likely a functional part of our cognitive system. Storing all the information we ever encounter would be difficult to manage.""

There was once a time when everyone knew their friends' phone numbers — now, many trust a device more than themselves, leaving some experts to wonder if this ""information offloading"" is making their memory and information control worse.

The fear of technology replacing human functions is valid, says Risko, who is also the Canada research chair in embodied and embedded cognition.

""Anytime there's been kind of massive changes in the technological environment, we've seen concern.

""[But] it doesn't mean that it's going to turn out badly. I think it should motivate us to be careful, as we should [be].""

Brains are not computers

“Our memory is fragile and imperfect in many ways,” says Evan Risko, University of Waterloo associate professor. (Wikipedia)

In his book Scatterbrain: How the Mind's Mistakes Make Humans Creative, Innovative, and Successful, neuroscientist Henning Beck argues our brains — to be as efficient as possible — are constantly dumping and rearranging information.

Rather than being an endless storage space, he compares the brain to an orchestra: our brain cells interact with each other like musicians.

""It is about creating that specific memory at this very moment, just like [how] an orchestra creates music at that very moment … [it's] not stored anywhere,"" he said to Young.

Accordingly, Risko says human brains can often be faulty.

""Our memory is fragile and imperfect in many ways,"" he said.

""And writing things down, or storing them in some sort of digital memory, gives us the advantage of a highly accurate memory store.""

Benefits and disadvantages of offloading

But technology is susceptible to manipulation, he notes.

In an experiment at the Cognition and Natural Behaviour Laboratory at the University of Waterloo, researchers gave participants an external storage tool, such as a word processor, as an aid to memorize a list of words.

On the last trial, the researchers changed some of the information the participants had recorded to see if they would notice — and they didn't.

Navigational aids can also impair spatial memory, with users blindly following their GPS rather than looking at landmarks or buildings, according to Risko.

""If I follow a route using these types of technologies if I'm then I have to follow that route again without it I won't be as fast. I won't remember as many scenes from the route that I travelled,"" said Risko.

""[But] we should weigh that against the benefits. I know if I didn't have GPS … I wouldn't get to half the places I was going [to].""

Diana Fu is a China expert at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. (Submitted by Diana Fu)

Hong Kongers have participated in waves of emigration before, in response to actions on the mainland. One wave came after the harsh crackdown on the 1989 protests, and another around the 1997 handover, where the United Kingdom transferred the former colony to China.

The new security law went into effect on July 1. It has the potential to curtail freedom of speech and ability to protest — not only in Hong Kong, but for Hong Kongers living anywhere in the world.

Already, there are reports of immigraton consultants seeing their case numbers double.

Countries like Australia and the United Kingdom are anticipating a new wave of emigration from the city, and are setting up policies that could allow them an easier path to residency and citizenship. Fortune magazine called Hong Kongers ""the world's most sought-after emigrants.""

The Sunday Edition's guest host, Anthony Germain, is a former China correspondent for the CBC. He talked to Diana Fu, associate professor in political science at the University of Toronto about why Hong Kongers would choose to leave and the impact that might have on the city.

Here are some highlights from their conversation with The Sunday Edition's host, Anthony Germain, condensed and edited for clarity.

How is the Hong Kong business community reacting to this law set by Beijing?

Beijing has very successfully been co-opting the business community by and by in Hong Kong. And it's done so with a combination of carrots and sticks. As far as the sticks — Beijing has warned the heads of big banks like HSBC that they would lose businesses from their Chinese banking customers if they did not support the new security law. They've also warned airlines, such as Cathay Pacific, and accounting firms that these companies need to keep their employees from joining the pro-democracy movement. So these are the sticks that have been used to co-op the business community.

But there's also carrots, right? Chinese companies from the mainland are expanding their businesses in Hong Kong. They're bringing in lots of investment capital. It's unclear if these expansions of Chinese companies are directly orchestrated by Beijing. In fact, there's no clear evidence of that. But it certainly does bode well for securing Hong Kong's financial status in the future. So even if there were worries about any sort of brain drain from Hong Kong, Beijing promises to replenish any brain drain that might be caused by potential mass exodus.

For those of us who are old enough, in the post-Tiananmen era, we remember these waves of immigration. And I think that's the time when a lot of Hong Kongers managed to obtain Canadian passports. What's the likelihood that we're going to see that kind of immigration from Hong Kong again, given what's happening right now?

So currently, we know that there are five jurisdictions prepared to receive emigrants from Hong Kong — these are the United Kingdom, the United States, Taiwan, Australia and Japan. Unsurprisingly, among these jurisdictions, the U.K. has gone the furthest in terms of providing a pathway to citizenship. There is a historical reason for this, which is that Hong Kong used to be a British colony. When Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, there was a mass exodus of people from there to all different kinds of places, including the U.K. The British government actually gave passports to [people from] Hong Kong.

There are 350,000 active holders of what's called BNO, British National (Overseas) passports in Hong Kong, and the British government has vowed to provide a pathway to citizenship for these people.

Canada actually has one of the world's largest Hong Kong diaspora communities. It's second only to the U.S. In 1997, when Hong Kong was handed back to China, tens of thousands of Hong Kongers emigrated to Vancouver and many have returned to Hong Kong after getting Canadian citizenship. Although Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has publicly welcomed Hong Kong Canadians to come back, Ottawa has yet to grant any special accommodations to asylum seekers from there.

This might sound a bit crass, but can some countries capitalize on this to get some extremely talented immigrants? Because I can sense there's probably a tension in Canada: do we really want to pick another fight with China? On the other hand, if other countries are going to poach some of these great minds and people who want to leave the place anyway, maybe Canada will miss out?

It's an interesting angle, because certainly the Western media has made a big deal about this possible brain drain from Hong Kong. And it has called Hong Kongers the world's most desirable immigrants, precisely because of their relative wealth, their education level and their skills. It remains to be seen exactly how large this exodus will be and how much of a windfall, as you put it, that countries who are receiving Hong Kong immigrants will actually get.

From Beijing's perspective, they're well prepared for this possible brain drain. They have a vision for Hong Kong — to be even more prosperous and stable than it was before.

I don't know if you've heard of this thing called the Greater Bay Area. It sounds like the San Francisco Bay Area, but it's actually an area that the Chinese government has proposed, which consists of an economic zone in south China, that would include Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province. These are some of the country's most economically vibrant and open regions in southern China. The government's goal is to develop a world class urban cluster that could rival global cities like San Francisco, New York or Tokyo.

For a long time, Andrea Chiu wanted to talk about race with her white wife, Helena, but it was hard to do.

""For people of colour, it's emotional,"" says Chiu. ""But when we talk about race among other people who are not racialized, I find they are really resistant. It's not about the personal, it's anything but personal. The thinking, from my experience, is 'but I'm a good person. I have Black friends, I have Asian friends, I'm not the racist.'""

So when Chiu started listening to Ijeoma Oluo's book So You Want to Talk About Race on audiobook, she saw an opportunity.

""Every chapter, I would kind of talk to myself, like 'yes, that's so resonant!' Or, 'so-and-so in my life did that,' says Chiu, who put the audiobook on during a road trip with her wife. ""She [Helena] had the exact same experience.""

Listening to the book with Helena helped the two connect by teaching them how to talk about race.

Having the conversation

Chiu (right) and her wife used the book So You Want To Talk About Race to help ease misunderstandings on ethnicity and the way people of colour are treated. (Submitted by Andrea Chiu)

""We were learning about the proper vocabulary to talk about race. The definition of racism, for example, that Ijeoma talks about. ... And having that shared experience of learning proper vocabulary or ways to think about intersectionality or micro-aggressions, just having that shared experience really helped us to have a conversation,"" says Chiu.

She adds that Helena is now more of a vocal ally when it comes to talking about race.

""We've had a number of conversations with her parents, for example, who are super open and willing to learn about issues around race, but come from a place where they don't have a lot of people of colour in their lives,"" says Chiu.

""She's the one who explained white privilege to her parents. She's also the one who stands up sometimes when I'm too tired or just don't want to say stuff in defence of, whether it's racialized peoples or Muslims.""

According to Chiu, Helena also understands her perspective better.

""In any relationship, we're constantly learning about our partner. And I think this has really helped Helena understand my perspective a little more. You know, why representation in the media is important, why I might feel a certain way in the workplace.""

Finding allies

Chiu understands these conversations are difficult but she says it's important for white people to talk about race.

Helena, right, learned how to be a better ally to her partner, Chiu, left, by engaging in conversations about race and identity in situations where Chiu could not. (Submitted by Andrea Chiu)

""It's really a question of: do you believe in dismantling systemic racism? If yes, then you should be having these conversations when the opportunities present themselves. But also because — similar to why we need men talking to other men about misogyny — we need white people to talk to other white people about this,"" says Chiu.

Sometimes the message is not for other white people but for your friends and partners of colour because we just want to be heard and felt supported. - Andrea Chiu

""Sometimes the message is more heard if it comes from another white person because it doesn't feel like a personal attack.""

But Chiu says being a vocal white ally sends an important message to people of colour, too.

""Sometimes the message is not for other white people but for your friends and partners of colour because we just want to be heard and felt supported,"" says Chiu.

""It might have been the same words on the page for other people, but each person's imagination got to be engaged. For me, being creative — and not knowing at that time what the good Lord had planned for me — it engaged the creative side of my brain that I couldn't deny.

""I fell in love with books. Books helped me create my 'mini-movie.' With Never Cry Wolf, I had this movie playing in my head. I couldn't wait to go back to school to get to listen to more.""

""Millions of people have read this book. But I guarantee not one of those people have the exact same mini-movie playing in their head because everybody has a different imagination.

It's vital for me, as a reader, to feel like I'm talking with a buddy when I read a book. - George Canyon

""I never would've come across this book had he not been my Uber driver in Nashville. Kurek told me he loves being a driver because he gets to talk to people and hear their stories. I think that's brilliant. He's a great guy and told me a lot of the backstory behind this book. It blew my mind.

I Flew for the Führer by Heinz Knoke

Heinz Knoke was a German fighter pilot during the Second World War. (Frontline)

""I'm big into history, especially military history. I like reading lots of books about the Second World War, Vietnam and Korea. This is a book by Heinz Knoke. He was a German air force pilot with the Luftwaffe. It's fascinating because the Luftwaffe — and actually most of the German army — hated Hitler and the Nazis.

""When you read this account from him, it's like, 'Oh my gosh.' In my own world, and with this war that my grandfathers fought in, you assume that all Germans in the army were behind Hitler.

""The Luftwaffe hated him. They flew to protect Germany. It's fascinating. I think the more we learn about things we don't know — especially about others around the world — the more we have in common. The common denominator, in this case, was his love of country and his love of flying.""

I was 17 and walking out of my morning homeroom class when my TA, Ms. Pezzente, stopped me.

""Why didn't you apply for valedictorian?"" she said.

I didn't know what to say.

That question has bothered me ever since I graduated high school.

Fear held me back

I remember hearing the announcements calling for valedictorian submissions. I kind of wanted to do it, but I figured I would have no chance at all. If I had no chance, why try?

Phung at age 17. (Submitted by Andrew Phung)

I'm a Calgary kid, born and raised. I grew up in the heart of northeast Calgary, an area filled with immigrant families trying to make the best life possible.

All my parents wanted for me was to be happy, healthy and stay out of trouble. And I did.

My career today is built on risk-taking, but in Grade 12, I played it safe. I wasn't someone who was ambitious.

Embracing failure

As a teenager, I didn't try because of the fear of failing. As an adult, my mentality has completely changed because of my work and the years I spent learning how to embrace failure through improv comedy.

If I have no chance, who cares? I should try anyway.

So when Now or Never challenged me to finally give my valedictorian speech at Scarborough's Wexford Collegiate School of the Arts, I didn't think I'd be nervous, but I was!

The do-over

I listened to my early 2000s hip-hop playlist on the drive to the school to amp myself up. As soon as I walked into the school, I was sent back in time. The smell, the lockers, and the feel of the place.

This wasn't even my school, but I felt like a 17-year-old kid again!

Hearing the students waiting for me in the auditorium got my heart racing, which is uncommon for me. I perform for a living, but this wasn't an improv or comedy show.

That all went away as soon as I started speaking. I spoke from the heart and I genuinely felt like the audience was with me the entire time.

In the moment, I took a risk and turned one section of my speech into a call and response from the crowd. The crowd was fantastic and it felt so right to include them.

Walking off the stage, I couldn't stop smiling. I did it! I never thought I'd be able to go back and make this right. It's cheesy to say, but a weight was lifted off my shoulders.

Ms. Pizzente, if you're reading this, I want you to know that your encouragement was appreciated. Thank you for believing in me.

The fiction of Michael Crummey has revolved around the rich history and heritage surrounding the place of his birth, Newfoundland and Labrador. His novels Sweetland and Galore were both set in the region, as is his latest, The Innocents.

The Innocents is a tale about a young brother and sister who live in isolation in a Newfoundland cove during the 18th century, surviving on knowledge their parents left behind.

Crummey won the Thomas Raddall Atlantic Fiction Award for his novel The Innocents. The 2019 novel was also shortlisted for the 2019 Scotiabank Giller Prize, the 2019 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction.

Crummey spoke with Shelagh Rogers about writing The Innocents.

Downhome connection

""I came across an old Newfoundland newspaper and found a paragraph-long account about a clergyman. He was travelling along the coast and happened on a brother and sister living alone in a cove. The sister was pregnant. The clergyman assumed — and quite rightly I'm sure — that the brother was the father.

""Being a clergyman, he had a few things to say about that. The brother ended up driving him off with a rifle. I knew immediately that was a story without giving it a second thought. It never left me, the notion of those two children — what life must have been like and how they ended up in that circumstance.

Every book I've written has felt completely different in terms of how it's come about, how it's been written and how I feel about it afterwards.

""Every book I've written has felt completely different in terms of how it's come about, how it's been written and how I feel about it afterwards. This book happened quickly. I had this notion about these two siblings for a long time. But I didn't want to go near it because of the fraught subject matter. When I decided to do it, I just wanted it done. For this book, I wrote every day for three and a half months.""

Employment and labour

""I was thinking of my own father when writing this book. He started working with his father in the Labrador fishery when he was nine. He never had a childhood. This was in the 1930s into the 1940s, not the 18th century. I imagine that those children would have been pretty well versed in work. Everybody had work just to survive.

""In the book, the two main characters — being 11 — are pretty close to an adult, in terms of work. But they know almost nothing about the world and nothing about life outside that cove. They have nothing to fall back on except their own wits.""

Down by the ocean

""This book is an adventure story, in a weird way — almost like a road novel. The characters don't move but the road is the ocean, the tides and the currents. Whatever comes by becomes the next chapter in the book.

A lot of the book was about getting inside the heads of these children who are so innocent and ignorant of the world.

""A lot of the book was about getting inside the heads of these children, who are so innocent and ignorant of the world. How they would try to make sense of things they have no words for.

The government's Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG), which was meant to be administered through the We Charity, has been put on pause in response to an ethics probe into the Liberal government's decision to outsource the program to an organization with ties to the Trudeau family.

""The student service grant would have been a really good opportunity for [students] to give back to the community, but to also earn some money for school,"" said Alfred Burgesson, a 23-year-old member of the Prime Minister's Youth Council who also works in youth employment.

Burgesson was asked to serve on an advisory board for the student grant project. He told The House that while he had positive experiences with the organization, he turned down the offer.

""I have not come across many people who've had great things to say about their experience with WE, so as a youth service provider, I decided not to get too close to that initiative,"" he said.



Aside from the fallout from the CCSG, the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially hard on young Canadians and their careers.

Burgesson spoke to The House about some of those challenges, what the federal government should do to help, and how Ottawa should do more to combat racism.

What does WE mean for the prime minister's future?

The ongoing controversy over the WE organization has become a growing thorn in the side of the Liberal government. The decision to give a sole-sourced contract to administer a program worth nearly $1 billion to an organization with links to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his family and his government has exploded into a potential conflict of interest.

Federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is looking into the matter. On Friday, the federal Conservatives called on the police to launch a criminal investigation.

To sort out what this means for the Liberal government going forward, guest host Catherine Cullen asks CBC chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton and Toronto Star political columnist Susan Delacourt for their views.

Economic recovery from an unparalleled crisis

Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled the government's fiscal snapshot this week, revealing that Canada's deficit is expected to hit a staggering $343 billion this year.

That update was the first real glimpse of the federal government's finances since the pandemic brought much of the country's economy to a halt and the government began shelling out billions in emergency aid.

Warm and fuzzy polar fleece jackets might be one of the best ways to stay warm in chilly Canadian winters, but the environment would be a lot better off if you didn't put them through your laundry's spin cycle.

They're one of the culprits in a new report that describes how different types of clothing materials shed tiny fibres and become one of the most ubiquitous kinds of pollution on the planet: microplastics.

Microfibres shed by synthetic clothing wind up in the environment. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

""To put it really simply, everywhere we look on the planet, from the furthest reaches of the Himalayas to the Marianas Trench, from the Arctic waters of Canada down to Antarctica, from zooplankton, plankton, to fish to birds to marine mammals, we're finding microplastics,"" said Peter Ross, the vice-president of research at Ocean Wise, and an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Victoria.

It turns out every time you wash your clothes, they release tiny fibres into the wastewater that goes into streams, lakes, oceans and marine organisms. Wastewater treatment systems can capture most of these fibres, but a large volume still escapes. If those fibres are synthetic, like nylon or the polyester in fleece garments, they enter ecosystems and stay for very long times.

Home laundry releases massive amounts of microfibres into the environment every year. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

Ross's organization teamed up with industry, companies like Patagonia and Mountain Equipment Co-op, to get a handle on this problem as it relates to fibres our clothing shed.

He said the science is showing the microplastics in our environments are dominated by tiny microfibres originating from the washing of textiles, so they decided to look into how much different types of textiles shed.

Scientists tested 38 types of materials to see how much they shed. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

""The first finding, of course, is that every single item shed fibres. And the second finding is that despite the variation we found, even within polyester — the polyester fleece or the fluffy, the warm, the soft, cushy kinds of fabrics — those were the ones that shed the most,"" said Ross.

A kilogram sample of polyester fleece released as much as 4.5 million fibres in a single wash.

Nylon performance gear-type material didn't shed nearly as much likely due to design features such as the length of fibre and its tighter weave.

While natural fibres like wool and cotton also shed, those will eventually be broken down, unlike their synthetic counterparts. That said, Ross cautions against ditching synthetic materials because he says it's important to consider the entire footprint of the production process as well as its staying power in the environment.

Wilson Cruz knows firsthand the power of television to alter perspectives and change lives.

The openly gay actor, who played gay teen Rickie Vasquez on the popular 1990s TV drama My So-Called Life, says the show helped him reconnect with his estranged father.

Cruz is one of the executive producers of Visible: Out on Television, a new docuseries from AppleTV+ that traces the highs and lows of LGBTQ representation on TV.

In an interview with Day 6 guest host Saroja Coelho, he looked back on that history and how his own onscreen roles have changed since the 1990s.

Here's part of that conversation.

In this TV series you describe your audition for My So-Called Life. What did you say to the casting director when you walked out of that audition?

We had just gone through the scene. I hadn't had many professional acting credits at that point, and so I didn't know if my audition was going to be good enough to get a callback.

And so before I walked out the door, I just had a real need to turn around and say to [the] casting director that had I seen a Rickie Vasquez on TV when I was 15 to 16 years old, it would have made a world of a difference to me.

I understood in my very first job the power of television and the responsibility that comes with it. - Wilson Cruz

To be able to see someone who looked like me, who represented my experience ... would have gone a long way to help me understand that things would be all right.

You were barely out of your teens yourself when My So-Called Life came out. How did the show affect your own life?

You know, I came out to my parents because of the show. My father threw me out of the house before we started filming the series and we didn't speak for a year.

It was the show that allowed me to have a conversation with my father again, because he was watching it and could ... understand a bit more about what my life has been like. [It] gave him the ability to reach out to me because of that.

It set me up for the rest of my career, as well, in the sense that I understood in my very first job the power of television and the responsibility that comes with it when you're making something like My So-Called Life. It's a gift to your audience that you're offering a view of the world that they perhaps wouldn't have received had it not been for you.

So it changed everything for me.

That really goes to the heart of what you're trying to do with this series. How important has TV been in changing public perception of the LGBTQ community?

I would argue that television has been our greatest tool, and that's really what the series is about.

It's about how the movement used this agent of change in order to tell the truth about who LGBTQ people are. We did it through scripted television, but it also came through the way we were covered in the news. And those depictions happened because people were fighting behind the scenes in order to make sure that they were being done in an honest and sensitive and truthful way.

And so this series is really about all of the people that really risked everything in order to do it.

When gay characters first started to appear on TV, most of them were played by straight actors — in part because so few actors were actually out at the time. How do you feel about that?

I'm grateful to them. You know, I think about somebody like Jane Alexander, who did a TV film with Gena Rowlands about a lesbian woman who was trying to keep parental rights after she divorced her husband and got into a relationship with a woman.

There weren't any openly lesbian actors who were willing or capable of taking on that role, and had someone like Gena Rowlands and Jane Alexander not stepped up with their name recognition and their respectful careers, that movie may never have been [made].

When you look back at some of those shows that were the early depictions of gay people on television, like Three's Company or Soap, which really walked a fine line between representing gay people and completely mocking them, how do you feel about those shows now?

Well, you know, there are two sides to those coins. We needed visibility, and I think especially in terms of Billy Crystal on Soap, it was a transitional time between when it was acceptable to mock LGBTQ people and the beginning of when we were being depicted as sympathetic.

And so you could tell that the audience didn't quite know how to react yet. They hadn't really been given permission to see themselves in these people yet. And so it was a difficult time in storytelling for LGBTQ people, who were still informing them about the truth of our lives.

When you look back on it, it was a very awkward growth period.

When was the first time that you watched television and thought, ""Yes that's that's close to my life. I can see myself in that""?

You know, I've said this before and I mean it: I didn't really see myself on TV until I saw myself on TV.

So many people talk about how we would try to find ourselves in shows that had nothing to do with us directly. That's why people love The Golden Girls so much: that's a chosen family, you know, with humour that was taken directly out of our own community.

So we would try to replace ourselves in those lives. It's this thing called the Tennessee Williams effect; you know, every female character that Tennessee Williams ever wrote was really a gay man. And we saw elements of that on television as well through shows like The Golden Girls or Designing Women or Sex in the City.

Now we're at a point where we're allowed to be those characters ourselves.

It has been 25 years since you played Rickie Vasquez on My So-Called Life. How have the characters you've played since then been different?

I think they've become different because I'm different. I think there's less explaining now about what being a gay man is. I'm given much more permission to just be and to exist without having to explain.

I mean, I think My So-Called Life and Rickie Vasquez were really an introduction. It was, you know, ""Gay Boy 101."" And now on Star Trek Discovery, there's no mention of the fact that we're gay.

It's just these two people are in love and are part of an epic love story ... and the most important thing about them is that they're part of a team that saves the world.

They are just like every other couple on that show. And that's the way it should be.

This is a two-part conversation: Listen to Part 1 | The Unconventional Diplomat: Breaking The Rules

Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein is perhaps best known as the outspoken UN High Commissioner for Human Rights — considered the world's moral-arbiter-in-chief — from 2014 to 2018. But he refused to run for a second term because he says it might have meant ""bending a knee in supplication"" before the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: United States, France, Russia, China and the United Kingdom.

""I didn't see my job as defending governments. Governments are more than capable of defending themselves. My job is not to defend them. Why should I excuse their behaviour? Why should I play to them? Why should I grovel before them?"" Al Hussein told Ideas producer Mary Lynk at his home in Harlem, New York.

""The job is to speak on behalf of all of those who are in detention, who are arbitrarily arrested, who are denied basic services, the right to education, the right to health, the right to adequate housing, clean drinking water.""

Al Hussein also points out Canada's failure to ratify the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. A bill supporting its implementation did pass the House of Commons, but not the Senate.

To those against the bill, Al Hussein says:

""... have some shame. Recognize what human suffering is. Money isn't everything. If it was, we would still have slavery. At some point, you draw a line and you say we will not, we will no longer behave in the way that we used to behave. And, we're going to change.""

Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein's granduncle was Iraq's last monarch, King Faisal. He led the Arab Revolt from 1916 to 1918, along with T.E. Lawrence, before becoming the ruler of Iraq. (Wikimedia)

A learned, eloquent man, Al Hussein has a PhD in philosophy from Cambridge University. He's been President of the UN Security Council and was the founding president of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.

But his pivotal moment in life came as a UN peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia in 1994 and 1995. He refers to this time as a formative experience and an anchor to his career.

Al Hussein admits that being a staunch defender of human rights does have side-effects.

""If you're a human rights defender, I think you've ought to have enough self-awareness to realize that within us, deep within us, we have the very failings of humanity itself.""

That humanity extends to devoting part of life to being of service to others, something he believes achieves deeper happiness and satisfaction in life.

""If everything revolves around you, everything is about you and the material, wealth or well-being, no matter how much of it you have, you're going to be still searching.""

""The question now isn't simply when and how our public bathrooms will reopen. It's whether the pandemic will be the tipping point that teaches people the truth about public bathrooms,"" Lezlie Lowe, a Halifax journalist and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs, wrote this week in The Walrus.

""[F]ar from being unhygienic, unsafe, or simply unimportant, with the correct distancing and cleaning measures, these facilities are a crucial part of any effective plan for preventing disease and easing inequity.""

Here is part of Lowe's conversation with As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal.

If you left the building that you're in right now in Halifax, how far would you have to walk to find a public bathroom?

Oh, my gracious. I don't even actually know how far I would have to walk. Quite a distance, I think.

How much more has this pandemic revealed about the issue of public bathrooms in this country?

What we've seen during the pandemic all across the country is that, in Canada, we really have a culture of relying on publicly accessible toilets, which is to say toilets that are in private businesses ... rather than public bathrooms, which are bathrooms that would be on streets, paid for by taxes and just considered part of the kind of basket of goods that we know we need to use our cities safely.

Stop signs and sidewalks and benches and trash cans — we know we need all those things. We don't really question paying for those things out of our municipal tax dollars. But bathrooms have really been left out of that in Canada and in other other parts of North America.

What we've seen with COVID is there's been this really big shutdown. And so not only have the few public bathrooms that are in many cities closed, but we've seen all these publicly accessible bathrooms closed. And all of a sudden people are like, ""Wait a minute, wait a minute,"" who really actually had pretty good access before. And now they're feeling what it's like to have diminished access.

Lowe is a Halifax journalist and journalism professor, and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs. (Riley Smith )

You've also written that bathrooms are about mobility. Elaborate on that.

When you look at any sort of municipal plan for any cities — and I did a lot of this research for my book — cities talk about walkability, they talk about livability, they talk about being pedestrian friendly and cyclist friendly, and a lot of talk about people aging in place.

None of those things are possible without a reasonable, accessible grid of public bathrooms because there is absolutely no way around the fact that bathrooms are needed by everybody every day of their lives.

Everybody uses the bathroom. And what we see in cities is you can go farther and you can stay out longer when you have access to that grid of public bathrooms.

We're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are. They're also kind of a joke - Lezlie Lowe, journalist and author

What's the holdup, then, here, do you think? You know, in Paris, I've seen automated toilets. In Istanbul, you can go to a mosque or WCs [water closets]. You know, you pay a few cents. Right across Europe, there's all of those examples. What's the hold up here?

We have a really different attitude toward bathrooms in, I would say, North America, and Canada particularly, than other places in the world.

The way I always describe it is when we're kids, we're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are. They're also kind of a joke. You know, I wrote a book about public bathroom access. There's only two responses. People are either like, ""Ew, that's gross."" Or they're kind of like, ""Ha ha ha!""

So we have these really kind of almost neurotic responses to public bathrooms and we're taught that as kids. And what happens is when we become adults, we sort of lack the capacity for talking about, you know, the basic need to go to the bathroom, in a serious way. And I think that is actually borne out in the policy decisions of cities.

And people experiencing homelessness in cities, including Toronto, have talked about this in recent weeks as well. Access for them is an issue.

Yeah. And I mean, I'm sure that is exacerbated now.

We talk about COVID, but we also have to think about the other health risks that are actually around when we look at public bathrooms. And there's ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks due to public defecation. I mean, there's very serious health concerns that we need to take into account when we think about what the value of having public bathrooms is.

And on the issue of COVID, I suspect some municipal leaders might say, you know, we just can't keep up. You have to clean these facilities. They wouldn't be safe, especially during a pandemic. But in your most recent article about this in The Walrus, you say public bathrooms aren't really riskier than any other high-touch public spaces.

We do automatically think of public bathrooms as these sort of paragons of filth. And, yeah, they can get really dirty. But so can other spaces.

Public bathrooms are not a high risk for COVID for a couple reasons. One is that COVID is a respiratory illness. And so what we know is that we need to stay out of small spaces with shared air with strangers. That's the same as an elevator. Nobody is talking about closing every elevator in every high-rise because they're too risky. We're just putting mitigation factors in place. So, you know, we say only two people in an elevator.

The other issue is high-touch surfaces. Yes, there are high-touch surfaces in bathrooms, but there are also high-touch surfaces entering, you know, malls and public libraries and restaurants and elevators, for that matter. And so, yeah, there needs to be enhanced cleaning. That's no different than any other space right now as we're coping with the pandemic.

The one thing that I would say sets public bathrooms apart when we're talking about COVID is, ironically, the fact that we practise hand hygiene in public bathrooms. Public bathrooms are the places we go to help get the virus off of our hands. So that sort of puts, I would say, a greater onus on cities to do those reasonable control of access and sanitizing solutions, but also keeping bathrooms open because people need to wash their hands more than ever when it comes to this virus.

Any sense of the costs for cities to put these public washrooms in?

Bathrooms are not cheap. They are, if you're looking at the on-street automated toilets that you mentioned earlier, those can cost, you know, a quarter of a million dollars to install.

I think we have to ask ourselves, who do we want to be? What do we want as a society? Because when we talk about livability, we talk about walkability, when we talk about people aging in place, if we say we want those things, then we actually have to put in place the supports that support those things.

So I think that, yes, they are costly, but they are also necessary to human dignity and to the full and reasonable use of our cities.

Do you think the pandemic, as you wrote, will be a tipping point?

I can say that, you know, as the person who wrote the book on public toilets, I have never talked about public toilets so much as I have in the last four months. And I think that's fantastic.

94,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/whitecoat/can-contact-tracing-apps-really-help-us-beat-covid-19-1.5643163,Can contact-tracing apps really help us beat COVID-19?,"['Cbc Radio', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"This month, the federal government plans to launch COVID Alert, its free, voluntary contact-tracing app.

Ontario will be the first province to release the app, even as some people raise privacy concerns.

But will it work?

To find out, Dr. Brian Goldman, host of The Dose talked to Dr. Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael's Hospital, and professor of epidemiology at University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

So how do contact-tracing apps work?

They work on the premise that people who test positive have to voluntarily enter the information into the phone. By looking at who's been close to that phone through Bluetooth connections, they're able to let people know that they have been in contact with someone who might have had an infection. Then it's supposed to prompt those people to potentially get tested.

Bluetooth contact tracing: First, users download an app and enable bluetooth on their smartphones. Second, the app sends out a unique anonymized beacon to other devices nearby using the same app. Third, each phone records and securely stores beacons it comes in contact with. Fourth, the app downloads a list of beacons associated with anonymous app users who have tested positive for coronavirus. The device cross-checks those beacons with ones it came into contact with. If there is a positive result in the list, users receive a notification. (CBC)

How does the app know that I've tested positive for COVID-19?

It will only know if you enter that information into the app.

So there's two big conditions for the app. One, it involves people voluntarily putting in their positive status if they've been tested. The second is it works much better if it has high coverage.

What is the biggest benefit of a contact-tracing app?

If it encourages people to get tested then that's a good thing.... the app could help identify who's at higher risk, and those are the populations that need to get tested. But that'll all depend on how wide the coverage is. The experience of Iceland wasn't so positive. They found that only something like 35 per cent of the Iceland population took up a free app and it wasn't very useful. Likewise, the U.K. experience has been not so useful .

On the other hand, the German experience has been more positive . But I attribute that to the fact that they relied on not just the app but they also had people calling you when there was a positive case.

I think there's a human nature part of this. If I get a call from a concerned public health official saying I might have been exposed, I can interact with them. It's a human voice that's assuring me to get tested so I think the German results are good because they had a lot of people on the phones along with the app.

A recent poll of Canadians found that over half disapproved of mandating a contact-tracing app. Are we as Canadians too suspicious of the government for this app to even work?

We have to have the right balance. I think we should have more requirements to have everyone who is positive be reported and to perhaps be required to have the app.

I'm not too concerned about the privacy concerns personally because if the app is housed under public health agencies, they're not working with commercial vendors to sell your information or others. So in that sense, I trust the government more than I would Apple or Google because you know they're kind of figuring out ways of monetizing it.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveils a new smart phone application designed to warn people when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. 2:39

We have to ask: What is our objective for the pandemic? The main objective is to prevent deaths in older people. If you're looking after older people or working at a nursing home, then you've got an extra obligation to make sure that you are protected. So in that case I would use the app.

If we get a second wave, our core strategy should be really that we're not going to prevent a little bit of infection here and there in the general population as much as we'd like to, but we should absolutely focus on stopping entry into seniors' homes because they're the ones getting killed by it.

The incident, some of which was captured on video, shows the need to address systemic racism both in the community and in policing, according to an academic who studies racism in Canada.

""When, in the particular culture of the current environment where race issues — and particularly the Black-white police relationship is in such tension — it strikes me as concerning the officer acted the way he acted in the current environment,"" Kathy Hogarth, an associate professor of social work at the University of Waterloo, said.

Rayan Babiker said she and four friends were driving around Sunnyside in northwest Calgary at around 2:40 p.m. on June 3, looking for parking before they planned to meet a friend and head to a Black Lives Matter vigil downtown.

One of the women in the car had been holding a Black Lives Matter sign up to the window and shouting the motto as they drove, usually to honks or waves from passersby.

The women said they drove past a white man engaged in what appeared to be a heated conversation with a Black man. The woman in the car yelled ""Black Lives Matter"" as they drove past and in response they said the man yelled back, ""Shut the f--k up, [N-words].""

The women shouted back ""f--k you"" and other expletives at him, and drove on.

'We were shocked'

""We were shocked. Yes, we've experienced racism, but never in broad daylight, and this man felt this was a safe environment for him to say that,"" said Babiker.

The women found parking and were walking to meet their friend when they came across the man again, in a different spot than the direction he had been walking. They said it seemed as if he had walked toward where they had parked. At this point, they start recording video on their phones.

The women confronted him, daring him to repeat what he had just shouted at them.

""You were so keen on calling us [N-words] when we were in the car, how do you feel now?"" one of them asked, while others shouted, ""Black Lives Matter.""

The man swore at them and began to walk away when one of the women splashed water from a water bottle onto his back, wetting the left sleeve of his polo shirt.

The man spun, lunging and grabbing 20-year-old Fatima Osman — who hadn't thrown the water — by the neck.

""Some water got thrown at him, I'm not sure what happened because it was behind me,"" she said.

""He got angry. He choked me and he punched me in the face …. I tried to grab him and do something to defend myself but he ran away.""

CBC News has not been able to confirm the identity of the man in the video and has blurred his face in the video as he's not currently facing charges.

A company, the logo of which is shown on the man's shirt, confirmed he is a former employee but said due to privacy legislation it was unable to comment further as to when the man left the company.

""We are deeply saddened to be associated with this in any way as we do not condone racism or violence under any circumstance,"" a company spokesperson said in an email.

Osman said she was hit in the face and a necklace of sentimental value to her was torn off. She shared a photo with CBC showing her bruised cheekbone.

""My face for a whole week after that, the side he punched, the left side was green and swollen. Even now it's kind of green and it kinda hurts when I touch it.""

The video's shaky, but as it resumes, it shows Osman pushing back at the man and grabbing his shirt, and the women trying to chase the man off, as he lunges in what the women said seemed to be an attempt to tear off the hijab of another woman in the group, before running off down the street.

Police arrive

They followed him, yelling at him and continuing to film. They were about to call the police to respond when they spotted a police officer driving up.

Babiker said they had planned on following him until they could get authorities to respond, so they were relieved to see a police officer.

The women, yelling over each other, told the officer variations of the same statement, ""He hit her, we have it on camera.""

The officer spoke with the man first, motioning to the women to calm down and give him some space. He asked the man for his ID, then told the man he could walk away before speaking to the women.

""We were all trying to say the same thing, but he felt like, I don't know, we weren't listening to him, he went to the offender here ... we felt like we wasted our time following this man around trying to get justice,"" said Babiker.

A female officer arrived a few minutes later and, after calming the group down, listened to their accounts of what had happened.

Professor troubled by police response

Hogarth, author of A Space for Race: Decoding Racism, Multiculturalism, and Post-Colonialism in the Quest for Belonging in Canada and Beyond, said she was troubled watching the video, seeing the officer let the man walk away before trying harder to obtain the women's perspective of what happened.

The Calgary Police Service said that, when coming across heated confrontations, it's common practice to separate parties to de-escalate a situation.

""Given the man was alone, it was easier to speak with him and send him on his way. Officers obtained his identification and followed up with him shortly after,"" an emailed statement from police read.

Osman said while she understands why the officer spoke with the man who hit her first, she felt disregarded.

""I understand that their protocol is to go to the person who actually punched,"" she said.

""At the same time, we were five young girls in distress, I had just told you this man punched me.""

Osman and her friends said they have since met with police to provide statements about what happened.

Osman said the detectives were kind and helpful, and she's hoping for justice, but she was concerned by one question an officer asked her.

She said police asked her why it was OK for her, a Black woman, to use the N-word, but when a white man used the same word she got angry.

""It was frustrating,"" Osman said, adding that when she uses the word, she's not using it with hate or as a slur against other Black people.

Police confirmed they are actively investigating the incident and said they cannot discuss the matter as it may eventually be before the courts.

""The file is being thoroughly investigated including interviews with those involved to gain full context and perspective before completing the investigation and consulting with the Crown,"" an emailed statement read.

Police said if anyone involved is dissatisfied with the investigation, they are encouraged to file a complaint through the Professional Standards Section.

Our system is not working for all of us ... until it works for all of us, it is not working for any of us. - Kathy Hogarth, social work professor

Babiker said this incident has changed her relationship to the police.

""I actually see the police as people who can potentially protect me but after [this] incident, that the only time I actually called them in and wanted their assistance, they failed to deliver ... since I had [this incident] on video, I thought I had the upper hand here,"" she said.

""It had me think maybe next time I shouldn't say anything or even try to ask for help or defend myself.""

Hogarth said Babiker's reaction to her experience should resonate with Black and Indigenous people of colour across the country.

""This is exactly what happens when victims of crimes cannot trust the system in place through experience, whether that's direct experience or vicarious experience ... but when victims cannot trust the systems that are in place to protect them will actually protect them, those victims are forced to suffer in silence,"" Hogarth said.

Kathy Hogarth, associate professor in the School of Social Work at Renison University College at the University of Waterloo, says the incident and police response will likely resonate with many BIPOC. (Submitted by Kathy Hogarth)

""We have strayed very far from the model of serve and protect because we serve and protect only a certain class of citizens ... we need change.

""Our system is not working for all of us ... until it works for all of us, it is not working for any of us.""

Hogarth pointed to recent comments by Calgary's police chief, who said he used to think systemic racism was not a problem in his force but that now he is not so sure.

Hogarth said the growth in that statement shows the dial is moving but perhaps not quickly enough.

""Systems that are absolutely built on racism are absolutely trying to deny the existence of it. We cannot begin to address systemic racism when those who hold responsibility for those systems deny the existence of it,"" she said.

""Until it becomes in the best interest of leadership to see the problem under their rule, under their responsibility, until it becomes in their best interest to see those issues, we will need change.""",[]

Now, he says the opposite is true.

Neasloss is the elected chief councillor of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, and the co-author of a new study on the genome of the spirit bear, a.k.a. Kermode, a rare, white-furred variant of the black bear in B.C.'s Central and North Coast regions.

The research found that the bears — which are culturally significant to Indigenous Peoples in the area — are less common than previously believed, and that more work needs to be done to protect them.

""It's probably one of the rarest bears on the planet,"" Neasloss told As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal. ""And through our latest research, we found out it's a lot more rare than we thought.""

The study was published in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence .

His first 'magical' encounter with a spirit bear

Neasloss is the resource stewardship director of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, whose people have a deep connection with the spirit bear.

But he didn't even know they existed until he saw one up close for the first time in the early 2000s.

He was working as an ecotourism guide in central B.C. when his supervisor told him to go look for one.

""I thought they were just pulling my leg,"" he said. ""I never heard about it in my community.""

Nevertheless, he set off on a hike to explore the forest.

""A few minutes into the trek, I basically almost came face-to-face with a spirit bear. And here he was walking across the forest with a salmon in his mouth,"" Neasloss said.

""I'll never, never forget that moment.""

As the creature plopped down in front of Neasloss to feast on its fish, he says the clouds parted and the sun shone down.

""And there was the spirit bear, pure white coat. And he was sitting there eating the salmon, and you see all the blood on his face,"" Neasloss said.

""And that was certainly a very magical moment and kind of helped propel me into sticking with tourism.""

Combining science with First Nations knowledge

When Neasloss asked his nation's elders why he had never heard of the bear, he says they told him they kept quiet about the animal to protect it from those who would hunt it for its fur.

""So it was kind of a big secret. Up until, you know, kind of the late '90s, nobody really knew about spirit bears,"" he said.

Now, the spirit bear is the provincial mammal of British Columbia, a major tourist draw, and a powerful symbol for conservation efforts.

""[In] today's day and age, I think we're starting to shift our focus and trying to be a bit more vocal with it, because ... these bears are under a number of threats.""

Still, Neasloss says very little is known about spirit bears. That, he argues, makes it hard to enact policies to protect them.

It's also why he participated in the study, which was an eight-year collaboration between First Nations stewards from the Kitasoo/Xai'xais and Gitga'at First Nations, the University of Victoria, the Spirit Bear Research Foundation and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation.

""We thought we would drive the science ourselves,"" he said.

""We also merged our science with First Nations knowledge and hopefully are able to provide some strong information to decision makers so we can do more to protect them.""

Researchers worked with members of the First Nations to collect fur samples from 385 black bears along 18,000 square kilometres of the Great Bear Rainforest using non-invasive wire corrals and ""extremely stinky"" scented lures.

The bears were drawn to the alluring scent of fish oil or beaver anal gland secretions and would rub up against the wire for a good scratch.

Scientists were then able to study the samples in the lab to determine how many bears carried the recessive gene that produces the unique reddish-white coat on some black bears — the same gene that causes red hair in humans.

""CSI-style, from each hair, we determined the individual bear's genetic fingerprint, sex, species and for black bears, the specific carriers of the spirit bear gene,"" Christina Service, wildlife biologist for the Kitasoo/Xai'xais Stewardship Authority, told the Vancouver Sun.

The gene that produces the spirit bear's white fur is rarer than previously believed, according to a new study. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press)

They discovered the genetic variance is 50 per cent rarer than previous estimates.

They were also able to map the populations and found that only half of the areas with high concentrations of spirit bears are protected.

From science to advocacy

On July 3, 1969, an era had ended for Newfoundland transportation when the train made its last run from Port aux Basques, N.L., to St. John's.

""Now, it's a thing of the past,"" said the CBC's Tom Kavanaugh in a report about the final journey. ""A victim to paved highways and Canadian National's new bus system.""

The train was to be available on standby ""if the bus has trouble during the winter,"" he added.

The final ride

Many of the travellers on the last Bullet were ""old-timers"" who had taken the train for years. And some of them were employees who didn't think much of the backup plan.

""I think they should be kept on, that's if we get the hard winter,"" said one such veteran. ""If we gets a hard winter ... the bus is no good.""

As viewers watched film of the scenery outside the train, another passenger was heard saying she ""definitely"" didn't like the idea of the train's discontinuation.

""We're going to miss it as an alternative route,"" added another as the train passed the Deer Lake laundromat and a sign for a place called The Spud. ""If you can't get on the bus there was always the train.""

There were pros and cons to the Caribou, which was anything but fast.

""The train is slow, but you can get up and move around,"" said a rider.

Why it died

Low ridership was one reason the train was being discontinued as a transportation option in Newfoundland. (CBC News/CBC Archives)

""The lack of passengers is the reason for the death of the Bullet,"" said Kavanaugh, as a train car full of empty seats was shown. ""Canadian National quotes figures to show that most people prefer the bus — or at least use the bus.""

He said CN had introduced the bus the previous year, and that some dining car staff felt the train service — which CN also operated — had ""been allowed to deteriorate.""

A longtime staffer, one of 60 who was now unemployed, had described dining cars that previously featured ""linen tablecloths, silverware and a varied menu.""

""Now, he says there are paper placemats, stainless steel and a limited menu,"" said Kavanaugh.

For its part, CN had claimed service in Newfoundland was ""comparable to that on the mainland.""

""It said the Bullet had just fallen victim to changes in modern transportation.""

Letters of protest

MPs look through some of the many letters pleading for the return of the Newfie Bullet three years after it ended. 0:56

Reporting in the CBC archives shows that protests over the loss of the service were already underway by September 1968.

In December that year, the Canadian Transportation Commission had conducted a study into phasing out the train. It was followed by a debate in the House of Commons in March 1969.

Three years after the train's end, some Newfoundlanders were still demanding its return.

""As a concerned citizen of Newfoundland I hereby give support for the restoration of rail service to this province,"" read a man identified as a Newfoundland MP who had pulled a letter from a barrel stuffed with correspondence.

""And by doing so, show my dissatisfaction with the way Newfoundland is being treated in regards to a safe and adequate transportation service.""",[]

She Has Written For Many Online', 'Print Publications', 'Including Scary Mommy', 'The Penny Hoarder', 'The Globe', 'Mail.', ""Brianna'S Budget-Savvy Ways Has Attracted Media Attention""]",2020-07-09,"“Tomorrow is Monday,” my husband says, a small smile creeping across his face. We’re sitting outside on our back patio, drinking a beer (for him) and tea (for me), while watching the sunset together. 'Monday' is a secret-code we have in our home because that’s the day we have scheduled for just the two of us.

To make it a bit more clear: Monday is the day we have scheduled for sex.

""But when my husband gently reminds me that it’s Monday tomorrow, I know he’s also asking me if 'Monday' is still happening.""

Obviously scheduling sex doesn’t sound very sexy. But when do we have the time to be together? My husband works full-time, while I attempt to re-enter the freelance field as my industry crashes and burns, all during a pandemic. To top it off, we have three young kids, a dog and a house to take care of. Scheduling sex is the only way it’s going to happen. Even without the pandemic, having a set schedule when you’ve been married a decade is a great solution — at least, it has been for us.

But lately even the appointment in my calendar hasn’t been enough for me to actually “attend” my meeting, if you catch my drift. I’m exhausted, overwhelmed and honestly there are days when that’s the last thing on my mind. But when my husband gently reminds me that it’s Monday tomorrow, I know he’s also asking me if 'Monday' is still happening.

I’ll be honest and say that I haven’t been interested in 'Mondaying' every single week since we started self-isolating in March. And I’ve accepted that it’s OK, and so has my partner. That’s the key to consent — just because we have a scheduled time doesn’t mean we’re obligated to show up. If one of us isn’t interested we respect each other. Other times, we 'Monday' — just not on Monday.

For us, having time to ourselves as a couple has been a key to not losing each other during this really challenging time. We’re constantly interacting with each other, and it’s easy to get sick of someone when you’re always around them. Still, we don’t want to lose the tenderness, the love or the connection we have with one another.

The pandemic has taught this mom that parenthood will never be easy. Read that POV here.

After the kids go to bed, we try to take some time to ourselves separately. My husband might play the guitar while I read, or I might walk the dog while he works on a home renovation project. But we always try to make time to be together. Some nights we’ll play Boggle or Yahtzee, or watch a show on Netflix or Apple TV+. Other nights we’ll retreat to bed and cuddle and talk about our day. What I’ve learned is the greater our connection to each other, the stronger our desire for intimacy.

What works for us won’t work for everyone, but we’ve learned that mutual respect and a desire to show up and love each other — even when we don’t feel like it — usually leads to a stronger desire to make time for sexual intimacy. We focus on the connection first, and the intimacy follows. On Mondays, or sometimes if we’re lucky, on a different day of the week.",[]

Close calls and brushes with death had stalked the scion of the Musitano crime family for years.

He survived one shooting that peppered his home with bullet holes in 2017, and another, just over a year before his death, that sent him to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds.

""He was a dead man walking,"" said Antonio Nicaso, a Mafia expert who teaches courses on organized crime at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.

""In the world of the Mafia, revenge does not lapse. Revenge does not have a statute of limitations.""

Ultimately, the 52-year-old couldn't escape those who were gunning for him. On Friday, he was shot and killed outside a strip mall in Burlington, Ont., west of Toronto.

Halton Region police confirmed Musitano was killed and said another person — who Nicaso said is believed to have been the mobster's close friend and bodyguard — was wounded and remains in hospital in serious condition.

Investigators are searching for a male suspect who fled in a newer model grey four-door sedan ""similar to an Infiniti Q50.""

UPDATED DESCRIP'N OF SUSPECT VEHICLE<br><br>The suspect vehicle in this afternoon's double shooting is a newer model grey 4-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50 with a sunroof. This vehicle will have fresh damage to the driver’s side in the area of the doors. Call police if seen. ^jh —@HaltonPolice

The vehicle will have ""fresh damage"" on the driver's side near the doors, say police, who are asking anyone who spots it to contact them.

Musitano's death marks the end of a string of violent attempts on his life, but it also raises questions about what will happen next now that one of the most powerful organized crime families in Hamilton is suddenly without a figurehead.

""With the playing field in the underworld being wide open, you're going to have a lot of different groups trying to make a power play,"" said Stephen Metelsky, a criminology professor at Mohawk College in Hamilton and a retired police sergeant.

'Those people never forget, never forgive'

The story of the Musitanos stretches back to the 1970s, when the family was linked to convictions for bombings and extortion, as well as the hit on mobster Domenic Racco in the 1980s.

Pat and his brother Angelo were charged with first-degree murder in 1997 for the contract killing of local Mob boss Johnny ""Pops"" Papalia and one of his lieutenants, Carmen Barillaro.

Angelo Musitano, right, and his brother Pat are shown leaving court in 1998. Pat was killed in a shooting on Friday in Burlington, Ont., while Angelo was killed in a targeted shooting outside his home in 2017. (Hamilton Spectator)

The Musitanos reached a deal and pleaded to conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Barillaro. In turn, the charges against them in connection with Papalia's death were dropped.

Both men were sentenced to 10 years in prison and were released in 2007.

Nicaso said he thinks other underworld figures never forgave Musitano for Papalia's death.

Mobsters can hold grudges for years, quietly hunting targets and harbouring ""festering feelings of revenge"" he said. In the world of the Mob, waiting 23 years for vengeance is nothing.

""There have been cases where revenge has come after 50 years,"" Nicaso said. ""Those people never forget, never forgive.""

Metelsky also traced Musitano's killing back to that of Papalia, pointing out the two deaths are ""eerily reminiscent"" of each other.

""Both mobsters [were] gunned down on the street in broad daylight,"" he said.

The organized crime specialist said Angelo's death in 2017 meant his brother's days were numbered, and the repeated attempts on Musitano's life were ""foreshadowing"" his death.

""The planning and scheming to kill Pat started the day after he survived last year,"" Metelsky said.

Musitano knew his death was coming, according to the professor.

""There's no retirement plan in the Mob,"" he said. ""There's typically three exit options in the Mafia: You go to jail, you're murdered or you put on a government jersey and become a co-operating witness.""

Hard to predict what's next

Nicaso said he's not sure what the next chapter will bring for organized crime in the area.

Mobsters around the world are less visible today and more focused on making money, he said. The two warring factions within the Rizzuto family have reportedly reached a silent agreement to focus on business, not violence, he noted.

""My instinct is to say [Musitano's death] was a kind of mission to revenge a betrayal that took place in 1997 ... but you never know,"" Nicaso said. ""They may have some other issue and may continue with the violence. It's very difficult to predict.""

Regardless, the next moment will be one to watch.

Musitano's death means the family, or at least its namesake, is ""completely decimated,"" Metelsky said.

Halton police are searching for a male suspect and a grey sedan with damage on its driver's side door. (David Ritchie)

It's a situation that's left a power vacuum in the underworld and no shortage of groups that might try to fill it.

""Hamilton is a very ripe geographical area for all kinds of criminal rackets,"" Metelsky said, with a location nestled close to Toronto and just a short drive from Buffalo and the U.S. border.

""Will the violence stop? No,"" he said. ""The problem is the violence never stops.""",[]

There’s a new way to look at the moon.



A way that shows not just the surface features of the 4.5-billion-year-old ball of rock, but also describes how old those features are and how they got there.



It’s called the Unified Geologic Map of the Moon.

It’s a map made by scientists from the United States Geological Survey, with help from NASA and the Lunar Planetary Institute.



The scientists started with maps made during six Apollo missions in the 1960s and ’70s.

More recently, they added data from satellites that are constantly orbiting the moon.



The satellites reveal much more detail about the size and shape of the moon’s rocky formations.

In yellow, you see craters made by asteroids and meteorites that have crashed into the moon over the past billion years.

In red and pink are the low-lying lava plains, formed when volcanoes erupted 10 million to one billion years ago.

Scientists can use the map to help plan for future human missions to the moon.

Pictures began to pop up on Twitter of crowds in Sylvan Lake on Saturday, a beachfront town west of Red Deer.

The posts appear to show groups of people closer than the required two-metre separation on a thin stretch of sand fronting the lake, with spillover crowds in the grassy park enclosing the beach.

Sylvan Lake today - my anxiety was a tad high today😬 Don’t think we’ll be going back. I felt like a Covidiot today 🤦🏻‍♀️ <a href=""https://t.co/ncYWBINIMO"">pic.twitter.com/ncYWBINIMO</a> —@papercandie

""COVID-19 is still here and we must do our part in limiting the spread,"" said Alberta Health spokesperson Tom McMillan in a statement to CBC News on Sunday. ""We continue to recommend that all Albertans physically distance whenever possible, including when at the beach.""

Public health orders require people to maintain a minimum two-metre separation at any indoor or outdoor gathering, with certain exceptions. Provincial guidelines offers flexibility for cohort groups, for example, with households permitted to have close interactions with up to 15 people.

Sylvan Lake was trending on Twitter Sunday afternoon with certain pictures shared hundreds of times.

NDP MLA Janis Irwin commented on a post, saying it was reminiscent of crowded U.S. beaches during recent long weekends.

Damn. Every time I see a pic of a crowded beach in the States, I shake my head at those foolish Americans. But here we are. This is in Alberta. We must do better, friends. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ableg</a> <a href=""https://t.co/sc2ZQPZ0ie"">https://t.co/sc2ZQPZ0ie</a> —@JanisIrwin

Sylvan Lake, home to about 15,000 residents, swells with thousands of visitors in the summer months as it hosts one of the most accessible beaches for people living in Red Deer, Calgary and Edmonton. Last week, the town announced it had deactivated its Emergency Coordination Centre, with decisions related to COVID-19 returned to regular administrative operations.

At the outset of the pandemic, local officials asked people with summer homes to stay put wherever they spent the winter, noting a local COVID-19 outbreak could overwhelm the healthcare system. Barriers were placed at the entrance of public parking lots around the lake to dissuade would-be beachgoers.

'We're all still vulnerable'

Local resident Greg Dickson says he felt safe in the community throughout the spring. But as the beach regains its status as a popular weekend getaway under relaxed public health restrictions, Dickson says he worries about an outbreak.

""I'm shocked, frankly,"" he said. ""It's like we've forgotten that we're all still vulnerable.""

Dickson says he arrived at the beach on Saturday to meet family members and seek out a possible memorial bench to honour a loved one who had recently died, unrelated to COVID-19. He briefly considered whether to brave the crowd with a mask on, but the 65-year-old and his wife, who has asthma, figured the risk was too apparent.

The visit to the park left Dickson feeling disillusioned. He took pride in the province's response to the COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, he says, but is increasingly distressed by what he sees as a collective disregard for physical distancing guidelines.

""We need each other,"" he said. ""My well-being and health is dependent on my neighbours and that was once comforting, now it's disturbing.

Being outside is not a level of protection unto itself. - Craig Jenne, infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary

Craig Jenne, an infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary, says the pictures are worrisome and indicative of what he called ""COVID fatigue"". People appear to be losing track of the public health guidelines that exist as a condition of the province's relaunch plan, he says.

""If we ignore these, we are going to have problems, we are going to have increased infections. Unfortunately, we may have to go back and close some things, whether it be beaches or even stores and restaurants if we're unable to keep numbers low,"" said Jenne, an associate professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases.

While early studies suggest the risk of COVID-19 transmission is markedly lower outside, compared to indoors, Jenne says the risk is still ""quite high"" in a large gathering such as the one documented at Sylvan Lake on Saturday.

""In crowding like that, if one person was infected, we can absolutely expect a cluster to develop, so we have to be careful"" he said.

A small amount of wind can begin to disperse the thousands of respiratory droplets we produce when speaking, coughing and sneezing — the same droplets that commonly spread the virus. Even so, the transmission risk still exists, prompting public health experts to issue physical distancing and masks guidelines for outdoor settings.

A study of 318 outbreaks in China found one was connected to outdoor transmission resulting in two COVID-19 cases. Another study of Japanese cases found the risk of transmission was around 18 times higher in a closed environment compared to open air. Both studies are in the pre-print phase, meaning they have not yet been subject to the rigorous oversight of academic peer-review.

""Being outside is not a level of protection unto itself,"" Jenne said. ""If we start packing venues with people, the fact that it's outside is going to offer little protection.""",[]
106,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/life/wellness/qigong-exercises-to-increase-mobility-and-mindfulness-1.5578767,Qigong exercises to increase mobility and mindfulness,"['Janet Ho', 'Cbc Life', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"While keeping up with an active lifestyle may feel like a challenge with so many pandemic-related safety procedures and restrictions to abide by, it can also be an opportunity to get creative about staying fit and discover new practices. There's one in particular that's gentle and easy enough to do whether you're seven or 87 years old.

The ancient Chinese practice of qigong is designed to improve mobility and well-being, combining slow body movements with focused breathing. The Mandarin term qigong (pronounced chee-kung or chee-kong) can be translated to ""energy work,"" which is the foundation of the whole practice: enhancing the flow of energy through the body.

The stretches that derive from qigong involve the full body. At the same time, they're very low-impact and can be modified easily depending on one's own physical limitations — making it accessible for many seniors — and space or other limitations, since no equipment is required.

Injury prevention and improving mobility

""Ideally, we would use [qigong] for prevention … when you're doing those movements, you're maintaining that smooth flow of energy throughout the body, so there's no opportunity for stagnation,"" says Sue Crites , an Alberta-based online qigong instructor. A holistic nutritionist with a masters in science, Crites began exploring qigong after the practice relieved pain in her hip — pain that physiotherapy, chiropractic treatment, massage, acupuncture and diet changes did not seem to improve. ""That just led me down this huge path.""

Francine Tseng, an osteopathic therapist at Consensio Clinic in Canmore, Alta., recommends qigong to her clients as a way to maintain and improve their baseline mobility. ""You might be surprised at how commonly people fall into a habitual way of moving — their bodies forget the ability to move fluidly and with coordination. Like if you're walking on a path and you step off a rock in an awkward way, your body might not have the coordination to react in the moment and that can cause injury.""

The simplicity of the exercises is part of what makes qigong so effective, according to Tseng. It can help retrain the body to achieve small detailed movements that may be lost over time due to a more sedentary lifestyle, previous injury or years of doing repetitive motions such as computer work or operating machinery.

Crites says she has seen significant improvements in a number of her older students, noting an example of an eldery man who started off needing the support of a chair for stability. ""[After practicing qigong,] his balance completely improved, and for someone who is a senior, who lives in a place where there's snow and ice, that is very significant … it's going to prevent falls … it's going to build his confidence [and] he's going to walk more. There's so much more to it,"" she says.

Mindfulness and releasing tension

""The goal of qigong is unification,"" said Maria Theresa Gregory via email from her studio, YogAloft Wellness Retreat , in McKellar, Ont., which includes qigong instruction. ""[The practice] reminds us that we are more than just a body. We are sensing, feeling, alive on so many more levels than just the physical.""

Like other mind-body practices, including yoga and tai chi, qigong may also help increase mindfulness, improve mood and release tension. ""Personally, [I find] the practice is a great way to remind my body and my heart to be open,"" says Tseng, who describes one qigong exercise as a kind of swimming or flying motion using one's arms . ""If my mind is going around in circles about something, [the motion] kind of helps give me that mental space. It [also] gives my body space because I tense up over time a lot, especially in times of stress or working at the computer. So it's just really good to remind myself that there's all this potential space [I] haven't been using the whole day.""

Similar to the distinctions between yoga practices (how, for instance, hatha and ashtanga practices vary) qigong offers different styles of practice, while the basic philosophy and exercises are similar. Here are some tutorials to help get you started. As with any new form of exercise, it doesn't hurt to check with your doctor before beginning, especially if you are recovering from or may be prone to injury.

1. The eight brocades exercises

This set of movements is one of the most popular exercises in qigong and will help as a foundation for daily practice.

2. The five animals routine

These qigong exercises, which have origins in the Shaolin martial arts, may help release tension in the body and improve balance.

3. A breathing exercise to calm the mind

A deep-breathing exercise that incorporates slow movement to help calm the body and mind.

4. A 20-minute daily routine

A quick and easy practice you can do every day to improve circulation and increase flexibility.

""Every corner of our province is getting back to work,"" Premier Doug Ford said at a Monday news conference.

""Today, we are ready to take the next step.""

The province says it will allow indoor gatherings of up to 50 people in Stage 3 and outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people. However, according to the plan, physical distancing remains a requirement for all people who are not from the same household or established social circle.

Work colleagues, including performers and crews, do not count toward gathering limits, according to the province.

The plan also says that people gathering inside for religious services, weddings or funerals can continue to fill up to 30 per cent of a room's capacity in Stage 3.

It also dictates that sport facilities and gyms can reopen but notes that physical distancing still must be maintained, ""except if playing a team sport or as needed for personal training.""

Amusement parks and water parks are not being allowed to reopen in Stage 3 at the moment.

Health measures still in place in Stage 3

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that health measures such as wearing face coverings, hand washing and physical distancing remain key to ensuring that Ontarians can ""safely enjoy the loosening of restrictions.

""We expect the province will remain in Stage 3 for the foreseeable future,"" Elliott said.

She also said that health officials will be monitoring for any COVID-19 outbreaks and can tighten restrictions if there are flare-ups. Provincial Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said Monday that he is hoping the entire province will be able to be in Stage 3 by the end of July.

Elliott also said social circles for people in Ontario will remain capped at 10 for now. The province can gradually expand them, but ""just not right yet,"" she said.

Finance Minister Rod Phillips said Ontario is in a ""strong position"" to reopen right now, especially compared to areas in some other countries being hard hit by COVID-19.

""We're in this position because we have made the choice to act responsibly and treat each other with respect,"" he said.

He said that respect is key in Stage 3 to ""avoid taking a step backwards.""

Provincial officials pointed to the situation in the United States as a cautionary tale Monday. Canada's southern neighbour opened the week grappling with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world after Florida shattered the national record for a state's largest single-day increase in new confirmed cases.

The World Health Organization warned that the pandemic is worsening globally and that ""there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.""

Williams said it seems the U.S. opened too quickly and is now having to backtrack.

""We do not want to repeat or have anything like that,"" he said.

116 new cases reported Monday

The loosening of restrictions comes as the spread of COVID-19 continues to slow in Ontario, with new daily case numbers having steadily declined over the last five weeks.

Ontario reported 116 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 today.

In a series of tweets this morning, Elliott noted that 29 of Ontario's 34 public health units reported five or fewer additional cases today, while 21 of those 29 confirmed no new cases at all. There are currently fewer than 1,500 active cases provincewide.

Further, the number of patients in Ontario hospitals with infections of the novel coronavirus also continues to fall, she said. There were five times as many people being treated in hospital for COVID-19 at the beginning of June than there are now.

""Having seen a continued decline in the number of new [COVID-19] cases as the province entered Stage 2, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we're providing details about Stage 3 of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,"" Elliott wrote.

Twenty-four public health units entered Stage 2 on June 12, and seven more on June 19. Toronto and Peel, the province's most populous health units, then proceeded into Stage 2 five days after that. The move included reopening patios and hair salons.

The president and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association is already expressing some hesitations at the prospect of entering the third phase.

""Given that hospitals continue to act as the anchor of Ontario's response to COVID-19, [the OHA] will be giving this announcement some serious scrutiny,"" Anthony Dale wrote on Twitter.

""We can't have hallway health care in a pandemic.""

Nearly 89% of confirmed cases resolved

The additional cases of COVID-19 reported today mean that Ontario has now seen a total of 36,839 infections of the novel coronavirus since the outbreak began in late January.

Of those, 88.7 per cent are considered resolved by the Ministry of Health.

The province's official death toll from the illness grew by three in today's report and now sits at 2,722. A CBC News count based on data provided directly by public health units, however, puts the real toll at 2,756 as of yesterday evening.

About three quarters of all deaths were residents in long-term care homes. Health officials are currently tracking ongoing outbreaks in 23 facilities.

Meanwhile, Ontario's network of about 30 community, commercial and hospital labs processed some 20,896 test samples for the virus since the last update. Another 7,837 are in the queue waiting to be completed.

The incident, some of which was captured on video, shows the need to address systemic racism both in the community and in policing, according to an academic who studies racism in Canada.

""When, in the particular culture of the current environment where race issues — and particularly the Black-white police relationship is in such tension — it strikes me as concerning the officer acted the way he acted in the current environment,"" Kathy Hogarth, an associate professor of social work at the University of Waterloo, said.

Rayan Babiker said she and four friends were driving around Sunnyside in northwest Calgary at around 2:40 p.m. on June 3, looking for parking before they planned to meet a friend and head to a Black Lives Matter vigil downtown.

One of the women in the car had been holding a Black Lives Matter sign up to the window and shouting the motto as they drove, usually to honks or waves from passersby.

The women said they drove past a white man engaged in what appeared to be a heated conversation with a Black man. The woman in the car yelled ""Black Lives Matter"" as they drove past and in response they said the man yelled back, ""Shut the f--k up, [N-words].""

The women shouted back ""f--k you"" and other expletives at him, and drove on.

'We were shocked'

""We were shocked. Yes, we've experienced racism, but never in broad daylight, and this man felt this was a safe environment for him to say that,"" said Babiker.

The women found parking and were walking to meet their friend when they came across the man again, in a different spot than the direction he had been walking. They said it seemed as if he had walked toward where they had parked. At this point, they start recording video on their phones.

The women confronted him, daring him to repeat what he had just shouted at them.

""You were so keen on calling us [N-words] when we were in the car, how do you feel now?"" one of them asked, while others shouted, ""Black Lives Matter.""

The man swore at them and began to walk away when one of the women splashed water from a water bottle onto his back, wetting the left sleeve of his polo shirt.

The man spun, lunging and grabbing 20-year-old Fatima Osman — who hadn't thrown the water — by the neck.

Watch an edited excerpt of cellphone video of the altercation below. CBC News has blurred the face of the man because police have not confirmed his identity or charged him. CBC has also bleeped out profanity.

""Some water got thrown at him, I'm not sure what happened because it was behind me,"" she said.

""He got angry. He choked me and he punched me in the face …. I tried to grab him and do something to defend myself but he ran away.""

CBC News has not been able to confirm the identity of the man in the video and has blurred his face in the video as he's not currently facing charges.

A company, the logo of which is shown on the man's shirt, confirmed he is a former employee but said due to privacy legislation it was unable to comment further as to when the man left the company.

""We are deeply saddened to be associated with this in any way as we do not condone racism or violence under any circumstance,"" a company spokesperson said in an email.

Osman said she was hit in the face and a necklace of sentimental value to her was torn off. She shared a photo with CBC showing her bruised cheekbone.

""My face for a whole week after that, the side he punched, the left side was green and swollen. Even now it's kind of green and it kinda hurts when I touch it.""

The video's shaky, but as it resumes, it shows Osman pushing back at the man and grabbing his shirt, and the women trying to chase the man off, as he lunges in what the women said seemed to be an attempt to tear off the hijab of another woman in the group, before running off down the street.

Police arrive

They followed him, yelling at him and continuing to film. They were about to call the police to respond when they spotted a police officer driving up.

Babiker said they had planned on following him until they could get authorities to respond, so they were relieved to see a police officer.

The women, yelling over each other, told the officer variations of the same statement, ""He hit her, we have it on camera.""

The officer spoke with the man first, motioning to the women to calm down and give him some space. He asked the man for his ID, then told the man he could walk away before speaking to the women.

""We were all trying to say the same thing, but he felt like, I don't know, we weren't listening to him, he went to the offender here ... we felt like we wasted our time following this man around trying to get justice,"" said Babiker.

A female officer arrived a few minutes later and, after calming the group down, listened to their accounts of what had happened.

Professor troubled by police response

Hogarth, author of A Space for Race: Decoding Racism, Multiculturalism, and Post-Colonialism in the Quest for Belonging in Canada and Beyond, said she was troubled watching the video, seeing the officer let the man walk away before trying harder to obtain the women's perspective of what happened.

The Calgary Police Service said that, when coming across heated confrontations, it's common practice to separate parties to de-escalate a situation.

""Given the man was alone, it was easier to speak with him and send him on his way. Officers obtained his identification and followed up with him shortly after,"" an emailed statement from police read.

Osman said while she understands why the officer spoke with the man who hit her first, she felt disregarded.

""I understand that their protocol is to go to the person who actually punched,"" she said.

""At the same time, we were five young girls in distress, I had just told you this man punched me.""

Osman and her friends said they have since met with police to provide statements about what happened.

Osman said the detectives were kind and helpful, and she's hoping for justice, but she was concerned by one question an officer asked her.

She said police asked her why it was OK for her, a Black woman, to use the N-word, but when a white man used the same word she got angry.

""It was frustrating,"" Osman said, adding that when she uses the word, she's not using it with hate or as a slur against other Black people.

Police confirmed they are actively investigating the incident and said they cannot discuss the matter as it may eventually be before the courts.

""The file is being thoroughly investigated including interviews with those involved to gain full context and perspective before completing the investigation and consulting with the Crown,"" an emailed statement read.

Police said if anyone involved is dissatisfied with the investigation, they are encouraged to file a complaint through the Professional Standards Section.

Our system is not working for all of us ... until it works for all of us, it is not working for any of us. - Kathy Hogarth, social work professor

Babiker said this incident has changed her relationship to the police.

""I actually see the police as people who can potentially protect me but after [this] incident, that the only time I actually called them in and wanted their assistance, they failed to deliver ... since I had [this incident] on video, I thought I had the upper hand here,"" she said.

""It had me think maybe next time I shouldn't say anything or even try to ask for help or defend myself.""

Hogarth said Babiker's reaction to her experience should resonate with Black and Indigenous people of colour across the country.

""This is exactly what happens when victims of crimes cannot trust the system in place through experience, whether that's direct experience or vicarious experience ... but when victims cannot trust the systems that are in place to protect them will actually protect them, those victims are forced to suffer in silence,"" Hogarth said.

Kathy Hogarth, associate professor in the School of Social Work at Renison University College at the University of Waterloo, says the incident and police response will likely resonate with many BIPOC. (Submitted by Kathy Hogarth)

""We have strayed very far from the model of serve and protect because we serve and protect only a certain class of citizens ... we need change.

""Our system is not working for all of us ... until it works for all of us, it is not working for any of us.""

Hogarth pointed to recent comments by Calgary's police chief, who said he used to think systemic racism was not a problem in his force but that now he is not so sure.

Hogarth said the growth in that statement shows the dial is moving but perhaps not quickly enough.

""Systems that are absolutely built on racism are absolutely trying to deny the existence of it. We cannot begin to address systemic racism when those who hold responsibility for those systems deny the existence of it,"" she said.

""Until it becomes in the best interest of leadership to see the problem under their rule, under their responsibility, until it becomes in their best interest to see those issues, we will need change.""",[]

The body was discovered five days after the 33-year-old Rivera disappeared on Lake Piru, where her son was found July 8 alone a few hours after the two rented a boat, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office said.

Authorities would not immediately say if the person found was Rivera but said the day after she disappeared that they believed she drowned in the lake northwest of Los Angeles. A 2 p.m. PT news conference was scheduled.

The lake, an hour's drive from Los Angeles, was searched by dozens of divers working in waters with little visibility, with help above from helicopters, drones and all-terrain vehicles.

Search crews made the discovery in the northeast area of the lake, and the body would be flown 64 kilometres to the coroner's office in Ventura, said Sheriff's Capt. Eric Buschow.

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons on the Fox musical-comedy Glee.

Her family has been notified of the discovery, said Buschow.

""I can't imagine what it's like for her parents, her family,"" he said. ""It takes an emotional toll on the search teams, too.""

Son found on drifting boat

The actor had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said. Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn't, according to a sheriff's office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life-jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera's purse and identification. Rivera is believed to have drowned ""in what appears to be a tragic accident,"" the statement said.

The boy, Rivera's son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The crash happened Saturday night during a race on a dirt track in Grain Valley.

Balcaen, 28, was sent to hospital but tweeted shortly afterwards that, despite the injuries and a ""very sore body with limited mobility,"" she was doing well.

""I'm in the mend,"" she posted, thanking everyone for their concern and suggesting she might be released from hospital on Monday.

Balcaen, who grew up in Winnipeg and now lives in North Carolina, made history in the fall of 2016, when she became the first Canadian-born woman to win a NASCAR-sanctioned race in the United States.

Struggles to land sponsorships have kept her from jumping fully into the NASCAR stock car racing circuit. In the meantime, she has been tearing up oval dirt tracks as part of the National Powri Series, racing in the open-wheeled midget class.

It was in one of those vehicles that flipped high in the air on Saturday, rolling numerous times before hitting the ground and rolling several more times.

In a Twitter post that shows video of the crash, Balcaen said she is not sure what caused it.

On Sunday, she tweeted an update, noting a new round of X-rays showed her lung ""is looking much better.""

I’m feeling better by the hour guys! Doing some more xrays this afternoon and hopefully be let out of here by tomorrow! Thank you to the racing community/family & my crew for being there for me last night & the nurses & doctors here in Missouri for all you guys have done♥️ —@amberbalcaen10

Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman responded on Twitter to Balcaen's original post about being in the hospital, sending her well wishes.

""From all of your friends back home in Winnipeg, get well, @amberbalcaen10!"" he wrote.

After Balcaen's historic win in 2016, Bowman held a ceremony at city hall where he presented her with the Outstanding Achievement Award.

Now, he says the opposite is true.

Neasloss is the elected chief councillor of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, and the co-author of a new study on the genome of the spirit bear, a.k.a. Kermode, a rare, white-furred variant of the black bear in B.C.'s Central and North Coast regions.

The research found that the bears — which are culturally significant to Indigenous Peoples in the area — are less common than previously believed, and that more work needs to be done to protect them.

""It's probably one of the rarest bears on the planet,"" Neasloss told As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal. ""And through our latest research, we found out it's a lot more rare than we thought.""

The study was published in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence .

His first 'magical' encounter with a spirit bear

Neasloss is the resource stewardship director of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, whose people have a deep connection with the spirit bear.

But he didn't even know they existed until he saw one up close for the first time in the early 2000s.

He was working as an ecotourism guide in central B.C. when his supervisor told him to go look for one.

""I thought they were just pulling my leg,"" he said. ""I never heard about it in my community.""

Nevertheless, he set off on a hike to explore the forest.

""A few minutes into the trek, I basically almost came face-to-face with a spirit bear. And here he was walking across the forest with a salmon in his mouth,"" Neasloss said.

""I'll never, never forget that moment.""

As the creature plopped down in front of Neasloss to feast on its fish, he says the clouds parted and the sun shone down.

""And there was the spirit bear, pure white coat. And he was sitting there eating the salmon, and you see all the blood on his face,"" Neasloss said.

""And that was certainly a very magical moment and kind of helped propel me into sticking with tourism.""

Combining science with First Nations knowledge

When Neasloss asked his nation's elders why he had never heard of the bear, he says they told him they kept quiet about the animal to protect it from those who would hunt it for its fur.

""So it was kind of a big secret. Up until, you know, kind of the late '90s, nobody really knew about spirit bears,"" he said.

Now, the spirit bear is the provincial mammal of British Columbia, a major tourist draw, and a powerful symbol for conservation efforts.

""[In] today's day and age, I think we're starting to shift our focus and trying to be a bit more vocal with it, because ... these bears are under a number of threats.""

Still, Neasloss says very little is known about spirit bears. That, he argues, makes it hard to enact policies to protect them.

It's also why he participated in the study, which was an eight-year collaboration between First Nations stewards from the Kitasoo/Xai'xais and Gitga'at First Nations, the University of Victoria, the Spirit Bear Research Foundation and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation.

""We thought we would drive the science ourselves,"" he said.

""We also merged our science with First Nations knowledge and hopefully are able to provide some strong information to decision makers so we can do more to protect them.""

Researchers worked with members of the First Nations to collect fur samples from 385 black bears along 18,000 square kilometres of the Great Bear Rainforest using non-invasive wire corrals and ""extremely stinky"" scented lures.

The bears were drawn to the alluring scent of fish oil or beaver anal gland secretions and would rub up against the wire for a good scratch.

Scientists were then able to study the samples in the lab to determine how many bears carried the recessive gene that produces the unique reddish-white coat on some black bears — the same gene that causes red hair in humans.

""CSI-style, from each hair, we determined the individual bear's genetic fingerprint, sex, species and for black bears, the specific carriers of the spirit bear gene,"" Christina Service, wildlife biologist for the Kitasoo/Xai'xais Stewardship Authority, told the Vancouver Sun.

The gene that produces the spirit bear's white fur is rarer than previously believed, according to a new study. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press)

They discovered the genetic variance is 50 per cent rarer than previous estimates.

They were also able to map the populations and found that only half of the areas with high concentrations of spirit bears are protected.

From science to advocacy

Armed with this information, Neasloss now hopes he and his colleagues can convince governments to create new conservation areas aimed specifically at protecting the creatures.

""The spirit bear is very important in our part of the region. There's a few communities that revere it as a very sacred animal,"" he said.

""I would say it's not just important culturally, but also in terms of economics. I mean, we built a tourism lodge and this is one of the only places in the world that you can come and view a spirit bear.""

Depp said the fight came after Heard's 30th birthday party, and hours after he had learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a ""haymaker"" at him.

Depp's lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

""A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch, effective if it reaches the target,"" Depp said.

""I have come across it,"" noted the judge.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper's executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater."" He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year, and the divorce was finalized in 2017.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard's 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had attended a meeting and been told that his former business managers had ""stolen my money.""

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said ""this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it's quite embarrassing — apparently I had made $650 million (all figures US)"" much of it through his involvement with the Pirates of the Caribbean films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million he was ""$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.""

Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

Depp testified for 5 days, denied hitting Heard

During five days in the witness box, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He called the relationship ""a crime scene waiting to happen."" But he denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

The Sun's defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp's violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet.

Following Depp's testimony, his former personal assistant Stephen Deuters was in the witness box. He contradicted Heard's account of an incident during a flight by private plane from Boston to Los Angeles in May 2014. Heard alleges the actor went into a rage, slapped her and kicked her in the back because he believed she was having an affair with actor James Franco.

Depp has denied assaulting Heard or being out of control.

Deuters, who is now the European head of Depp's production company, said Depp was quiet and ""introverted"" on the plane. He said the couple had ""an argument of sorts,"" but ""it didn't seem to be a screaming-obscenities slanging match.""

In a written witness statement, Deuters said the actor ""made a playful attempt to tap (Heard) on the bottom with his shoe"" but didn't kick her.

Deuters acknowledged in court on Monday that he sent Heard a text message after the flight saying Depp was ""incredibly apologetic and knows that he has done wrong,"" but denied that meant he agreed with her version of events.

In the text, which was read aloud in court, Deuters wrote that ""when I told him he kicked you, he cried.""

While testifying, Deuters said he used the word ""kicked"" because Heard had used it and he was trying to calm her down. He said Depp did not kick Heard.

""I was seeking probably to deflate the situation. It wasn't my job to be a relationship counsellor,"" he said.

In his written statement, Deuters also alleged that Heard ""was the abuser in the relationship. She had subjected Mr. Depp to years of abuse.""

Marriage broke down for good after birthday party

Depp has strongly denied all of Heard's allegations, including a claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia, where Depp was appearing as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film.

Deuters agreed that the couple had an altercation, which ended up with their house being trashed and Depp's fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him, a claim she denies.

Depp said Monday that he had surgery on the severed finger when he returned to the U.S. and developed a ""painful"" superbug infection, MRSA.

He said the marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed after the April 2016 birthday party, a mishap Heard blamed on her Yorkshire terriers.

Carpentier was last seen Wednesday with his daughters in a convenience store in the Saint-Nicolas neighbourhood of Lévis, Que.

His car, badly damaged and abandoned, was found about five kilometres west of that store on Highway 20, just an hour later.

On Thursday, police issued an Amber Alert for the girls. It ended when their bodies were discovered in the forest on Saturday.

They were taken to hospital and later declared dead.

Mathieu said that all evidence so far leads them to believe that Carpentier was in the car with his daughters at the time of the crash, but the only one who could tell them that for sure is Carpentier himself.

""Martin Carpentier is the key to understanding the entire event,"" Mathieu said.

The dense forest in the area as well as the humid and rainy weather over the weekend have made the search particularly challenging, Mathieu said.

Though police had previously used the help of volunteers in their search for the girls, Mathieu is now calling on residents to stay away from the area so as not to slow down the investigation.

She is also asking that Quebecers avoid misinformation and rumours that have been circulating about the case online.

Canadian soldiers helped the officers with their search of the area over the weekend but have since left. Mathieu said they can be called back if the need arises.

Premier François Legault said Monday that, like the rest of the province, he is shocked and saddened by the death of the two girls. He urged anyone in crisis to get help.

Parents, he said, can call Ligne Parents at 1-800-361-5085.

""Anybody who is at the end of their rope, as they say, before doing something stupid, please call and ask for help. There is no shame in getting support.""",[]

That coincides with the start of the province's two-week construction holiday, when tens of thousands of Quebecers take their summer vacation.

""It's better to wear a mask than to be confined at home,"" said Premier François Legault in making the announcement Monday afternoon. ""It's not fun wearing a mask, but it's essential.""

The regulation applies to everyone age 12 and up, although Legault said even children as young as two could be encouraged to wear a mask. People with a medical condition that precludes them from wearing one will be exempted.

Legault said the government took time before making masks mandatory to get people used to the two-metre distancing rule, which he said is the most important one to follow.

""I am asking all Quebecers to collaborate. We need to respect the two-metre [rule],"" Legault said.

He also stressed the importance of keeping gatherings to a maximum of 10 people.

The indoor mask regulation will apply to retail stores, malls and recreational centres and any other enclosed public space, including restaurants, whenever someone is not seated at a table.

Business owners are responsible for applying the new regulations. If they fail to, they could face fines of between $400 and $6,000.

To start, only businesses will face fines

As of Aug. 1, individuals who refuse to wear masks could also face fines. For now, that won't happen, but people without masks could be denied entry to indoor establishments.

Dr. Karl Weiss, a microbiologist and the head of infectious diseases at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital, said wearing a mask is a temporary measure that has to become as much of a habit as stopping for a red light.

""It's not a debate. It's something that everyone has to use,"" said Weiss. ""It has to be apolitical.

""The day we have an effective vaccine, the mask will disappear.""

Weiss said several studies have proven the effectiveness of using a mask to limit the spread of coronavirus micro-droplets.

Last week, Dr. Horacio Arruda, the province's public health director, said he was evaluating the possibility of making masks mandatory after Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante said she planned to do so.

As of today, wearing a mask or face covering is mandatory on public transit across the province.

Financial impact worries businesses

In a news release, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said although its members understand that asking customers to wear masks is important to contain the spread of COVID-19, they are concerned about the cost.

""Only 20 per cent of Quebec businesses are earning their usual income for this time of year,"" said the CFIB. ""Many cannot afford to lose customers and will bear the additional costs of purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE).""

The federation is asking for financial assistance to purchase PPE for workers.

The last thing Quebec's merchants want is to close up shop because of an outbreak of COVID-19, said Stéphane Drouin of the Quebec retail council.

He said shop owners will apply the new regulations responsibly, and he has faith customers will comply.

""In Montreal, many people accept that they have to wear the mask,"" Drouin said. ""I can understand that in the regions, where there hasn't been a case for two or three months, it may require a greater social acceptability.""



For Étienne Cummings, director of public relations and government affairs for Quebec City's chamber of commerce, the new regulation was a logical next step, although it will not be easy for merchants to turn away customers who refuse to wear mask.

He said he hopes the new rule won't discourage Quebecers from continuing to support local businesses.",[]

Born Kelly Kamalelehua Smith on Oct. 13, 1962, in Honolulu, Hawaii, Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television beginning in the 1980s, including the 1985 teen comedy Mischief, 1986's Space Camp and her breakthrough, 1988's Twins. Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger's character.

Preston was first married to actor Kevin Gage. They divorced in 1987.

The year after, Preston met Travolta while shooting the 1989 film The Experts, about a Soviet KGB agent who hires hip New Yorkers to update the spy program's understanding of American society. They meet on the dance floor after Travolta asks, ""Does anyone here know how to dance?"" Preston responds: ""I know how to dance.""

The pair were married in 1991 at a midnight ceremony in Paris while expecting their first son, Jett.

Preston had a lengthy acting career in movies and television, starring opposite Kevin Costner in the 1999 film For Love of the Game. In 2003, she starred in What a Girl Wants and as the mom in the live-action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat. The following year she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved.

Preston gave one of her most well-received performances in Jerry Maguire as the ex-fiancee of Cruise's sports agent who dumps him early in the movie. The Daily News called her ""icily effective.""

Russell Crowe tweeted that he met Preston ""first in late '92 I think,"" adding that while he hadn't seen Preston much, ""when I did, she was always the same sparkly eyed gem.""

Actor Daniel Dae Kim recalled Preston's kindness to him early on in his career.

""I was lucky enough to work with her on one of my very first films, For Love of The Game. We were shooting on cold days in Colorado, but she couldn't have been warmer or kinder to a young, nervous actor trying to make good,"" he posted online.

Preston occasionally appeared in films with her husband, although the results were seldom among either's best work. Among them: the box-office bomb Battlefield Earth in 2000 and the 2009 Disney comedy Old Dogs, also with their daughter, Ella Bleu.

Death of son Jett

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas.

The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million US from the actors in exchange for not releasing sensitive information about their son's death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time but decided to stop pursuing the case, and it was dismissed. He cited the severe strain the proceedings and his son's death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston's first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, The Last Song, which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

In addition to Jett and Ella Bleu, who was born in 2000, the couple had son Benjamin in 2010.

Ella wrote on Instagram Sunday: ""I have never met anyone as courageous, strong, beautiful and loving as you. Anyone who is lucky enough to have known you or to have ever been in your presence will agree that you have a glow and a light that never ceases to shine and that makes anyone around you feel instantly happy.""

They last starred together in the 2018 film Gotti, with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss's wife, Victoria.

""Kelly's love and life will always be remembered,"" Travolta said on Instagram.

""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.""

The Public Health Agency of Canada is adding on-site employees at 36 points of entry, including New Brunswick crossings in St. Stephen, Woodstock and Edmundston.

Tammy Jarbeau, a Health Canada spokesperson, said the ""increased presence"" of officials is at the points of entry — including air and land — that see 90 per cent of travellers.

""PHAC officials, including quarantine officers, clinical screening officers and screening officers will be on-site to screen travellers entering Canada at these ports of entry,"" she said.

The news follows a surge in new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., with large daily increases in some of the country's most populous states. That uptick is paired with an increase in traffic across the international border at airports and land crossings, as restrictions are loosened.

Travel across the border has been linked to a new cluster of cases in Prince Edward Island tied to an individual who came from the U.S. with a student visa.

The number of passenger cars crossing the border at Calais, Maine, fell to 5,400 for the month of April. In January 106,000 cars entered the U.S. there. (CBC)

Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Toronto, said medical screening for the virus falls outside the job of Canada Border Service Agency officers.

""That's a problem,"" he said. ""We just assume that we can just charge the customs and immigration folks with essentially doing public health work.""

Furness said he believes the health officials will be used for secondary screening if there is an issue, which could be a question that creates cause for concern. He thinks the decision might have been prompted by the recent increase in cross-border travel.

Land crossings nearly double

Traffic between the U.S. and Canada has dropped since the border closed to non-essential travel on March 21. But recent exemptions have allowed for traffic to enter, including immediate family members, who are required to stay in the country for a minimum of 15 days, with 14 days in quarantine.

Cross-border travel is also permitted for work and study, medical care, health reasons and to maintain the flow of goods and services for essential supply chains.

Two government orders currently restrict travel into Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first blocks entry to foreign nationals except for certain circumstances, while the second closes the U.S.-Canada land border to non-essential travel until July 21.

The volume of people crossing the land border has increased since restrictions began in March, from about 115,000 a week from late April to early May to 175,000 a week in late June. The CBSA says those figures include commercial and non-commercial traffic.

The number of non-commercial highway travellers entering Canada has nearly doubled over that time period, going from about 3,300 a week to about 6,500.

Secondary health screening

Mark Stuart, an agency spokesperson, said officers ask all travellers about their purpose of visit and state of their health and look for visible signs of illness.

""CBSA officers remain vigilant and are highly trained to identify travellers seeking entry into Canada who may pose a health and safety risk,"" he said.

Officers will refer any traveller suspected of being ill to a Public Health Agency staff member for further assessment, regardless of how they responded to questions. They also consider if a person is able to properly self-isolate or quarantine.

The health agency said all ports of entry, including land borders, always have access to quarantine officers through a tele-health system. Only the 36 high-traffic sites will have that staff onsite.

All travellers entering Canada are required to isolate if they have symptoms or quarantine for 14 days without signs of the virus. International arrivals must also complete a contact-tracing form and provide information to allow for physical checks that they are following isolation rules.

People 'want it shut down'

St. Stephen Mayor Allan MacEachern said he believes residents in his border community will feel safer with the new measures.

""People knowing that is put in place, how people will try to bend the rules and try to sneak through even though they could be arrested, you don't know — they won't take that chance now,"" he said.

The mayor said his town is in a ""tough situation"" with the shutdown with families divided and daily life disrupted. St. Stephen also relies on a steady flow of American tourists at its businesses.

Despite close ties with neighbouring Calais, Maine, fears over COVID-19 are prompting calls for the closure to continue.

""Walking on the street or reading comments on Facebook, you can definitely see people want it shut down, they really do want it shut down,"" MacEachern said

Travel restrictions helping

Furness said travel restrictions — despite some flare-ups — have been largely effective at preventing the spread of the virus from the U.S. and internationally. But the risk remains.

""It doesn't take that many people to cause a lot of COVID,"" he said. ""I mean one person can spark a whole outbreak.""

In February and March, CBSA officials began asking screening questions, while airlines began passenger temperature checks.

Those measures do little to catch asymptomatic individuals. Furness said he'd like to see the use of pulse oximeters, a device that checks how much oxygen is dissolved in blood. That level could indicate decreased lung capacity and the possibility of having COVID-19.

The infection control epidemiologist said the key measure of how well governments are managing the crisis is looking at the response when a case gets through.

""The one thing to be afraid of is someone presents at the hospital, they've got COVID, and they have no idea how they got it,"" he said. ""That's what's scary.""",[]

On July 3, 1969, an era had ended for Newfoundland transportation when the train made its last run from Port aux Basques, N.L., to St. John's.

""Now, it's a thing of the past,"" said the CBC's Tom Kavanaugh in a report about the final journey. ""A victim to paved highways and Canadian National's new bus system.""

The train was to be available on standby ""if the bus has trouble during the winter,"" he added.

The final ride

People in cars turned out along the route to watch the train pass by for the last time. (CBC News/CBC Archives)

Many of the travellers on the last Bullet were ""old-timers"" who had taken the train for years. And some of them were employees who didn't think much of the backup plan.

""I think they should be kept on, that's if we get the hard winter,"" said one such veteran. ""If we gets a hard winter ... the bus is no good.""

As viewers watched film of the scenery outside the train, another passenger was heard saying she ""definitely"" didn't like the idea of the train's discontinuation.

""We're going to miss it as an alternative route,"" added another as the train passed the Deer Lake laundromat and a sign for a place called The Spud. ""If you can't get on the bus there was always the train.""

There were pros and cons to the Caribou, which was anything but fast.

""The train is slow, but you can get up and move around,"" said a rider.

Why it died

Low ridership was one reason the train was being discontinued as a transportation option in Newfoundland. (CBC News/CBC Archives)

""The lack of passengers is the reason for the death of the Bullet,"" said Kavanaugh, as a train car full of empty seats was shown. ""Canadian National quotes figures to show that most people prefer the bus — or at least use the bus.""

He said CN had introduced the bus the previous year, and that some dining car staff felt the train service — which CN also operated — had ""been allowed to deteriorate.""

A longtime staffer, one of 60 who was now unemployed, had described dining cars that previously featured ""linen tablecloths, silverware and a varied menu.""

""Now, he says there are paper placemats, stainless steel and a limited menu,"" said Kavanaugh.

For its part, CN had claimed service in Newfoundland was ""comparable to that on the mainland.""

""It said the Bullet had just fallen victim to changes in modern transportation.""

Letters of protest

MPs look through some of the many letters pleading for the return of the Newfie Bullet three years after it ended. 0:56

Reporting in the CBC archives shows that protests over the loss of the service were already underway by September 1968.

In December that year, the Canadian Transportation Commission had conducted a study into phasing out the train. It was followed by a debate in the House of Commons in March 1969.

Three years after the train's end, some Newfoundlanders were still demanding its return.

""As a concerned citizen of Newfoundland I hereby give support for the restoration of rail service to this province,"" read a man identified as a Newfoundland MP who had pulled a letter from a barrel stuffed with correspondence.

""And by doing so, show my dissatisfaction with the way Newfoundland is being treated in regards to a safe and adequate transportation service.""",[]

Close calls and brushes with death had stalked the scion of the Musitano crime family for years.

He survived one shooting that peppered his home with bullet holes in 2017, and another, just over a year before his death, that sent him to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds.

""He was a dead man walking,"" said Antonio Nicaso, a Mafia expert who teaches courses on organized crime at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.

""In the world of the Mafia, revenge does not lapse. Revenge does not have a statute of limitations.""

Ultimately, the 52-year-old couldn't escape those who were gunning for him. On Friday, he was shot and killed outside a strip mall in Burlington, Ont., west of Toronto.

Halton Region police confirmed Musitano was killed and said another person — who Nicaso said is believed to have been the mobster's close friend and bodyguard — was wounded and remains in hospital in serious condition.

Investigators are searching for a male suspect who fled in a newer model grey four-door sedan ""similar to an Infiniti Q50.""

The vehicle will have ""fresh damage"" on the driver's side near the doors, say police, who are asking anyone who spots it to contact them.

Musitano's death marks the end of a string of violent attempts on his life, but it also raises questions about what will happen next now that one of the most powerful organized crime families in Hamilton is suddenly without a figurehead.

""With the playing field in the underworld being wide open, you're going to have a lot of different groups trying to make a power play,"" said Stephen Metelsky, a criminology professor at Mohawk College in Hamilton and a retired police sergeant.

'Those people never forget, never forgive'

The story of the Musitanos stretches back to the 1970s, when the family was linked to convictions for bombings and extortion, as well as the hit on mobster Domenic Racco in the 1980s.

Pat and his brother Angelo were charged with first-degree murder in 1997 for the contract killing of local Mob boss Johnny ""Pops"" Papalia and one of his lieutenants, Carmen Barillaro.

Angelo Musitano, right, and his brother Pat are shown leaving court in 1998. Pat was killed in a shooting on Friday in Burlington, Ont., while Angelo was killed in a targeted shooting outside his home in 2017. (Hamilton Spectator)

The Musitanos reached a deal and pleaded to conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Barillaro. In turn, the charges against them in connection with Papalia's death were dropped.

Both men were sentenced to 10 years in prison and were released in 2007.

Nicaso said he thinks other underworld figures never forgave Musitano for Papalia's death.

Mobsters can hold grudges for years, quietly hunting targets and harbouring ""festering feelings of revenge"" he said. In the world of the Mob, waiting 23 years for vengeance is nothing.

""There have been cases where revenge has come after 50 years,"" Nicaso said. ""Those people never forget, never forgive.""

Metelsky also traced Musitano's killing back to that of Papalia, pointing out the two deaths are ""eerily reminiscent"" of each other.

""Both mobsters [were] gunned down on the street in broad daylight,"" he said.

The organized crime specialist said Angelo's death in 2017 meant his brother's days were numbered, and the repeated attempts on Musitano's life were ""foreshadowing"" his death.

""The planning and scheming to kill Pat started the day after he survived last year,"" Metelsky said.

Musitano knew his death was coming, according to the professor.

""There's no retirement plan in the Mob,"" he said. ""There's typically three exit options in the Mafia: You go to jail, you're murdered or you put on a government jersey and become a co-operating witness.""

Hard to predict what's next

Nicaso said he's not sure what the next chapter will bring for organized crime in the area.

Mobsters around the world are less visible today and more focused on making money, he said. The two warring factions within the Rizzuto family have reportedly reached a silent agreement to focus on business, not violence, he noted.

""My instinct is to say [Musitano's death] was a kind of mission to revenge a betrayal that took place in 1997 ... but you never know,"" Nicaso said. ""They may have some other issue and may continue with the violence. It's very difficult to predict.""

Regardless, the next moment will be one to watch.

Musitano's death means the family, or at least its namesake, is ""completely decimated,"" Metelsky said.

It's a situation that's left a power vacuum in the underworld and no shortage of groups that might try to fill it.

""Hamilton is a very ripe geographical area for all kinds of criminal rackets,"" Metelsky said, with a location nestled close to Toronto and just a short drive from Buffalo and the U.S. border.

""Will the violence stop? No,"" he said. ""The problem is the violence never stops.""",[]

""There are few players in the game who can impact a team and a fan base the way Tony did in Toronto,"" Blue Jays president/CEO Mark Shapiro said in a statement.

""Beyond his impressive career numbers, achievements, and accolades, Tony resonated with baseball fans because of how he played the game and conducted himself as a teammate. To wear a patch in his memory is to honour his exceptional life on behalf of Blue Jays fans across the country.""

Pictures began to pop up on Twitter of crowds in Sylvan Lake on Saturday, a beachfront town west of Red Deer.

The posts appear to show groups of people closer than the required two-metre separation on a thin stretch of sand fronting the lake, with spillover crowds in the grassy park enclosing the beach.

Sylvan Lake today - my anxiety was a tad high today😬 Don’t think we’ll be going back. I felt like a Covidiot today 🤦🏻‍♀️ <a href=""https://t.co/ncYWBINIMO"">pic.twitter.com/ncYWBINIMO</a> —@papercandie

""COVID-19 is still here and we must do our part in limiting the spread,"" said Alberta Health spokesperson Tom McMillan in a statement to CBC News on Sunday. ""We continue to recommend that all Albertans physically distance whenever possible, including when at the beach.""

Public health orders require people to maintain a minimum two-metre separation at any indoor or outdoor gathering, with certain exceptions. Provincial guidelines offers flexibility for cohort groups, for example, with households permitted to have close interactions with up to 15 people.

Sylvan Lake was trending on Twitter Sunday afternoon with certain pictures shared hundreds of times.

NDP MLA Janis Irwin commented on a post, saying it was reminiscent of crowded U.S. beaches during recent long weekends.

Damn. Every time I see a pic of a crowded beach in the States, I shake my head at those foolish Americans. But here we are. This is in Alberta. We must do better, friends. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ableg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ableg</a> <a href=""https://t.co/sc2ZQPZ0ie"">https://t.co/sc2ZQPZ0ie</a> —@JanisIrwin

Sylvan Lake, home to about 15,000 residents, swells with thousands of visitors in the summer months as it hosts one of the most accessible beaches for people living in Red Deer, Calgary and Edmonton. Last week, the town announced it had deactivated its Emergency Coordination Centre, with decisions related to COVID-19 returned to regular administrative operations.

At the outset of the pandemic, local officials asked people with summer homes to stay put wherever they spent the winter, noting a local COVID-19 outbreak could overwhelm the healthcare system. Barriers were placed at the entrance of public parking lots around the lake to dissuade would-be beachgoers.

'We're all still vulnerable'

Local resident Greg Dickson says he felt safe in the community throughout the spring. But as the beach regains its status as a popular weekend getaway under relaxed public health restrictions, Dickson says he worries about an outbreak.

""I'm shocked, frankly,"" he said. ""It's like we've forgotten that we're all still vulnerable.""

Dickson says he arrived at the beach on Saturday to meet family members and seek out a possible memorial bench to honour a loved one who had recently died, unrelated to COVID-19. He briefly considered whether to brave the crowd with a mask on, but the 65-year-old and his wife, who has asthma, figured the risk was too apparent.

The visit to the park left Dickson feeling disillusioned. He took pride in the province's response to the COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, he says, but is increasingly distressed by what he sees as a collective disregard for physical distancing guidelines.

""We need each other,"" he said. ""My well-being and health is dependent on my neighbours and that was once comforting, now it's disturbing.

Being outside is not a level of protection unto itself. - Craig Jenne, infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary

Craig Jenne, an infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary, says the pictures are worrisome and indicative of what he called ""COVID fatigue"". People appear to be losing track of the public health guidelines that exist as a condition of the province's relaunch plan, he says.

""If we ignore these, we are going to have problems, we are going to have increased infections. Unfortunately, we may have to go back and close some things, whether it be beaches or even stores and restaurants if we're unable to keep numbers low,"" said Jenne, an associate professor in the department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases.

While early studies suggest the risk of COVID-19 transmission is markedly lower outside, compared to indoors, Jenne says the risk is still ""quite high"" in a large gathering such as the one documented at Sylvan Lake on Saturday.

""In crowding like that, if one person was infected, we can absolutely expect a cluster to develop, so we have to be careful"" he said.

A small amount of wind can begin to disperse the thousands of respiratory droplets we produce when speaking, coughing and sneezing — the same droplets that commonly spread the virus. Even so, the transmission risk still exists, prompting public health experts to issue physical distancing and masks guidelines for outdoor settings.

A study of 318 outbreaks in China found one was connected to outdoor transmission resulting in two COVID-19 cases. Another study of Japanese cases found the risk of transmission was around 18 times higher in a closed environment compared to open air. Both studies are in the pre-print phase, meaning they have not yet been subject to the rigorous oversight of academic peer-review.

""Being outside is not a level of protection unto itself,"" Jenne said. ""If we start packing venues with people, the fact that it's outside is going to offer little protection.""",[]

The band drew criticism on social media after the performance Thursday night as part of the First on First: Dickinson Summer Nights concert series in Dickinson, in the state's southwest.

Spin magazine posted video showing the crowd packed in and not wearing face masks.

""We have had the luxury of hindsight and we would like to apologize to those who disagreed with our decision to fulfil our contractual agreement. The promoter and staff were nothing but professional and assured us of the safety precautions,"" Great White said in a statement on Saturday.

Although North Dakota health officials recommend physical distancing and wearing masks when possible, there is no legal requirement to do so in the state, and Great White said the band nevertheless was ""not in a position to enforce the laws.""

The band is best known for its version of Once Bitten, Twice Shy.

A different iteration of Great White that included longtime frontman Jack Russell — and that performed under the name Jack Russell's Great White — was involved in one of the most tragic concerts in U.S. history in 2003. During a show at The Station nightclub in Rhode Island, the band's pyrotechnics sparked a fast-moving blaze that caused a bottleneck as fans tried to flee. The fire killed 100 people.",[]

To survive here, creatures have to endure intense changes in their surroundings. They have to go from an underwater environment to practically dry land twice a day. Some areas even face hurricane-force waves every 10 seconds.

In Kingdom of the Tide, a documentary from The Nature of Things, we meet some of the unusual and quirky characters that have adapted to survive in such a harsh environment.

Sea stars have an unusual stomach

Sea stars, relatives of the sea urchin, have an unique way of obtaining and consuming their food. They have to move fast to catch their prey before the tide goes out, leaving them stranded in place. Hundreds of tiny tube feet allow them to move quickly underwater. But those feet are also designed for another purpose: opening the shells of mussels.

Once the sea star has latched on to and pried open a mussel shell, even just a crack, it ejects its stomach from within its body and inserts it into the shell. Once inside, the stomach begins to digest the mussel into a gastric soup. Then, it’s as simple as pulling its stomach, and its liquid lunch, back inside its body.

Being well-endowed is key to barnacles’ breeding success

Barnacles are crustaceans often found in the upper parts of the intertidal zone. By secreting a natural glue, they cling to the rocks — and once they’re attached to something, they’re really stuck. But while this might help them when the tide roars in and out, it leaves them unable to move and seek out potential mates.

Barnacles have an impressive adaptation to get around the problem. They’re hermaphroditic, meaning they have both female and male sexual organs; this means they can reproduce with any of their neighbours.",[]

You Can Find Her Stories At Cbc.Ca Television', 'Cbc.Ca Comedy Or Follow Her On Twitter']",,"Comedy seems to have taken on a new shape since the pandemic reared its ugly head, with comedians performing standup from home and finding innovative ways to do what they do best. Some have taken this opportunity to assess their past acts, write new books or standup shows while others may have decided to start an online comedy religion.

Here's what these 14 Canadian comedians say they've been up to during the pandemic and what their plans are for after it's all settled.

Kevin McDonald

Kevin McDonald is a Canadian actor, voice actor and a comedy icon. He is a member of a popular comedy troupe Kids in the Hall which became a CBC series in the late ‘80s. He’s also appeared in shows that defined the ‘90s such as Friends, Seinfeld and That ‘70s Show. His latest Winnipeg Comedy Festival special, “Square Pegs,” airs August 9th on CBC Television. (LEIF NORMAN)

I've done some online talk shows and I've done my charity thing but mostly I'm concentrating on writing.

The Kids in the Hall, we were supposed to start shooting a few weeks ago but since we can't and all the sketches are done, we've been re-writing for five weeks so there's been a lot of writing since February for me.

We're either making the sketches tight and perfect or we're draining the life out of them. I'm also writing a movie and I'm thinking of writing a book of short stories but I'd like to have my movie ready by the time [COVID-19 situation] is over.

Right now Amazon is saying we're going to shoot early next year. Hopefully that'll be the case, you never know. But I'm lucky that I have something waiting and then after that I'll try to sell my movie script that I'm writing now.

Pete Johansson

Pete Johansson is a comedian, writer, actor and podcaster with a number of notable televised and radio appearances — from Just for Laughs, Comedy Central's Premium Blend to CBC's Comics! and two episodes of The Debaters, one of which was nominated for a CSA. He also has a special on Netflix called You Might Also Enjoy Pete Johansson, and has recently released a comedy album, The Adventures of Passive Agressive Suicide Boy. You can watch his Winnipeg Comedy Festival standup, airing August 9th, and his Ha!lifax ComedyFest performances, premiering August 16th, on CBC Television. (Photo by David Cyr )

I took a step back from performing [standup] full time, about two years ago, to go back to university. I'm in my third year now and I'm going to get my degree in cog sci psychology and then I'm probably going to get my masters after that in cog sci AI.

My whole goal is I wanted to understand more how we think, how we function, how we adapt and what comedy means to it. And then I'd like to sort of take some of the higher concept things that scare people and make people nervous about the future and I want to bridge them in a sort of a comedic way — to help people not be afraid of some of the useful tools that we're learning about consciousness itself, the idea of the mind. Because there's lots of people out there that are sort of explaining these things, but they're doing in a real serious, sort of, mean way — in a way that's sort of like isolating or not broad scope.

Whereas I, kind of, think that people like to learn about these things in a funnier, more approachable way of how it can improve their lives and how we don't have to be terrified of a lot of the things that are happening — that the world is moving towards a better understanding of ourselves.

I'd like to maybe get people to laugh away a little bit of that fear that's sort of paralyzing us as a society. - Pete Johansson

There's all these opportunities to do something a little more transformative. And as I look at comedy, especially during COVID-19 right now, I look at people going to Zoom and using different mediums for expressing comedy. I think that I too would like to sort of evolve into maybe slightly evolved format from just straight standup into something a little more complex and engaging.

Jessica Holmes

Jessica Holmes is a comedian, actress, author of Depression: The Comedy and mental health advocate, best known for her role in CBC's Royal Canadian Air Farce.

I've been creating comedy videos for my own sanity at this time — it's only 20% Céline.

As a touring speaker, it will be a while before I'll be back on the road in theatres/convention centres. It was a tough pill to swallow at first, but now I'm enjoying being a full time mom, and doing the odd virtual show. The trick to those ones is, you really have to picture the audience at home. I miss you live audience!

And my plan is just to keep taking care of my and my kids' mental health, one day at a time.

Nick Reynoldson

Nick Reynoldson is a comedian, actor and writer from Scarborough, Ontario. He was a runner-up at SiriusXM’s Top Comic competition and has headlined and appeared in major festivals such as Just For Laughs, the Winnipeg Comedy Festival, NXNE and Kevin Hart’s LOL Network. (Photo by Ryan Bolton.)

I have done a few shows on Zoom from the comfort of my kitchen. Even though I feel the Zoom comedy shows are missing a lot of the heart and soul that makes live standup comedy so special, it's hard to argue with talking smack in your boxers, six feet from your bed.

Of course, I too have grandiose plans for post COVID-19. Just like everyone else I have been quietly working and constantly bettering myself in quarantine. I, in no way, have been ignoring all responsibilities and day-drinking to curb the crippling anxiety of a global pandemic and the fact my job doesn't exist at the moment. I also have been painting.

Mark Critch

Mark Critch is one of the most recognizable faces in Canadian comedy, best known for his work on CBC’s This Hour Has 22 Minutes. He’s also written a book, Son of A Critch, and appeared in the CBC series Republic of Doyle and at countless comedy festivals including JFL, Winnipeg and Ha!ifax. (CBC)

Yeah, I've done a bunch of stuff for different charities and things like that. I made a little short video for a performance for a local creative food sharing association here [in NL]. And also did a little short video for my friend Alan Doyle, fundraising for A Dollar A Day [Foundation]. It's a mental health charity. I think it's been a really great opportunity, actually, to use comedy and music to raise a lot of money for different charities and stuff.

And then, I've been able to do some of these performances with all kinds of different artists from all across the country because, you know, we're all in our old little bubbles together. But because of Zoom and Facebook Live, we can come together. And because people are all in the same boat.

I [also] put out a book. I did a book reading and had a big audience on Facebook Live for that through the National Arts Centre.

Book two. I made a deal with the Penguin Canada and so I have to write my second book. So that's what I've been doing. Quarantine is actually pretty good for writing a book. It takes away all your excuses to put it off.

Garrett Jamieson

Garrett Jamieson is a comedian and one of the founding members of the award winning sketch troupe The BOOM in which he worked with Canadian comedians Scott Thompson, Nikki Payne and Colin Mochrie. He’s also been featured on CBC’s The Ron James Show, at NXNE, the Odd Block Festival, JFL 42 and has opened up on tour for Juno Award-winning metal band, KEN mode.

I have performed from home and it's a nightmare telling jokes to a camera. Not one comic is enjoying themselves. They die a little bit every time they tell a joke in that medium. One could argue smoking is actually healthier. I don't ever plan on doing it again, however if someone were to spontaneously ask me, I would say, ""Yes please, I love performing."" Coincidently, I have quit smoking and started joking. The way I smoke and joke are exactly the same: no filter, one right after the other, and on fire. Also, a friendly warning, if you do watch me doing standup online, be careful — if you take in my second-hand jokes, they can kill. I bought that joke at a second-hand store. You're probably dying of laughter by now. I'll stop... I'm kidding. I can't stop (just like smoking).



I am in the midst of starting an online comedy religion called The God Of Comedy. It'll be a comedy church show live every Sunday where performers (comedy monks) praise the god of comedy and give humorous anecdotes and in turn the audience feels closer to the god of comedy. I'm doing this for tax reasons. This show will be way funnier than Peter Popoff's because we'll be telling the truth. The truth is funny. But, if all this fails, I do have an album coming out at the end of summer called Born Crying Die Laughing, with myself and the band Sprattacus. It's psychedelic music standup comedy that works out your diaphragm. It'll be the hottest audio workout you can get this summer. Perfect for all the people who put on weight a.k.a ""The COVID-19."" Look for it on Comedy Records.

Martha Chaves

Martha Chaves is a comedian, actress, activist and playwright who’s performed on major stages including JFL, Ha!ifax and the Winnipeg Comedy Festivals. She won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Standup Comic of 2017 and is a frequent performer and guest on CBC Radio’s The Debaters, Because News and Laugh Out Loud. (CBC)

Yes, I have done some performances from home. I have even managed to perform at a festival! I did We're Funny That Way for CBC Gem. That one was interesting because my wife and I had to allow Tom, a CBC technician, to enter our quarantined quarters to help with the filming. I am a germaphobe on the best of days, now imagine during the 'rona! But I love comedy and performing so much, that I had no qualms with letting Tom in. After, of course, he was disinfected, masked and gloved, as if he was about to perform brain surgery. Tom's know-how made the taping turn out splendid.

I have also done other online shows, like CBC's Because News , in which I am a regular panel member. I am getting used to it, and I lament that before COVID-19, I dissed YouTube stars for being fluffy. I thought it was easy to talk to nobody from your basement. On top of it, I had to stop my boycott of Amazon because they had to provide me with all the equipment for my makeshift recording studio. Oh, I have everything! Ring light to make me pretty, microphones, even puppets, in case I need to become a prop-act — the works!

My first plan [for post-pandemic] is to survive — so far, so good — and I am writing a lot of new jokes. Nothing will be the same after we come out of this. Hopefully! My act is going through major renovations. It's like COVID-19 is the Property Brothers. Only not as cute.

I am also writing Pandemia Bohemia, a one-person show about my adventures and observations during this challenging time. I feel like Albert Camus writing The Plague but from a funny lesbian perspective. I even made a parody of John Denver's Leaving On A Jet Plane. I can't sing, but still. I'm not leaving on a jet plane. Incidentally, on the 26th of August, I am scheduled to perform at The Winnipeg Comedy Festival on a gala about traveling, which I hope resumes soon. I will also be recording my second comedy album with Howl and Roar.

Jay & Eytan

Jay Wells L’Ecuyer and Eytan Millstone are award-winning filmmakers and a comedy duo based in Brooklyn, New York, originally from Toronto. The pair have written and performed live sketches with Canadian greats, Colin Mochrie and Scott Thompson. Two of their sketch comedy albums reached No. 1 on the iTunes Canada Comedy charts. They’ve also been featured on the front page of Funny Or Die and College Humor. (Shawn McPherson)

As a comedy duo, performing ""together"" from our own homes felt a bit off. As much as we miss the stage, we luckily have another creative outlet with our series, YouTube Comment Theater, where we perform dramatic re-enactments of YouTube comments. We found some great COVID-19-related comment threads and got creative with quarantine filming in our separate apartments.

We've always tried to balance our love of live comedy and comedic filmmaking. Having written and directed a few short films, we've been using this time away from the stage to sink our teeth into a full-length feature. It'd be impossible to film properly right now with the restrictions, but we can write and start pre-production while we wait to get back out there.

Trent McClellan

Trent McClellan is a Canadian household name: a standup comedian, writer, podcaster and actor, best known for his work on CBC’s 22 Minutes. He was also a panelist on Canada Reads and has performed on the Just for Laughs, Ha!ifax ComedyFest and Winnipeg Comedy Festival stages. (CBC)

I've done a few things online in terms of hosting. I hosted a virtual pub night for the local soccer team and I hosted a few other little things online. I focused a lot on my podcast [ The Generators ] and I'm just filling up that library with good episodes and stuff.

I've taken this pause as kind of a bring-everything-back-to-the-warehouse workshop, kind of a retooling of sorts approach to my past work by asking those big questions as opposed to just going on autopilot that we all often do. The big thing I've been doing is kind of going, 'OK, well, when we get a chance to perform live again' — which I'm hoping we will be able to do — 'what do I want to do? What do I want to say? What did I want to fix about how I was doing standup before? What kind of comedian do I want to be?'

At the end of the day, you have to be authentic to yourself. Something that I'm amazed that a lot of people, especially in the comedy world, don't talk about, is happiness. They talk about success: I've got this festival, I got the show and whatever. It's like, 'Yeah, but are you happy?' Comedy comes with a real backpack of challenges from anxiety to job insecurities so I think being happy is the ticket to success.

I think that's been one of the spinoffs of this whole pause of society, giving us that ability to quiet all the noise and ask ourselves those questions.

Many comedians are going to saturate every show with comments about COVID-19. But I go like, 'Nah, I'm not going down that road because that's going to be beaten to death a month after shows start back up again.'

Meg MacKey

Live performances from home can be quite challenging. Especially given my current situation, where I've had to leave Toronto to look after family members who live in a very remote area, with limited internet and cellphone coverage.

I've found that treating the performance like a YouTube video (that you can't edit) or like you're doing a live sketch is a lot more helpful. As a standup I rely on a lot of crowd interaction/energy so losing that means that the material has to change out of necessity. I've also used the lack of stable internet connection to my advantage in performance.

Fortunately, this has given me the time and opportunity to collaborate with another comedian who I admire greatly, but we'd always been too busy to work on something concrete. We'll hopefully have something completed in the next six months — I'm aiming for early/mid-2021.

I did a handful of shows over Zoom early in the pandemic, but it's been a while now. They make me feel insane — sitting in a chat room with five other comics, just trying not to look at myself. It definitely doesn't feel all that much like doing standup, it feels more like delivering a eulogy to standup. Like, 'we've all gathered here today to pay our respects to my joke about dating…'

Honestly, I don't really have any major creative projects on the go as of now. I kept hearing a lot of folks saying, 'it's OK if you aren't productive in quarantine,' and I really took that to heart I guess. I have saved all of the thirst traps I've taken over the course of the pandemic to a private folder called ""Quaran T'n A"" so maybe I'll release that in a nice photo-journal. Black and white probably.

Dena Jackson

Dena Jackson is a Toronto-based comedian, speaker, writer and host of the Ego Podcast whose writing has been featured on CBC Comedy and the Beaverton. She’s delivered several talks for university and corporate audiences, including a TEDx focused on mental health and mindfulness, and has performed at numerous festivals including JFL42.

I learned very early on during this pandemic that online comedy shows are not for me. While I completely support anyone performing in them 'cause we all need an outlet, I feel that standup comedy is a live art. If I can't connect with my audience's laughter (or lack thereof), I find it impossible to read the room — which to me is an integral part of standup comedy.

I also do public speaking and I've been giving online talks during isolation. Giving a talk is different from doing your comedy act because you're not working for laughs, you're speaking to a group, so the pressure is off in that way. If I'm being honest, I like the online talks better than doing live talks in some ways because you can still be interactive and encourage your audience to ask questions in an online forum.

I love hearing that so many other artists are getting creative and working on new projects. I love seeing what comedians are doing these days too. I'm noticing my peers painting, working on scripts, poetry, podcasts and lots of videos about 2020 life. Comedians and artists are the best at commenting on life in general and I love seeing how they put it all together so that we can laugh no matter how hard things might be.

I've been working on a fiction novel and it's something I started 13 years ago and finally committed to finishing. I had to adjust my writing style for it (as comedy writing is succinct and to the point) but I'm really enjoying working on this book.

I have not done any stand up since COVID-19 hit. There's something about a zoomed-in head that's really unappealing to me but I have been working on my Zoltar impressions in the event that I need to talk to the Power Rangers. Also, I'm aware that that's possibly a ""deep"" reference.

Other than the impression work, I have been working on some scripts/writing packages and have actually filmed a Social Distance short film that's been accepted in some isolation festivals. I'm trying to stay positive during this time and focusing on growing other skills.",[]

Over the course of the summer, we'll be highlighting some of the individual performances that were included in the cabaret.

There is no performer on this planet quite like Yovska, and we've been very lucky to have him be part of both our series Canada's a Drag and our recent special CBC Arts Presents Queer Pride Inside: A Buddies in Bad Times Cabaret. A Toronto-based designer and drag performance artist, Yovska categorizes himself as a ""drag creature"" dressing up as a variety of different monsters with a dash of fashion. He relates the themes of the paranormal and fantasy to his experiences growing up as queer and immigrant in Canada. By reclaiming the form of monsters and aliens, Yovska is able to turn negative stereotypes into empowering alter egos.

Yovska (CBC Arts)

For Queer Pride Inside, Yovska decided to offer up a timely, haunting piece entitled ""Pandemic is a Drag.""

""My video deals with anxieties and fears of going outside and what is outside during this quarantine time,"" Yovska says. ""The monsters looking in from the windows and creeping around the house stand as metaphors for the fears of uncertainty that loom around the corner. It's about being in the dark, and I relate this to the idea of keeping a light on because you're scared of what could be hiding in the shadows of your room.""

Five of them were fatal. The CBC Docs POV film Above the Law looks at the stories of three individuals who appear to have been the victims of excessive force by Calgary police.

One of them is Godfred Addai-Nyamekye. In December 2013, the then 26-year-old student and immigrant from Ghana, was detained late at night by two police officers who maintain he was intoxicated — a claim Addai-Nyamekye refutes. They put him in a police vehicle and drove him to an isolated location, abandoning him in the cold wearing only a tracksuit and sneakers.

When he called 911 for help, another officer arrived and proceeded to beat and Taser him. Addai-Nyamekye was later charged with having assaulted the officer but was acquitted, in no small part because a Calgary police helicopter captured the violent arrest on video.

After being abandoned by police in a desolate construction site in -28 C weather, Godfred Addai-Nyamekye called 911. After 15 minutes, a different officer, Const. Trevor Lindsay, arrived on the scene, and Addai-Nyamekye was tasered and beaten. Following the incident, Addai-Nyamekye was charged with having assaulted Const. Lindsay, but helicopter footage of the event helped to prove otherwise. 0:54

In 2018, the Calgary Police Service released an independent review on the use of force by Calgary police containing 65 recommendations pertaining to officer recruitment, training, use of force and provincial oversight.

Harpreet Aulakh is an associate professor in economics, justice and policy studies at Mount Royal University in Calgary who studies diversity issues in the criminal justice system. Here, she discusses how policing needs to change in Canada to address issues pertaining to systemic racism and use of force.

Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Harpreet Aulakh, associate professor at Mount Royal University (Lost Time Media)

Why is now a good time to discuss changes in policing?

This is the perfect time to have the conversation around addressing the use of force, around systemic racism. These events have exploded among racialized communities and police forces around the Western world.

It cannot just be a matter of choice, but a matter of necessity for the police departments to address these issues because positive relations between community members and police are essential for safer communities.

What are some of the problems with policing right now?

It has a lot to do with our racist history, our racist past. The history of our country was based on racism, including the foundations of policing in Canada.

The whole philosophy around policing strategies needs to change because the traditional practices have damaged the police–community relationship. These policies are enforced in low-income and high-crime neighbourhoods, which are more likely to be inhabited by ethnic minorities.

Traditional policing strategies provide incentives for the officers and are designed to reward officers for the number of stops conducted, arrests made, [the] number of civilian contact cards completed. And these interactions increase the negative contact with the residents.

Even a very non-violent, non-confrontational interaction with the police officer and a racial minority member could be perceived under the anxiety that, ""Am I being singled out?"" Even if the right police officer is being unbiased, he would have that anxiousness in mind, ""Will I be judged a racist?"" These tensions need to be resolved.

What changes need to be made to policing?

If we want to change the whole policing strategy, we need to change it in practical ways. The officer should be aligned with the cause of increasing trust and positive engagement with the community.

For example, there should be incentives for how many young offenders were diverted away from the justice system. Or whether the police officers engage with the community members and how many positive, constructive relationships are built. The number of times they were able to resolve a situation without an arrest. Those things should be built into policing itself.

What new skills do officers need to make these changes?

There needs to be a harsh look at all the major branches of the department right from [the start in terms of] education criteria, skills requirements, [recruits'] age and experience.

In many countries in Europe, they look for at least an undergraduate degree. Education is important for applicants in understanding how society works. Think about [the fact that] you can be in the police force just after grade 12. How much experience do you have?

We need to look at the qualifications of the recruits, our skill requirements, our training programs. There should be a mandatory communications skills training program, and year after year, [officers] should be developing their skill sets.

If we expect to not use force or use force less — and also increase the use of verbal communication [in] resolving the situation — then we need to equip them with those skills.

Everything should be on the table for open discussion. This is the time to set the tone for job culture in the department.

Are there any concrete examples of police departments that have successfully changed their relationship with their community?



There is a small police department in California, Stockton PD . What they do is they involve community members in some of their training. They talk about the local history of police with racialized members of the community, and they give local incidents of police brutality from the community perspective.

When do you think change will happen?

I want to be hopeful. This is the perfect time. If we get good command and leadership in different levels of the police departments, I think they have a chance. Change is slow, but it has to happen.

""Homemade pasta, tossed through a seriously indulgent sauce of cream, Parmesan and fresh truffle, this is a well-known Italian dish that I cooked up for Goldie Hawn — she loves it! This is my tweaked version of the original, swapping in single cream to make it a little less naughty."" - Jamie Oliver

Fettuccine Alfredo

By Jamie Oliver

Ingredients

½ x Royal pasta dough (see below for recipe)

Semolina, for dusting

150 mL double cream

150 mL double cream

1 large free-range egg

60 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve

Optional:

Fresh truffle or 1 whole nutmeg, for grating

Truffle oil

Preparation

1. Make the Royal pasta dough, rolling the sheets out to the thickness of a playing card. Set up the fettuccine attachment on your pasta machine and gently run through each pasta sheet. Place on semolina-dusted tray until needed.

2. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil over a high heat, then add the fettuccine and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until al dente.

3. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Gently heat the cream in a large frying pan on a low heat, separate the egg yolk (save the white for another day) and whisk into the pan. Finely grate and gently whisk in the Parmesan, then season well with sea salt and black pepper.

4. Using tongs, drop the fettuccine into the sauce and toss well, adding splashes of the cooking water to loosen into a lovely, silky sauce.

5. Serve with shavings of truffle or gratings of nutmeg (if using), a good grating of Parmesan and a drizzle of truffle oil.

Yield: Makes 4 servings

You Can Find Her Stories At Cbc.Ca Television', 'Cbc.Ca Comedy Or Follow Her On Twitter']",,"CBC's This Hour Has 22 Minutes stars Mark Critch and Trent McClellan are veterans in the Canadian comedy sphere. They've done everything from live performances to hosting to writing for and, of course, starring in 22 Minutes — where they've done sketches and interviewed politicians, musicians and many prominents personalities.

But how different is it working on 22 Minutes versus performing standup, live on-stage? Here's what they had to say.

""They're kind of two different machines,"" says Trent McClellan.

""For 22 Minutes, we tape the show on a Monday night, Tuesday we start writing again, Wednesday we read what we wrote, Thursday and Friday we're shooting it,"" adds Mark Critch.

""The jokes that we do [there] are desk jokes that are really quick. It's like, here's a topic and here's the punchline,"" explains McClellan.

""We don't have the luxury of time because we have to put something out every single week and we don't really get a chance to try it a bunch of times before we put it out to the world. We get one crack at it with a studio audience and then our producers have to decide if that was good enough to make the show that week.""

""Whereas in standup, you can take a bit about wine, for example, and try that twenty times before you ever decide, 'OK, yeah that's good enough to do on a big show or it's good enough to do on tour.' You get to change it and move it around and alter it and adjust it. And so you get far more cracks at trying to perfect it. So they're kind of very different in that regard.""

""And that's not necessarily my style,"" adds McClellan, ""my style is more going into a topic and then there's a number of jokes and angles on this one particular experience or topic. But that's part of the job description and you accept that going in.""

""For me, the way I work generally is very quickly. I've always done it that way,"" says Critch.

""[The Ha!ifax ComedyFest] comes in April, right after 22 Minutes, so we start 22 Minutes in September, I go out there and I write a lot for it and then that ends — and the Halifax festival happens. So, it's kind of like, a lot of my trying out material and club kind of time is taken up.""

""A lot of people would work on the same routine for you know, a year or years. I'm just used to doing stuff and boom, it's done, and move on to the next things. So every time I do something like the Ha!ifax ComedyFest, I write new material just for that and every time I've ever done it there, that's kind of the only time I've done it, really.""

Every comedian has a different approach to creating jokes and McClellan says: ""As an artist you'd like as many attempts at it as you can so that you can put it out and go, 'OK, that was as good as that bit can be.'""

""That's where all the other comedians, of course, they have great routines that they've been perfecting,"" adds Critch, ""so I'm always a little bit nervous before I come out [on stage].""

Critch says he always talks to the stage manager at the Ha!ifax ComedyFest before he goes out, saying: ""'Oh, what am I doing, I just wrote this stuff a week ago? Now I'm about to go out and do it in front of these people while being televised. I'm an idiot. Remind me not to do this'. But I got out there and it's all great.""

""Great thing about these comedy festivals,"" says Critch, ""is people see all these new faces who go on to do amazing things. But they're also seeing a lot of their favourites whom they've come to love year after year.""

""It's one of those moments where I have had that kind of ability to pause and go like, 'Wow, how grateful am I to just be part of this thing?',"" adds McClellan.

When he performed for conservative Muslim audiences, they would get uncomfortable when he started talking about sex.

When he performed midnight shows at comedy clubs, audiences would get just as uncomfortable when he talked about having genuine religious faith.

Those tensions helped to inspire Ramy, an eponymous comedy show about an Arab-Muslim family living in New Jersey.

The program — which also features Oscar winner Mahershala Ali as Sheikh Ali Malik — captures the push and pull between religion and everyday life, or as Youssef puts it, ""Friday prayers and Friday night.""

""That central tension was really important for me to bring out because I felt like there were no depictions of faith or being religious that felt organic to me in the on-screen world,"" says Youssef in an interview with q host Tom Power.

The Christian film genre feels highly sanitized, almost a commercial for the religion, he says, and other films feature priests gone bad or Muslim leaders linked to terrorist organizations.

""All these really blown-out concepts. So for me, this space that is so real for people who do believe, and for people who are navigating that, was the central focus of what I wanted to make,"" he explains.

""If anything, it's more about a person of faith of my generation than it is even specifically about being Muslim.""

'If other people are the problem then so am I'

Religion itself has become such a punch line in modern society, adds Youssef, that tackling religious belief in comedy actually seems edgy.

However he doesn't fault people who are averse to religious culture because, as he puts it, religion has become an industry.

""The way that these real emotions and these real ideals have been manipulated for a lot of bad and a lot of darkness and a lot of shame that is leveraged toward entire societies, the idea that there would be so much anti-religion is completely justified,"" he says.

""And I am very anti-religious culture on the whole. But I connect to faith — and those are different things.""

Youssef says he doesn't have a problem with Islam; rather, he has a problem with its followers. But Youssef isn't pointing fingers at his Muslim culture or community; rather, the show is about pointing a finger at the follower he knows best: himself.

""The core of my work is self-examining, because if other people are the problem then so am I,"" he says.

""I'm not exempt from looking at my hypocrisies and my gaps between what I believe and what I actually do.""

'I'm going to keep this to myself'

For his performance, Youssef won a Golden Globe earlier this year, a Peabody this week, and is a likely contender for Emmy consideration later this year.

The show primarily centres around Youssef's character, but it also features his family and friends — a fact not lost on his father, who has adjusted his behaviour accordingly.

""He'll be in the middle of telling me a story and he'll just cut it off and be like, 'You know what? I'm going to keep this to myself. I'm not trying to have this show up in your stand-up,"" recounts Youssef, who tells the story of his dad's unlikely connection to Donald Trump in his HBO special Ramy Youssef: Feelings.

""And I'm like, 'No, man, I only told, like, two bits about you. I don't mention you that much. We can just talk.'""

In the show, Youssef plays a version of himself — a millennial who's trying to forge his own identity and figure out how religion, relationships and his family fit into his life.

But Youssef, who is Ramy's co-creator, writer and executive producer, reserves the most cutting humour for his own character, and avoids protecting the protagonist or trying to make him look good.

""I really wanted to look at the ego-heavy version of myself. I really wanted to look at what would my life looked like if I went left in the fork as opposed to right,"" says Youssef.

'We all walk around with questions'

He's always been fortunate, he adds: his family is communicative, he has a passion for his work, and he got involved in comedy and film at a young age.

""I've always had this focus, but so much of the character I created for the show is, 'What if I didn't have that? What if I was really succumbing to my ego? What if I didn't find answers to certain questions and I was a little bit more stuck?""

Many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind. - Ramy Youssef

The second season of Ramy was just released on Hulu and Crave. And while the subject matter is serious, and the show tackles pressing issues of racism and anti-Muslim sentiment, Youssef emphasizes that the last thing he's aiming to do is offer answers.

""I think we all walk around with questions and there's even a thought that we're all actively trying to answer our questions, but I would argue that many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind,"" he says.

""My goal in opening up some of these things is to bring people closer to whatever questions they might have.""

Canadian summer is a fleeting season. Before you know it, you'll be spending eight months under a blanket with the heat cranked up, so, while you can, do as many things outside as possible. One great way to do this is taking your summer blockbuster-bingeing outdoors and you can DIY your own scenic cinema. Here's what you need to create one a movie theatre in your own backyard.

Projector

Remember those gigantic, 3-light projectors? We've come a long way since then. Home movie projectors range greatly in price from about $100 to over $1,000. Wirecutter's ""best cheap projectors"" are in the $600-900 range. But Amazon sells wireless projectors for under $200 with multiple connection options, including directly to your smartphone. Users seem to like the resolution of the VANKYO Cinemango 100 Mini Projector. Performance will also depend on the quality and distance from your screen.

VANKYO Cinemango 100 Mini Projector, $188.99, Amazon

Projector screen

Your projector is just part of the equation, of course. While you certainly make it ultra-rustic with a white sheet or a blank wall, this screen can keep your movies looking sharp. This 16:9 formatted screen displays a 100 inch-wide projection and comes with sticky hooks to help you install. It's also made of anti-crease fabric, so go ahead and fold it up into a small bag for easy storage.

Projector Screen, $35, Amazon

Bluetooth speaker

While it would be nice to run some concert-quality speakers out there, space and wiring in the backyard is usually limited (not to mention the potential for complaints from neighbours), so something a little more concentrated is best. Weighing just under one pound, this bluetooth speaker is splashproof and has a strong enough battery to allow up to 15 hours of play time. With full-spectrum audio for clear listening at any volume, the speaker also has a range up to 30 feet, so it can easily accommodate a backyard setup.

Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker, $35.99, Amazon

Inflatable lounger

Watching a 3-hour movie in a lawn chair would be a little uncomfortable and, short of dragging your recliner across the deck, this is the next best thing. This inflatable lounger can be used in a variety of ways, including for a single person to lie in or for multiple people to sit on, like a sofa. The durable nylon fabric is intended for any kind of outdoor terrain. And it has side pockets for your drinks and snacks. Best of all, it inflates instantly by holding it in the wind, so setup is a matter of seconds.

Cozyful Inflatable Air Lounger, $44.95, Amazon

Outdoor popcorn popper

A movie without snacks is no movie at all and this outdoor popcorn maker is a classic addition. A non-stick kettle with a wooden handle that keeps cool, it can be used over your bonfire, campfire or backyard grill.

Coghlan's Corn Popper, $24.99, Cabela's

Utility wagon

If you're having company over for an all-night binge, you'll also need something to hold and transport your snacks and drinks. This wagon folds and sets up in seconds, is able to hold up to 150 pounds and is made with an easy to clean fabric. It contains four cup holders and has a pop-up rear folding table, so you can snack for hours without taking your eyes off the screen.

These ""irregular border crossings"" represent tens of thousands of families and individuals who have travelled across continents in hopes of finding a safe home.

Headlines often describe these crossings as a crisis, a political problem, an urgent issue ahead of an election year.

Filmmaker Cristian Gomes says he was alarmed by some of the rhetoric and reactions he was hearing in the media. He felt the experiences of the real people behind the numbers were getting lost.

""It just shocked me because most people had strong opinions on [asylum seekers] that were just based on false information,"" Gomes says. ""That frustrated me. I wanted to go and explore this type of story and bring some humanity back into the discussion.""

For his short documentary Road to Roxham, Gomes trained his camera on the front lines — an unauthorized border crossing point on Roxham Road, which runs between New York state and Quebec.

'Every story takes a piece from you.'

(CBC Short Docs: Road to Roxham)

Arriving at the border, Gomes not only found asylum seekers hoping to be accepted into Canada, but a whole new economy that had sprung up in the area. Taxi services were suddenly flourishing, picking up travellers from the airport, train station and bus station in nearby Plattsburgh, N.Y., and driving them up the quiet, tree-lined Roxham Road to the Quebec border.

Gomes asked Mary Ann Ero, an American with a taxi service in the area, if she remembered any border crossers in particular.

Ero described a man she drove up Roxham Road: He had lost his wife and children — they had been struck by a train as they attempted to leave the United States. The man was on the same journey now.

Ero cried with the man during the drive. ""He said that he'd never forget me,"" she says in the documentary. ""That was, I think, the best and worst experience, you know … Every story takes a piece from you.""

The police give instructions. The crossings are quiet and orderly. A woman carefully navigates a baby carriage over a snowy bank. Young children drag large suitcases through puddles.

Gomes met one woman, Sofia, who carried stacks of court documents with her as evidence of the domestic abuse she was fleeing. She said she was escaping a man who had already found her in the United States. Her story did not make it into the documentary, but Gomes remembers her because she was travelling with three young children, ""too young to know what was going on.""

Some asylum claims are accepted, some are abandoned or withdrawn, and some are outright rejected.

What happens when asylum seekers are deported? It's a difficult group to track.

The Washington Post published a story in February detailing the torture and murder of deportees, often by gangs. In 2018, The New Yorker outlined the case of a young mother fleeing an abusive ex-husband. After she was deported, her body was found in a burned-out car.

Gomes says that while he doesn't have a personal connection to irregular border crossers, he was motivated by articles in the media and by his own Canadian identity.

""My family is a family of Portuguese immigrants and they came here after World War II — that was kind of my personal connection to it,"" he says. ""I always had that experience frame my perspective. I'm always interested in stories that explore identity, Canadian identity in particular. Who we let in and those [immigration] processes.""

Refugees around the globe

Road to Roxham premiered on YouTube on June 20, which is World Refugee Day.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees had just released its 2019 report showing that 79.5 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide by the end of the year due to ""war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order."" An estimated 40 per cent were children under the age of 18.

At the border between Quebec and New York, Gomes met some of those people.

""Watching the documentary is one thing,"" he says. ""Going there in real life is something entirely different. I think standing at the border all day and just watching families from everywhere — all different ethnicities, all around the globe — cross into Canada gives you a different perspective. Seeing them face-to-face is different than seeing them on camera; it's different than seeing them on the news.""

Gomes hopes viewers listen to their stories.

""It's not really a politics issue; it's more of a human rights issue,"" he says. ""It's just sad to see that that's where the discussion in America and Canada is going. There's no space for the humanity.""

(CBC/CBC Comedy)

Trent McClellan and Shaun Majumder have a few things in common. They've entertained Canadians on This Hour Has 22 Minutes, they're veterans of the standup circuit, they were born in 1972, and they grew up with a mixed-race heritage in overwhelmingly white communities in Newfoundland and Labrador. They've also both used their comedy as a way of talking about racism, and have connected their own lived experiences in routines that poke and prod, yet still leave audiences howling with laughter.

Majumder, the son of an Indian father, was raised by his white mother in Burlington, on Newfoundland's Baie Verte Peninsula.

Born to a Black father and a white mother, McClellan grew up in Corner Brook.

Both comedians talked this week with Bernice Hillier, cohost of CBC Radio's Newfoundland Morning. Here's their conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Bernice Hillier: We've heard people say that racism is not an issue in this province. What's the reality, as you've experienced it here?

Shaun Majumder: I did not experience overt racism, like you might expect. When you hear the word ""racism,"" I'm half-white so there were plenty of tanned-looking fellows walking around the Green Bay area, and so people couldn't quite put their finger on where I was from. But still, even back when I was a kid, there was never any kind of dark racism — and when I say dark, I mean just that energy of heavy, true hate. You know, ""You go down back to your country, where you come from,"" you know what I mean? There was none of that.

Trent McClellan says taking risks is critical for a comedian, and that can include putting race on the list of topics to cover. (CBC)

Bernice Hillier: I want to ask Trent — what was your experience growing up as a person of colour in a mainly white community?

Trent McClellan: I just did a podcast yesterday with four other Black Canadian comedians and we all shared our experiences, and one of the things that was amazing about it was how early in our lives that racism played a role. I remember being called the N-word, probably by the time I was nine, eight or nine. You had to think about this. This is pre-internet, right? So it's not like they could have gone online and learned about what this was. This was taught to them by someone in their family. So I grew up with my white grandparents raising me. I'm like this skinny, scrawny kid with a massive afro — you know, I couldn't have stood out more. It was amazing, just in talking to everybody that was on the podcast, about how early it knocked on their door and how quickly you realize that, ""Oh, this is going to play a role in my life."" So obviously you grow up and you have lots of friends and family who accept you, but I I remember dating people, and their parents weren't cool that they were dating a Black guy.

Since the US election, alt-right white nationalists feel emboldened in their quest to create a utopian society where races never mix. Shaun Majumder sees a different future: beige. 2:07

Bernice Hillier: Shaun, you joke in your standup that when kids in Burlington said they were going to get the Black guy, you said, 'Where's he to?' When did you first realize that your skin colour made you different in the eyes of others?

Shaun Majumder: Like I said, it wasn't overt for me at all. Nobody ever used a racial slur. I mean I guess they did, you know, but it wasn't in the way that someone would be filled with hate to say, ""You are this, so therefore you are different."" They had heard the word, ""Paki"" was the word that they used for me, but it was a loving nickname. My sister talked about it. She was like, ""Some of our best friends [would say], 'Come on, Paki, let's go, we're going up to the dam drinking.'"" It was not driven by hate. I even talked about this in my standup. There was a woman on the show Majumder Manor, for example. The producers asked her what she thought of me and my sister growing up and she was like, ""Oh my God, we loved Shaun and Rani growing up. We loved them so much, they were some sweet. And we'd see him on the bus, the back of the bus, and we'd be like, Look at the two little burnt babies, sitting in the back of the bus."" And this is on national TV! Burnt babies — now, you put this in writing, you're going to be crucified.

Bernice Hillier: It sounds pretty awful.

Trent McClellan: Yeah.

Shaun Majumder: It's awful, but it was coming from a place of love. I struggle … I'm not saying ignorance is an excuse, but I'm telling you, I live in the United States. You see what the African-American experience is here in terms of the dark, dark history, and it reminds me of the First Nations experience in Canada. In terms of the multi-generational damage that has been done to a people, from slavery all the way to residential schools, you see a parallel that exists today. People can't say, ""Get over it. It's done.""

Bernice Hillier: Trent, how did you deal with the isolation that came with being a member of a minority in a community that was mostly white?

Trent McClellan: I got really small, in a lot of ways. I tried not to rock the boat because you're always going to be the centre of attention anyway. I didn't want to walk in this room and every single person is going to stare, and go, ""That is quite the hairdo!"" I went inside myself a little bit. I was pretty quiet. Then I gravitated towards sports, and then once I became fairly good at different sports, it was like that changed your status. Now you're the kid that's being picked first for things and so there was kind of an empowering thing in that for me. I developed my sense of confidence and kind of came out of my shell quite a bit just from that.

Kids are very visual learners. You look around and realize that no one looks like me. No one has hair like I do. These are things you're constantly taking into your subconscious all the time, as you navigate through the world.

Bernice Hillier: Do you think, Trent, that it led you to a career in comedy? You know, that coming out of your shell eventually and finding some way to make sense of it all?

Trent McClellan: Definitely, yeah. Because I think for a number of reasons, you get used to all eyes on you. You get used to being the centre of attention. For me, comedy was a defence mechanism, to kind of take the power back. Well, if you're going to be the centre of attention, I might as well control that situation. Then I can manipulate my world and the topics and stuff to entertain people. It was a way of shifting that dynamic.

Bernice Hillier: Shaun, what about you? Can you connect the dots, too, between race and your career choice?

Shaun Majumder: Yeah. I think developing a sense of humour was definitely a way through the social ranks. You know, it put you in a higher status, if you're 13, 14 and you can feel somebody bearing down, maybe it's the most popular kid bearing down to intimidate you in some way, and then you drop a funny one-liner, and all of a sudden the pretty girls are chuckling. And you're like, ""Heyyyy, you know what, maybe there's something to this.""

And Trent, I wanted actually to ask you this. I always remember that girls, for example, always found me to be curious, and they were curious in a good way. You know, ""Ooh, he's different,"" there's a bit of an exotic feel for this young fella up at the teen dance, but at the exact same moment, the same moment of feeling like I am on top, there was always the same person who might be like, yes, but, mother would never let you in the house. You know what I mean? Did you have that too, Trent, where you were exotic, but not exotic enough to be invited over for supper?

Trent McClellan: [laughs] Yeah. It was like you were the crown jewel behind the glass. Like, ""Oh, I'd love to have that diamond. I'd love to wear that diamond. I'd never be able to afford that diamond."" It's a true story. I remember being in school and another girl coming up to me and she goes, ""Yeah, just so you know, this other girl really really likes you."" And you're a kid fighting acne and hormones and all that stuff. I mean it was really pretty empowering and inflating. I said, ""Really, I don't even know who that is."" She goes, ""Well, you know what they say about Black guys."" And I was like, ""No. No, I don't."" I didn't even know what the stereotypes were!

Bernice Hillier: How do you both use comedy as a form of education on race and racism? Obviously your first role as a comedian is to be funny, to make people laugh. Do you feel a responsibility to also educate in some way?

Shaun Majumder: Yeah. My last tour was all about hate — it was called the Hate Tour. I spoke a lot on stage about, you know, we talk about how Newfoundlanders are the friendliest people on Earth. Well, yes, it's true. They genuinely are some of the most hospitable, kind, open, warm people.

But within that group, there are also many people who — especially now because of Facebook and all the social media — you know, hate can be spawned by people planting seeds of fear. I talk about the kind of racism, the kind of hate that exists or that has existed in my experience growing up in Newfoundland. There are people who say racist things that still come from a place of love — they just aren't unaware of it. There was a woman who dropped the N-word on VOCM that time, and she just dropped it like it was nothing. She was like, ""Oh, I loves them all!"" You know, there's a sense of ignorance there.

I'm not saying there aren't hate-filled, racist people in Newfoundland. I'm sure there are but it's a different kind. We don't have a history of [Black] slavery. But if I were a Beothuk growing up in Newfoundland, I might feel different. I may have some historical issues there.

Responsibility as a comedian

Bernice Hillier: Trent, what about for you? How do you use comedy to educate, or do you not even really feel that that's a responsibility or a role for you?

Trent McClellan: For me, it's kind of coming in and out of my act, depending on year to year, and where I'm at with what's going on with me personally. That might mean you see me in one year and there's a bunch of stuff about race, and the next time you see me, I might not mention it at all. One of the things I've always felt like as a performer — I don't know if Shaun felt this — but because people may not have had much interaction with someone who is Black, I always felt like somewhat of a representative of my race, in a way. I almost felt like if people come to my show and they laugh, then maybe that changes someone's mind about having some pretty ignorant or backward thoughts about Black people. You know, ""Man, that guy's experience was very similar to mine,"" or ""His life is not as different from mine as I thought it was, and I laughed and had a great time.""

Maybe that's the thing that allows them to leave and go, like, ""Hmmm."" That's going to put an ounce of thought in their head, that's going to change how they approach things. I didn't really acknowledge it until later in life, when I felt, yeah, I do kind of walk in with a certain sense of responsibility sometimes, as opposed to just being me and who I am during the day. I do feel a sense of that responsibility. I don't know if you felt that way, Shaun, at any point.

Trent McClellan grew up in Corner Brook, launched his standup career in Calgary and now works on 22 Minutes in Halifax. (Submitted by Jake Hirsch)

Shaun Majumder: My experience was that I actually felt like I did not represent anything. In my act, I talked about how I came to discover that I was brown later in life. Like, I had no idea, in fact. I think I was a bit racist growing up. I was a little white supremacist! You know, because my mom was white, my sister was beige, I grew up in a town of white people, I thought I was white like everybody else. My dad was brown and he lived in Ontario and so I knew my dad was Indian but I remember even going to school and doing a show-and-tell, and I talked about how my dad was Indian but I talked about how he wore — this is so ignorant — I talked about how he wore a headdress of feathers. And I remember the teacher looking at me and going, ""Really? Really, Shaun?"" ""Well, yes, yes, he was a chief."" Like, I had no idea what I was talking about.

I never felt like I represented anything because of the fact that I'm a mixed-race guy, but I also I was different enough to know, now looking back in retrospect, the little things that happened that were because I was brown. Again, it was not a direct kind of racism that you might expect. It was a different kind altogether. There was a curiosity. Look, if someone didn't like me, it was probably because I was an arsehole, not because I was brown.

In 2016, Shaun Majumder profiled Joe Exotic when he was running for president. The scene is included in the Netflix documentary series Tiger King. (This Hour Has 22 Minutes)

Trent McClellan: Right, right. We were talking about this yesterday, too, with the other comedians. The amount of times I was in my head about different things. I remember we had a new teacher at our school once and they were doing roll call and attendance, and he goes, ""Trent McClellan?"" and I put up my hand, and he goes, ""You must play basketball, do ya?"" In my mind I went, I do play basketball. Does he know that I play basketball or is he just looking at me visually? Is it because I'm tall? Because I'm sitting down so he wouldn't be able to tell how tall. My mind just went through these like mental gymnastics, just from a basic question that this teacher had just asked. I was in my own head a lot, overthinking this.

Shaun Majumder: I never got people going, ""Shaun Majumder?"" And then I raised my hand, and ""You must play cricket, do ya?"" I never got that.

Trent McClellan: [laughs] I don't think there were a lot of cricket games going on in Burlington, was there, back in the day.

Shaun Majumder: [laughs] Not at that time.

Trent McClellan: No. Now, it's a big deal.

Shaun Majumder: Now the league is huge. It's a huge league.

Bernice Hillier: Guys, we're going to have to wrap it up. Thank you so much for taking time to speak with us.

Shaun Majumder: [sarcastically] Oh, really? Are we stopping early because we're brown? Is that what's going on here?

Bernice Hillier: [laughs] Nothing to do with it.

Shaun Majumder: [laughs] I'm a little sensitive, sorry. This conversation's got me fired up.

Bernice Hillier: Thank you to both of you for your time.

Thorne's series Utopia Falls illustrates diverse young leaders who rise up against their oppressors, something the world is in need of and, thankfully, is not of short supply.

Born in Calgary but now living in Toronto, Thorne has built a long career as a television director, producer, filmmaker, and music video director for a number of artists including Kardinal Offishall, Belly, and Shawn Desman. With an obvious keen eye for incorporating music in his storytelling, it was only natural that the heroes in Utopia Falls were driven by music and the arts.

Earlier this year, Thorne sat with us and described his show as a ""love letter to hip-hop"" and told us why he created Utopia Falls. He took his love for the music genre, sci-fi, and a need to create something that he was not seeing in the world to tell a very relevant story.

R.T. Thorne tells us what inspired him to create Utopia Falls and how the all-star team came together. 4:01

With anti-Black racism being discussed widely in the public sphere, and more and more interest for anti-racism resources, we asked Thorne to curate a selection of CBC Gem films and documentaries that you can add to your viewing list.

Unarmed Verses



This documentary, directed by Charles Officer, follows Francine Valentine, a young girl who is trying to find her own voice through poetry and music while her community is being revitalized, putting her home and family at risk.



While the larger scope of this narrative is about the gentrification of her neighbourhood, the real focus is how a single Black life does matter.



""It's a snapshot of these young Black lives,"" Thorne says of the film. ""They're just trying to find their way, and trying to find their voice, and realizing their voice is important and valid.""



It's a quiet yet powerful look at one of many stepping stones in the Black Lives Matter movement.

It's a lovingly crafted film. It really states that these Black lives do matter. - On Unarmed Verses



The Skin We're In

One might be able to draw a dotted line between Unarmed Verses and The Skin We're In, Journalist Desmond Cole's essay-turned-documentary (also directed by Charles Officer) that faces systemic racism in Canada head-on.

""They are almost companion pieces. They show two ends of the struggle,"" R.T. states as he compares the two documentaries, particularly the moment in The Skin We're In when Cole explores the history of Africville and how that community was demolished to make way for Halifax housing. ""It shows that gentrification... its roots are deep in our history.""

Thorne also praises the documentary's hero. ""Desmond Cole… what a force!""

The film does not shy away from declaring that Canada's hands are not clean of anti-Black racism. Canadian Black lives matter.

""The legacy of The Skin We're In, as a piece, really shows how far we've come in the acceptance of [Black Lives Matter], and probably how far we have still to go.""

In calling out systemic racism in our culture, our politics, and our society, the documentary continues to drive the conversation, pushing people into action and bringing them together to support Black Lives Matter. Whether it came out 20 years ago, 10 years ago or 10 days ago, it's a conversation that has stayed relevant, and Thorne is hopeful that change is on the horizon.

""Out of this pain. Out of this anger and outrage,"" he reflects, ""is a chance for real change and it feels different.""

He's such a powerful voice in it and so unapologetic. - On Desmond Cole



Black Cop

Ronnie Rowe plays a Black cop who is racially profiled and assaulted by fellow officers who are white. This takes him down an almost cathartic path of vengeance that turns the lenses on a reality Black people face each day. Bold, uncompromising, and often at times satirical, Cory Bowles' debut feature film Black Cop flips the script and perspective on the very real police brutality against Black people in Canada.

""It's part satire, part drama. There's also a feeling of standup in it. There are all these different aspects of this film which is just really unique as a piece. And then take tackling this sort of subject matter. This idea of a Black police officer who gets racially profiled by his own people, in his own 'blue gang,' and then psychologically how that affects him. It goes further in what it must be for a lot of Black police officers who have to police their own people in a system that is racist toward their own people and how they feel about that, and the conflict they feel about that and the anger that they feel about that. It's just a really interesting piece that examines that from a different point of view.""

It was complex, in form and in subject matter. - On Black Cop



Jean of the Joneses

Family values and connections are the thread of this film directed by Stella Meghie, and produced by Floyd Kane and Amos Adetuyi, the creators of Diggstown .

While previous picks were powerful social commentaries on anti-Black and systemic racism, Thorne notes that Black voices telling Black stories was also about people and the lives they live, comical or otherwise.

""The focus is about Black lives and Black voices, so here is a film that is a joyful expression of Black lives and particularly Black women which is just wonderful to see,"" R.T. explains. ""Quirky and funny, and very lived-in women.""

A fun expression of family and Black women living their lives. - On Jean of the Joneses



Rebelle (War Witch)

R.T. describes this 2012 film as, ""A journey of a young Black girl being forced into womanhood.""

Written and directed by Montreal director Kim Nguyen, Rebelle (War Witch) is seen through the eyes of Komona (Rachel Mwanza) as she tells her unborn baby the story of her life as a child soldier in a civil war in Africa.

Though heavy and at times hard to watch, it is a story of resilience.

R.T. says, ""She's forced into this situation but then she carves out her own life and tries to escape and find her own way.""

It's as heart-wrenching as it is powerful.​​​​​​ - On Rebelle (War Witch)

150,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/eats-coast-music-awards-2020-gender-disparity-1.5646931,Calls for transparency come after women account for small percentage of ECMA winners,"['Haley Ryan', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm At', 'Last Updated']",,"This year's East Coast Music Awards were unusual in many ways amid a global pandemic, but the small number of women who actually won brought up long-standing conversations around gender parity in the Atlantic music scene.

Kimberly Sinclair owns SpinCount, a Nova Scotia music promotions firm, and is a former ECMA board member. She said the percentage of women who took home awards this weekend ""does not match"" the actual industry she works with every day.

The ECMAs aired a pre-taped main show on CBC Saturday night where they handed out some awards, while many were also announced as part of a pre-awards show on Friday.

In total, the music winners were dominated by men, with only four of the 27 categories — 14.8 per cent — going to women, or bands with women in them.

That included Laura Roy (R&B/soul recording), Eastern Owl (Indigenous artist), Nancy Hynes (Inspirational recording, with Ian Foster), and Natalie MacMaster (roots/traditional).

Eastern Owl is, from left, Jenelle Duval, Jaime O'Leary, Joanna Barker, Stacey Howse, Natasha Blackwood, Rebecca Sharr, and Danielle Benoit. (Jennie Williams )

Sinclair also noted the nominees overall skewed heavily toward men, with some awards like album of the year, as well as best country, group, rock, and folk recordings, having only one woman, or groups with women, nominated out of five.

On the industry side, two categories, producer and studio engineer of the year, didn't have women nominated at all.

""I don't know why it came out this way,"" Sinclair said.

""As a music industry as a whole, not just the ECMAs, I think [on] the East Coast we need to have … bigger conversations on how we can make space for women. Because clearly the space is not there currently.""

Promoter calls for 'sunshine policy'

The results bring up many unanswered questions for Sinclair around which artists put their names in for each category, how the nominees are chosen, and by whom.

According to the ECMA website, nominees are chosen by a pool of more than 200 jury members consisting of ""qualified regional, national, and international industry professionals.""

Sinclair said she'd like to see the ECMA's adopt a ""sunshine policy"" where everything is in the open, including who is in the jury pool.

""In 2020, how did we get to this point where the percentage is so dominated by the male industry that it's not even correct?""

It's only with that transparency that the problem will become clear, Sinclair said. At issue is whether women are being passed over in the jury process or aren't putting their names forward in the first place.

Unclear how many women up for nominations

If that's the case, Sinclair said it could be that not enough women have professional teams behind them, or maybe they still don't feel comfortable in the industry, or feel the ECMA's aren't ""for them.""

Sinclair added she's sure the winners deserved their awards and it's not a case of arguing female nominees were better. But, if the numbers are one woman against four men, ""statistically it's not going to work out ... and that's the problem.""

She said it's also ""ridiculous"" to argue that maybe there simply weren't other women in the industry who made music good enough to be nominated.

Fellow Islander and member of The East Pointers, Tim Chaisson, said seeing such a low percentage of female music winners ""definitely shocks me.""

Their group took home two ECMAs this year for songwriter of the year and contemporary roots recording for their album Yours to Break.

But he said it is obvious the results should be more balanced given how many talented artists of all different backgrounds, genders and cultures work in the region.

""I'm so happy that people are like voicing those concerns,"" Chaisson said. ""It definitely needs to be a huge conversation right now and it just needs to keep going.""

Tim Chaisson, P.E.I. musician and member of The East Pointers, said such a low number of female ECMA winners in 2020 was a shock. (Canadian Beats/Facebook)

Internationally, projects like Keychange are calling on music organizations, venues, labels and around the world to sign a pledge committing to reach gender balance by 2022.

Canada had 21 entries signed onto the pledge as of Sunday, with two from the Atlantic region — the Halifax Pop Explosion and Nova Scotia Music Week.

In 2018, Truro's Rock the Hub caught backlash after announcing an all-male lineup that caused bands like In Flight Safety to drop out. They eventually added one female act to the roster.

It's examples like that, and the 2020 ECMA results, that Sinclair says show the Atlantic industry as a whole has to take specific and concrete steps to better reflect the people in it.

""We have more talent here on the East Coast than most people have in their entire country,"" Sinclair said.

""This is something that we celebrate really well. I just want to make sure everyone's invited to the party.""

Dean Stairs, chair of ECMA's board of directors, said in an emailed statement on Sunday, that the organization continually strives to ensure the jury process is fair and equitable.

""Every effort is made to balance each jury with regard to gender, regional representation, and industry expertise from outside the Atlantic region. This work is ongoing,"" he said.

Mostly anonymous allegations are being posted to an Instagram page that has garnered more than 46,000 followers and is targeting prominent Quebecers, including musicians, concert promoters and comedians.

David Desrosiers, bassist of the band Simple Plan, resigned from the group Thursday after he was accused on the social network of predatory behaviour against his female fans.

He posted an apology on Instagram Thursday for the ""harm"" he has caused women. The allegations ""have led me to acknowledge that some of the interactions I have had with women have caused them harm,"" he said, adding that he would seek ""professional help to educate myself and act appropriately in the future.""

In a statement, Simple Plan also apologized to the women affected, and to fans who are disappointed by the ""regretful situation.""

Meanwhile, TV personality Maripier Morin apologized publicly after singer Safia Nolin posted earlier this week that she had sexually harassed her and made racist comments when they were having drinks together in 2018.

Quebec singer-songwriter Bernard Adamus was dropped from his label following an anonymous post to the Instagram page accusing him of improprieties.

Adamus posted Thursday on his Instagram account that he had been vulgar, arrogant and drunk too many times in his life, and he apologized to all the women he's hurt.

Amid the wave of allegations, Montreal legal clinic Juripop told CBC News it received a surge in calls and has opened close to 100 new files. The clinic started a free service for sexual assault survivors last month and has been tagged in many social media posts.

""It really started on Monday morning and specifically on Instagram,"" Sophie Gagnon, executive director of Juripop, told CBC Montreal's Daybreak on Thursday.

""Contrary to #MeToo, more and more people are identifying by name the person who assaulted or offended them,"" she added. ""So that obviously creates a higher risk of libel.""",[]

The band, who had previously been known as Lady Antebellum, filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday seeking a ruling that their use of the trademark ""Lady A"" does not infringe on White's use of the same name. The band is not seeking monetary damages.

The Grammy-winning band made up of Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood, who are all white, changed their name last month saying they are regretful and embarrassed for not taking into consideration the word's associations with slavery.

White, who is Black, told Rolling Stone magazine in an article posted Friday that she felt like she was being erased. White said she had been performing as Lady A for more than 20 years.

""They claim to be allies and that they wanted to change their name out of the racist connotation, and then they sue a Black woman for the new name,"" White told the publication.

White said in negotiations with the band over the use of the name, she requested $10 million US, half of which she would use to rebrand herself and the other half she would donate to charities of her choice, including those associated with Black Lives Matter.

""I have to rebrand myself. I don't want to have to share a name with you. And you shouldn't be allowed to just get a slap on the wrist,"" White said. ""I wanted my name. All I ever wanted was to keep my name in the blues genre doing what I did. I should not have to bend to [the band's] will because they've got money,"" she said.

According to the lawsuit, the band applied for trademarks for the name ""Lady A"" for entertainment services and for use on clothing back in 2010 and no oppositions were filed by any person or entity.",[]

""It makes me smile to hear it,"" said Raffi Cavoukian from his home on Salt Spring Island.

The song was inspired by a beluga whale Cavoukian had seen at the Vancouver Aquarium in 1979.

""It took my career to a whole new level, and recently, in recent years, in concert, I've heard a whole new generation who I call 'beluga grads' — adults who grew up singing Baby Beluga — who bring their own kids to the concerts.""

World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma has been doing a series of songs called ""Songs of Comfort"" throughout the pandemic, and he reached out to Cavoukian for a duet.

""He's an artist at his prime. He's just at the top of his game. I'm just so thrilled with this joining of talents.""

Pay special attention to the way Ma imitates whale song during the transition to Raffi's newly coined verse, written especially for adults — the ""beluga grads"" — who remember the song from their youth.

""Grown-up beluga, sing a song of peace,"" he enjoins them. ""Sing a song of diversity, child-honouring, social justice, climate action. We need to hear you.""

'Come Back,' Mustafa feat. James Blake

""Come Back"" marks the second collaboration between Toronto poet and songwriter Mustafa and British artist James Blake. In the video for this new track, Blake is sitting at a piano, kicking off the song's main refrain pleading for someone to return, while Mustafa stands behind him silently soaking in the words and the sunlight beaming through the studio's window. The song is as simple as that, and its pared down production makes it all the more powerful when the two singers come together in harmony, softly singing, ""Please come back/ at least in my dreams.""

""Come Back,"" as Mustafa notes in a statement, was released on the second anniversary of Toronto rapper Smoke Dawg's death. ""I pray the people you lost come back to you in the form that heals you best,"" he wrote. ""If not a memory, a dream, if not a dream, in their siblings' eyes, if not that, then in the way you carry yourself."" This song is a stunning tribute that packs an emotional gut-punch; it may not heal you completely, but it certainly eases the pain. — Melody Lau

'Hard on Everyone,' Kathleen Edwards

The time between making the decision to leave and finally making it out the door is different for everybody. Kathleen Edwards' new song, ""Hard on Everyone,"" is a version of what it looked and sounded like for her. ""This song is me waking the f--k up. And exiting. Written on the floor of my empty house after leaving a bad situation,"" Edwards wrote on Twitter . And there is something defiant and urgent in the guitars moving under Edwards' words. Her vocal delivery, which on many of her most beloved songs is often edged with a wry wisdom, is different here; she's in dialogue with whomever was part of her bad situation, but she's also in dialogue with herself. Edwards is making space for her anger toward this other person, but it never consumes her because it sounds like she's also operating from a place of much-deserved compassion for herself. Boundaries are hard on everyone, and leaving is sometimes the hardest, bravest boundary of all. — Andrea Warner

'Sticky,' Swagger Rite

Toronto rapper Swagger Rite has been making a lot of noise for a couple years now, and released his major label debut, The Swagged Out Pedestrian, in 2019. He's become known for his high energy and trap-influenced sound, but on his latest release, he shows off his softer, slower side. On ""Sticky,"" we see Swagger reflecting on violence in the city, as well as his upbringing in the Jane and Weston area. ""Growing up in the slums in these cold streets, public housing rats and roaches, plus there's no heat,"" he sings through Auto-Tune. It's a side of Swagger we haven't seen before, and shows that the artist is just as comfortable making a ballad as he is a banger, all while keeping to the vivid street scenes he's built his career on. ""Cause it's real when you living in the field,"" he sings. ""You either make it, go to jail, or you get killed."" — Jesse Kinos-Goodin

'Hey Stupid, I Love You,' JP Saxe

JP Saxe is a self-described ""over-feeler, over-thinker and over-sharer,"" and that's what makes his effusive, emotionally vulnerable songs so irresistible. That, and his unpretentious, conversational style of singing. ""If somebody wants more love from you, turns out its a lot easier to just give it to them, than to convince them they don't need it,"" he explained on Facebook , introducing his new single, ""Hey Stupid, I Love You."" Restrained production keeps the focus on the lyrics, as Saxe articulates the insecurities we all feel from time to time — ""I just wish you could lean in and kiss me/ Say nothing's wrong, tell me to settle down"" — and, let's be honest, make us feel a bit stupid. — Robert Rowat

'Out of Love,' Busty and the Bass feat. Macy Gray

Four years ago, Montreal band Busty and the Bass covered Macy Gray's ""I Try,"" adding their own DIY flair to the soulful classic. Fast forward to 2020 and things have come full circle: the two artists have come together on a new track titled ""Out of Love."" Whereas ""I Try"" is a song about feeling stuck and unable to let go of someone, ""Out of Love"" is begging for a relationship to dissolve. ""I just wanna come out and say I'm sick of waiting,"" singer Nick Ferraro kicks off, adding, ""I just wanna hear that it's over now."" Gray's signature raspy vocals effortlessly blend on the second verse as she echoes the exhaustion. ""Drop the ball and hope I make the call but those signs are just a waste on me,"" Gray coos over the track's sparkling disco-inspired production and bright horns. ""Out of Love"" may sound breezy, making it an ideal summer jam, but simmering underneath is a burning desire to move on. — ML",[]

156,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ennio-morricone-dead-91-1.5638652,Oscar-winning film score composer Ennio Morricone dead at 91,"['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Oscar-winning Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as The Untouchables and the epic Once Upon A Time In America, died on Monday. He was 91.

Morricone's longtime lawyer and friend, Giorgio Assumma, said the Maestro, as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following a recent fall in which he broke a leg.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

""I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,"" began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: ""I don't want to bother anyone.""

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood's and Italy's top directors, including Brian de Palma (The Untouchables), Quentin Tarantino (The Hateful Eight) and Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers).

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: ""There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.""

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called spaghetti western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone.

Morricone was credited with nothing less than reinventing music for western movies through his partnership with Leone, a former classmate. Their partnership included the Dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: A Fistful of Dollars in 1964, For a Few Dollars More in 1965 and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — for instance those played on a harmonica in 1968's Once Upon a Time in the West or another played on pan flute in Leone's 1984 movie Once Upon A Time in America — which would instantly become the film's motif.

The latter movie is a saga of Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone's masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone's evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

'Discipline and curiosity'

""Inspiration does not exist,"" Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. ""What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.""

In a later interview with Italian state TV, Morricone cited ""study, discipline and curiosity"" as the keys to his creative genius. ""Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path"" along life's experiences, he said.

""A great phenomenon of world music"" was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for The Hateful Eight, Tarantino's 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone's Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

""When I say favourite composer, I don't mean movie composer.... I'm talking about Mozart, I'm talking about Beethoven, I'm talking about Schubert,"" Tarantino said.

Italy's head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer's family, wrote: ""Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.""

Morricone's soundtracks, Mattarella said, ""contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.""

Morricone's style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements. His music punctuated the long silences typical of the spaghetti westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly became Morricone's trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of A Fistful of Dollars and thinking: ""What actor wouldn't want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?""

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (The Hateful Eight was his sixth), but until then had never won.

Started career as a trumpeter

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

""I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,"" he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of fascism called Il Federale (known in English as The Fascist). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on The Battle of Algiers, the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French, and later on Queimada, a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with Days Of Heaven, a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside The Hateful Eight, the others were for The Mission (1986), The Untouchables (1987), Bugsy (1991) and Malena (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying: ""I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.""

But he also made no secret that he thought The Mission, with its memorably sweet theme of Gabriel's Oboe, deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock's Round Midnight.

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa's Carlo Felice Theatre later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city's 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge's replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, such as one version of an eternal summer hit, Sapore di Sale (Taste of Salt), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his ""friendship and admiration"" for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer's piece Voci dal Silenzio (Voices from the Silence), the work elicited ""true emotion"" from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an ""extraordinary"" composer of film scores and classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn't, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on Clockwork Orange. But that collaboration didn't happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife, Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children: Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.",[]
157,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/music/haviah-mighty-hopes-people-will-do-their-part-in-reversing-white-supremacy-after-watching-her-new-video-1.5632902,Haviah Mighty hopes people will 'do their part in reversing white supremacy' after watching her new video,"['Holly Gordon', 'Cbc Music', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"""Man, we have so much work to do.""

The closing lyrics to Haviah Mighty's quasi-title track ""Thirteen,"" from her debut solo album, 13th Floor, hold so much in just eight words. The Toronto-born rapper blasts through centuries of oppression in the song's three minutes, connecting slavery to the modern-day prison system in vivid, personal detail. The work is to dismantle the system.

While the album came out a year ago, winning the 2019 Polaris Music Prize and making Mighty the first hip-hop artist to win in the prize's 14-year history, the official video for ""Thirteen"" comes out this Canada Day, just over a month after George Floyd's death and the beginning of the current worldwide anti-Black racism protests — and while everyone is at home during a pandemic, more alert to what's going on in the world than possibly ever before. Her hope is that people will feel moved to ""do their part in reversing white supremacy"" after watching the video.

""Given the climate right now and the focus of everything that's been going on and how well it ties in to themes that I was thinking about a year ago on this record and it just not being your mainstream conversation [a year ago] — now it is that mainstream conversation,"" explains Mighty, over the phone from her home. ""It felt like there would be no better time to put [the video] out … obviously, it's a message that I think is important to hear at any time but while people's social media is open, while their hearts and ears are open, I think that's the manner for them to receive it. ""

If you listen to the song, I think it's clear how it ties in to every Black person globally. - Haviah Mighty

The video has been finished since April, and Mighty was thinking of releasing it later this summer as the last visual project from 13th Floor. But releasing it on Canada Day felt right: it's her way of showing solidarity with Black and Indigenous communities on a holiday that feels less and less celebratory. And while the song ""Thirteen"" speaks specifically to the United States' 13th amendment, which abolished slavery ""except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,"" it is very much connected to Canada.

""If you listen to the song, I think it's clear how it ties in to every Black person globally,"" she says.

The new animated video for ""Thirteen"" is stop-you-in-your-tracks powerful, with animator Theo Kapodistrias illustrating subtle emotions within the song (Mighty's opening sigh dissipates a set of chains that are connected to her childhood head) while also zeroing in on striking detail (a set of nooses drop out of a tree just before Mighty raps, ""Those nooses they up in the trees and I'm hanging but I'll never fall like my pants"").

Visuals from the video will air on two Canada Day celebrations where Mighty will perform ""Thirteen"": CBC's Canada Day celebration (8-10 p.m. ET) and Toronto's Canada Day celebration (7-8 p.m. ET), both online streams (and a TV broadcast, for CBC).

""I feel kind of deceived about celebrating Canada Day,"" she says, ""and I feel like celebrating it should look a little different. We can still have shows and parties and music but I chose to do that song. I don't feel it's controversial, and I think for those that do, you know, that's why I did it.""

'Ignorant people need to be weeded out'

Mighty has been rapping about the effects of systemic racism for years, including her time with feminist hip-hop group the Sorority, and has talked extensively about her experiences — and how she's been gaslit about those experiences.

It's hard to live a trauma that seems invisible and tell people the pain from it and feel it your whole life, feel how it's impacted you and have that be dismissed.​​ - Haviah Mighty

""I've been told to my face, 'You don't know what racism it looks like' by a white person,"" she says, laughing. ""So I know definitively that there's a lot of people out there that are like, yeah if you haven't been hung from a tree, you don't really have a fight here.""

""It's hard to live a trauma that seems invisible and tell people the pain from it and feel it your whole life, feel how it's impacted you and have that be dismissed,"" she continues.

It's something she says she's been digging into more than ever these past few months, fuelled by the most recent police killings of Black people, the protests and the conversations that are happening.

""I was talking to my mom about this yesterday. She's like, 'You've always been a vocal person, always fighting injustices. You'd always come home and tell me all the things that kids said. Or whatever the teacher did. Always, you were just ready to break down the injustice. You would write essays about why you deserve the cookies.' So I like learning that about myself and knowing I kind of always had that nature in me because yeah, in a way, I think I suppressed the pain of it because I've just always been like — I'm not taking on the pain, I deserve better. And now, finally, at least to see in my lifetime, there's some resurgence or some sort of revolution. The climate feels completely different.""

Haviah Mighty performs her song In Women Colour in the q studio. 3:03

Having attended a predominantly white school in London, Ont., Mighty describes being called the n-word ""several times a week as a child,"" and being treated unfairly by teachers who limited her — and her sisters' — educational opportunities. And the education they did get wasn't complete.

""Particularly with Black people, with Black culture, most of us go to school and we learn about our history through a white history teacher who has a book and who doesn't know anything deeper than the book that they're reading,"" she says. ""And the book only goes as far back as us being taken from our motherland, but there's nothing before that. So how can you have pride in your people if that's what you learn about your people?""

""And I think that's one of the biggest issues, is there's been a systematic indoctrination of feeling like a lesser-than human being — and that needs to be reversed,"" she continues. ""And so to me, the history, understanding what exists before slavery is to understand that slavery is a moment in time. Well, many moments in time, 400-plus years in time, but it's not the beginning of time. It's not the origin of the Black people story. It is not your worth.""

This moment in time feels like a reckoning to Mighty, as she sees more and more people of all backgrounds having the tough conversations. And as someone who has been vocal about anti-Black racism her whole life, Mighty is ready for the rest of the world to catch up.

""I kind of love it because I feel like I've been ready for this conversation my whole life,"" she says, laughing lightly.

And for the first time, she feels, people are listening — and demanding change.

""I do think it's very important that this conversation is happening because ignorant people need to be weeded out, at the end of the day.""",[]

After securing the participation of at least one musician from each of Canada's 28 professional orchestras, Ball reached out to Yannick Nézet-Séguin to see whether he'd agree to conduct the performance. ""He thought it was a fabulous idea and immediately jumped onboard.""

'Extraordinary conditions'

Fung, who's based in New York and has recently written music for Nézet-Séguin's Philadelphia Orchestra, agreed to compose the five-minute work within one month.

""In times of crisis and peril, we have but the reliance of faith,"" she says, ""from the profound faith in humanity, faith in love, and faith that we will persevere and get through this with dignity, to the mundane faith that I would complete the piece within the extraordinary conditions that faced me, with a young child at home 24/7, a bronchial infection, and a very tight timeline (ultimately, a matter of days) to complete the piece in a manner feasible for COVID remote performance requirements.""

That faith resulted in Prayer, based on a chant by Hildegard von Bingen. ""Under no other circumstances ... have I worn my heart on my sleeve as transparently as I have with this piece,"" Fung reflects.

It's performed by 36 individuals in multiple locales — see the full roster, below — and united in a virtual performance that has been produced and edited by CBC Music's Francesco Guidoccio and Doug Doctor.

""Imagining the sounds and the people around me, conducting in front of a video camera, but imagining everyone in front of me — that was something very special,"" conductor Nézet-Séguin told CBC.

""And once orchestras are back in their halls, playing for live audiences, they're all invited to play this beautiful new work,"" adds Ball, ""kind of like a collective musical hug and a testament to the experience Canadians have shared.""

The radio premiere of Fung's Prayer takes place on CBC Radio One and via the CBC Listen app on July 1 at 7:45 a.m. on the Canada Day special Extraordinary Times: Canada Day 2020. It also airs on CBC Music and via the CBC Listen app on Tempo with host Julie Nesrallah at 12:50 p.m.

159,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/patrick-watson-indigenous-land-acknowledgement-censored-canada-day-1.5636152,Montreal artist Patrick Watson says Indigenous land acknowledgement 'censored' from Canada Day performance,"['The Canadian Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson says Canadian Heritage edited out a land acknowledgement he made to Indigenous peoples before his Montreal Canada Day performance.

Watson posted on Facebook Thursday, saying he was ""deeply upset"" to discover his statement did not make it into the hour-long broadcast, which was pre-recorded and filmed in Montreal's Olympic Stadium.

The virtual show was funded by the federal government as a replacement for annual festivities held in Montreal to celebrate the national holiday.

Montreal-based communications agency, Tandem Communication, put the show together.

The musician said he made the acknowledgement during his performance but it was not included in the program broadcast to Canadians. A version of the performance, available online, does not contain Watson's homage to Indigenous peoples.

A land acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes Indigenous peoples occupied the territory that became Canada long before colonization.

Watson posted what he called the ""censored"" words he uttered during his performance.

""We would like to acknowledge that we are playing at this event from the unceded lands of the Kanien'keha:ka Nation,"" he wrote.

""Tiohtia:ke/Montreal is known as gathering place for many First Nations, we hope to honour that tradition.""

The musician said he wanted to celebrate ""where I was standing, to point out the connection between the Indigenous struggles with the Black Lives Matter movement, and to include everyone who lives in Canada and their sensibilities.""

A Canadian Heritage spokesperson said it has no involvement in the programming choices of the communities and organizations it funds.

""Each year, Canadian Heritage provides funding to support activities through the Celebrate Canada program. This funding allows communities and organizations across Canada to celebrate the diversity of our country through four days of celebration, including Canada Day,"" spokesperson Martine Courage said in an email.

""Funded communities and organizations are responsible for programming their respective activities.""

Deputy NDP Leader Alexandre Boulerice, an MP from Quebec, said Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault needs to explain why Watson's statement was not included in the official program.

If Guilbeault doesn't explain the decision, Boulerice said in an interview, ""it would be very, very hypocritical for the Liberals to wrap themselves in reconciliation with First Nations and Indigenous peoples and then, censor artists who just want to express their solidarity with certain Aboriginal peoples.""

Guilbeault, however, did mention the country's Indigenous peoples, in a recorded statement edited into the virtual Canada Day performance. In fact, Guilbeault's message opens the show.

The minister said ""Indigenous peoples have taken care of this land over the centuries. Their cultures and traditions are a great source of wealth for this country.""",[]

On it was a track called ""He's a Keeper of the Fire,"" a blazing psychedelic number where Sainte-Marie belts passionately about a man who's ""got a funny kinda voodoo, baby.""

This Canada Day, Indo-Canadian musician King Khan (best known for his band King Khan and the Shrines) is releasing a song titled ""She is the Keeper of My Soul,"" a song Khan describes as a ""response to the epic anthem of Buffy Sainte-Marie.""

The track, which was written by Khan and performed by his daughter Saba Lou, accompanies his short film titled Rat-Tribution Now, a project for the 2020 Pop Kultur Festival based in Berlin. The film, Khan says, ""is an attempt at achieving retribution,"" referencing North America's historical mistreatment of Indigenous peoples. As such, the release of this song is also in dedication to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and proceeds from the song will go to the NDN COVID-19 Response Project.

""I have decided to release this song for Canada Day to be a stark reminder that these women are still ignored by the majority of people in Canada,"" Khan tells CBC Music over email. ""The song asks, 'Who will be the keeper of my soul?' I wanted to write it from the perspective of MMIWG.""

Written in a similar structure to Sainte-Marie's ""He's a Keeper of the Fire,"" Khan's song confronts listeners with powerful questions:

When you put me down

Without a sound

How will the world ever know?



When my judgment day

Seems like it's gone astray

Who'll be the keeper of my soul?

Saba Lou, who is the main vocalist on the track, says that having a woman sing Khan's words ""gives the words another meaning."" She adds: ""These topics need attention and awareness, so again and again they must be mentioned from all perspectives, using different approaches. I was glad when [Khan] asked me to sing it.""

""Buffy's activism always inspired me, she's probably the most important Canadian singer of all time,"" Khan says, of Sainte-Marie's legacy as a musician. Another artist that ""She is the Keeper of My Soul"" is dedicated to is Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq. Khan says Rat-Tribution Now is ""an homage"" to Tagaq's 2016 music video for ""Retribution.""

""I am so happy that such a power frau has emerged from the aurora borealis,"" he adds. (Khan has also commissioned tarot illustrations of both Sainte-Marie and Tagaq by Game of Thrones graphic artist Michael Eaton for a tarot deck he is creating.)

In addition to Rat-Tribution Now and ""She is the Keeper of My Soul,"" Khan has spent his time in lockdown working with American social activist Malik Rahim on raising money for people in New Orleans who are in need of insulin supplies. Titled Just Insulin, the fundraising initiative aims to ""uplift a community ravaged by diabetes, no access to medicine, with COVID-19 preying on healthy young people, killing them just like the cops do.""

The hope is to ""set up a source of Canadian insulin and send it to this community in New Orleans."" Through tarot card readings, Khan has already raised close to $2,000 US.

For Khan, the time to be active is now, to confront problems in our reality and to channel change with creativity, especially as an artist. ""This pandemic is not simply a wake-up call, it's utter devastation in your own backyard,"" he warns. ""Creativity is our only way out.""

""If you are not creating something to show your empathy, then you are useless,"" he adds. ""Sorry to be such a Debbie Downer.""",[]
161,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/music/violinist-chloe-kim-s-weekly-online-baroque-concert-series-kicks-off-friday-july-3-1.5633710,"Violinist Chloe Kim's weekly online baroque concert series kicks off Friday, July 3","['Andrea Warner', 'Cbc Music', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"The financial implications of COVID-19 have been crushing to the arts, and particularly to classical musicians who often perform in larger ensembles and may not have the opportunities that solo artists do with streaming or exploring other digital platforms. According to a survey of the UK Musicians' Union , one-fifth of all classical musicians believe that coronavirus will be the end of their careers, and similar concerns have gripped classical artists around the world, including here in Canada.

But Victoria-based baroque violinist Chloe Kim has a plan to reinvigorate her music community. The 23-year-old is the artistic director and creator of the ambitious new weekly concert project, Music for the Pause. The online concert series kicks off Friday, July 3, and runs for 11 weeks, featuring mostly Victoria-based musicians performing baroque chamber works on period instruments.

""Music for the Pause is a way of keeping myself and my colleagues, who are like family to me, creatively engaged as well as for staying connected to audiences during a very difficult and strange time,"" explains Kim. ""As someone who thrives on the intensity of a full performing schedule and the togetherness and sharing that comes with that, the concept of a summer without music was inconceivable to me. I like the challenge of having to work within certain parameters, whether it be social distancing regulations or personnel limitations, and I choose to see this period of time as an opportunity to be creative, rather than one of waiting or inactivity.""

Among the artists joining Kim in Music for the Pause are fellow baroque violinists Tyson Doknjas, Christi Meyers, Jeanne Lamon, Elyssa Lefurgey-Smith, Paul Luchkow, Kathryn Wiebe as well as Mark McDonald (organ), Christina Hutten (harpsichord), Mieka Michaux (baroque viola), Katrina Russell (dulcian/baroque bassoon), Soile Stratkauskas (baroque flute), and Christina Mahler (baroque cello).

""It's been an absolute joy to be making music again,"" Kim says. ""To be honest, I almost cried when I first got into the rehearsal space with my colleagues — I can't describe how cathartic it was. It just feels good to be creating and feeling again, especially with such dear friends.""

The series, which is co-presented by Early Music Society of the Islands, Victoria Baroque , Pacific Baroque Series, and Christ Church Cathedral , will be filmed inside Christ Church Cathedral's Chapel of the New Jerusalem, and each performance will include short interviews between musicians and celebrity guests from the international early music community. Starting July 3, each concert in the 11-part series will stream weekly on Fridays at 7:30 p.m. PT, via Facebook Live on each of the co-presenters' Facebook pages. The streams are free, but viewers are encouraged to donate, with proceeds benefiting artists whose incomes have been affected by the pandemic.

Beyond Cbc', 'Knegt Is Also A Stand-Up Comedian', 'The Filmmaker Of Numerous Short Films']",,"CBC Arts Presents Queer Pride Inside: A Buddies in Bad Times Cabaret was a virtual cabaret featuring over a dozen LGBTQ Canadian artists that CBC Arts produced in partnership with Buddies in Bad Times this past June in celebration of Pride Month. Over the course of the summer, we'll be highlighting some of the individual performances that were included in the cabaret.

Teiya Kasahara 笠原貞野 is a true treasure of our queer world, and it was an absolute honour for us to have them included in CBC Arts Presents Queer Pride Inside: A Buddies in Bad Times Cabaret. A queer, gender non-binary, multidisciplinary performer and creator, Kasahara comes from a background of over a decade of singing both traditional and contemporary operatic roles across North America and Europe. They were most recently praised as ""a force of nature"" by the Toronto Star and ""an artist with extraordinary things to say"" by The Globe and Mail.

Kasahara combines opera, theatre and taiko in their artistic practice and co-founded Amplified Opera, a new initiative which is bringing an injection of inclusivity to Toronto's opera community, with their recent inaugural concert series AMPLIFY highlighting stories of international equity-seeking artists.

Teiya's original work The Queen in Me is planned to premiere in Toronto once theatres reopen following the COVID-19 global pandemic, and it was an except from that show that they performed for Queer Pride Inside — from a Toronto rooftop, no less. In the performance, Kasahara takes inspiration from their career in opera, alongside their lived experience as a queer, biracial, non-binary artist, to re-imagine the Queen of the Night, one of opera's most infamous fallen women. They also took the opportunity to address unrest both in the operatic community and the world in general.

""We are in a critical time right now,"" Teiya says as they introduce the piece. ""It would be remiss of me to not use this platform to especially call out the systemic racism and violence by Black and Indigenous friends and colleagues face every day in the operatic community and in their lives at large. This excerpt from The Queen In Me is my callout to the opera industry and the world.""

163,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/music/the-best-music-to-stream-right-now-according-to-vivian-fung-1.5621896,"The best music to stream right now, according to Vivian Fung","['Robert Rowat', 'Cbc Music', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"For Juno Award-winning composer Vivian Fung, the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it an unusual task: to write a piece for orchestra, to be played by a virtual symphony comprising musicians from Canada's 28 professional orchestras, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. Oh, and to complete it within a month.

She set to work, and delivered her new piece, Prayer, on time.

When she wasn't toiling away on that project or looking after her five-year-old daughter, Fung, like the rest of us, turned to music for stimulation and distraction from the increasingly alarming headlines.

Below, she tells us about the music that's been getting her through the pandemic.

'O pastor animarum,' Hildegard von Bingen

""In times of crisis and peril, we have but the reliance of faith — from the profound faith in humanity to faith in love, and faith that we will persevere and get through this with dignity. In the end, I chose a chant from my composer heroine, Hildegard von Bingen, as inspiration for my Prayer.""

O Shepherd of our souls, O primal voice,

Whose call created all of us;

Now hear our plea to thee, to thee, and deign

To free us from our miseries

And feebleness.

Standing Wave

""When the shutdown happened, I was in the middle of working on Corona Morphs for the awesome Vancouver-based new music group Standing Wave. They are working on an online release of the piece, since the premiere was supposed to happen in May 2020. I'll also soon be writing a flute concerto for their flutist, Christie Reside, who is also the principal flutist of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. In the meantime, here is a sample of what Standing Wave can do.""

'Kam Knea Doch Chkae,' Doch Chkae

""I have been experiencing a lot of pent-up emotion, and I thought this song by Doch Chkae was a good outlet for the anger and repression that I was facing. I first heard of this Cambodian heavy metal band through my husband, who is a bit of a metal head. I also took a trip to Cambodia last year to understand some of my family history — my uncle and family were living in Cambodia, they were overseas Chinese living in Phnom Penh, at the time of genocide and fortunately they escaped.""

Wayang No. II (Shadowdance), Anthony Davis

""Fresh from his Pulitzer Prize for his opera The Central Park Five, Anthony Davis has been on my mind. I love the influence of Balinese gamelan in his work Wayang No. II (Shadowdance). I, myself, was inspired by gamelan, especially for my album Dreamscapes, which includes the Juno Award-winning Violin Concerto.""

Civitas Ensemble

""I am very proud of a recent release of my piece Birdsong for violin and piano performed by members of Civitas Ensemble, based in Chicago. The recording was recently voted by the Chicago Tribune as one of the eight most alluring classical recordings of the year, so far. They called the performance 'sheer technical wizardry.'""

'Kelly Blue,' Howard Johnson and Gravity

""My five-year-old son has been obsessed about the tuba lately, and this is one of his favourite tracks that we have been listening to in the car. It has also been a good entry point to talk about both jazz and recent events happening in our world.""",[]

Every time a musician draws inspiration from what's going on around them in the present, or looks to the past to bring an old story into a new light, they're helping to create a canon of songs that tell the story of how we got to where we are today.

From before Confederation to the creation of the railroad that would cut across the country and bring it into the future, through great strife, injustice and the lasting impact of colonialism on Indigenous people; to the disasters that bonded communities through grief and the triumphs that joined them in celebration — it's all there in the words and notes of our musicians.

Below, CBC Music has gathered a selection of songs that tell the stories, both big and small, of Canada.

And on Canada Day, at noon local time, you can tune in to Radio One for a one-hour special hosted by Daniel Greaves called Records of Time: Songs About our History. Greaves will talk with Canadian artists — including iskwē, Joe Sealy and Sarah Harmer — about the stories behind the songs of theirs that have been included in this list.

You can listen to the piece in full below, produced by Arianne Robinson.

Host Daniel Greaves talks with Canadian artists about the story behind their songs: music based on historical events that also reflect our present day. 51:41

Pre-Confederation and colonization

Buffy Sainte-Marie's ""My Country 'tis of thy People You're Dying"" isn't about one thing — it's about everything colonizers have destroyed within and pushed onto Indigenous populations across Turtle Island. Residential schools. Language extinction. Genocide. ""Can't you see how their poverty's profiting you?"" Sainte-Marie sings. ""My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.""

The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens

Our life blood is shut up in your chemical tanks

And now here you come, bill of sale in your hand

And surprise in your eyes, that we're lacking in thanks

For the blessings of civilization you brought us

The lessons you've taught us.

1720-2020: Cape Breton coal mining

Coal mining began in Cape Breton, N.S., in the 1700s to fuel the construction of the Fortress of Louisbourg, and it became a significant industry in the province, with more than 300 underground coal mines having been in operation since 1720. The last coal mine in Nova Scotia closed this year .

Rita MacNeil, who is from Big Pond, Cape Breton, visited the Sydney mines early in her career — and the miners' stories she heard there sparked her hit song ""Working Man.""

At the age of sixteen years

Oh, he quarrels with his peers

Who vowed they'd never see another one

In the dark recess of the mines

Where you age before your time

And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

1755-64: the Great Upheaval

Between 1755 and 1764, more than 10,000 Acadians were forced to forfeit their lands around the Bay of Fundy to the British authorities in a mass expulsion. They were moved by ship to other colonies down the Atlantic, with thousands dying in the squalid conditions onboard. Many ended up in New Orleans, where they helped develop Cajun culture.

The Band's Robbie Robertson wrote ""Acadian Driftwood"" about their plight.

They signed a treaty

And our homes were taken

Loved-ones forsaken,

They didn't give a damn.

Try to raise a family

End up an enemy

Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham.

1813: Laura Secord's heroic warning

Laura Secord is famous for having walked 32 kilometres out of American-occupied territory in June 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack, effectively stopping the invasion.

Ontario folk band Tanglefoot memorialized her journey in their song ""Secord's Warning"" — as did this Heritage Minute .

Come all you brave young soldier lads

With your strong and manly bearing

I'll tell you a tale of a woman bold and her deed of honest daring

Laura Secord was American-born in the state of Massachusetts

But she made her home in Canada and proved so faithful to us

1830-90: the life of Crowfoot

Crowfoot was a Siksika chief and warrior who was known as a voice for peace and reason. He negotiated with the Canadian government on behalf of the Blackfoot, and was key to the signing of the controversial Treaty 7 .

Willie Dunn sang about Crowfoot's life and death, as well as the damaging effects of colonialism, on ""The Ballad of Crowfoot.""

Crowfoot, Crowfoot, why the tears?

You've been a brave man, for many years.

Why the sadness? Why the sorrow?

Maybe there'll be a better tomorrow.

Maybe one day you'll find honesty,

Instead of the usual treachery,

Perhaps one day the truth may prevail,

And the warmth of love which it does entail.

1845: the Franklin Expedition

Sir John Franklin was a British naval officer and famous Arctic explorer. However, he is best known for the tragic 1845 expedition that sought to find the Northwest Passage, a sea route through the Canadian Arctic. His two ships became trapped in the ice, and all crew members perished, making it the worst tragedy in the history of Arctic exploration.

The ships' whereabouts were unknown until they were found in 2014 and 2016 in present-day Nunavut. It's a mystery that inspired Stan Rogers to write one of his best-known songs, ""Northwest Passage.""

Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage

To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea

Tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage

And make a Northwest Passage to the sea.

1848-1970: Halifax's Africville

Africville was a Black community in Halifax, on the south shore of the Bedford Basin. Seaview United Baptist Church, a post office, stores and a school were all part of the neighbourhood, though the City of Halifax would not provide the families with sewage, clean water or garbage disposal — but it did put a dump, a hospital and a prison around the houses. By 1970, the City had relocated the 400 families who lived in the community and razed Africville to the ground.

Jazz musician Joe Sealy's father was born in Africville, and the musician wrote ""Africville"" to ""represent the beginnings of the community, its development and its demise at the end of it,"" as he told CBC's Daniel Greaves for Records of Time: Songs About our History. Sealy would later create an entire album based around the track, called Africville Suites, which won the 1997 Juno for contemporary jazz album.

1859-1959: Rockwood Asylum for the Criminally Insane

For 100 years, inmates who were deemed "" criminally insane "" at the Kingston Penitentiary were moved to the Rockwood Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Not big enough for all of its inmates, the asylum relegated women to the stables until a new wing was built for them in 1868.

When Simone Schmidt, a.k.a. Fiver, came across that information, they embarked on an album of fictional stories of women patients based on in-depth research into the asylum's case files from 1856 and 1881 — giving a voice to the voiceless more than a century later.

1886: the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway

The Conservative government of Prime Minister John A. MacDonald spearheaded the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connected Montreal to Vancouver and was later dubbed ""the National Dream.""

When the CBC commissioned Gordon Lightfoot to write a song for Canada's centennial in 1967, the result was the ""Canadian Railroad Trilogy.""

For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run

When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun

Long before the white man and long before the wheel

When the green dark forest was too silent to be real.

1869-70: Red River Rebellion

Unsurprisingly, when the Dominion of Canada and the Hudson's Bay Company were working on the details of the Rupert's Land transfer in the 1860s, no one had consulted the Indigenous community, whose traditional hunting grounds marked that land. The Métis rallied around a then 25-year-old Louis Riel — a movement called the Red River Rebellion — and seized Upper Fort Garry, creating a provisional government in protest and leading to Rupert's Land's entry into the Canadian Federation and the eventual creation of Manitoba.

Thomas Scott was a surveyor for the government, and singer-songwriter James Keelaghan's song ""Red River Rising"" tells a sliver of the story from his perspective. Scott was captured during the Fort Garry seizing, and later executed.

Well, Thomas Scott he took the lead, we rode to Portage Town

Cory's on the other side

Métis riders on our tail, it's soon they rode us down

Cory's on the other side.

1903: the Frank Slide

The former mining town of Frank sits in the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta, and in 1903 a massive rock slide killed nearly 100 people and took out most of the town's mining infrastructure.

The Rural Alberta Advantage commemorated the tragedy on their 2008 album, Hometowns.

And under the rubble of the mountain that tumbled

I'll hold you forever

I'll hold you forever

They'll build up another on the bodies of our brothers

I'll love you forever.

The Rural Alberta Advantage | Frank | CBC Music Festival 4:21

July 8, 1917: the death of Tom Thomson

Tom Thomson is one of the most famous painters in Canada, but his death, more than 100 years ago, is still shrouded in mystery. Thomson disappeared into Algonquin Park's Canoe Lake, and the only trace of him to be found was his overturned canoe.

His death has inspired history buffs and songwriters for decades, including Trent Severn, who wrote ""The Jack Pine"" about him and his famous painting of the same name .

You think I don't know you're there

But I spy campfire smoke in the air

Ride along prevailing breeze

Wave hello with only branch and leaf.

July 1, 1916: Battle of the Somme

On the first day of World War I's Battle of the Somme, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment made a tragic advance at Beaumont Hamel, all but wiping them out. In total , 324 were killed, or presumed dead, and 386 were wounded. Great Big Sea sang about the event in ""Recruiting Sergeant.""

The call came from London, for the last July drive

To the trenches with the regiment, prepare yourselves to die.

The roll call next morning, just a handful survived

Enlist you Newfoundlanders and come follow me.

Oct. 22, 1966: the death of Chanie Wenjack

Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Ojibwa boy, ran away from a residential school near Kenora, Ont., only to be found dead a week later beside the railway tracks.

Gord Downie sang about the event on 2016's The Secret Path, but it was immortalized more than 40 years earlier by Indigenous musician Willie Dunn in the song "" Charlie Wenjack .""

Walk on, little Charlie

Walk on through the snow

Heading down the railway line

Trying to make it home.

Jan 31, 1970: David Milgard's wrongful conviction

David Milgard was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 20-year-old nursing student, Gail Miller. He was released after spending 23 years in prison.

The Tragically Hip famously wrote ""Wheat Kings"" about the Milgard case.

Late breaking story on the CBC

A nation whispers, 'we always knew that he'd go free.

1970s: the end of log driving in North America

Canada began log driving, a method of moving logs from forests to mills using river currents, in 1806. It was an integral transportation method for decades until the 1970s, when changes in environmental legislation and the use of trucks revolutionized the industry.

To memorialize the tradition, Wade Hemsworth wrote ""The Log Driver's Waltz,"" a now beloved folk song that was originally released in 1979 in a National Film Board animated film soundtracked by a version of the song sung by Kate and Anna McGarrigle and the Mountain City Four.

For he goes birling down and down white water

That's where the log driver learns to step lightly

Yes, birling down and down white water

The log driver's waltz pleases girls completely.

1970: Reggie 'the Riverton Rifle' Leach enters the NHL

Ojibway hockey player Reggie Leach entered the NHL in 1970 and in his 14 years in the league, he won a Stanley Cup, the Conn Smythe Trophy and was selected as an all-star twice. Eligible for the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, Leach has yet to be inducted.

In 2013, Weakerthans frontman John K. Samson put together a petition, and an accompanying song, for Leach to get the recognition he deserves.

(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas photos from the old Tribune

Of Reggie smiling with the Stanley Cup

Curled their corners, dropped off bedroom walls

Left a square of where they used to be.

October 1970: the October Crisis

In 1970, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped and killed Quebec's Minister of Labour, Pierre Laporte, in what became known as the October Crisis. Laporte's body was eventually found in the trunk of a car.

The Tragically Hip's ""Locked in the Trunk of a Car"" was written about the event and told from the killer's point of view.

Then I found a place, it's dark and it's rotted.

It's a cool, sweet kinda place where the coppers won't spot it.

Nov. 10, 1975: the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald

The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was a Great Lakes freighter that sank in Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975, resulting in the deaths of all 29 crew members onboard. While technically an American freighter, it sank in Canadian waters near Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

It became the inspiration for one of Gordon Lightfoot's most famous songs, ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.""

For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

Superior, they said, never gives up her dead

When the gales of November come early.

Feb. 15, 1982: The Ocean Ranger disaster

The Ocean Ranger was an offshore drilling unit 267 km east of St. John's, N.L., that was hit by a major storm and sank, killing all 84 crew members on board.

Folk icon Ron Hynes wrote about the disaster in his song, ""Atlantic Blue.""

What colour is a heartache from a love lost at sea?

What shade of memory never fades but lingers to eternity?

And how dark is the light of day that sleepless eyes of mine survey?

Is that you, Atlantic Blue? My heart is as cold as you.

1988 Summer Olympics silver

Guyanese-Canadian boxer Egerton Marcus won a silver medal in Seoul, South Korea. In ""Nothing at All,"" a song about Black excellence, Maestro Fresh Wes devotes a verse to Marcus's achievement.

I'll talk about my homey Egerton Marcus.

A brother from Toronto who's oh so great.

A little bit of weight champ in 88.

He excelled to the second highest level in Korea

Bringing home a silver medal.

Dec. 6, 1989: École Polytechnique massacre

On Dec. 6, 1989, Mark Lépine entered Montreal's École Polytechnique and killed 14 women in what was the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history at the time. The event, which is now commemorated every year as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, led to stricter gun control laws in Canada.

In response to the tragedy, folk artist Stephen Fearing wrote ""The Bells of Mourning"" and, later on, a followup to that called ""Assassin's Apprentice,"" which Fearing said was ""an attempt on my part to get into the head of Mark Lépine a little bit more.""

Tonight I am speechless

My head is filled with pouring rain

As the darkness falls on Montreal

When violence is shrieking

The city streets will run with pain

Until the moon can shed no light at all.

May 2, 1992: the Westray mining disaster

Twenty-six Nova Scotian miners were killed when the Westray coal mine exploded in May 1992, a result of a methane gas leak. The tragedy led to the creation of the Westray Act, enacted in 2004, which provided new rules for attributing criminal liability to corporations when workers are injured or killed on the job.

It also inspired the song ""Westray"" by Sarah Harmer's former band, Weeping Tile.

A natural disaster comes out wasn't natural after all

In a small town on the East Coast, well they've gathered in a firehall

And who forgot to let the canary out?

Will you be there when they're pulling bodies out?

January 1998: North American ice storm

This massive storm struck a number of Canadian cities, stretching from eastern Ontario to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In Montreal, the city was forced to shut down for a week, and the event served as the inspiration behind ""Neighbourhood #3 (Power Out),"" a single from Arcade Fire's breakout album, Funeral.

I woke up with the power out

Not really something to shout about

Ice has covered up my parents' hands

Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans.

Sept. 24, 2003: Hurricane Juan hits the Maritimes

Hurricane Juan was the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893. Causing $300 million in damages across the Maritimes, the tropical cyclone also killed eight people.

Two years later, Dartmouth, N.S., artist Joel Plaskett penned a song about the hurricane titled ""Natural Disaster.""

The air was getting heavy, I knew that it was coming

So I started up the Chevy and kept the motor running

A storm came down upon us and flooded all the rivers

Surrounded by piranhas and the doctors who deliver.

July 16, 2012: Danzig Street shooting

A shooting occurred at a barbecue on Danzig Street in Scarborough, killing Joshua Yasay and Shyanne Charles and injuring 24 others. Police described it as the worst act of gun violence in Toronto's history.

Drake used it to make a rare political song, teaming up with Snoop Dogg (under the name Snoop Lion) for ""No Guns Allowed.""

News from back home

This when it hurts to be gone

Two more young names to be carved out of stone

One summer day that went horribly wrong.

May 1, 2016: Fort McMurray wildfire

This wildfire, which swept through the region of Fort McMurray, was the largest evacuation in Alberta history, forcing 88,000 people out of their homes.

Nils Edenloff, frontman of the Rural Alberta Advantage, grew up there and when his band released ""Beacon Hill,"" a song inspired by this event, he wrote : ""Beacon Hill was one of the hardest hit areas and some of the footage that came out of there made it look just biblical — real fire and brimstone sort of stuff.""

While the fire seals our little fate

I'll get you all the way home

No lies living this time, you never never want to grow.

August 2014 and Aug. 9, 2016: the deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie

On Aug. 17, 2014, 15-year-old Tina Fontaine's body was found wrapped in plastic and a duvet cover in Winnipeg's Red River. Two years later, 22-year-old Colten Boushie was shot and killed while out drinking with his friends. The Indigenous youths were just two of many lives lost to violence, and the investigation into Fontaine's murder partially led the Canadian government to order the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.

On the anniversary of both Fontaine and Boushie's accused killers' trials — both of which ended in acquittal — Cree singer iskwē released the song ""Little Star,"" a response to racist media coverage during the youths' deaths and subsequent trials.

Have you seen the news today

Did you hear what they had to say

About our lost star

They take in ways I can't understand

Place the blame on her like she was nobody's child

March 28, 2017: Edmonton Oilers clinch playoff spot

The last time the Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup was in 1990 and in 2017, they earned their first spot in the playoffs since 2006.

To mark this momentous occasion, Edmonton-born rapper Cadence Weapon released an ode to the team's captain, Connor McDavid. The team unfortunately got eliminated in the second round, and have yet to return to the playoffs since.

Reppin' Edmo

We don't play for the Flames

Yeah we caught a few L's

Now we back in the game

Hope we see a banner getting raised.

Sept. 25, 2018: Romeo Saganash stands up to Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons

NDP MP Romeo Saganash accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of not caring about Indigenous peoples' rights during talks over the Trans Mountain pipeline. ""Why doesn't the prime minister just say the truth and tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn't give a f--k about their rights?"" Saganash asked the House in September 2018.

A year later, DJ duo A Tribe Called Red commemorated that day by releasing ""The OG,"" featuring powwow drum group Black Bear, which excerpts Saganash's House of Commons speech.

Mr. Speaker, sounds like a most important relationship, doesn't it?

Why doesn't the prime minister just say the truth

And tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn't give a f--k about their rights?

Anti-Black racism, police shootings of Black people

Regis Korchinski-Paquet. D'Andre Campbell. Nicholas Gibbs. Olando Brown. Pierre Coriolan. There is no date on this entry because police killings of Black Canadians and anti-Black racism have many dates — too many to list, and without an end in sight.

In October 2018, Shad released A Short Story About a War, a concept album set in a dystopian desert world of Shad's making, but its themes and allegories of violence and racism are all reality. The song ""The Stone Throwers (Gone in a Blink)"" covers a list of oppressions — slavery, real estate segregation, the water crisis in Flint, Mich., the prison system — that spans centuries, and it came with a video that matches striking images with these standout lines:

We wasn't thought of

We wasn't brought up and taught we was set up

That's why we get caught up

Y'all discarded us

Put them bars up

Of course we got guards up

We hard cuz we're hard up

They got them start-ups and Starbucks'

We got a couple of stars till they turn 'em to stardust

They starve us

Can't even drink water

Up North with that Flint water

All in the sink as they sink farther.

170,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bet-awards-blm-1.5630961,BET Awards highlight Black voices as artists turn political,"['Mesfin Fekadu', 'The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jun', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"The BET Awards served as an extension of the voices of Black people protesting in the streets about the inequalities Black people face daily, as artists used their performances to highlight the Black Lives Matter movement, civil rights and the lives of those lost because of police officers, including George Floyd.

DaBaby, with his face pressed against the ground as an officer's knee crippled his neck — replicating the last moments of Floyd's life — rapped a verse from the Black Lives Matter remix of his hit song Rockstar.

His performance also featured images from protests, a reflection of the current world in the wake of Floyd's death and the death of others, including Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.

Sunday's show, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic, featured a number of highly produced, well-crafted and pre-taped performances. The BET Awards kicked off with Black artists rapping and singing anthems about the Black experience and fighting for equal rights.

Anderson .Paak and Jay Rock perform ""Lockdown,"" a powerful song about the impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans and the nationwide protests against police brutality. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BETAwards?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BETAwards</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9zWye1BXuv"">https://t.co/9zWye1BXuv</a> —@BETAwards

The 12-year-old sensation Keedron Bryant, who turned heads on social media with his passionate performance about being a young Black man in today's world, started the show with an a cappella performance of his poignant song I Just Wanna Live, which earned him a record deal.

That was followed by an all-star performance of Public Enemy's 1989 anthem Fight the Power, featuring Nas, Black Thought, Rapsody and YG adding new lyrics to the song, even namedropping Taylor and others.

Michelle Obama highlighted Beyoncé's commitment to the Black community before presenting her with the humanitarian award, saying: ""You can see it in everything she does, from her music that gives voice to Black joy and Black pain, to her activism that demands justice for Black lives.""

Beyoncé received the humanitarian award and used her speech to urge everyone to vote. 'There are people banking on us staying at home during local elections and primaries happening in states across the country. We have to vote like our life depends on it, because it does.' (Associated Press)

Beyoncé used her speech to encourage viewers to vote ""like our life depends on it"" in the upcoming election.

""I want to dedicate this award to all of my brothers out there, all of my sisters out there inspiring me, marching and fighting for change. Your voices are being heard and you're proving to our ancestors that their struggles were not in vain. Now we have one more thing we need to do to walk in our true power, and that is to vote,"" she said.

Political, artsy performances

Sunday's show celebrated BET's 20th awards show and BET's 40th year as a network. The three-hour event, which aired on CBS for the first time, was hosted by comedian, actress and TV personality Amanda Seales, who starred in several skits, including one about women who identify as ""Karen,"" a common stereotype and term for racist and privileged white women.

Other artists were political during their performances, including Roddy Ricch, who wore a Black Lives Matter shirt while he rapped, Alicia Keys, Anderson Paak and Jay Rock, as well as brothers SiR and D Smoke, who performed with their mother Jackie Gouche.

Lil Wayne paid tribute to NBA icon Kobe Bryant, who died in January, with a performance of his 2009 song Kobe Bryant, weaving in new lyrics. Wayne Brady, in a glittery suit, rolled around on top of a piano as he sang a medley of Little Richard hits.

Nipsey Hussle, who was named best male hip-hop artist and earned the humanitarian award at last year's BET Awards, won video of the year for Higher, a clip he filmed with DJ Khaled and John Legend shortly before he died .

""This is for Nipsey Hussle and hip-hop,"" Khaled said in a taped video. ""Nipsey Hussle, thank you for working with me on this Higher record. I appreciate you. Nipsey's family, we love you.""

The BET Awards, one of the first awards shows to air virtually, featured performances that were sharp with artsy stage production, giving extra life to the songs being performed. It was a welcome break from the ""living room"" and homebound performances hundreds of artists have shared on social media since the pandemic hit in March.

Chloe x Halle, who have successfully performed for various TV shows and events during the pandemic while promoting their new album, gave an epic performance of their songs Do It and Forgive Me. R&B star Summer Walker, who played guitar and sang, was also impressive during her performance, which featured Usher.

Megan Thee Stallion went to the desert with background dancers as she twerked and rapped her No. 1 hit Savage. She won best female hip-hop artist, beating out Cardi B and Nicki Minaj.

""Oh my God, I probably recorded this video like 10 times. It feels so crazy doing this from my house,"" she said. ""I used to watch the BET Awards all the time thinking, 'One day that's going to be me going up there accepting my award' — and now it is.""

Though the BET Awards are technically about handing out trophies, the awards were an afterthought. During the live telecast, Richh won album of the year for his debut Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial; Lizzo was named best female R&B/pop artist; and Burna Boy won best international act. Overall, Chris Brown, Beyoncé and Ricch were the night's big winners, taking home two honours each. Beyoncé won the BET HER award for Brown Skin Girl, shared with daughter Blue Ivy Carter as well as Wizkid and Saint JHN. The song also won Beyoncé and Blue Ivy a Soul Train Music Award last year.",[]

Kelly Peterson told The Canadian Press that as trustee of the late musician's estate, she's always looking for ways to further his legacy and welcomes the effort by a Montreal man to see her late husband recognized.

A petition launched last week by Naveed Hussain calling on the city to rename Lionel-Groulx Metro station after Peterson, who grew up in the nearby Little Burgundy neighbourhood, has been gaining traction, so far garnering more than 16,000 signatures.

""I love the idea of Oscar being honoured,"" Peterson said Thursday. ""It always really warms my heart and thrills me to see him being remembered.""

""To have so many people in the neighbourhood in which he grew up wanting to honour him and remember him that way is really overwhelming.""

However, the City of Montreal and its transit agency, the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), have said that renaming a Metro station is complicated and not likely to happen.

An STM spokesperson said stations are typically named after the streets they exit onto or nearby landmarks.The STM has only ever made five name changes since the Metro opened in 1966, and it's had a moratorium on name changes since 2006.

A previous grassroots attempt to rename Lionel-Groulx station for Peterson in 2008, shortly after the musician's death, did not succeed.

In Montreal, a concert hall at Concordia University bears Peterson's name, as does a park not far from Lionel-Groulx station. There's also a mural across from the green space in Little Burgundy near the Metro station, inaugurated in 2010.

A city spokesperson indicated this week officials would be open to finding a different way of honouring the jazz legend whose career spanned more than 60 years.

Just last year, the city honoured Peterson's late sister, Daisy Peterson-Sweeney, an accomplished music teacher, by naming a park in the neighbourhood for her.

""I would be delighted and thrilled and honoured if the city wanted to do something to honour Oscar even more,"" Peterson said.

""It's not something I ever expect from anyone — I don't just mean Montreal — Oscar was always humbled by every honour he received, and I feel the same way.""

Kelly Peterson, who lives in southern Ontario, said it's not for her to get involved in Montreal city politics or change its policies.

""I don't live there. I don't feel I have the right to get involved in something that has an impact on the residents, and I'm not one of them,"" she said. ""But the honour? Absolutely, I love it.""

Oscar Peterson does have schools named for him in the Ontario communities of Mississauga and Stouffville, as well as a small square in Toronto's financial district.

Kelly Peterson's focus has been on promoting her late husband's musical legacy — the songs that he recorded and played, but more recently, those he composed himself, so that people can see a more complete version of Oscar Peterson.

""People play Bach. People play Beethoven. I want people to play Oscar Peterson,"" she said. ""I've always felt that his music will outlive all of us: people will be listening to Oscar's music 100 years from now, so it would be nice if there are other things that represent him, as well.""",[]

And now she can add children's book author to that list, with the publication of Hey Little Rockabye.

Featuring illustrations by Ben Hodson, Hey Little Rockabye conveys an important message about finding love and acceptance: a young girl rescues a little dog and tries to convince her parents to let her keep him.

An accompanying song was released and the book features sheet music for readers to sing along.

Sainte-Marie spoke with Shelagh Rogers about creating Hey Little Rockabye.

For the love of pets

""Hey Little Rockabye is about the many wonderful pets who need a forever home. We're hoping that people will consider adopting a little Rockabye of their own through shelters. There are all kinds of reasons why a pet may need a home — and all kinds of people who would do well to have one.

There are all kinds of reasons why a pet may need a home — and all kinds of people who would do well to have one.

""Over the years, I came to be not only a dog people but a cat people. So I'm both. Cats and dogs are very different. Most people who start out with dogs they think that a cat is going to speak the same language as a dog. But you can train cats, you just have to learn a different language. It's like playing the piano is kind of like playing a guitar, but not exactly in crucial ways.""

Longing for a pet

""As a little girl, I had rabbits. There was a dog and there was a cat that everybody ignored. When I was a little girl I wanted to be a zookeeper — and would envision that would get me close to animals!

When I'm on the road, I like to go down to the local shelter or the local pet stores where they have pets out for adoption.

""I'm always longing for a pet. When I'm on the road — when I'm in Toronto or Calgary or someplace — I like to go down to the local shelter or the local pet stores where they have pets out for adoption. I like to go in to socialize with the animals who are there.

""I think it does those pets a lot of good, the more people socialize with them. It makes them a better candidate for adoption if we do that now and then.""

Finding forever homes

""I'm glad that people are finding out about available animals at pet shelters. All of my animals have been rescues. Adopting a pet is a major thing.

It's a major commitment and I'm so proud that people are finding forever homes for these animals.

""In many pet shelters, you have to sign some papers that state you are not going to adopt a kitten and then abandon it when it grows up — or adopt a dog and then find out that there are vet bills involved.

""It's a major commitment and I'm so proud that people are finding forever homes for these animals. The animals give us so much. It's so precious.""
