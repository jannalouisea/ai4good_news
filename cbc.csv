Disinfecting groceries, wiping down packages, cordoning off playgrounds.

While those approaches to avoiding COVID-19 infection became commonplace early on in the pandemic, the virus may not transmit as easily on surfaces as was originally thought — and experts say it may be time to shift our focus on how we protect ourselves.

To date, there have been ""no specific reports"" of COVID-19 directly from contact with contaminated surfaces, even though research consistently shows the virus can survive on them for several hours or days, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.

The update was part of a new scientific brief released by the UN agency outlining its stance on how COVID-19 spreads, after an open letter from more than 200 experts to change its messaging on the possibility it transmits through the air.

Despite the lack of concrete evidence on surface transmission, the WHO still maintains contaminated surfaces – also known as fomites – are a ""likely mode of transmission"" for COVID-19.

Surfaces 'not a significant risk' for COVID-19

But experts from a variety of disciplines aren't convinced, and some warn the focus on surfaces has been overblown.

Emanuel Goldman, a microbiology professor at the New Jersey Medical School of Rutgers University, said in an article published in The Lancet journal earlier this week that the risk of COVID-19 infection from surfaces is ""exaggerated.""

""This is not a significant risk,"" he told CBC News. ""Not even a measurable risk.""

Goldman said the evidence for infection from surfaces was based on lab experiments that were unrealistic when compared to real life situations and used extremely large amounts of virus to test if it could survive over extended periods of time.

Linsey Marr, an expert in the transmission of viruses at Virginia Tech who has studied the survival of COVID-19 on surfaces, said that while it's possible people could get infected from surfaces, it's still unclear if it's actually happening.

""I think the thinking has changed,"" Marr said, adding the perceived risk of transmission from contaminated surfaces is lower than it was earlier in the pandemic when not much was known about the coronavirus.

She said in order to be infected with COVID-19 from a surface, a person would have to transfer it to their fingers where it would need to survive long enough to enter the body by touching the eyes, nose or mouth.

""We know that virus can survive [on surfaces] and then the question is, can people pick those up and transfer them into their respiratory tract?"" Marr said. ""You have to have a lot of virus on there to cause infections.""

The average person infected with COVID-19 also isn't typically shedding large amounts of the virus at any given time, noted infectious disease specialist Dr. Zain Chagla, an associate professor at McMaster University in Hamilton.

""Viruses aren't that environmentally hardy,"" he added.

""They're built to infect humans. They're built to infect cells. As soon as they leave the human host and enter the environment, they become more and more unstable.""

Eugene Chudnovsky, a professor of physics at the City University of New York whose research has focused on the spread of the virus, said the threat of infection from a surface like a doorknob really depends on the conditions to which it was exposed.

""If there are just a few people touching it in an hour, it's very unlikely it will contain the infective dose of the virus,"" he said.

""But if this is a door that is getting opened every few seconds for a lengthy bit of time and there is a significant number of symptomatic infected people who are touching it during a few hours, it can accumulate a significant amount of the virus.""

Disinfecting surfaces 'not as necessary as we thought'

One of the reasons the evidence for COVID-19 infection from surfaces is lacking is because it's difficult to track through contact tracing.

""You can start asking people about conversations they had and places they were, but when you start asking them about surfaces they've touched, it gets much, much harder to really pin it down,"" said Erin Bromage, an associate biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who researches infectious diseases.

""They're probably associated with a few percentage of transmissions, probably at the highest, which is a lot lower than what we find, say, for influenza – but it seems to be not a major driver with this particular pathogen.""

The Public Health Agency of Canada maintains it is ""not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces,"" and says the risk of infection from things like packages is low. It does, however, still list contaminated surfaces as a common route of infection.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines on surface transmission of COVID-19 in May, saying it ""may be possible"" a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface that has the virus on it but it's not ""the main way the virus spreads.""

""There's just a growing narrative that the degree of transmission through fomites is probably less than what was earlier anticipated,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.

""The vast majority of transmission seems to be through close contact with an infected individual, primarily in an indoor setting.""

He said the change in thinking around the risk of COVID-19 infection from surfaces means that the average person's groceries are probably much less of a threat than a visit to the grocery store.

""It reinforces hand hygiene, but it also tells us that the need to disinfect every surface that comes into the house is probably not as necessary as we thought it was earlier on in the pandemic,"" he said. ""It's not hurting anybody, but it's just not necessary.""

Bromage, who wrote a viral blog post in May shared by millions explaining the places people are most at risk of COVID-19 infection, said the risk of transmission from surfaces on things brought into the home is ""quite low"" in countries like the U.S. and Canada.

""It's probably something to be aware of,"" he said, ""but something that we don't need to focus a lot of anxiety and attention on.""

Chagla said the initial focus on surface contamination also sparked a common practice that could be downright harmful: wearing latex gloves while running errands or shopping.

""Going to the grocery store wearing a pair of gloves is probably not the cleanest thing to be doing,"" he said.

While health-care workers and food service staff wear gloves for infection control reasons, Chagla stressed they're used for specific purposes, and short periods of time.

Wearing gloves for extended stretches while touching various objects can lead to cross-contamination the longer you're wearing them, he said, which winds up being less helpful than just washing or sanitizing your bare hands regularly.

'Misinterpretation' of data

For parents of young children who are concerned about the risk of COVID-19 infection from surfaces like playgrounds, which have been off limits in cities like Toronto for months, the lack of evidence is no doubt frustrating.

Marr thinks the guidance on children avoiding playgrounds has been ""misguided"" throughout the pandemic.

""Playgrounds are probably one of the safer places for kids to congregate, if they have to congregate,"" she said. ""And the reason why is that sunlight kills off the virus pretty effectively. So if it is on surfaces, I don't think it's going to last very long.""

Chagla said at this point in the pandemic, there's no ""good reason"" why playgrounds should remain closed, given the combination of sunlight and open-air ventilation making them a relatively low-risk activity.

Marr said the real risk of infection from playgrounds is largely from kids who are in close contact with each other, not from the surfaces they're interacting with.

Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said Wednesday that officials are weighing the evidence on infection in children, but that the risk seems low.

""From the science, what we know is that certainly young people, children, are less likely to have more severe consequences if they do get infected with the virus,"" he said.

""It also appears that in terms of transmission, young children — at least in some of the studies I've seen — do not appear to be as efficient or effective in terms of transmitting the virus to others.""

Goldman said misguided policy decisions from governments and businesses pushed him to speak out about the lack of evidence for COVID-19 risk from surfaces.

""The problem is the public policy was driven by this misinterpretation of the data,"" he said.

""It's not that the data were wrong, but they were not the right data. It was not data that applied to the actual situations that are relevant.""

Goldman said these policy decisions can be ""counterproductive"" because they can ""dilute"" effective prevention measures like physical distancing and wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19.

""It's actually harmful to have the wrong interpretation of the data,"" he said.

""I think it's time to say the emperor has no clothes.""

19,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-face-mask-public-1st-time-military-hospital-visit-1.5646591,Trump wears face mask in public for 1st time during military hospital visit,"['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"U.S. President Donald Trump wore a mask during a visit to a military hospital on Saturday, the first time the president has been seen in public with the type of facial covering recommended by health officials as a precaution against spreading or becoming infected by the novel coronavirus.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., located just outside of Washington, D.C., to meet wounded service members and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it's a great thing to wear a mask.""

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the novel coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

WATCH | Are you making these face mask mistakes?:

A face mask is meant to limit the spread of COVID-19. But if it slips below your nose, hovers around your chin, or you touch the outside with your hands, medical experts say that might be riskier than not wearing one at all. 3:55

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democrat Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Okla., Phoenix and South Dakota's Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you're out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it's difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

He Is The Author Of Promise', 'Peril', ""A Book About Justin Trudeau'S Years In Power.Follow Aaron On Twitter"", 'Aaron Wherryparliament Hill Bureau', 'Parliament Hill Bureau']",,"Justin Trudeau and his government have shown a remarkable ability to find trouble in novel places — a Christmas vacation, the Shawcross doctrine and the possibility of a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC-Lavalin, the prime minister's choice of attire during a trip to India.

And now, a national program for student volunteers.

News that a subsidiary of the WE Charity paid Trudeau's mother and brother for speaking engagements raises further questions about the government's decision to enlist WE to disburse the funds from that program — and the prime minister's apparent involvement in signing off on that decision.

It inflames doubts that were already being raised about the intent behind the government's decision to partner with WE.

But it also makes one wonder why the prime minister keeps putting himself in these situations.

WE insisted at first that ""the charity"" had ""never paid an honorarium"" to Margaret Trudeau, the former wife of Pierre Trudeau, who is known for her advocacy on the issue of mental health. In some cases, that statement now appears to be incorrect: the charity did pay Margaret Trudeau for some appearances, though WE now claims that was a paperwork error. But WE's original claim also elided over the fact that its for-profit arm, ME to WE, had paid the prime minister's mother.

For WE, it's impossible to justify that omission. For Trudeau, the newest facts make it much more difficult for him to explain why he went anywhere near this decision.

Trudeau insists that the recommendation to partner with WE came from public service officials and an associate deputy minister has defended the choice. A committee of the House of Commons has requested the internal documentation related to the government's decision and the paper trail will now be studied closely.

But even a recommendation from a non-partisan public servant won't be enough to entirely redeem what has happened here.

Even without the participation of Trudeau and his family members in WE events, it's now obvious that the charity's involvement would have attracted WE's various critics regardless. In fact, it was criticism of WE's general practices and new complaints about how it was administering the volunteer program that compelled the government and the charity to walk away from their arrangement last week.

A scandal in plain sight

That false start has real implications for a program that is supposed to be creating opportunities for young people.

But the demise of the partnership was not enough to end the controversy because of the known ties between Trudeau and WE. In addition to the appearances by Margaret and Alexandre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau has made several appearances as prime minister at WE events and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau hosts a podcast for WE (she is not paid for that, though she was paid for an appearance in 2012).

That was always going to be enough to raise suspicions. The fact that Margaret and Alexandre, also known as Sacha, were paid for their appearances now adds money to the mix.

Maybe, by some strict reading of the applicable rules, the Liberals can argue that Trudeau's involvement in the decision to go forward with WE didn't amount to a conflict of interest. That ultimately will be up to the ethics commissioner to decide. But the prime minister himself could have eliminated the possibility of any conflict — simply by stepping back and excusing himself from any participation in the decision.

As Trudeau acknowledged earlier this week, he did not recuse himself. And now he faces the possibility of a third reprimand by the ethics commissioner — after earlier rulings against that vacation on the Aga Khan's private island and the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.

Some may choose to believe that there was corruption in any or all of those cases. A final verdict on the current controversy will depend on both documentation and the testimony of officials. But even a less-damning read of the last five years is unflattering.

Self-inflicted wounds

For whatever reason, the prime minister and his office seem to have a recurring problem of failing to check themselves. As a result, they have now repeatedly wrecked themselves.

Perhaps believing their motives are sound and their intentions are good — and that meaning well should transcend all potential problems — they have waltzed into a series of avoidable spectacles.

In each case, it seems as if someone (not least the prime minister himself) should have seen the trouble coming — that what this government lacks is someone willing to put their hand up and ask, ""Wait, are we sure about this?"" (In that respect, Trudeau's worst moments as prime minister might have something in common with his infamous decision to wear blackface in previous years — the lack of an internal or external voice counselling caution.)

Trudeau apologized in September 2019 after images and a video of him in blackface and brownface became public, just weeks before the federal election.

Trudeau's life has played out at a rarified level, where your father can be a friend of the Aga Khan and your mother and your brother can be celebrities who get paid to speak. Someone from that world should be keenly aware of how vulnerable he is to the charge of being out-of-touch — should know how dangerous it is to leave the impression that the standards of mere mortals don't apply to him. And yet, more than once, he seems to have lost track of what is expected from a politician.

Burning through the benefit of the doubt

Trudeau's Liberals came to power having made many promises to do big things. They might tell themselves now that their electoral fortunes still depend ultimately on getting those big things right — on the economy, equality, climate change, and so on. There is still a pandemic to battle. But ethics and judgment and character become big things when people in public life leave room for doubt — when they can be labelled arrogant, or entitled, or worse.

It also gets much harder to do those big things every time you turn a Christmas vacation or a student volunteer program into a multi-chapter affair of revelation and recrimination.

In the absence of the WE controversy, the focus of political attention in Ottawa yesterday might have been the new jobs numbers, or the testimony of grocery store executives who recently withdrew a wage bonus for their employees. The Liberals might only have had to worry about how they were going to manage the economy's restart and the government's fiscal situation.

Instead, the prime minister is being asked again to account for actions that apparently weren't accounted for very well to begin with.",[]

How the pandemic caught Canada with its stockpiles down.

South Africa's confirmed cases have doubled in just 2 weeks

India breaks its record for a daily increase in cases.

Why it may be harder to catch COVID-19 from surfaces than we first thought.

A long-expected upturn in the United States for coronavirus deaths has begun, driven by fatalities in states in the South and West, according to data on the pandemic.

The number of deaths per day from the virus had been falling for months and even remained down as states like Florida and Texas saw explosions in cases and hospitalizations — and reported daily U.S. infections broke records several times in recent days.

Scientists warned it wouldn't last. A coronavirus death, when it occurs, typically comes several weeks after a person is first infected. And experts predicted states that saw increases in cases and hospitalizations would, at some point, see deaths rise, too. Now that's happening.

""It's consistently picking up. And it's picking up at the time you'd expect it to,"" said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious diseases researcher.

According to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for daily reported deaths in the U.S. has increased from 578 two weeks ago to 664 on July 10 — still well below the heights hit in April. Daily reported deaths increased in 27 states over that time period, but the majority of those states are averaging under 15 new deaths per day. A smaller group of states has been driving the nationwide increase in deaths.

California is averaging 91 reported deaths per day while Texas is close behind with 66. But Florida, Arizona, Illinois, New Jersey and South Carolina also saw sizable rises. New Jersey's recent jump is thought to be partially attributable to its less frequent reporting of probable deaths.

The virus has killed more than 130,000 people in the U.S. and more than a half-million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be higher.

Deaths first began mounting in the U.S. in March. About two dozen deaths were being reported daily in the middle of that month. By late in the month, hundreds were being reported each day and thousands in April. Most happened in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast.

Deaths were so high there because it was a new virus tearing through a densely populated area, and it quickly swept through vulnerable groups of people in nursing homes and other places, said Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers University School of Public Health in New Jersey.

Many of the infections occurred before government officials imposed stay-at-home orders and other physical-distancing measures. The daily death toll started falling in mid-April — and continued to fall until about a week ago.

Researchers now expect deaths to rise for at least several weeks, but some think the count probably will not go up as dramatically as it did in the spring — for several reasons.

First, testing was extremely limited early in the pandemic, and it's become clear that unrecognized infections were spreading on subways, in nursing homes and in other public places before anyone knew exactly what was going on. Now testing is more widespread, and the magnitude of outbreaks is becoming better understood.

Second, many people's health behaviours have changed, with mask-wearing becoming more common in some places. Although there is no vaccine yet, hospitals are also getting better at treating patients.

Another factor, tragically, is that deadly new viruses often tear through vulnerable populations first, such as the elderly and people already weakened by other health conditions. That means in the Northeast, at least, ""many of the vulnerable people have already died,"" Halkitis said.

Now, the U.S. is likely in for ""a much longer, slower burn,"" Hanage, the Harvard researcher, said. ""We're not going to see as many deaths [as in the spring]. But we're going to see a total number of deaths, which is going to be large.""

What's happening with coronavirus in Canada

As of 12:45 p.m. ET on Saturday, Canada had 107,346 confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 71,266 of those as recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,809.

Ontario reported 130 new confirmed cases on Saturday, bringing the province's total to 36,594.

Quebec reported 91 new cases on Saturday for a provincial total of 56,407.

In British Columbia, health officials on Friday reported 25 more cases of COVID 19 within a 24-hour period, the biggest increase since May 8.

B.C. health officials have issued a warning about possible exposure to the coronavirus in Kelowna, covering anyone who attended public and private gatherings in the downtown and waterfront areas over 12 days this summer. It's believed eight cases may be tied to visits to local bars and restaurants between June 25 and July 6.

Several towns in Quebec's Montérégie region have made masks mandatory after an outbreak of COVID-19 linked to house parties.

Newfoundland and Labrador on Friday reported its first new case of coronavirus in six weeks. The patient is a man in his 50s who had recently returned from the U.S., according to the provincial health department.

Meanwhile, Nova Scotia has extended its state of emergency for another two weeks. Emergency measures are now in place until July 26.

The extension was announced as the province reported no new cases of COVID-19 and one more recovery — leaving only three active cases.

Here's what's happening around the world

Globally more than 12.5 million people have been infected by the virus and over 560,000 have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the pandemic's true toll is much higher due to testing shortages, poor data collection in some nations and other issues.

In Africa, more than 8,000 health workers have been infected, half of them in South Africa. The continent of 1.3 billion has the world's lowest levels of health staffing and more than 550,000 cases, and the pandemic is reaching ""full speed,"" the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

In Kenya, some have been outraged by a local newspaper report that says several governors have installed intensive-care unit equipment in their homes. The country lost its first doctor to COVID-19 this week.

South Africa's confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled in just two weeks to a quarter-million. To complicate matters, the country's troubled power utility has announced new electricity cuts in the dead of winter as a cold front brings freezing weather. Many of the country's urban poor live in shacks of scrap metal and wood.

In Asia-Pacific, the beleaguered Australian state of Victoria received some good news, with health officials reporting 216 new cases in the past 24 hours, down from the record 288 the previous day. It hopes a new six-week lockdown in Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city with a population of five million, will curb the spread.

India reported a new daily high of 27,114 cases on Saturday, and nearly a dozen states have imposed a partial lockdown in high-risk areas.

A surge in infections saw cases jump from 600,000 to more than 800,000 in nine days. Infected people are packing India's public hospitals, as many are unable to afford private facilities that generally uphold higher standards of care.

In the Americas, where inequality is sharp and Brazil and Peru are among the world's top five most badly hit countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping through the continent's leadership, with two more presidents and powerful officials testing positive in the past week.

Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro and Interim Bolivia President Jeanine Anez have both said they tested positive in the past week. Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández announced June 16 that he and his wife had tested positive.

Many leaders have used their diagnoses to call on the public to heighten precautions like physical distancing and mask wearing. But some, like Bolsonaro, have drawn attention to unproven treatments with potentially harmful side effects.

In Europe, Greek authorities announced 41 new cases of coronavirus over the past 24 hours on Saturday, with 11 detected in incoming tourists.There were no new confirmed deaths. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 3,772 and 193 deaths.

Italy has confirmed another 188 infections, a third in the hard-hit Lombardy region. Public health officials say the outbreak remains under control in Italy, the one-time epicentre of the outbreak in Europe, but they are paying attention to clusters of domestic and international infections.

Italy halted all air traffic with Bangladesh and 13 other countries after more than two dozen cases were linked to charter flights of returning Bangladeshi immigrants. On Saturday, eight of the 19 new infections in the Lazio region around Rome were linked to the Bangladeshi community cluster.",[]
22,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rober-mueller-roger-stone-russia-investigation-trump-commute-sentence-1.5646624,"Robert Mueller defends Russia probe, says Roger Stone 'remains a convicted felon' in op-ed","['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Former U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of ""paramount importance"" and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, ""remains a convicted felon, and rightly so"" despite the president's decision to commute his prison sentence.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller's first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president's extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to ""respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

""The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,"" Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this ""whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.""

Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT! —@realDonaldTrump

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work.

In his first public appearance after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report's findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller said did not adequately capture the gravity of his team's findings.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller's mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

Roger Stone was sentenced in February to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether the U.S. president's campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. 4:07

Stone was particularly critical, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks' release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers.

""We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,"" Mueller wrote. ""The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.""",[]

To hear Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand describe it, Canada's effort to supply frontline workers during the pandemic has been a significant — if uneven — success.

""We did procurement like it has never been done before,"" said Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand. ""We are in an urgent scramble to secure personal protective equipment and we will not let up until that task is accomplished.""

The federal government, she said, has conducted just under a hundred flights to Canada carrying Chinese personal protective equipment (PPE) and bringing supplies from the U.S. and Europe.

It was a remarkable, last-ditch effort. But could it have been avoided?

Dr. Sandy Buchman, president of the Canadian Medical Association, gives Ottawa credit for pulling every lever it could when the need for PPE became critical. ""But they wouldn't have had to scramble to do that if we had adequate stockpiles, and the same goes for medication,"" he told CBC News. ""We should have maintained and had them available.

""We had a pandemic plan in place but we didn't actually have things ready. We didn't have adequate personal protective equipment for frontline health care workers.""

In fact, Canada still doesn't have the PPE it needs to keep those essential workers safe.

Read more from the series:

Just take a look at the nation's capital. Thirty out of some 600 Ottawa paramedics are currently reassigned from front-line duties because of a lack of N95 masks, according to their union.

CUPE ambulance rep Jason Fraser told CBC News that when he began as a paramedic during the SARS epidemic in 2003, he and his co-workers were fitted out with state-of-the-art respirators.

""For 17 years, the gold standard of mask has been the N95 masks,"" he said. ""And due to a global shortage or difficulty obtaining proper PPE, all of a sudden surgical masks are OK protection.""

Fraser said his members don't want to work with anything less than N95s and don't believe they'd be asked to do so were it not for preventable shortages.

He points the finger of blame mainly at the Ontario government. But a shortage of N95s has been an issue in many places across the country.

PPE stock in poor shape

Canada's pandemic response got off to a rocky start when it came to the basic tools: masks, gowns, gloves and other products.

Canadian PPE stockpile levels were woefully low when the pandemic hit; materials were allowed to expire without being used or even donated, and then ended up in landfills. The Trudeau government was widely criticized for sending 16 tons of PPE to China at a time when the novel coronavirus was still mostly a Chinese problem, and the Public Health Agency of Canada was still mistakenly assessing the risk to Canadians as ""low.""

Anand said her department responded to those shortages by fostering the creation of a Canadian PPE industry from scratch.

""Forty-four per cent of our contracts by dollar value are made with domestic manufacturers,"" she said.

""This is an incredible effort on behalf of Canadians themselves to protect Canadians. So that is a heartening story and it's also an important lesson learned.""

It's a lesson nearly everyone involved in fighting the pandemic agrees has to be learned — if Canada wants to avoid the same experience when the next pandemic hits.

The preppers weren't prepared

One nation that hasn't had to worry about PPE is Finland. Its history of Soviet invasion left it with a siege mentality that manifested itself in the construction of a secret network of bunkers stocked with supplies to carry its people through times of war or disaster — including a huge stockpile of masks.

Canada also has a National Emergency Stockpile System (NESS), launched in 1952 at the height of the Cold War and originally intended to help Canada survive a nuclear attack.

Lately, the system's rationale has changed somewhat. ""We began to move away from beds and blankets and increased our holdings of antiviral medications and key treatments,"" Sally Thornton of the Public Health Agency of Canada told MPs at a committee hearing in May.

""We do not focus on PPE and that wouldn't be a major element, because we count on our provinces, within their respective authority, to maintain their stockpile.""

Some MPs found that answer highly unsatisfactory, given that the NESS last year threw out two million N95 masks that had been allowed to expire.

Stockpile 'completely unready'

""The stockpile system proved completely unready for COVID-19, and the degree of unreadiness goes well beyond the explanation that COVID-19 was was unexpected in terms of its impact and scale,"" said Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa, an intelligence expert who studied the NESS's response to the pandemic.

""It was clearly underfunded. Cabinet ministers and senior officials have admitted that fact.""

Health Minister Patty Hajdu said in April that ""federal governments for decades have been underfunding things like public health preparedness, and I would say that obviously governments all across the world are in the same exact situation.""

What Hajdu said is true — although her own government closed warehouses and left the stockpile even smaller than it found it. NESS's annual budget is only about $3 million and both the Harper and Trudeau governments routinely spent even less on it. It has a regular staff of just 18 people.

""But beyond its underfunding,"" said Wark, ""it basically lacked any kind of strategy as far as I can tell to prepare for an emergency ...""

""There was really no planning done to integrate the federal government's stockpile system with those held by the provinces and territories. It's not until February — a month into the COVID-19 crisis — [that] the federal government wakes up to the fact that they don't even know what is held in provincial and territorial stockpiles, nor do provinces and territories know what's held in the federal stockpile. That points to a basic strategic failure.""

The come-as-you-are pandemic

When March arrived, Wark said, ""the stockpile system had to transition into being a kind of portal for trying to get supplies hastily mobilized from domestic suppliers or international sources into Canada and passed on to provinces and territories.

""You know, I think the whole thing was just a desperate scramble. And it didn't need to have been that way, if proper attention had been paid to the important role that the stockpile system was meant to play.""

A pandemic is a bad time to start shopping for emergency supplies. With COVID-19 engulfing one country after another, Canada found itself competing with dozens of other countries, as well as private U.S. hospital networks, to acquire the most sought-after items.

Anand said the government has learned that lesson and will ensure that stockpiles of PPE, medicines and other essentials are maintained in future.

Stockpiles alone won't solve the problem, she said, because PPE products have expiry dates and a major pandemic would at least start to exhaust any stockpile.

""Another part of the puzzle is also to make sure that we've got relationships with a diverse range of suppliers who can produce these goods so that we have priority when it comes to making sure that we have that product,"" she said.

Unreliable suppliers

Canada's two main markets for acquiring PPE supplies — the U.S. and China — have been problematic.

China's PPE market quickly flooded with new companies that previously had been making things like baby toys or auto parts. They began to churn out PPE of wildly varying quality.

In the U.S., President Donald Trump ordered 3M to stop fulfilling contracts to provide N95 masks to other countries, and halted a shipment to Ontario in April. Thanks mainly to dogged resistance to that order by 3M executives, the threat was averted.

But it it all served as a reminder of the risks involved in depending on other countries for essential supplies in a global emergency. Ontario Premier Doug Ford vowed to make his province self-sufficient.

""I'm not going to rely on President Trump,"" he said. ""I'm not going to rely on any prime minister of any country ever again. Our manufacturing, we're gearing up and once they start, we're never going to stop them.""

Anand said she is working to end Canada's dependence on foreign sources.

""The strategy from procurement has been to diversify our supply chains to make sure that we are not reliant on one country or one jurisdiction alone,"" she said.

""We would very much aim to have domestic production of every item here in Canada.""

That would mean persuading the Canadian manufacturers that switched production over to medical equipment — such as clothing maker Stanfields in Nova Scotia — to stay in the game once the crisis passes.

Mixed messages on masks

The government's early advice against wearing masks confused many Canadians, who suspected (correctly, as it turned out) that the guidance defied common sense.

That confusion also affected people in the medical field.

""I have been astounded that we are not being told to wear masks,"" one occupational therapist told CBC News on March 31, describing conditions at the rehab hospital where she worked. ""We are even being told we can't wear our own masks and will be reprimanded and potentially disciplined for doing so.""

Some Canadian hospitals even had security guards order people to remove masks before they could enter.

Calgary ER physician Joe Vipond told CBC News the government's position on masks struck him as irrational from the beginning.

""And I see that changing, but boy it's slow!"" he said.

He said that his own province of Alberta was ""pretty late to the PPE bandwagon"".

""I know in B.C. on March 25 every single hospital and every single long term care facility were mandated to wear masks in all situations, in order to avoid pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread,"" he said.

In Alberta, he added, that decision came ""a good three weeks after. And so I think a lot of ways we were quite lucky to avoid a lot of transmission within our acute care facilities. That didn't work out so well for our long term care facilities.

""I know there was one outbreak at the Lloydminster hospital and also in Winnipeg that were blamed on lack of universal masking. There was always a concern about N95, and we were told to be very cautious in our use.""

Vipond blamed the relentless search for cost efficiencies, cheaper vendors and just-in-time delivery for the shortages.

""There is value in having stockpiles and there is value in having your own domestic control over things,"" he said. ""I'm hoping that we recognize the value of being a masters of our own domain.""

Mike Villeneuve, CEO of the Canadian Nurses' Association, agrees with Vipond about the patchwork nature of PPE access across the country.

""It's been a story of great success in many places ... and the complete opposite in others — you can't seem to get it, or it's locked up, or I'm encouraged to not use it because it's expensive,"" he said.

""Our view is that we should err on the side of protecting people, and whatever the cost of an N95 mask is, [it's] small compared to the cost of a life.""

'A sense of mistrust'

Villeneuve said the fact that rules on PPE use varied from place to place led nurses to suspect PPE policies were being driven not by the best science but by harsh realities of supply and shortage.

""How come that filters down so differently across 13 jurisdictions, hundreds of employers and different practice settings and so on, when a nurse in a practice setting in Alberta is doing the same thing as a nurse in the same setting in Manitoba?"" he said.

""That sort of sets up a sense of mistrust.""

Anand said that it's up to provinces to set such policies — but she doesn't rule out the federal government making uniform recommendations.

She said her department soon will be rolling out new PPE supplier competitions on its supply hub website.

""We have had 26,000 businesses respond to our call out to suppliers, 26,000 businesses wanting to step up and assist in the Team Canada effort,"" she said. And while only about 17,000 of those companies are Canadian, Anand argued it ""suggests is that there is capacity in the Canadian economy to become self-sufficient in the area of PPE.""",[]

“The way we see it represented, it’s immediately associated with a violence, the English term 'warrior,' which has completely different connotations than what we describe our men and their role as, which is Rotisken’rakéhte, he carries the burden of peace,” said Horn-Miller.

“The media at the time of the Oka Crisis created an image of the warrior to vilify our people and what we were doing, and that still continues. When we stand up for something, we’re vilified for it.”

Ellen Gabriel, an activist and artist from Kanesatake who is known for her involvement as spokesperson for the longhouse during the crisis, said she had mixed feelings about the flag for similar reasons.



“On one hand, I am proud because it is a symbol of the resistance of 1990,"" said Gabrie. ""But my experience of it first-hand in the community wasn’t so pleasant.""

When the barricades came down, she said, she faced harassment from people bearing the flag. The images that were predominant in the news, she said, created a romanticized image of warriors and the flag’s association with “male machismo” and ignored Kanien’kehá:ka women’s strong leadership role throughout the crisis.

“It’s sexy — a cute guy wearing a mask … holding an AK-47. It looks so exotic in Canada, right? But when the SWAT team arrived at 5:15 in the morning on July 11, it was the women that went to the front,” she said.

“There hasn’t been an in-depth discussion in our communities about that machismo and how it hurt a lot of us afterwards.”",[]

She Was Formerly Posted In Washington', 'Cbc News', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et']",,"Dr. Jobin Varughese knows all too well the heartbreaking toll wrought by COVID-19 at Ontario's long-term care homes.

He's chief medical officer at Holland Christian Homes' Grace Manor in Brampton, near Toronto, one of the facilities where the military was first deployed in the spring as death tolls across the province's care homes were rapidly rising.

Grace Manor lost 12 residents. Dozens more, including staff, fell ill — a dark time followed now by another threat causing Varughese just as much, if not more, concern than the coronavirus: the ongoing isolation and loneliness of those in his care.

""As a home that's had COVID, I never want to see it come back,"" he said. ""But one of the problems is, we're never going to be able to replace a family member.""

""There's a lot of different roles that [family] caregivers play that we're just missing.""

Varughese is now calling on Ontario's government to allow family caregivers back inside long-term care facilities, describing them as essential. He argues that with infection control training and protective equipment, it can be done safely even as the pandemic drags on.

""Our homes are finding themselves not able to provide everything that they would love to provide because that next level of glue of [family] caregiver is just not present,"" he said, adding family members often play a crucial role in feeding residents, helping them fall asleep, and calming those with dementia.

Naila Shah, 60, is a resident at Seven Oaks long-term care home. Before the pandemic, her family visited twice a day to help with her care. (Submitted by Shah Family )

""One of the benefits of having caregivers is that some of the tasks that may take an hour, or hour-and-a-half, families are very willing to spend that time ... and staff can then move to another task — they're then able to do two or three more things during that same time frame.""

'Our visits were definitely what kept her together'

It's the exact kind of care father-son duo Ali and Azeem Shah say they used to provide for their mother and wife, Naila Shah, who lives at Seven Oaks long-term care home in Scarborough, Ont., where 42 residents died during of COVID-19.

Before the lockdown began in March, the family went to the home twice a day, helping out at meal times and with other tasks. They consider themselves essential caregivers and they're desperate to be allowed back inside to help care for Shah. Her family said she feels like a prisoner.

""There can be so many other things taken care of that us family members can do that will alleviate the home and give them a break,"" said Azeem Shah, her son. ""Our visits were definitely what kept her together in terms of being happy and living a life worth living — not being abandoned or alone.""

WATCH | Growing calls to allow family caregivers back in Ontario nursing homes:

The Ontario government is facing growing calls to allow family members who help with caregiving back inside long-term care homes after being kept out for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2:08

For Ali Shah, the twice daily visits helped too. The retiree has been married to Naila for more than 40 years, and he misses her terribly.

""Usually she won't call—now she calls about three to four times a day,"" Shah said. ""That means she's really, really lonely.""

Despite what she's going through, Shah said Naila is ""more concerned about the family [than herself] ... that everybody is OK. How are the grandchildren?""

'We've still got to be very, very careful'

Currently in Ontario, family members are only allowed to see long-term care residents during 30-minute outdoor visits , with few exceptions. Homes are only required to provide those visits once a week and they must be pre-scheduled.

One visitor is allowed at a time and they must wear a mask and practice physical distancing from their loved one. Visitors are also asked to confirm that they have tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 14 days before their scheduled time.

Beyond those visits, Ontario's long-term care residents remain confined inside while other provinces are allowing more freedoms and visitor access.

In Quebec, where more than 3,600 people living in long-term care died from the virus, residents are once again allowed on outings outside their facilities. Visitors are allowed inside homes and as many as two people can visit at a time, so long as a home isn't experiencing an active outbreak.

In British Columbia, where one of Canada's first widely-reported long-term care outbreaks occurred at the Lynn Valley care home, visitors are also allowed to see their loved ones inside . Visitors are being trained on the proper use of personal protective equipment.

Ontario has no immediate plans to follow suit, according to its health minister, who cited the threat of the virus in a press conference earlier this week. More than 1,800 long-term care residents in the province have died from COVID-19.

""While we know that there are many family members that want to visit their loved one in LTC and do a lot of essential duties and help them in many ways, we are still very concerned about the transmission of COVID-19,"" said Health Ontario Minister Christine Elliott on Wednesday.

""We've got to still be very, very careful.""

'They're missing the point'

Still, several prominent geriatricians have been arguing for weeks that the benefits of carefully opening up homes to family caregivers would far outweigh the risk of COVID-19.

Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Toronto's University Health Network, said the province's current rules are too restrictive, even damaging.

""They're missing the point,"" Sinha said. ""I think a lot of people are going to die of loneliness and isolation and the fact that they're not getting care at levels of what their families were providing before ... if we keep putting these restrictions up.""

WATCH | Frustration surrounds visiting restrictions at Ontario nursing homes:

The Ontario government has now allowed for limited family visits to long-term care homes, but some doctors say the remaining restrictions are stricter than they need to be, and that is frustrating families. 2:04

Others point to chronic under-staffing in long-term care homes, and families' long-time role in filling that gap. They argue loved ones would be eager to learn proper infection control to keep risk as low as possible.

""To assume that families are these walking viral receptacles of plague is patently incorrect, and it's unfair,"" said Vivian Stamatopoulos, a professor at Ontario Tech University and advocate for family caregivers. ""They have, quite frankly, provided a crucial supply of caregiving labour that is missing in these facilities.

""Without their support, that system collapses. And that's exactly what's happened.""

A bittersweet reunion

There have been some exceptions in Ontario. Anil Reddi, whose mother lives in a Toronto long-term care home, is now one of few family caregivers allowed back inside a facility in the province.

But Reddi's access was only granted after he received alarming phone calls from nurses at the home, telling him that his mother had stopped eating.

Their reunion was bittersweet.

""She was angry ... my absence was interpreted by my Mom that I didn't care, I had abandoned her,"" he said. ""That was so sad that she felt that way.""

Reddi now goes to help feed his mother at mealtimes, like he did daily before the pandemic.

""I'm grateful for that but it's just sad to see how far she's gone downhill,"" Reddi said. ""The words 'pandemic prison' have been coined. It's so apt.""

'It's a constant worry'

Still — being able to help his mother multiple times a day in her own room — Reddi knows he's getting the kind of access so many others, like the Shah family, are yearning for too.

""For me, it's really upsetting...and I can only imagine what she's feeling inside,"" Azeem Shah said of his mother. ""It's a constant worry. It's something in the back of your head that you can't get rid of.""

Ali Shah has had an outdoor visit with Naila under Ontario's current rules — a half an hour that went by far too quickly, he said.

Now the 71-year-old lines up for COVID-19 tests every two weeks so he's allowed to keep seeing his wife — especially with the couple's 42nd anniversary coming up at the end of the month.

He hopes to see her on, or at least, near the date — July 26. But, from a distance and with the clock ticking, it will be far from a celebration.

""It has affected everybody,"" Shah said. ""It is a hard time.""",[]
28,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-niece-book-1.5646052,Book by Trump's niece claims he has psychological disorders. We asked psychologists,"['Alexander Panetta', 'About The Authoralexander Panettaalexander Panetta Is A Washington-Based Correspondent For Cbc News Who Has Covered American Politics', 'Canada-U.S. Issues Since He Previously Worked In Ottawa', 'Quebec City', 'Internationally', 'Reporting On Politics', 'Conflict', 'Disaster', 'The Montreal Expos.', 'Alexander Panetta Is A Washington-Based Correspondent For Cbc News Who Has Covered American Politics']",,"Armed with a doctorate in psychology, a piercing pen and a decades-old grudge, Mary Trump has attacked one of the world's most powerful people.

The target is her uncle, the president of the United States.

Her new book about Donald Trump is unique in the annals of presidential biographies: the author purporting to probe the president's mind not only has personal access to family gossip but also professional credentials as a clinical psychologist.

There is deep debate in her field about the ethics of making public pronouncements on the mental health of a public figure — especially one she's never clinically observed.

In Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man, Mary Trump describes the president's father — her grandfather — as a high-functioning sociopath and blames him for instilling in his children the value of aggression and the notion that kindness is weakness.

She suggests the most damaged of the siblings is Donald Trump, who, she said, has a variety of psychological impairments: definitely narcissism, for which she says he meets all nine criteria, but probably other conditions. She lists as possibilities antisocial personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, a learning disorder and sleep disorder.

The president of the United States, in her opinion, struggles to control his impulses; tell the truth; learn new facts; apologize for mistakes; and lives in constant terror of having people perceive his flaws.

She said she was traumatized by his 2016 election win and feared that her uncle was uniquely ill-qualified to govern in a crisis.

""It felt as though 62,979,636 voters had chosen to turn this country into a macro version of my malignantly dysfunctional family,"" writes Mary Trump, whose immediate family has feuded bitterly with the rest of the Trumps ever since it was sidelined from the grandparents' wills.

""Donald's pathologies are so complex and his behaviours so often inexplicable that coming up with an accurate and comprehensive diagnosis would require a full battery of psychological and neuropsychological tests that he'll never sit for.""

She wrote that she hoped her book would put to rest the idea that Trump deploys strategies or has a tangible agenda — when his only aim is to protect his own fragile ego and have others see him as strong and smart.

The White House press secretary has called her work ""a book of falsehoods."" The Trump family lawyer has sued to try blocking its distribution, alleging violation of a nondisclosure agreement.

But on the broader issue of global public interest, the mental state of the U.S. president, what do Mary Trump's colleagues say?

CBC News reached out to about two dozen psychologists at U.S. universities who study pathologies and asked two questions:

Is it ethically permissible to write what Mary Trump wrote?

Do they agree with what she's written about the president, based on excerpts they've seen from media reports on the book?

There's a formal taboo in psychiatry against opining publicly on public figures, named after Barry Goldwater, a presidential candidate who successfully sued a magazine that ran a series of psychiatrist opinions on him.

Psychology does not have the same so-called Goldwater rule but does have professional standards discouraging public speculation about people's mental health.

Nearly all the experts contacted by CBC News declined to comment, several citing various reasons: ethical considerations, fear of professional consequences and fear of harassment from Trump supporters.

""All of the above,"" said one clinical psychologist, who requested not to be named, when asked why people wouldn't comment on the record.

She said people in her profession could face expensive lawsuits, or lose career opportunities with public organizations if they're perceived to have a political bias, which she said would be ""career suicide"" for some. She also mentioned ""intimidation.""

""I wouldn't want someone coming to my house and saying, 'How dare you say this?'"" she said.

She did agree to speak without being named. Several others responded to a request for comment by offering the names of two colleagues quoted here, who have previously spoken publicly.

Here are their answers, which have been edited for clarity.

Is it ethically permissible to write what Mary Trump wrote?

Josh Miller, a clinical psychologist and director of clinical training at the University of Georgia, defended the author: ""Does the Goldwater rule apply to psychologists, and does it make a great deal of sense in the modern day?... I think we sometimes privilege the idea that you can only make a diagnosis if you're treating a patient. But psychiatrists make diagnoses after one 50-minute session, or three, or four, all the time. We surely all have much more information on Donald Trump at this point in time than a mental-health professional would after somewhere between 50 and 200 minutes. Then, a family member … I think clearly has much more information than a mental-health professional ever would. The ethics? I don't know — I personally fall into the category that there is a duty to warn about potentially the most important person in the world and whether they have a pattern of personality traits that portend quite poorly.""

So did Donald Lynam, a distinguished professor of clinical psychology at Purdue University: ""I don't have a real problem with a trained professional who has access to lots of behavioural data on a person making an assessment like this.… I personally think that there is more than enough longitudinal life-history data available on many persons in the public eye that would enable professionals to make such assessments. I think Trump is no exception. He has always been a very public figure. Many books and stories have been written about his behaviour.""

The book says Trump, right, was eager to please his father, seen here on the left with boxing promoter Don King in 1987, and to gain the parental approval that eluded his older brother. (The Associated Press)

Another clinical psychologist who works in the Washington, D.C., area, and asked not to be named, offered a more nuanced view: ""The only ethical concern I can see is when someone puts their clinical hat on to diagnose, treat or make clinical recommendations based on a personal story … not rooted in data. That's where, in my view, we run across some ethical grey zones. When we combine someone who has a title, and knowledge about a particular field, and offers an opinion, we can easily interpret that this is their professional opinion as opposed to a personal opinion. That can become very blurry.… One of the reasons psychology is a science-based field is we root our conclusions in data, in scientific principles. … [Otherwise] it becomes a question of opinion and that's where biases can come from.… If a patient comes into my office and I really don't [like] them … I still have to give them a fair and objective treatment, or I have to identify that I'm too biased to be able to evaluate them and refer out.… That's why we use questionnaires, and ink-blot cards we give people sometimes ... [to] test a hypothesis. ...There is also a very high risk of bias when there's a particular family member who is not someone's favourite.""

Do you agree with what she's written about the president?

Miller: ""[On narcissism] I agree entirely. 'Prototypical' doesn't describe the degree to which [Trump] meets the criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Many of us who study it say that if we [described a character like his in a paper] other peer reviewers would say, 'You've made up too cartoonish of a case.' They wouldn't believe it would be possible. That's how incredibly well he fits those symptoms. I've viewed Donald Trump as an example of narcissism going back 15 years. Long before he was running for president, long before he was associated with the Republican Party. Literally, going back into the mid-2000s … at academic talks he was one of the pictures I would put up. This is hardly new.… Narcissism is associated with aggression, in general, and specifically under an ego-threat. When someone has criticized you, we're going to see lashing out.… An inability to accept blame — it's always someone else's fault.… To not admit one's mistakes ...that inability to admit that one has ever been wrong is a really huge problem…. I agree that we should not be distracted by his narcissism from his psychopathy…. Search for the criteria for psychopathy. Look at traits and behaviours in the psychopathy checklist written by Hare . Grapple with how many would he not fit there. And psychopathy is associated much more strongly than narcissism with behaviours that are particularly scary.… It's the callousness, irresponsibility, impulse-control problems, lack of remorse or shame.""

Lynam: ""I agree that Trump meets most, if not all, of the criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder .... He certainly meets more than enough to deserve the diagnosis. I am not sure that I would say he has other pathologies, but I would say that he appears to have some additional traits outside of the ones included in NPD that make him more 'disturbed.' I think he is reckless, impulsive, unreliable and dishonest. There are some stories that suggest a tendency towards antisocial behaviour.... I am hesitant to say this, but I think the other diagnosis that should be considered is psychopathy... I have seen some commentators refer to a similar construct to psychopathy with the term 'malignant narcissism.' The only part with which I might disagree with Mary Trump (based on reported details of the book) is that I am not sure it is possible to pinpoint causes for these traits. It could be due to his father's treatment of him. It could be due to the genes he shares with his father. It could be due to a host of factors. I would not speculate on that.""",[]

McCloskey and his wife, Patricia, are both personal injury lawyers and have said they were frightened for their lives when demonstrators protesting against police violence marched by their mansion on their way to the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson.

Videos show the couple, who are white, shouting at Black and white protesters to keep off their property over several minutes while some in the crowd record the scene on their cellphones, or shout out that the protesters have no interest in causing the couple harm. Patricia McCloskey pointed a handgun at the crowd.

The McCloskeys, a lawyer representing them and the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.

Soon after the incident, Kimberly Gardner, the city's chief prosecutor, said she was alarmed by the videos and that her office was investigating a possible infringement of people's right to peacefully protest, saying in a statement that ""intimidation or threat of deadly force will not be tolerated.""

The couple have said they were within their rights to defend their property.

Last year, the federal government passed new environmental assessment legislation, the Impact Assessment Act, which requires Indigenous knowledge to be used alongside scientific information in any decisions about the environment, including natural resource projects.

In a guidance document , the government states that ""including Indigenous knowledge in assessment processes needs to be based on a foundation of respect for the worldview of Indigenous peoples.""

Listen to What on Earth on CBC Radio 1 every Sunday at 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m. in Newfoundland

However, those who have studied these processes say that when companies come calling in the hopes of mining or transporting natural resources on Indigenous lands, consultation becomes more about ticking boxes than actually listening to Indigenous teachings.

Janelle Baker, an assistant professor of anthropology at Alberta's Athabasca University who worked for years as a consultant on the use of traditional lands, said the process is often geared to ""identify-specific locations where things happen ... so that a site can be identified, avoided or mitigated, and they want to move on.""

In contrast, she said, ""you go to a[n Indigenous] community member, and they see things more holistically"" and are concerned with cascading and cumulative effects of development on their way of life.

Baker, whose mother and grandmother are Métis, called the consultation process itself ""extractive.""

When a company comes to hear the perspective of an Indigenous knowledge keeper, ""that person shares personal information, teachings — that's a gift that someone is giving these people,"" she said.

""To me, that knowledge has been extracted to prove [that an Indigenous person has] been consulted, without actually considering what that person has taught or shared.""

A different relationship with nature

Last week, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a First Nations challenge against the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, which would twin an existing 1,150-kilometre pipeline going from Edmonton to coastal B.C.

A group comprising the Squamish Nation, Tsleil-Waututh Nation and Coldwater Indian Band had challenged the federal government's second approval of the pipeline, citing inadequate Indigenous consultation.

Part of the problem is the process is imposed on Indigenous people and leaves no room for their language, ceremonies or understanding of relations to the land, said Nick Claxton, elected chief of Tsawout First Nation on Vancouver Island, who testified on behalf of his community at the National Energy Board's Trans Mountain pipeline hearings.

Claxton, who is also an assistant professor at the University of Victoria, is a co-author of a paper published earlier this year on the hurdles to properly expanding the role of Indigenous knowledge in environmental assessments.

He said one insight that shaped his appreciation of the natural world was learning from his uncle how his people's language, Sencoten, refers to salmon.

""In our language, they have two names — a common name and a prayer name. Those prayer names are very sacred. When you understand that language, you are actually referring to the salmon as relatives with human spirits,"" Claxton said.

""That was a key understanding for me to come to, in terms of how to relate to our homeland and territories.... It's a different way of understanding the world.

""If you take that lens, you would have a different perspective on environmental assessment processes.""

'A colonial way of thinking'

Baker, of Athabasca University, said one of the things that complicates assessments of resource projects is a historical skepticism of Indigenous knowledge.

""It's a colonial way of thinking that Western science is right and the only way to know things,"" she said.

To demonstrate how Western science can come up short in understanding the natural environment, Baker cited work she did a few years ago studying traditional knowledge about berry cultivation in Fort McKay, Alta.

Elders had told Baker's working group that the cranberries were better near Moose Lake, a ""really sacred, clean area that they really respect."" But that puzzled scientists because berries thrive on water, and rain gauges set up there had registered less precipitation than in other areas.

Janelle Baker is an assistant professor and anthropologist at Athabasca University. (Submitted by Janelle Baker)

""It was kind of this mystery,"" Baker said, until an elder pointed out that the reason the berries were responding so well is due to a mist that comes off the lake. Scientists put up humidity monitors in the area and confirmed the elder was right.

""If we relax and just open our minds a bit, I think there are a lot of times where that [scientific] knowledge can come together ― if we can really hear one another,"" Baker said.

Indigenous solutions

There are other signs of mutual understanding when it comes to balancing nature and economic activity.

Steven Nitah, a former elected chief of Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation in the Northwest Territories, helped create an Indigenous guardians program, in which Dene members monitor and manage ""high-biodiversity areas.""

He said that because Dene know the land ""intimately and intricately,"" they're able to provide guidance on how to minimize environmental harm.

In 2010, Canada and the Lutsel K’e Dene First Nation committed to negotiate a park agreement for the establishment of Thaidene Nëné or 'Land of the Ancestors' National Park Reserve at the eastern end of Great Slave Lake. (Parks Canada)

The group monitors things like caribou migrations and the downstream effects of diamond mining, and Nitah said that he has already seen progress in being able to continue economic activity while safeguarding nature.

""For example, during caribou migration, the guardians are out here informing the mines that the migration is in effect, and the mines ... shut down traffic during that time,"" he said.

Last month, Nitah and the Lutsel K'e Dene First Nation won a United Nations award for the establishment of Thaidene Nëné or ""Land of the Ancestors"" National Park Reserve. The Indigenous Protected Area, near Great Slave Lake, spans 26,376 square kilometres of boreal forest and tundra with lakes, rivers and waterfalls.

The Equator Prize, which is handed out every couple of years, celebrates ""Indigenous peoples and local community solutions to conservation and sustainable development.""

Nitah said that as the world faces the increasing threat of climate change, initiatives like the guardian program can be of benefit to all.

""The world only has 25 per cent of its biodiversity left, and Indigenous people influence or control 82 per cent of that, so that tells me that the Indigenous worldview and its relationship with nature is a solution that all populations of the world can look towards.""

It began last weekend with developers of the $8 billion Atlantic Coast gas pipeline terminating the project amid cost, permitting and litigation uncertainties.

It continued Monday with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that left in place a lower court ruling that blocked a key environmental permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline — a decision the company said will continue to delay large portions of construction on the 1,947-kilometre project.

Calgary-based TC Energy vows to continue building the Canadian leg of the project while fighting the legal battle south of the border.

The news out of the U.S. courts didn't shake Kenney's public confidence in the project as he continued to tout the benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline.

""It immediately creates thousands of jobs,"" he said during a news conference on Wednesday.

""But after the oil starts flowing, it'll generate tens of billions of dollars that will benefit Albertans and generate government revenues for decades to come.""

Also this week, a U.S. judge ordered the Dakota Access pipeline to shut down and empty its oil in 30 days. According to the ruling, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental Policy Act because it failed to produce an adequate Environmental Impact Statement for a segment of the project. The pipeline has been in operation since 2017.

In recent days, the state of Michigan also launched a website to keep the public abreast of its ongoing battle with Enbridge over the Line 5 pipeline.

The company shut down both legs of the pipeline last month after noticing a disturbance to an underwater anchor support in the Straits of Mackinac. The state wants to keep Line 5 closed indefinitely. A judge has allowed the west leg to reopen, but the other leg remains closed until more testing is finished.

Attention on climate change, oil spills

Developing large pipeline projects has become increasingly difficult in the last decade, especially with greater attention on climate change and spill concerns. And while building a new mine or power plant may impact a few nearby communities, pipelines can pass by hundreds of communities along a route.

The past week adds even more wrinkles to an already uncertain outlook for major pipeline development in North America.

Building an oil or natural gas pipeline will ultimately become more difficult in the wake of recent developments, said Stephanie Kainz, a senior associate with RS Energy Group in Calgary.

Although she'd never seen an order like the one telling the operator of the Dakota Access pipeline to stop flowing oil, Kainz said in her opinion, the biggest news was Keystone XL, which continues to be blocked from using a streamlined permitting process, called Nationwide Permit 12.

""The Supreme Court telling Keystone XL they can't use Nationwide Permit 12 for their water crossings ... really means that Keystone XL literally has to go the long way around the permitting process to cross every single water crossing,"" Kainz said.

A spokesperson for TC Energy said Thursday that the company will seek authorization for the necessary permits and approvals to convene U.S. mainline pipeline construction in 2021 and maintain its 2023 in-service date.

The Keystone XL pipeline would provide a valuable outlet for Alberta crude to the world market, giving it direct access to the U.S. Midwest and down to the Gulf Coast, Kainz said. Building it should mean producers can fetch a better price for its crude and more royalties for Alberta.

But further delays mean the project could face big political headwinds, she said.

""I want to be very optimistic on it, but I think it definitely lowers the chances of it actually being completed, especially going into an election this fall,"" she said. ""Right now you're banking on a Trump re-election in the midst of a pandemic.""

Biden opposed to Keystone XL

U.S. President Donald Trump has been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL project, but his opponent, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has said he would tear up Trump's approval of the pipeline if he wins the White House.

Kenney said he believes Biden can be persuaded to back the project, but the former vice-president has been unequivocal in his criticism of the pipeline, calling it ""tarsands that we don't need .""

James Coleman, an associate professor of energy law at Southern Methodist University in Texas, said pipeline developers will, on balance, view the past week positively because the U.S. Supreme Court did not stop other projects from using the nationwide permit.

For proponents of Keystone XL, he said, it's also a ""serious positive"" that the court appears interested enough to look at the matter when it takes so few cases.

Still, he said he believes the odds of getting this pipeline built remain less than 50 per cent because of Biden's chances of winning in November.

""It's not going to be in service by the time he would be elected [this fall]. So, any individual [court] decision is playing on the margins of that basically bigger overall question, which is about the election.""

Coleman said the last week of news demonstrates for people outside of the energy industry just how difficult a business it is to build pipelines these days. It perhaps also underscores why government investment may be necessary to get such projects done.

""One thing you're seeing is if you want to build energy transport infrastructure — doesn't matter if it's a power line or oil pipeline or natural gas pipeline — it is getting riskier,"" Coleman said.

""One way to have even a chance of getting to build is to have government investment because that government investment provides patience that wouldn't otherwise exist. And thus far, in the United States, we haven't felt the need to invest in oil pipelines. I'm not sure that that's far off.""

The question Kenney will ultimately have to answer is whether his big bet on Keystone XL was worth the gamble. It's a bet that comes with considerable hurdles and uncertainty, with the cost for some also measured against climate change and the future of energy.

And even if the legal and regulatory hurdles are overcome, the outcome of a hotly contested election in a foreign country could decide the fate of the project — and with it, Alberta's investment.",[]

The case of Stephen Cameron, a pilot for national carrier Vietnam Airlines, became a sensation in Vietnam, where a combination of targeted testing and an aggressive quarantine program has kept its coronavirus tally to an impressively low 370 cases, and zero deaths.

""The odds say that I shouldn't be here, so I can only thank everybody here for what they've done,"" Cameron said, leaving hospital in a wheelchair and flanked by doctors holding flowers.

The 43-year-old Scot, who arrived in the Southeast Asian country from Britain in early March, was hospitalized three days after his first flight for Vietnam Airlines, following a visit to a bar in Ho Chi Minh City that became linked to a cluster of coronavirus cases.

Cameron's illness and the highly publicized efforts of Vietnam's doctors to save him became a symbol in Vietnam of the country's successful fight against the virus.

Lung capacity was at just 10%

At one point, medical officials said Cameron, initially identified only as ""Patient 91,"" had just 10 per cent of his lung capacity and was in critical condition.

By early April, Cameron was on a ventilator and life-support machine at Ho Chi Minh City's Hospital of Tropical Diseases. In May, medical officials were saying that he urgently needed a lung transplant.

With the vast majority of Vietnam's COVID-19 patients already recovered, the news of a potential first death prompted a national outpouring of support, with dozens of people coming forward as potential lung donors.

State doctors turned the volunteers down, saying donated lungs should come from brain-dead donors.

But under round-the clock care, Cameron improved. By June, he no longer required a lung transplant and was taken off life-support.

Vietnam spent more than $200,000 US treating him. Vietnamese doctors will accompany Cameron on the special flight back to Britain, state media said.

""As soon as I get fit, I'm coming back,"" said Cameron. ""I'm still a pilot — my licence has lapsed, that's all.""",[]
34,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-candidates-we-scandal-1.5646350,How Conservative leadership hopefuls would address the WE scandal if they win,"['Stephanie Levitz', 'The Canadian Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Conservative MPs said Friday their party doesn't want to bring down the government over the latest ethics scandal ensnaring Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Andrew Scheer, the party's current leader, is in his final weeks in the job.

Conservative Party members are now voting for his replacement, with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to WE Charity, given Trudeau's long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau's ties as well — one of the minister's daughters works for WE Charity.

Both the Liberal government and WE have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization's connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives say revelations that Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud. Trudeau himself was never paid.

WATCH | Opposition calls for criminal investigation:

The opposition calls for the RCMP to investigate the granting of a large federal contract to the WE Charity, after Justin Trudeau's mother and brother had been paid by the group for public appearances. And, it's revealed the finance minister also has family links to the group. 3:00

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012, and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

Given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss as the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer's replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis: Canadians should vote Trudeau out

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau's scandals, and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

""The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,"" Lewis said in a statement.

""The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.""

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins the leadership, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay: Strengthen power of ethics commissioner

MacKay's wife, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, a human rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign said she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there's a finding a politician broke conflict-of-interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister's private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which covers breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

Being in the cabinet room when the decision was made and knowing their family connection to WE is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

""It's essential we keep confidence in public office holders,"" he said. ""This undermines that.""

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it's not that simple, MacKay said.

""We can't lose sight of the bigger picture here, which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,"" he said.

""This is going to undermine severely the prime minister's legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.""

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O'Toole: Police should investigate

O'Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O'Toole supports his party's call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said given that O'Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from ""day one.""

""As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,"" she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O'Toole's children have also attended WE events, and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

The final candidate, Derek Sloan — who is also a sitting MP — did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.",[]

A statement said police and military who responded to reports of a shooting at the International Pentecostal Holiness Church headquarters in Zuurbekom found four people ""shot and burned to death in a car"" and a security guard shot in another car. Six other people were injured.

Police said they rescued men, women and children who had been held hostage and appeared to have been living at the church. It was not clear how many were rescued.

The attack by a group of armed people ""may have been motivated by a feud"" between church members, the police statement said.

The church is one of the largest — and reportedly richest — in South Africa.

Halton Region police say they responded to reports of a shooting at about 1:10 p.m. at 484 Plains Rd. E., the site of a small business plaza. The shooting took place in front of Pro Patio Furniture.

When police arrived, they said in a news release, they found ""two victims with gunshot wounds.""

""One victim in this shooting has succumbed to their injuries,"" police said in a tweet Friday afternoon. ""A second victim has been transported to hospital. Suspect(s) remain outstanding at this time.""

Police have since confirmed the victim who died is 52-year-old Musitano.

Const. Steve Elms of the Halton Regional Police Service, west of Toronto, told CBC News that the suspect reportedly fled westbound on Plains Road East in a grey sedan.

The licence plate of one of the vehicles at the scene, a black GMC Denali, matches the plate of a black GMC Denali found outside the office of a lawyer near where Musitano was shot in 2019.

Police say people in the area should expect a ""heavy police presence throughout the afternoon and into the evening,"" but they don't believe there is an active threat to public safety. Roughly a dozen police vehicles lined the street and parking lot near the shooting. Dozens more officers were on the scene.

Plains Road East is closed in both directions between King Road and Waterdown Road.

Ahmed Shaarwar works at the Shoppers Drug Mart across the street from the shooting. He said he didn't see the shooting take place, but it is still a shock.

""I'm surprised. Usually we don't see such stark things,"" Shaarwar told CBC News.

""I'm scared, of course, especially for my kids as well. Any innocent bystander can get wounded.""

He said the fact that an infamous Mob boss was killed makes it ""even stranger.""

Musitano's brother, Angelo, was shot to death in front of his Waterdown, Ont., home in May 2017.

Weeks later, Pat Musitano's home on St. Clair Boulevard in Hamilton was also shot up.

The Musitano family is linked to convictions for bombings and extortion in the 1970s, as well as the hit on mobster Domenic Racco in the 1980s, and the murders of Johnny ""Pops"" Papalia and one of his lieutenants, Carmen Barillaro, in 1997.

The Musitano brothers reached a deal and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in the death of Barillaro. In turn, the charges against them in connection with Papalia's death were dropped. They were sentenced to 10 years in prison but were released in 2007, and had made little noise since then — until bullets started flying once more.

The Musitanos were once protected by an alliance with the famed Rizzuto crime family, based out of Montreal.

About a year ago, Nagpal joined Shaadi.com, a website that asks users to choose potential matches based on family background, status and body type. She said there was also a filter asking users for their preference of skin colour.

""I felt really uncomfortable,"" said the University of Toronto graduate student, who is originally from Vancouver.

Nagpal soon deleted her account, but returned to the site last month after feeling some pressure from her mother to get married. She was again confronted with the skin-tone filter, which allowed users to select from ""fair,"" ""wheatish"" or ""dark.""

Discrimination within communities of colour

To Nagpal, the need to do something felt urgent because even though many prominent people in the South Asian community have come out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, there are still some, including Bollywood actors, who continue to promote creams that promise to lighten skin tone.

Nagpal emailed the website, which is owned by a company based in Mumbai, India, hoping to get the skin-tone filter removed.

She received a one-sentence response saying the filter was a popular feature with parents looking to arrange marriages for their children.

""Most parents do require this as an option so it is visible on the site,"" read the response sent on June 10.

Nagpal then posted the response to a Facebook group with more than 2,000 South Asian women in North America.

Group members Hetal Lakhani and Roshni Patel got involved, creating an online petition to remove the filter.

They argued that it perpetuates a form of racial discrimination known as shadeism or colourism that's prevalent in the South Asian community — with light skin being historically viewed as more desirable than dark.

Overnight, the petition had amassed more than 1,400 signatures and Nagpal said the skin-tone filter was no longer on the site.

In an email, a spokesperson for Shaadi.com told CBC Toronto that they were not aware of the skin-tone filter and claimed it was a ""non-functional aspect"" of the site.

""There is no skin colour filter on Shaadi.com, on any of its platforms,"" the spokesperson said.

A petition for shaadi.com to remove its skin-tone filter amassed more than 1,400 signatures overnight. Soon after, Nagpal said the skin-tone filter was no longer on the site. (Shaadi.com)

""We do not discriminate based on skin colour and our member base is as diverse and pluralistic as the world today is.""

Two other prominent South Asian matrimonial sites — Bharat Matrimony and Jeevansathi.com — were also pressured to remove skin-tone filters.

CBC News contacted both websites for comment on this story, but received no response.

'Colourism is very easy to fester in communities'

Thurka Gunaratnam, a filmmaker and educator based in Toronto who has focused on shadeism in her work, says the filter did not come as a shock to her.

""When a group has been historically oppressed and they have not been given the freedom to understand what their own identity is, something like colourism is very easy to fester in communities,"" said Gunaratnam.

""It's so embedded in us from such a young age, it just makes me really sad,"" Yogarajah told CBC News.

She said women who are targeted by ad campaigns for the creams are ""deeply impacted"" by beauty standards, but that it ""ultimately comes down to their value as a person.""

The call comes a day after CBC News and Canadaland reported that, despite initial claims, WE had financial dealings with some of Trudeau's family members, most notably his mother Margaret and brother Alexandre.

WE and its affiliates paid out some $300,000 in speaking fees to the two through the Speakers' Spotlight Bureau over the last four years.

CTV News also reported that the prime minister's wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, received $1,500 for participating in a WE event in 2012, before Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party. She currently hosts a podcast for the charity.

The prime minister isn't the only member of cabinet with personal ties to WE. CBC News reported Friday that Finance Minister Bill Morneau's daughter also works for the charity, as a paid employee of the charity's travel department since 2019.

Neither Trudeau nor Morneau recused themselves from cabinet's discussion on the student grants program.

Federal Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion announced last Friday that he was investigating Trudeau over the choice of WE to run the grants program.

But Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said a probe by the ethics commissioner alone is insufficient, given the new revelations about payments to Trudeau family members before Ottawa awarded WE the contract to administer the the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG).

""It's not just a conflict of interest. It's much more serious than that. We have a prime minister that has used his powers to get a benefit out of an organization related to himself and his family,"" he said in French.

Poilievre cited Section 121 of the Criminal Code as a potential avenue for the police.

That section, titled ""frauds on the government,"" says it's an offence for someone to give an elected official or any member of their family ""a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for co-operation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in connection with the transaction of business with or any matter of business relating to the government.""

""We're asking the relevant authorities if this could apply,"" Poilievre said.

In a letter to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, Conservative ethics critic Michael Barrett said his party is also concerned about the seven other federal grants and contributions — valued at more than $5 million — that WE has received from Ottawa since 2017.

""I encourage the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to investigate the possibility of criminal offences arising from these disturbing facts. You and the very able members of the national police force possess the necessary skills, expertise and tools to get to the bottom of this,"" Barrett said in the letter.

The initial decision to outsource the student grants program to a third party with ties to the prime minister's family was criticized by some in the charitable sector and by the opposition Conservatives.

WE decided to pull out of the contract last week, citing the ""controversy"" over the partnership. WE agreed to give up the $19.5 million it was to be paid to administer the program.

Trudeau had defended the partnership, saying WE was the only group with a nationwide network capable of operating a program of this sort for young people. Other charitable organizations have questioned that assertion.

Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said today the prime minister wasn't the one who picked WE to dole out the grants to students.

He said that the recommendation came from bureaucrats working at Employment and Social Development Canada. They selected WE because of its extensive partnerships with other youth organizations, he told reporters.

""Make no mistake — the directions that we take are really based on the non-partisan advice that we get from our public service,"" he said. ""They made a clear recommendation and we followed that recommendation.""

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the government needs to produce the records that show public servants were behind the original recommendation to work with WE on this program.

He said Liberal parliamentarians should be just as curious as opposition MPs about the prime minister's handling of this file.

""It's getting to the point where I'd challenge other Liberal MPs and Liberal cabinet ministers — Did they know that the prime minister was in this position?"" Scheer said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics. ""When cabinet was signing off on this decision, was Mr. Trudeau open and forthright with his colleagues? Did he inform them what he was asking them to agree to?

""How closely do they want to be associated with Justin Trudeau's ethical behaviour here? We really do need to get to the bottom of this.""

Federal Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains spoke with reporters during an event at GM's Oshawa facilities on Friday. 1:39

Barrett said it's ""essential"" that the police probe the government's decision to hand such a valuable contract to a ""Trudeau and Liberal-friendly firm.""

""Canadians deserve to have a prime minister and a cabinet and a Parliament that they have confidence in,"" he said. ""It is clear that confidence has been shaken yet again.""

In an interview with Power and Politics, Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez insisted that federal bureaucrats were the ones who picked WE — and that it wasn't the only charitable organization the government worked with to roll out pandemic aid. The government also has worked with the United Way and Food Banks Canada, he said.

He said the government is ready to move on with the grants program without WE.

""You have to understand that we're in a COVID environment where we made decisions day-by-day — sometimes faster than we wanted,"" Rodriquez said today. ""Sometimes the programs weren't perfect.""

He also promised that ""all documents that can be shared will be shared.""",[]
39,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-roger-stone-sentence-commute-1.5646065,Trump commutes ally Roger Stone's sentence related to Russia probe,"['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime political confidant Roger Stone on Friday, just days before he was set to report to prison. The move, short of a full pardon, is sure to alarm critics who have long railed against the president's repeated interventions in the nation's justice system.

Stone had been sentenced in February to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. He was set to report to prison by Tuesday.

Stone told The Associated Press that Trump had called him earlier Friday to inform him of the commutation. Stone was celebrating in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with conservative friends and said he had to change rooms because there were ""too many people opening bottles of Champagne here.""

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany called Stone a ""victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media.""

""Not only was Mr. Stone charged by overzealous prosecutors pursuing a case that never should have existed, and arrested in an operation that never should have been approved, but there were also serious questions about the jury in the case,"" she said in a statement.

WATCH | Trump says Stone treated 'viciously':

U.S. President Donald Trump won't say if he is considering a pardon for his former adviser, Roger Stone — who was found guilty of witness tampering, obstruction and lying to Congress — but slams the justice system for its pursuit of the case. 1:03

A commutation does not erase Stone's felony convictions in the same way a pardon would, but it would protect him from serving prison time as a result.

The action, which Trump had foreshadowed in recent days, reflects his lingering rage over the Russia investigation and is a testament to his conviction that he and his associates were mistreated by agents and prosecutors. His administration has been eager to rewrite the narrative of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, with Trump's own Justice Department moving in May to dismiss the criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Stone, for his part, had been open about his desire for a pardon or commutation, appealing for the president's help in a series of Instagram posts in which he maintained that his life could be in jeopardy if imprisoned during a pandemic. He had recently sought to postpone his surrender date by months after getting a brief extension from the judge.

Trump had repeatedly publicly inserted himself into Stone's case, including just before Stone's sentencing, when he suggested in a tweet that Stone was being subjected to a different standard than several prominent Democrats. He railed that the conviction ""should be thrown out"" and called the Justice Department's initial sentencing recommendation ""horrible and very unfair.""

""Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!"" he wrote.

Trump's longtime friend and adviser

Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster, was the sixth Trump aide or adviser to have been convicted of charges brought as part of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

A longtime Trump friend and informal adviser, Stone had boasted during the campaign that he was in contact with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through a trusted intermediary and hinted at inside knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to release more than 19,000 emails hacked from the servers of the Democratic National Committee.

WATCH | Who is Roger Stone?

U.S. political consultant Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, was arrested Friday as part of the FBI's investigation. Stone now faces charges of lying to investigators, obstructing justice and witness tampering. 4:07

But Stone denied any wrongdoing and consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated. He did not take the stand during his trial, did not speak at his sentencing, and his lawyers did not call any witnesses in his defence.

Trump also targeted those involved in the case. He retweeted a comment by Fox News commentator Andrew Napolitano that the jury appeared to have been biased against Trump, and called out Judge Amy Berman Jackson by name, saying ""almost any judge in the country"" would throw out the conviction.

The tweets continued even after Trump earned a public rebuke from his own attorney general, William Barr, who said the president's comments were ""making it impossible"" for him to do his job. Barr was so incensed that he told people he was considering resigning over the matter.

Case sparked turmoil in Justice Department

Prosecutors had originally recommended Stone serve seven to nine years in federal prison. But, in a highly unusual move, Barr reversed that decision after a Trump tweet and recommended a more lenient punishment, prompting a mini-revolt inside the Justice Department, with the entire prosecution team resigning from the case.

Department officials have vehemently denied Barr was responding to Trump's criticism and have insisted there was no contact with the White House over the decision. Barr has also pointed out that the judge, in imposing a 40-month sentence, had agreed with him that the original sentencing recommendation was excessive.

Barr, who was attorney general during Stone's trial last fall, has said the prosecution was justified, and the Justice Department did not support Stone's more recent effort to put off his surrender date. Though the Justice Department raised concerns about the handling of Flynn's case, including what it said were irregularities about his FBI interview, prosecutors did not point to any similar issues or problems with the Stone prosecution.

Even so, the pardon will almost certainly contribute to the portrait of a president determined — particularly in an election year — to undo the effects of a Russia investigation that has shadowed his administration from the outset, and to intervene on behalf of political allies.

Trump, meanwhile, had long kept the door open to a reprieve.

""You're going to see what happens. Let's see what happens,"" he said when asked in February whether Stone deserved prison time, adding, ""Somebody has to stick up for the people.""

He told Sean Hannity in an interview Thursday night that it was a ""disgrace they didn't give him a retrial."" Asked if he was considering a pardon, he added: ""I am always thinking.""

That language prompted preemptive rebuke from House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, who tweeted after the sentencing that ""to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a breathtaking act of corruption.""

Clemency spree

The commutation was the latest example of Trump using his unlimited clemency power to pardon powerful men he believes have been mistreated by the justice system.

Trump went on a clemency spree in February commuting the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, and pardoning former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, financier Michael Milken and several others.

Trump has also offered clemency to other political allies, including Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was awaiting sentencing at the time, conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who had been convicted on campaign finance violations, and Conrad Black, a newspaper publisher convicted of fraud who had written a flattering book about the president.

Trump, however, has spent much more time trumpeting his decision to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving life in prison for nonviolent drug offences and who came to Trump's attention after reality star Kim Kardashian West took up her cause.

Interior Health says eight people who have tested positive for the coronavirus attended private gatherings in the area and visited local bars and restaurants between June 25 and July 6.

Events that took place on Canada Day and over the holiday weekend are of particular concern, according to a news release.

""We believe that these individuals acquired the disease elsewhere,"" Interior Health's Dr. Silvina Mema told CBC News.

Six of the people who tested positive live outside of the region — mainly in B.C.'s Lower Mainland and Alberta, according to Mema.

""These are individuals who came here to spend time with friends, so there are a number of different restaurants and pubs, the waterfront area that they have been at,"" she said.

Contact tracing is underway, and anyone who may have been exposed will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Anyone else who participated in events in the downtown area during the dates in question should monitor themselves for symptoms. Testing is available to anyone who has symptoms of the disease, but it is not recommended for anyone who doesn't have symptoms because of a risk of false negatives.

Mema said this large-scale potential exposure should serve as a reminder that everyone still needs to be very careful about preventing transmission, even though B.C. is in its third phase of reopening.

""I think it's fair to assume that there could be a positive case anywhere, and the message that I would like to convey … is that we don't have to let our guard down. The virus is everywhere,"" she said.

The league and its players' union formally signed an agreement Friday that would see hockey return — with hub cities in Toronto and Edmonton.

The agreement includes the potential to return to the Olympics in 2022 and 2026 and a four-year extension of the collective bargaining agreement.

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

WATCH | Outlining NHL's return plan:

CBC News' Raffy Boudjikanian outlines the NHL's return-to-play plan, including the decision to use Edmonton and Toronto as the two ""hub cities."" 2:31

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current agreement, which was scheduled to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also gives the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight Winter Games between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at $81.5 million US in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back to the fans.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the agreement will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time since Bettman was hired in 1993 that the NHL has bridged two collective agreements without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was completely wiped out.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

""It's the obvious choice to bring the NHL to Edmonton,"" Kenney said on Twitter last month.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team's travelling party will be capped at 52, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said the NHL choosing to hold all games in Canada reduces the risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the hub running, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's protocols with regard to health and safety.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me [players are] getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day. Maybe every third day or whatever.

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-four clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia will compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending Cup champion St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include No. 5 Pittsburgh vs. No. 12 Montreal, No. 6 Carolina vs. No. 11 New York Rangers, No. 7 New York Islanders vs. No. 10 Florida and No. 8 Toronto vs. No. 9 Columbus. In the West, the matchups are No. 5 Edmonton vs. No. 12 Chicago, No. 6 Nashville vs. No. 11 Arizona, No. 7 Vancouver vs. No. 10 Minnesota and No. 8 Calgary vs. No. 9 Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five matchups in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket. The league says Oct. 4 is the last possible date for the Stanley Cup final.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

Not only that, said Commissioner Brenda Lucki and Brian Sauvé of the National Police Federation, but it damages an ""important national dialogue with all stakeholders seeking solutions to societal issues.""

The Mounties have said the suspect was armed and threatening Prime Minister Justin Trudeau but was arrested peacefully after Mounties talked him down for more than an hour and a half on the morning of July 2.

They say the reservist on active duty with the Canadian Forces rammed a gate with a truck to enter the grounds.

Corey Hurren, who is from Manitoba, faces 22 charges, nearly all of them weapons offences related to the guns allegedly in his possession.

Singh called incident a reminder of systemic racism

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is the most prominent person who has suggested the incident would have had a worse ending if Hurren weren't white.

The incident at Rideau Hall followed weeks of stories about police officers treating people of colour, especially Indigenous people, harshly, to the point of killing them.

That included Rodney Levi, an Indigenous man shot by the RCMP in New Brunswick during a visit to check on his welfare in June.

On Wednesday, Singh said the contrast ""reminds us all of how systemic racism is real.""

Asked whether he believed the Rideau Hall incident would gone worse if the suspect hadn't been white, Singh simply replied: ""Yes.""

Lucki and Sauvé said in their statement that the RCMP resolve the vast majority of crises without violence because of their commitment to using as little force as possible.

""To suggest a more violent conclusion would have been inevitable if the suspect was of another race is speculative and disheartening to the arresting officers, their families, and all partners who helped successfully and professionally resolve this threat,"" they said.

They've done everything from live performances to hosting to writing for and, of course, starring in 22 Minutes — where they've done sketches and interviewed politicians, musicians and many prominents personalities.

But how different is it working on 22 Minutes versus performing standup, live on-stage? Here's what they had to say.

""They're kind of two different machines,"" says Trent McClellan.

""For 22 Minutes, we tape the show on a Monday night, Tuesday we start writing again, Wednesday we read what we wrote, Thursday and Friday we're shooting it,"" adds Mark Critch.

""The jokes that we do [there] are desk jokes that are really quick. It's like, here's a topic and here's the punchline,"" explains McClellan.

""We don't have the luxury of time because we have to put something out every single week and we don't really get a chance to try it a bunch of times before we put it out to the world. We get one crack at it with a studio audience and then our producers have to decide if that was good enough to make the show that week.""

""Whereas in standup, you can take a bit about wine, for example, and try that twenty times before you ever decide, 'OK, yeah that's good enough to do on a big show or it's good enough to do on tour.' You get to change it and move it around and alter it and adjust it. And so you get far more cracks at trying to perfect it. So they're kind of very different in that regard.""

""And that's not necessarily my style,"" adds McClellan, ""my style is more going into a topic and then there's a number of jokes and angles on this one particular experience or topic. But that's part of the job description and you accept that going in.""

""For me, the way I work generally is very quickly. I've always done it that way,"" says Critch.

""[The Ha!ifax ComedyFest] comes in April, right after 22 Minutes, so we start 22 Minutes in September, I go out there and I write a lot for it and then that ends — and the Halifax festival happens. So, it's kind of like, a lot of my trying out material and club kind of time is taken up.""

""A lot of people would work on the same routine for you know, a year or years. I'm just used to doing stuff and boom, it's done, and move on to the next things. So every time I do something like the Ha!ifax ComedyFest, I write new material just for that and every time I've ever done it there, that's kind of the only time I've done it, really.""

Every comedian has a different approach to creating jokes and McClellan says: ""As an artist you'd like as many attempts at it as you can so that you can put it out and go, 'OK, that was as good as that bit can be.'""

""That's where all the other comedians, of course, they have great routines that they've been perfecting,"" adds Critch, ""so I'm always a little bit nervous before I come out [on stage].""

Critch says he always talks to the stage manager at the Ha!ifax ComedyFest before he goes out, saying: ""'Oh, what am I doing, I just wrote this stuff a week ago? Now I'm about to go out and do it in front of these people while being televised. I'm an idiot. Remind me not to do this'. But I got out there and it's all great.""

""Great thing about these comedy festivals,"" says Critch, ""is people see all these new faces who go on to do amazing things. But they're also seeing a lot of their favourites whom they've come to love year after year.""

""It's one of those moments where I have had that kind of ability to pause and go like, 'Wow, how grateful am I to just be part of this thing?',"" adds McClellan.

When he performed for conservative Muslim audiences, they would get uncomfortable when he started talking about sex.

When he performed midnight shows at comedy clubs, audiences would get just as uncomfortable when he talked about having genuine religious faith.

Those tensions helped to inspire Ramy, an eponymous comedy show about an Arab-Muslim family living in New Jersey.

The program — which also features Oscar winner Mahershala Ali as Sheikh Ali Malik — captures the push and pull between religion and everyday life, or as Youssef puts it, ""Friday prayers and Friday night.""

""That central tension was really important for me to bring out because I felt like there were no depictions of faith or being religious that felt organic to me in the on-screen world,"" says Youssef in an interview with q host Tom Power.

The Christian film genre feels highly sanitized, almost a commercial for the religion, he says, and other films feature priests gone bad or Muslim leaders linked to terrorist organizations.

""All these really blown-out concepts. So for me, this space that is so real for people who do believe, and for people who are navigating that, was the central focus of what I wanted to make,"" he explains.

""If anything, it's more about a person of faith of my generation than it is even specifically about being Muslim.""

'If other people are the problem then so am I'

Religion itself has become such a punch line in modern society, adds Youssef, that tackling religious belief in comedy actually seems edgy.

However he doesn't fault people who are averse to religious culture because, as he puts it, religion has become an industry.

""The way that these real emotions and these real ideals have been manipulated for a lot of bad and a lot of darkness and a lot of shame that is leveraged toward entire societies, the idea that there would be so much anti-religion is completely justified,"" he says.

""And I am very anti-religious culture on the whole. But I connect to faith — and those are different things.""

Youssef says he doesn't have a problem with Islam; rather, he has a problem with its followers. But Youssef isn't pointing fingers at his Muslim culture or community; rather, the show is about pointing a finger at the follower he knows best: himself.

""The core of my work is self-examining, because if other people are the problem then so am I,"" he says.

""I'm not exempt from looking at my hypocrisies and my gaps between what I believe and what I actually do.""

'I'm going to keep this to myself'

For his performance, Youssef won a Golden Globe earlier this year, a Peabody this week, and is a likely contender for Emmy consideration later this year.

The show primarily centres around Youssef's character, but it also features his family and friends — a fact not lost on his father, who has adjusted his behaviour accordingly.

""He'll be in the middle of telling me a story and he'll just cut it off and be like, 'You know what? I'm going to keep this to myself. I'm not trying to have this show up in your stand-up,"" recounts Youssef, who tells the story of his dad's unlikely connection to Donald Trump in his HBO special Ramy Youssef: Feelings.

""And I'm like, 'No, man, I only told, like, two bits about you. I don't mention you that much. We can just talk.'""

In the show, Youssef plays a version of himself — a millennial who's trying to forge his own identity and figure out how religion, relationships and his family fit into his life.

But Youssef, who is Ramy's co-creator, writer and executive producer, reserves the most cutting humour for his own character, and avoids protecting the protagonist or trying to make him look good.

""I really wanted to look at the ego-heavy version of myself. I really wanted to look at what would my life looked like if I went left in the fork as opposed to right,"" says Youssef.

'We all walk around with questions'

He's always been fortunate, he adds: his family is communicative, he has a passion for his work, and he got involved in comedy and film at a young age.

""I've always had this focus, but so much of the character I created for the show is, 'What if I didn't have that? What if I was really succumbing to my ego? What if I didn't find answers to certain questions and I was a little bit more stuck?""

Many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind. - Ramy Youssef

The second season of Ramy was just released on Hulu and Crave. And while the subject matter is serious, and the show tackles pressing issues of racism and anti-Muslim sentiment, Youssef emphasizes that the last thing he's aiming to do is offer answers.

""I think we all walk around with questions and there's even a thought that we're all actively trying to answer our questions, but I would argue that many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind,"" he says.

""My goal in opening up some of these things is to bring people closer to whatever questions they might have.""

Canadian summer is a fleeting season. Before you know it, you'll be spending eight months under a blanket with the heat cranked up, so, while you can, do as many things outside as possible. One great way to do this is taking your summer blockbuster-bingeing outdoors and you can DIY your own scenic cinema. Here's what you need to create one a movie theatre in your own backyard.

Projector

Remember those gigantic, 3-light projectors? We've come a long way since then. Home movie projectors range greatly in price from about $100 to over $1,000. Wirecutter's ""best cheap projectors"" are in the $600-900 range. But Amazon sells wireless projectors for under $200 with multiple connection options, including directly to your smartphone. Users seem to like the resolution of the VANKYO Cinemango 100 Mini Projector. Performance will also depend on the quality and distance from your screen.

VANKYO Cinemango 100 Mini Projector, $188.99, Amazon

Projector screen

Your projector is just part of the equation, of course. While you certainly make it ultra-rustic with a white sheet or a blank wall, this screen can keep your movies looking sharp. This 16:9 formatted screen displays a 100 inch-wide projection and comes with sticky hooks to help you install. It's also made of anti-crease fabric, so go ahead and fold it up into a small bag for easy storage.

Projector Screen, $35, Amazon

Bluetooth speaker

While it would be nice to run some concert-quality speakers out there, space and wiring in the backyard is usually limited (not to mention the potential for complaints from neighbours), so something a little more concentrated is best. Weighing just under one pound, this bluetooth speaker is splashproof and has a strong enough battery to allow up to 15 hours of play time. With full-spectrum audio for clear listening at any volume, the speaker also has a range up to 30 feet, so it can easily accommodate a backyard setup.

Portable Bluetooth Wireless Speaker, $35.99, Amazon

Inflatable lounger

Watching a 3-hour movie in a lawn chair would be a little uncomfortable and, short of dragging your recliner across the deck, this is the next best thing. This inflatable lounger can be used in a variety of ways, including for a single person to lie in or for multiple people to sit on, like a sofa. The durable nylon fabric is intended for any kind of outdoor terrain. And it has side pockets for your drinks and snacks. Best of all, it inflates instantly by holding it in the wind, so setup is a matter of seconds.

Cozyful Inflatable Air Lounger, $44.95, Amazon

Outdoor popcorn popper

A movie without snacks is no movie at all and this outdoor popcorn maker is a classic addition. A non-stick kettle with a wooden handle that keeps cool, it can be used over your bonfire, campfire or backyard grill.

Coghlan's Corn Popper, $24.99, Cabela's

Utility wagon

If you're having company over for an all-night binge, you'll also need something to hold and transport your snacks and drinks. This wagon folds and sets up in seconds, is able to hold up to 150 pounds and is made with an easy to clean fabric. It contains four cup holders and has a pop-up rear folding table, so you can snack for hours without taking your eyes off the screen.

These ""irregular border crossings"" represent tens of thousands of families and individuals who have travelled across continents in hopes of finding a safe home.

Headlines often describe these crossings as a crisis, a political problem, an urgent issue ahead of an election year.

Filmmaker Cristian Gomes says he was alarmed by some of the rhetoric and reactions he was hearing in the media. He felt the experiences of the real people behind the numbers were getting lost.

""It just shocked me because most people had strong opinions on [asylum seekers] that were just based on false information,"" Gomes says. ""That frustrated me. I wanted to go and explore this type of story and bring some humanity back into the discussion.""

For his short documentary Road to Roxham, Gomes trained his camera on the front lines — an unauthorized border crossing point on Roxham Road, which runs between New York state and Quebec.

'Every story takes a piece from you.'

(CBC Short Docs: Road to Roxham)

Arriving at the border, Gomes not only found asylum seekers hoping to be accepted into Canada, but a whole new economy that had sprung up in the area. Taxi services were suddenly flourishing, picking up travellers from the airport, train station and bus station in nearby Plattsburgh, N.Y., and driving them up the quiet, tree-lined Roxham Road to the Quebec border.

Gomes asked Mary Ann Ero, an American with a taxi service in the area, if she remembered any border crossers in particular.

Ero described a man she drove up Roxham Road: He had lost his wife and children — they had been struck by a train as they attempted to leave the United States. The man was on the same journey now.

Ero cried with the man during the drive. ""He said that he'd never forget me,"" she says in the documentary. ""That was, I think, the best and worst experience, you know … Every story takes a piece from you.""

The police give instructions. The crossings are quiet and orderly. A woman carefully navigates a baby carriage over a snowy bank. Young children drag large suitcases through puddles.

Gomes met one woman, Sofia, who carried stacks of court documents with her as evidence of the domestic abuse she was fleeing. She said she was escaping a man who had already found her in the United States. Her story did not make it into the documentary, but Gomes remembers her because she was travelling with three young children, ""too young to know what was going on.""

Some asylum claims are accepted, some are abandoned or withdrawn, and some are outright rejected.

What happens when asylum seekers are deported? It's a difficult group to track.

The Washington Post published a story in February detailing the torture and murder of deportees, often by gangs. In 2018, The New Yorker outlined the case of a young mother fleeing an abusive ex-husband. After she was deported, her body was found in a burned-out car.

Gomes says that while he doesn't have a personal connection to irregular border crossers, he was motivated by articles in the media and by his own Canadian identity.

""My family is a family of Portuguese immigrants and they came here after World War II — that was kind of my personal connection to it,"" he says. ""I always had that experience frame my perspective. I'm always interested in stories that explore identity, Canadian identity in particular. Who we let in and those [immigration] processes.""

Refugees around the globe

Road to Roxham premiered on YouTube on June 20, which is World Refugee Day.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees had just released its 2019 report showing that 79.5 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide by the end of the year due to ""war, conflict, persecution, human rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order."" An estimated 40 per cent were children under the age of 18.

At the border between Quebec and New York, Gomes met some of those people.

""Watching the documentary is one thing,"" he says. ""Going there in real life is something entirely different. I think standing at the border all day and just watching families from everywhere — all different ethnicities, all around the globe — cross into Canada gives you a different perspective. Seeing them face-to-face is different than seeing them on camera; it's different than seeing them on the news.""

Gomes hopes viewers listen to their stories.

""It's not really a politics issue; it's more of a human rights issue,"" he says. ""It's just sad to see that that's where the discussion in America and Canada is going. There's no space for the humanity.""

(CBC/CBC Comedy)

Trent McClellan and Shaun Majumder have a few things in common. They've entertained Canadians on This Hour Has 22 Minutes, they're veterans of the standup circuit, they were born in 1972, and they grew up with a mixed-race heritage in overwhelmingly white communities in Newfoundland and Labrador. They've also both used their comedy as a way of talking about racism, and have connected their own lived experiences in routines that poke and prod, yet still leave audiences howling with laughter.

Majumder, the son of an Indian father, was raised by his white mother in Burlington, on Newfoundland's Baie Verte Peninsula.

Born to a Black father and a white mother, McClellan grew up in Corner Brook.

Both comedians talked this week with Bernice Hillier, cohost of CBC Radio's Newfoundland Morning. Here's their conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Bernice Hillier: We've heard people say that racism is not an issue in this province. What's the reality, as you've experienced it here?

Shaun Majumder: I did not experience overt racism, like you might expect. When you hear the word ""racism,"" I'm half-white so there were plenty of tanned-looking fellows walking around the Green Bay area, and so people couldn't quite put their finger on where I was from. But still, even back when I was a kid, there was never any kind of dark racism — and when I say dark, I mean just that energy of heavy, true hate. You know, ""You go down back to your country, where you come from,"" you know what I mean? There was none of that.

Trent McClellan says taking risks is critical for a comedian, and that can include putting race on the list of topics to cover. (CBC)

Bernice Hillier: I want to ask Trent — what was your experience growing up as a person of colour in a mainly white community?

Trent McClellan: I just did a podcast yesterday with four other Black Canadian comedians and we all shared our experiences, and one of the things that was amazing about it was how early in our lives that racism played a role. I remember being called the N-word, probably by the time I was nine, eight or nine. You had to think about this. This is pre-internet, right? So it's not like they could have gone online and learned about what this was. This was taught to them by someone in their family. So I grew up with my white grandparents raising me. I'm like this skinny, scrawny kid with a massive afro — you know, I couldn't have stood out more. It was amazing, just in talking to everybody that was on the podcast, about how early it knocked on their door and how quickly you realize that, ""Oh, this is going to play a role in my life."" So obviously you grow up and you have lots of friends and family who accept you, but I I remember dating people, and their parents weren't cool that they were dating a Black guy.

Since the US election, alt-right white nationalists feel emboldened in their quest to create a utopian society where races never mix. Shaun Majumder sees a different future: beige. 2:07

Bernice Hillier: Shaun, you joke in your standup that when kids in Burlington said they were going to get the Black guy, you said, 'Where's he to?' When did you first realize that your skin colour made you different in the eyes of others?

Shaun Majumder: Like I said, it wasn't overt for me at all. Nobody ever used a racial slur. I mean I guess they did, you know, but it wasn't in the way that someone would be filled with hate to say, ""You are this, so therefore you are different."" They had heard the word, ""Paki"" was the word that they used for me, but it was a loving nickname. My sister talked about it. She was like, ""Some of our best friends [would say], 'Come on, Paki, let's go, we're going up to the dam drinking.'"" It was not driven by hate. I even talked about this in my standup. There was a woman on the show Majumder Manor, for example. The producers asked her what she thought of me and my sister growing up and she was like, ""Oh my God, we loved Shaun and Rani growing up. We loved them so much, they were some sweet. And we'd see him on the bus, the back of the bus, and we'd be like, Look at the two little burnt babies, sitting in the back of the bus."" And this is on national TV! Burnt babies — now, you put this in writing, you're going to be crucified.

Bernice Hillier: It sounds pretty awful.

Trent McClellan: Yeah.

Shaun Majumder: It's awful, but it was coming from a place of love. I struggle … I'm not saying ignorance is an excuse, but I'm telling you, I live in the United States. You see what the African-American experience is here in terms of the dark, dark history, and it reminds me of the First Nations experience in Canada. In terms of the multi-generational damage that has been done to a people, from slavery all the way to residential schools, you see a parallel that exists today. People can't say, ""Get over it. It's done.""

Bernice Hillier: Trent, how did you deal with the isolation that came with being a member of a minority in a community that was mostly white?

Trent McClellan: I got really small, in a lot of ways. I tried not to rock the boat because you're always going to be the centre of attention anyway. I didn't want to walk in this room and every single person is going to stare, and go, ""That is quite the hairdo!"" I went inside myself a little bit. I was pretty quiet. Then I gravitated towards sports, and then once I became fairly good at different sports, it was like that changed your status. Now you're the kid that's being picked first for things and so there was kind of an empowering thing in that for me. I developed my sense of confidence and kind of came out of my shell quite a bit just from that.

Kids are very visual learners. You look around and realize that no one looks like me. No one has hair like I do. These are things you're constantly taking into your subconscious all the time, as you navigate through the world.

Bernice Hillier: Do you think, Trent, that it led you to a career in comedy? You know, that coming out of your shell eventually and finding some way to make sense of it all?

Trent McClellan: Definitely, yeah. Because I think for a number of reasons, you get used to all eyes on you. You get used to being the centre of attention. For me, comedy was a defence mechanism, to kind of take the power back. Well, if you're going to be the centre of attention, I might as well control that situation. Then I can manipulate my world and the topics and stuff to entertain people. It was a way of shifting that dynamic.

Bernice Hillier: Shaun, what about you? Can you connect the dots, too, between race and your career choice?

Shaun Majumder: Yeah. I think developing a sense of humour was definitely a way through the social ranks. You know, it put you in a higher status, if you're 13, 14 and you can feel somebody bearing down, maybe it's the most popular kid bearing down to intimidate you in some way, and then you drop a funny one-liner, and all of a sudden the pretty girls are chuckling. And you're like, ""Heyyyy, you know what, maybe there's something to this.""

And Trent, I wanted actually to ask you this. I always remember that girls, for example, always found me to be curious, and they were curious in a good way. You know, ""Ooh, he's different,"" there's a bit of an exotic feel for this young fella up at the teen dance, but at the exact same moment, the same moment of feeling like I am on top, there was always the same person who might be like, yes, but, mother would never let you in the house. You know what I mean? Did you have that too, Trent, where you were exotic, but not exotic enough to be invited over for supper?

Trent McClellan: [laughs] Yeah. It was like you were the crown jewel behind the glass. Like, ""Oh, I'd love to have that diamond. I'd love to wear that diamond. I'd never be able to afford that diamond."" It's a true story. I remember being in school and another girl coming up to me and she goes, ""Yeah, just so you know, this other girl really really likes you."" And you're a kid fighting acne and hormones and all that stuff. I mean it was really pretty empowering and inflating. I said, ""Really, I don't even know who that is."" She goes, ""Well, you know what they say about Black guys."" And I was like, ""No. No, I don't."" I didn't even know what the stereotypes were!

Bernice Hillier: How do you both use comedy as a form of education on race and racism? Obviously your first role as a comedian is to be funny, to make people laugh. Do you feel a responsibility to also educate in some way?

Shaun Majumder: Yeah. My last tour was all about hate — it was called the Hate Tour. I spoke a lot on stage about, you know, we talk about how Newfoundlanders are the friendliest people on Earth. Well, yes, it's true. They genuinely are some of the most hospitable, kind, open, warm people.

But within that group, there are also many people who — especially now because of Facebook and all the social media — you know, hate can be spawned by people planting seeds of fear. I talk about the kind of racism, the kind of hate that exists or that has existed in my experience growing up in Newfoundland. There are people who say racist things that still come from a place of love — they just aren't unaware of it. There was a woman who dropped the N-word on VOCM that time, and she just dropped it like it was nothing. She was like, ""Oh, I loves them all!"" You know, there's a sense of ignorance there.

I'm not saying there aren't hate-filled, racist people in Newfoundland. I'm sure there are but it's a different kind. We don't have a history of [Black] slavery. But if I were a Beothuk growing up in Newfoundland, I might feel different. I may have some historical issues there.

Responsibility as a comedian

Bernice Hillier: Trent, what about for you? How do you use comedy to educate, or do you not even really feel that that's a responsibility or a role for you?

Trent McClellan: For me, it's kind of coming in and out of my act, depending on year to year, and where I'm at with what's going on with me personally. That might mean you see me in one year and there's a bunch of stuff about race, and the next time you see me, I might not mention it at all. One of the things I've always felt like as a performer — I don't know if Shaun felt this — but because people may not have had much interaction with someone who is Black, I always felt like somewhat of a representative of my race, in a way. I almost felt like if people come to my show and they laugh, then maybe that changes someone's mind about having some pretty ignorant or backward thoughts about Black people. You know, ""Man, that guy's experience was very similar to mine,"" or ""His life is not as different from mine as I thought it was, and I laughed and had a great time.""

Maybe that's the thing that allows them to leave and go, like, ""Hmmm."" That's going to put an ounce of thought in their head, that's going to change how they approach things. I didn't really acknowledge it until later in life, when I felt, yeah, I do kind of walk in with a certain sense of responsibility sometimes, as opposed to just being me and who I am during the day. I do feel a sense of that responsibility. I don't know if you felt that way, Shaun, at any point.

Trent McClellan grew up in Corner Brook, launched his standup career in Calgary and now works on 22 Minutes in Halifax. (Submitted by Jake Hirsch)

Shaun Majumder: My experience was that I actually felt like I did not represent anything. In my act, I talked about how I came to discover that I was brown later in life. Like, I had no idea, in fact. I think I was a bit racist growing up. I was a little white supremacist! You know, because my mom was white, my sister was beige, I grew up in a town of white people, I thought I was white like everybody else. My dad was brown and he lived in Ontario and so I knew my dad was Indian but I remember even going to school and doing a show-and-tell, and I talked about how my dad was Indian but I talked about how he wore — this is so ignorant — I talked about how he wore a headdress of feathers. And I remember the teacher looking at me and going, ""Really? Really, Shaun?"" ""Well, yes, yes, he was a chief."" Like, I had no idea what I was talking about.

I never felt like I represented anything because of the fact that I'm a mixed-race guy, but I also I was different enough to know, now looking back in retrospect, the little things that happened that were because I was brown. Again, it was not a direct kind of racism that you might expect. It was a different kind altogether. There was a curiosity. Look, if someone didn't like me, it was probably because I was an arsehole, not because I was brown.

In 2016, Shaun Majumder profiled Joe Exotic when he was running for president. The scene is included in the Netflix documentary series Tiger King. (This Hour Has 22 Minutes)

Trent McClellan: Right, right. We were talking about this yesterday, too, with the other comedians. The amount of times I was in my head about different things. I remember we had a new teacher at our school once and they were doing roll call and attendance, and he goes, ""Trent McClellan?"" and I put up my hand, and he goes, ""You must play basketball, do ya?"" In my mind I went, I do play basketball. Does he know that I play basketball or is he just looking at me visually? Is it because I'm tall? Because I'm sitting down so he wouldn't be able to tell how tall. My mind just went through these like mental gymnastics, just from a basic question that this teacher had just asked. I was in my own head a lot, overthinking this.

Shaun Majumder: I never got people going, ""Shaun Majumder?"" And then I raised my hand, and ""You must play cricket, do ya?"" I never got that.

Trent McClellan: [laughs] I don't think there were a lot of cricket games going on in Burlington, was there, back in the day.

Shaun Majumder: [laughs] Not at that time.

Trent McClellan: No. Now, it's a big deal.

Shaun Majumder: Now the league is huge. It's a huge league.

Bernice Hillier: Guys, we're going to have to wrap it up. Thank you so much for taking time to speak with us.

Shaun Majumder: [sarcastically] Oh, really? Are we stopping early because we're brown? Is that what's going on here?

Bernice Hillier: [laughs] Nothing to do with it.

Shaun Majumder: [laughs] I'm a little sensitive, sorry. This conversation's got me fired up.

Bernice Hillier: Thank you to both of you for your time.

Thorne's series Utopia Falls illustrates diverse young leaders who rise up against their oppressors, something the world is in need of and, thankfully, is not of short supply.

Born in Calgary but now living in Toronto, Thorne has built a long career as a television director, producer, filmmaker, and music video director for a number of artists including Kardinal Offishall, Belly, and Shawn Desman. With an obvious keen eye for incorporating music in his storytelling, it was only natural that the heroes in Utopia Falls were driven by music and the arts.

Earlier this year, Thorne sat with us and described his show as a ""love letter to hip-hop"" and told us why he created Utopia Falls. He took his love for the music genre, sci-fi, and a need to create something that he was not seeing in the world to tell a very relevant story.

R.T. Thorne tells us what inspired him to create Utopia Falls and how the all-star team came together. 4:01

With anti-Black racism being discussed widely in the public sphere, and more and more interest for anti-racism resources, we asked Thorne to curate a selection of CBC Gem films and documentaries that you can add to your viewing list.

Unarmed Verses



This documentary, directed by Charles Officer, follows Francine Valentine, a young girl who is trying to find her own voice through poetry and music while her community is being revitalized, putting her home and family at risk.



While the larger scope of this narrative is about the gentrification of her neighbourhood, the real focus is how a single Black life does matter.



""It's a snapshot of these young Black lives,"" Thorne says of the film. ""They're just trying to find their way, and trying to find their voice, and realizing their voice is important and valid.""



It's a quiet yet powerful look at one of many stepping stones in the Black Lives Matter movement.

It's a lovingly crafted film. It really states that these Black lives do matter. - On Unarmed Verses



The Skin We're In

One might be able to draw a dotted line between Unarmed Verses and The Skin We're In, Journalist Desmond Cole's essay-turned-documentary (also directed by Charles Officer) that faces systemic racism in Canada head-on.

""They are almost companion pieces. They show two ends of the struggle,"" R.T. states as he compares the two documentaries, particularly the moment in The Skin We're In when Cole explores the history of Africville and how that community was demolished to make way for Halifax housing. ""It shows that gentrification... its roots are deep in our history.""

Thorne also praises the documentary's hero. ""Desmond Cole… what a force!""

The film does not shy away from declaring that Canada's hands are not clean of anti-Black racism. Canadian Black lives matter.

""The legacy of The Skin We're In, as a piece, really shows how far we've come in the acceptance of [Black Lives Matter], and probably how far we have still to go.""

In calling out systemic racism in our culture, our politics, and our society, the documentary continues to drive the conversation, pushing people into action and bringing them together to support Black Lives Matter. Whether it came out 20 years ago, 10 years ago or 10 days ago, it's a conversation that has stayed relevant, and Thorne is hopeful that change is on the horizon.

""Out of this pain. Out of this anger and outrage,"" he reflects, ""is a chance for real change and it feels different.""

He's such a powerful voice in it and so unapologetic. - On Desmond Cole



Black Cop

Ronnie Rowe plays a Black cop who is racially profiled and assaulted by fellow officers who are white. This takes him down an almost cathartic path of vengeance that turns the lenses on a reality Black people face each day. Bold, uncompromising, and often at times satirical, Cory Bowles' debut feature film Black Cop flips the script and perspective on the very real police brutality against Black people in Canada.

""It's part satire, part drama. There's also a feeling of standup in it. There are all these different aspects of this film which is just really unique as a piece. And then take tackling this sort of subject matter. This idea of a Black police officer who gets racially profiled by his own people, in his own 'blue gang,' and then psychologically how that affects him. It goes further in what it must be for a lot of Black police officers who have to police their own people in a system that is racist toward their own people and how they feel about that, and the conflict they feel about that and the anger that they feel about that. It's just a really interesting piece that examines that from a different point of view.""

It was complex, in form and in subject matter. - On Black Cop



Jean of the Joneses

Family values and connections are the thread of this film directed by Stella Meghie, and produced by Floyd Kane and Amos Adetuyi, the creators of Diggstown .

While previous picks were powerful social commentaries on anti-Black and systemic racism, Thorne notes that Black voices telling Black stories was also about people and the lives they live, comical or otherwise.

""The focus is about Black lives and Black voices, so here is a film that is a joyful expression of Black lives and particularly Black women which is just wonderful to see,"" R.T. explains. ""Quirky and funny, and very lived-in women.""

A fun expression of family and Black women living their lives. - On Jean of the Joneses



Rebelle (War Witch)

R.T. describes this 2012 film as, ""A journey of a young Black girl being forced into womanhood.""

Written and directed by Montreal director Kim Nguyen, Rebelle (War Witch) is seen through the eyes of Komona (Rachel Mwanza) as she tells her unborn baby the story of her life as a child soldier in a civil war in Africa.

Though heavy and at times hard to watch, it is a story of resilience.

R.T. says, ""She's forced into this situation but then she carves out her own life and tries to escape and find her own way.""

It's as heart-wrenching as it is powerful.​​​​​​ - On Rebelle (War Witch)

We’ll let you sit with that for a minute. There are a lot of modifiers there.

The company was started in New York in 1974, on the heels of the Stonewall Riots. The Trocks, as it’s known, was a result of the Gay Liberation movement. The Trocks’ dancers play both male and female roles. That meant wearing tutus and dancing en pointe, something that was an act of rebellion, against the dance community, and the world as a whole. In Rebels on Pointe, we go behind the scenes and find out what makes Les Ballets de Trockadero so special to the LGBTQ community, the dance community, its legions of fans around the world, and the dancers themselves.

“It’s not a gay company, per se, in that we don’t address gay issues in a political sense,” says Tory Dobrin, The Trocks’ artistic director, who was himself a member of the company from 1980 through 1998. “But there is a lot of gay sensibility, because of the use of drag, and we’re all gay.”

In the 1970s, men dancing en pointe was almost unheard of. The Trocks gave dancers a chance to explore their artform without being hemmed in by gender roles. It was a venue for free expression at a time when gay people faced huge stigma.

The company’s first shows were in a loft space in New York’s Meat Packing District. In 1977, they appeared on television for the first time. More than 40 years after their founding, they’ve performed all over the world and developed a tremendous cult following.

In some ways, the history of The Trocks mirrors the history of the LGBTQ community. What started as a subversive, underground performance has turned into a beloved institution. What was considered an adult show now plays to matinées filled with children and is seen as an accessible entry point to the world of ballet. They were a novelty act, now they’re respected as dancers, and in some quarters, considered stars. Today, the company includes multiple married couples, Dobrin says gay men of his generation “didn’t think that was possible.”

As much as a Trocks performance is full of camp humour, The Trocks themselves are all serious performers. The current company includes former members of the English National Ballet, the National Ballet of Cuba, the Dance Theater of Harlem, and the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.

“The ballets are hard,” explains New York Times dance critic Gia Kourlas. “They’re not faking that. That’s not the joke. The jokes are in the details; what they’re doing with their face or their eyes.”

So why be a Trock in 2018? There are a lot of reasons.

In some ways, even in a much more liberated world, The Trocks still serves the same purpose it always did. LGBTQ people may be able to live more openly than ever before, but on stage, gender roles in ballet are as rigid as they’ve ever been.

“Being a male ballet dancer in a very traditional company, I play the prince who is in love with the princess, every role,” explains James Whiteside, a principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater and massive Trocks fan. “Every single role, I am playing counter to my nature.”

For The Trocks, many of whom would be considered too small for traditional male ballet roles, that’s not a problem. They can be the prince or the princess. They get to make art, push boundaries, and change how people see the world. They can be celebrated by the dance world while thumbing their noses at it a little too.

And most importantly, they get to live their childhood dreams of the big stage, on their terms, and inspire the next generation of dancers to go hard, and be themselves unapologetically.",[]

These stories, shared or foreign, open our eyes to possibilities or opportunities to be enlightened. They may instigate critical thinking and perhaps change our status-quo or question unconsciously engrained views about the world, or ourselves.

Canadian literature basks in the same sun thanks to the prominent authors such as Mordecai Richler, Margaret Atwood, Lawrence Hill, Alice Munro, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson and many, many others.

Some CanLit masterpieces have been made into acclaimed films and here are a few you can now stream on CBC Gem .

Away from Her is a moving love story that walks down a path of age, disability and a long marriage. Away from Her is the lyrical screenplay adaptation of celebrated author Alice Munro's short story ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" from her 2001 collection Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage.

The story follows a man coping with the institutionalization of his wife due to Alzheimer's disease. He faces an epiphany when she loses all her memory and shifts her affections to another nursing home resident, Aubrey — a man in a wheelchair who is also mute.

This critically acclaimed film was written and directed by Sarah Polley, starring high-profile leads including Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent, and supporting cast: Olympia Dukakis, Michael Murphy, Wendy Crewson, Alberta Watson, and Kristen Thomson.

Away From Her was Sarah Polley's feature film directorial debut and had critics praising not only the performances in the film but also Polley's screenplay and direction.

""Rarely has love at any age been depicted so honestly on screen. For such a fully realized portrait to be created by a 28-year-old first-time director is even more remarkable."" — Ann Hornaday, Washington Post.

The film received two nominations at the 80th Academy Awards: for Best Actress (Julie Christie) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Sarah Polley). It also won seven Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.

Michel Poulette's Maïna is a sensual coming-of-age story of a young Innu woman's spiritual journey and a tale of cultural conflict, set around 600 years ago in the Canadian wilderness, before the European invasion.

The film, based on Dominique Demers' book of the same name, sees Maïna travel all the way to the Great North to save her young friend. And when her rescue mission fails, the Inuit travellers — who've held her friend captive — take her too. Along their arduous adventure to the Arctic, Maïna ends up falling in love with a man in the enemy tribe.

Maïna received multiple awards and an impressive six Canadian Screen Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Cinematography.

In this interview with CBC's All in a Weekend , director Michel Poulette said that he was absolutely absorbed in the book from start to finish and decided to make it a picture.

He explained that the book was set 3,500 years ago but after talking to Innu and Inuit people and in doing the research they decided it was better to make the timeline closer to today, making it the 18th century instead. He added that this was the first time Innu people could see themselves represented on the big screen but also could hear themselves, as the languages spoken in the film are Innu and Inuit.

And to add icing on the cake, ""I think [people] will [take away from] this movie a new knowledge about these two civilisations,"" says Pulette. The film is also filled with wild animals such as polar bears, caribou, wolves, ducks and more.

Barney's Version is a film that follows a picaresque and touching story of the politically incorrect, impulsive, irascible and fearlessly blunt 67-year-old Barney Panofsky — who believes only two things: that no one will ever understand anyone else and that life is absurd.

When a series of events propels Barney to write his memoirs, what unfolds is a funny, frank and surprisingly touching portrait of one of CanLit's most iconic characters. A raunchy yet tender account of his life that includes plenty of bad behaviour.

The film is based on Mordecai Richler's 1997 book of the same name which is written from a first person point of view — while the movie is told from a third person's point of view.

The book won the 1997 Scotiabank Giller Prize and was a Canada Reads 2004 finalist, defended by Canadian author and journalist, Zsuzsi Gartner.

Not only was the book written by one of Canada's most celebrated authors, who also briefly worked at the CBC in Montreal, but the film version boasts Hollywood celebrity mega stars: Oscar nominee Paul Giamatti (Billions, Cinderella Man) and two-time Oscar winner, Dustin Hoffman (The Graduate, Rain Man), in the lead roles.

The film was nominated for a number of awards including an Academy Award for best makeup and won many Genies plus a Golden Globe for Best Actor.

Biidaaban is a short animated film based on stories and poems by acclaimed Anishinaabe writer/musician Leanne Betasamosake Simpson.

In this mesmerizing stop-motion short directed by Amanda Strong, Indigenous youths are on a mission to reclaim the ceremonial harvesting of sap from maple trees in suburban Ontario (somewhere in Peterborough) — like their Indigenous ancestors did for generations.

Unlike those who came before them, titular Biidaaban joined by a 10,000-year-old shapeshifter, Sabe, are forced to sneak out in the middle of the night because the trees that once belonged to the forest now grow on private property. The duo, however, is guided by spirits of animals who used to roam there, a ghost caribou and ghost wolf, to do the work.

""In this story, we wanted to create a dialogue around who owns land and what is owned property — especially when you have trees and root systems that have existed in those spaces since time immemorial,"" said Strong to CBC Arts in their interview about the film's many breathtaking moments .

The Lesser Blessed is a film about a First Nations teenager's struggle for identity, healing, and a quest to find his place in the modern world — starring Benjamin Bratt, Kiowa Gordon and Joel Evans.

The film was adapted in 2012 by Ukranian filmmaker, Anita Doron, from Canadian writer Richard Van Camp's novel of the same name — which won the German Youth Literature Prize in 2001 — and garnered a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Canadian Screen Awards.

""The Lesser Blessed inspired me to keep writing my own stories about young Anishinaabeg. The diverse, compelling characters are humanised in a way that was largely unseen in mainstream media and literature at the time this short but very potent book was published, two decades ago,"" said journalist and author, Waubgeshig Rice, about the book to CBC Books .

""Van Camp showed me that it's okay to go to dark places and write about harsh truths when depicting the young Indigenous experience in fiction, all the while ensuring hope and joy have space to triumph.""

The Breadwinner is a 2017 animated film executive produced by Angelina Jolie and Mimi Polk Gitlin, and directed by Nora Twomey, about a headstrong young girl in Afghanistan who disguises herself as a boy in order to provide for her family and become the titular breadwinner.

Based on the best-selling children's novel of the same name — also known as Parvana — by Deborah Ellis, the film was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 2018 Academy Awards, and won a CSA for Best Adapted Screenplay.

The book was released in 2000 after the author spent months interviewing women and girls in refugee camps in Pakistan for research. Ellis used these interviews as the basis of her depiction of life in Afghanistan.

A beautiful, gifted but mentally ill woman loses custody of her two young children when caught up in a manic episode that makes her leave them unattended on an island near her summer home.

This adaptation of Joan Clark's novel of the same name also delves into survival, overcoming obstacles and mending familial fences. The author said An Audience of Chairs is based on her cousin, who is bipolar and has had a hard life because of it.

""Like beauty, madness altered perception, but instead of offering illusion, it offered delusion. Moranna learned the tricks madness played on perception the hard way as experience showed her how persuasively madness distorted reality. Experience also showed her that if she hung on long enough, the panic would subside and the delusions would pass."" — Excerpt from the book An Audience of Chairs (p. 286)

Based on Newfoundland author Joel Thomas Hynes' first novel of the same name, the film follows the story of Keith and Natasha's relationship that turns rotten. When Natasha runs away to Halifax, Keith makes it his mission to track her down, only to learn things about himself that he never realized before.

The film received two awards at the Atlantic Film Festival for best feature film and best original screenplay.

Author Joel Thomas Hynes, known for recurring characters on Republic of Doyle , Orphan Black, Mary Kills People and Frontier, plays the lead in the film. He also created and starred in Little Dog and will be seen in the upcoming CBC Gem series based on a book, The Trickster.",[]

64,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/features/im-a-toronto-sex-worker-heres-why-i-find-my-job-empowering,Selling Sex: I’m a Toronto sex worker: Here’s why I find my job empowering,[],,"I have been working in the sex trade since November 2008. Like the sex workers featured in Selling Sex, a documentary presented by The Passionate Eye, I also find my job to be lucrative, enjoyable and empowering.

There’s a negative stigma around the industry that desperately needs to change. Many people view sex workers as victims who have been pushed into this work by circumstances beyond their control or sheer desperation. I am neither; I do this job by choice.

But for more than a decade, I didn’t talk about my work much with others — mostly because I didn’t want my family to be afraid for me, but also because I found my job made other people uncomfortable.

In the film, British filmmaker Louis Theroux presents the stories of sex workers with respect, compassion and humanity. Documentaries like this are integral in helping to dispel stigmas against those who willingly work in the sex industry.

Breaking those stigmas is the reason that I decided to come out as a proud sex worker to my community of friends and family a year ago.

Why I became a sex worker

In my early teens, I aspired to be an Olympic-level figure skater, a fashion designer, a teacher, and a mom but never a prostitute.

By 2008, I was working as a clothing department manager at an adult store and living alone in a two-bedroom apartment. I couldn’t pay my rent and wanted more freedom in life. And sex work seemed like an appealing way to meet my financial needs in a way that gave a good return for my time and energy.

I reached out to a good friend who I knew was working as an escort, and she (somewhat reluctantly) gave me guidance on how to safely enter the business. Initially, I felt ashamed. Fortunately, my first appointment was wonderful, and the initial pangs of shame I felt melted away as I re-counted my money at home.

Sex work has also served as a vehicle for my own sexual self-discovery. Most of my co-workers prefer heterosexual, monogamous relationships in their personal lives, but I am bisexual, love kink and am definitely not a monogamist. Sex work is a perfect way for me to nurture all these aspects.

How I find empowerment in sex work

Like two of the three women interviewed in Selling Sex and many sex workers in the industry, I have a history of sexual and psychological abuse. I find commodifying my body a way to take back power both physically and psychologically. Men enjoy my company and tell me that I’m bright and attractive. I feel confident and worthy.

What’s really empowering is knowing I help clients feel good about themselves, too. Some of my clients are also sexual abuse survivors, and with them, I ensure that they aren’t participating in any sex acts that are harmful.

I don’t want to add to another person’s trauma, so I treat all my clients with the same respect and dignity I, and all people, should be treated with. I’m proud of the role I play in teaching clients all the ways to have a healthy and enjoyable sexual connection.

Understanding how laws affect sex workers

In England, it’s legal to “sell sex” so long as it doesn’t involve coercion, exploitation or abuse, isn’t causing a public nuisance, and doesn’t involve a brothel. But not in Canada.

Here, Bill C-36, called the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, makes it legal for workers to sell sex but illegal for clients to pay for it. We’re restricted in how we advertise our services and need to work indoors in small (but hidden) brothels, our own homes or travel out to a client. This puts us at risk because we need to be discreet. Although most of our clients are safe, the law makes it difficult to screen clients to protect ourselves against sexual predators. And if there is a problem, calling the police often isn’t an option.

Telling stories of women who are involved in sex work from a positive viewpoint is important to change people’s attitudes. Once we change our perceptions about sex workers and the people who seek our services, I hope that the laws will change to make our working environment safer.

After all, who wouldn’t want to be paid well to do something that makes them and others feel good?

Bhatt says local pipelines and wells will be used for backdrops and they hope to cast some local energy industry workers as extras. One of the lead characters, Natallie Gamble, is a third generation pipeline worker.

""The reason we chose Sundre is there's viewpoints that haven't really been used in film before. Other parts of the Rocky Mountains, you've seen them in every postcard, where this is quite special,"" he said.

Bhatt chose to remain in creative control of the series concept rather than sell the royalties and rights to a bigger company. He hopes the series will be picked up by the streaming giant Netflix.

More than 200 locals turned up to a casting call and information session held in the town on Tuesday to learn more about the project and to have their photos taken to be considered for work as extras.

""It's exciting to have a pilot filmed here in our community and it's just fun to be part of the whole thing,"" said Andrea Englehart, who took part in the casting call.

""I think nothing but good things can come of this,"" she said.

The Town of Sundre is welcoming the opportunity with open arms, too.

The town's economic development officer Jon Allan hopes a series rolling into town will provide a big cash injection for local businesses as well as showcasing the area to the world and potential visitors.

""We're super excited, this is amazing news. We're trying help them make this pilot production a reality,"" said Allan.

""If this pilot, this proof of concept, takes off it will have massive downstream benefits to the community,"" he said.

Allan says the production would go beyond just using nearby backdrops for some scenes, showcasing the town itself and and showing off its Western feel.

Talk of a new series comes as the province's multi-million-dollar film industry waits patiently to fire up again after a long and frustrating break for production companies and workers due to COVID-19.

""This is one of those made in Alberta projects, one of those made in Alberta stories. Everyone knows the conversations around oil and gas and this is a really good human piece to add to all of that,"" said Brock Skretting, with industry advocacy group Keep Alberta Rolling.

Skretting is hoping the pilot is picked up and goes on to become an Alberta film industry success story.

""It could potentially bring hundreds of jobs and bring millions of dollars into the province,"" Skretting said.

""Involving our small towns in our stories is so crucial because they need it right now. Albertans need a win,"" he said.

Skretting says the industry is moving closer to reopening after COVID-19 while safety protocols and guidelines are finalized across the industry.

Ingredients

Chili & rice:

1 dried smoked chipotle or ancho chili

½ fresh red chili

1 red onion

1 tsp sweet smoked paprika

½ tsp cumin seeds

1–2 garlic cloves

1 big bunch of fresh coriander

Olive oil

2 mixed-colour peppers

1 x 400 g tin of chickpeas

1 x 400 g tin of black beans

1 lemon

700 mg passata

1x 250 g pack of cooked mixed long grain and wild rice

Salad:

4 small corn tortilla wraps

2 ripe avocados

3 heaped tbsp fat-free natural yoghurt, plus extra to serve

½ a cucumber

1 fresh red chili

1 handful of ripe cherry tomatoes

Preparation

Ingredients out • Oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 • Food processor (bowl blade) • Lidded casserole pan, high heat • Stick blender

Start cooking:

Put the chilies, peeled and halved red onion, paprika and cumin seeds into the processor, squash in the unpeeled garlic through a garlic crusher, then add the coriander stalks (reserving the leaves) and 2 tablespoons of oil, and whiz until fine.

Tip into the pan, then add the deseeded and roughly chopped peppers, drained chickpeas and black beans, a pinch of salt and pepper and the passata, stir well and put the lid on.

Fold the tortillas in half, slice into 0.5cm strips, sprinkle on to a baking tray and pop in the oven until golden and crisp.

Put most of the coriander leaves, a pinch of salt and pepper, half a peeled avocado, the yogurt and the juice from 2 limes into a jug and whiz with a stick blender until silky.

Check and adjust the seasoning of the chili, leave the lid off.

Remove the tortillas from the oven into a bowl, cut the lettuce into chunky wedges and add to the bowl.

Scoop and dot over curls of avocado.

Peel the cucumber into ribbons and finely slice half a chili, then scatter both over the top.

Make a well in the middle of the chili and tip in the rice, then pop the lid on for the last few minutes to warm the rice through.

Pour the dressing over the salad, pick over the remaining coriander leaves, finely slice the remaining chili and sprinkle over the top along with the halved cherry tomatoes, then toss everything together.

Serve with dollops of yogurt.

Kathleen Hearn's obituary isn't your average death notice.

""It pains me to admit it, but apparently, I have passed away … I now will check the obituaries and finally see my name there,"" it reads.

Hearn died on Thursday, but not before she penned her own obituary, one full of wit and wry humour.

Katheen's sister-in-law, Dorothy Hearn, says she wasn't surprised by the obit.

""I expected nothing less from her than to do her own obituary and have a few jokes thrown in,"" she said.

Dorothy said she didn't get to see the obit before it was published, but was ""just blown away"" when she read it.

She said Kathleen had an unpredictable and sometimes shocking sense of humour — as her obituary shows.

""As I leave you all behind, I want to thank all those who were part of my life and the butt of my jokes,"" Kathleen wrote.

""In the meantime, I now have the smoking hot body I have always wanted… having been cremated.""

'Kathy was Kathy'

In the 40 years that she knew Kathleen, Dorothy said it was nothing but laughs when they were together.

""Kathleen was full of life. From the moment we met her, until her last breath, Kathy was Kathy,"" she said.

""She was outgoing, funny, loving, a sense of humour like no other person you could meet. Very loveable.""

Dorothy said Kathleen even held a contest to choose an obit, but decided to write her own instead.

""She just had a couple of other people write an obituary to see which one would be the best one, but of course she went with her own. She knew that from the beginning anyway, it was just a fun thing to do,"" she said.

Kathleen had her fair share of tough times in her life, Dorothy said, like her husband Mack's battle with multiple sclerosis and his death at just 45 years old.

But through it all, including her own battle with cancer, she said Kathleen took it all in stride.

""There was never a down day in her life. No matter what came at her, it was a laugh. She dealt with it like no one I have ever known,"" Dorothy said.

""Even during her chemo at the Health Sciences [Centre], the staff there were in constant laughter … she just didn't let anything get her down.""

Even after her sister-in-law's passing, Dorothy Hearn said she's glad Kathleen's humorous obituary could put a smile on people's faces.

""She walked in and the whole atmosphere changed. She was a constant riot, you didn't know what she was going to say next,"" she said.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller's first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president's extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to ""respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

""The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,"" Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this ""whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.""

Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT! —@realDonaldTrump

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work.

In his first public appearance after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report's findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller said did not adequately capture the gravity of his team's findings.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller's mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

WATCH | Trump commutes friend Roger Stone's prison sentence:

Roger Stone was sentenced in February to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing the House investigation into whether the U.S. president's campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. 4:07

Stone was particularly critical, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks' release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers.

""We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,"" Mueller wrote. ""The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.""",[]

Yet there are areas of the country where the concept of four litres of moo juice coming in transparent, jiggly bags is the most inexplicable thing about life in Eastern Canada.

But what's to blame for the proliferation of bagged milk in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime provinces but not others?

It's a question The Cost of Living heard from listeners who were confused when they had difficulty finding the same milk jugs in Ontario that are easily sourced at any grocery store from British Columbia to Manitoba, or in the United States.

This doesn't make any sense. Why would they do it like this? - Shemma Yamach, puzzled by milk bags after moving to Toronto from Edmonton

""Whenever I have American friends visiting, they think the milk in my fridge is totally ridiculous,"" said CBC reporter Jonathan Pinto. ""In Detroit, milk comes in jugs.""

The reaction is similar for people who come eastward from western provinces.

""Coming from Alberta, I'm used to seeing milk jugs. I went through the store repeatedly and couldn't find them,"" said Shemma Yamach, who moved to Toronto after growing up in Edmonton.

She quickly realized the issue wasn't that every grocery store she visited was just out of what she thought was universal — the four-litre hard plastic milk jug.

Those who use milk bags also know to have a reusable plastic holster for said bags. (City of Toronto)

""After going to people's homes and seeing that everyone had these bags of milk, and they cut them open on the corner and drink milk out of this pitcher… well, I just thought this doesn't make any sense. Why would they do it like this?"" asked Yamach.

The question was echoed by Pinto, who works for CBC Radio's Afternoon Drive in southwestern Ontario.

""How come some places have milk in bags, and others don't?""

Enter the metric system

Milk bags first entered the Canadian market in the late 1960s.

However, Canada's conversion to the metric system in the 1970s meant dairy producers needed to replace and resize existing milk containers, which were measured in imperial quarts.

When buying milk in plastic bags, consumers have to buy a jug to hold it too. The practice goes as far back as 1969. (CBC News/CBC Archives)

Retrofitting assembly lines or replacing heavy glass bottles was an expensive prospect for the milk industry, and milk bags — which they were already experimenting with — could be easily and cheaply adjusted.

Changing a one-quart bag to a 1.3-litre bag was relatively painless, so three-quart bags of milk quickly became four-litre bags across parts of Canada.

Where my bags at?

Milk bags started to fall out of popularity in many parts of the country as the hard plastic used for things like large jugs became cheaper.

Plus, in the 1980s, Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government relaxed rules on metric measurements.

This combination helped market forces take hold, and milk jugs slowly became more popular in areas of the country.

""I think the shift took place less as a result of a movement away from plastic bags, and more the attraction of rigid milk jugs,"" said Dan Wong, president of the Western Dairy Council.

Eventually milk bags became unheard of in provinces like Alberta or British Columbia.

Why the bag for Ontario?

Ontario has remained an exception.

For decades, regulations in Ontario restricted the sale of more than one pint or about 473 millilitres of milk in containers other than plastic film pouches (aka bags), laminated containers or coated paper containers (such as Tetra Paks).

""I think it was a historical regulation that stemmed back to the days when plastic jugs were very rare in the marketplace,"" said Dan Wong.

To sell milk in four-litre hard plastic jugs, a retailer or producer had to implement a deposit or recycling system for those products and some stores, such as the Becker Milk Company, did so. Consumers could buy milk jugs at those retailers if they paid a deposit for the jug at the store.

Stunned by the size of these giant milk bags sold in supermarkets in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Canada?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Canada</a>! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/milk?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#milk</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/travel?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#travel</a> <a href=""https://t.co/HDVKVDicqo"">pic.twitter.com/HDVKVDicqo</a> —@carolchan9394

Bags did not have this restriction, so mainstream grocery stores and milk producers stuck to the bags for the most part. This explains why Ontario grocers almost exclusively provided large quantities of milk in bags.

In other markets such as Quebec or Nova Scotia, bags and jugs have co-existed for years based on demand.

The Ontario regulation was amended in mid-2018, but consumer habits can take decades to break, so expect to keep seeing white, jiggly milk bags at your local grocery store for years to come. At least in Ontario.

Previously', 'Cbc News', 'Posted']",,"As recreational sports gradually resume across Ontario, organizers say they're taking the necessary steps to keep players safe. But do the strict new measures go far enough?

Brockville Braves coach Gene Falsetto, whose players are 15 to 20, said COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the way he runs the organization. Falsetto had to write to Hockey Canada and Hockey Eastern Ontario to outline the steps he would take to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, in dressing rooms and on the ice, before his team could meet up last week.

He said both the players and their parents, who aren't yet allowed into the arena, are more than happy to comply with the new rules if it means getting back to the game they love.

""They want to see things succeed,"" he said. ""They're ecstatic, and so am I.""

Among the many new rules: only nine players are allowed on the ice at a time during two 60-minute practices each week; the focus is on skill development, and no contact between players is allowed; and water bottles must be placed two metres apart.

""I think being able to have a smaller group and being able to control that smaller group is much easier for coaches, for players, and I think it helps the parents ease their minds as well,"" Falsetto said.

Dressing rooms are for putting on helmets, gloves and skates only. That means players must arrive at the rink mostly dressed, like when they were little. Even then, Falsetto tries to keep the number of players in the room at any one time to four or five.

Soccer also making a comeback

Many of the new rules being adopted by recreational soccer clubs mirror those in hockey.

""There is a consumer confidence right now that's very low, hence why it's very important that you have safety and protocols demonstrated in a graduated way,"" said Johnny Misley, CEO of Ontario Soccer, which has set out a three-phase plan to return to competitive play in the province.

Currently, all Ottawa clubs are still in Phase 1 of the plan, and have been since June 12. Players practise in groups of about four that have been told to stick together. For now, they stay two metres apart, even in their groups.

""It's good for the community, it's good for society and it's a nice way to ease back into normalcy,"" Misley said. ""We're contributing to good mental health, and that's a huge concern right now.""

Like hockey, it's unclear yet when games will resume. Misley said the rules will progress in lockstep with the province.

Weigh the risks, expert advises

While players may be champing at the bit to get back to regular competition, Dr. Gerald Evans, medical director of infection prevention and control at Kingston Heath Sciences Centre, says they and their parents should weigh the benefits against the potential costs.

In recent months, professional baseball and hockey players, along with golfers and other athletes, have tested positive for COVID-19, and Evans said that shows there may be something about group exercise that allows the respiratory illness to spread. When that transmission is occurring is harder to nail down, however.

""The part that's hard to sort out is what part of it is the actual sport and what part of it is the social activities that occur around sports. That's a bit of an unknown,"" he said.

""We know that congregating in change rooms, from lessons in health care, is a particularly vulnerable time when transmission can occur.""

Athletes produce more respiratory droplets when they're exerting themselves, and it's difficult to engage in aerobic activity while wearing a face mask, Evans pointed out.

""You've got to balance it. At the moment, as we're trying to get on top of this disease, is it worth the risk?"" he asked. ""There's nothing wrong with having a summer off where all you do is go swimming and hanging out in your backyard and not do anything else.""",[]

Claim to fame

When COVID-19 restrictions started, Zev decided he had to get out of the house.

That’s when he decided that instead of getting a ride to his summer job with Churchill River Canoe Outfitters in Missinipe, Sask., he would canoe there.

Zev managed to reach his final destination on June 29, after 59 days in the wilderness.

While Zev’s dad and some friends joined him for part of the trip, he covered much of the more than 2,000-kilometre distance alone.

Well, not totally alone.

His dog, Blaze, remained by his side from start to finish.

Zev said his canine co-adventurer, Blaze, barely whined, even when he had to be on board the boat all day. (Image submitted by: Karsten Heuer)

""I was on my own and hadn't really been on my own before. Everything kind of felt a little bit careful and cautious and kind of like holding your breath."" - Zev Heuer

Zev, who has been canoe tripping with his parents since he was a baby, said he feels “super comfortable” in a canoe.

Still, travelling solo meant he had to learn to look after himself — and his gear.

Zev had to do more than paddle his canoe — he also had to pull and carry it. (Image submitted by: Karsten Heuer)

Once, he had to wade out into waist-deep water to catch his boat before it drifted downstream, after forgetting to secure it on shore.

Lessons learned

As he prepares to start his summer job — and the next phase of his life — Zev said he now feels better prepared to deal with whatever challenges might come his way.

Zev said getting through some tough portages helped build his confidence that he can get through other challenges in life. (Image submitted by: Karsten Heuer)

No matter what the obstacle might be, he said, you can always compare it to a difficult portage — when you have to carry your canoe over tough terrain.

“You can say, 'Oh this is nothing,’” Zev said. “'I can do this.'”

After arriving at his summer job site in style, Zev will spend the next two months working at an outfitter shop for canoe trippers.

Then it’s back to school in September.

He Has Covered Ballet', 'Film', 'Most Recently Health Sciences Research.', 'Matthew Pariselli Is A Writer', 'For Cbc Sports', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et']",,"Over the course of her eight years as a swimmer on Canada's national team, Martha McCabe estimates she had at least 10 teammates who identified as LGBTQ+.

She says there were probably 30 to 40 members of the community competing during her time swimming at the university level.

At her first Olympics in 2012, she marched into London's Olympic Stadium alongside Mark Tewksbury, an Olympic champion swimmer and a vocal advocate for gay rights since coming out publicly in 1998.

But what McCabe noticed was that none of the LGBTQ+ swimmers she knew was a woman. And that lack of a visible role model played a part in preventing her from recognizing her own sexuality.

""For me, swimming was the world,"" the 30-year-old two-time Olympian said. ""Sure, I probably knew a couple of lesbians outside of swimming, but I was barely paying attention to my life outside of swimming.

""The people I looked up to were in swimming. The people I was constantly surrounded by and giving my full attention to were in swimming. I think if there was an out lesbian within that circle, someone I could have potentially looked up to, it would have been normalized a little bit more.

WATCH | CBC Sports panel details challenges of being LGBTQ+ in sports today:

CBC Sports panellists Devin Heroux, Erin McLeod, Wade Davis and Anastasia Bucsis explain why this year's Pride demands tough conversations about the intersectionality of class, sex, race and ability. 54:01

""I think because there haven't really been any superstars in the sport publicly come out as lesbian and advocate for women in the LGBTQ+ space, it makes it more challenging to realize these things about yourself,"" she said.

McCabe is fresh off her first Pride Month as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. The world championship and Pan Am Games medallist is coming out publicly in the hopes of inspiring other young athletes and increasing LGBTQ+ representation in swimming, specifically on the women's side, where she says it is severely lacking.

""I want to be an example to young female swimmers and help ones who are struggling with this, so they can see it's normal,"" said McCabe, who specialized in the 200-metre breaststroke and placed fifth in the London 2012 Olympics. ""Parents also need to recognize that this needs to be normalized. Kids don't see this everywhere, and when you don't see it, it becomes this hurdle you have to get over.""

It wasn't a hurdle McCabe confronted during her career; it was after she hung up her swimsuit that she explored her sexuality. She says she was never attracted to women throughout her years in the pool, but admits it would have been helpful — and could have changed her trajectory — if she knew out women in swimming when she competed.

""I think because I didn't see it in people I looked up to, the thought never crossed my mind. I didn't question the norms society had built around me because I didn't even realize there was something to question,"" she said.

I want to be an example to young female swimmers and help ones who are struggling with this, so they can see it's normal. - Martha McCabe

Tewksbury agrees that knowing LGBTQ+ women in the sport could have benefited McCabe.

""Obviously Martha is not the first one. I even know of women who were members of the community, but very private about it,"" said Tewksbury, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics and was Canada's chef de mission at the London Olympics in 2012. ""I'm realizing how unfortunate that is. Even some Olympic medallists, I think they could have been really good role models for Martha.

""This is so important, Martha sharing her story. I don't know how many women have ever been on the national team and have publicly identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community before. It's great; it starts a whole different level of conversation, hopefully in places across the country that need it.""

Coming out to family and friends isn't a painless process for every LGBTQ+ person, but it has been for McCabe, a Canmore, Alta. resident originally from Toronto. She says she has only received love and support from those closest to her, for which she is thankful.

McCabe emphasizes the importance of coming out, especially in the sporting arena where she says it doesn't happen enough.

""Young people need to be able to see themselves in the people they look up to,"" she said. ""We need minority voices from different races, sexualities, gender identities, etc. — people bold enough to speak out, to share and to be themselves publicly so that younger generations can see they are not alone, and that you can be successful despite your differences,"" she said.

Inclusivity is crucial to McCabe. It's a component of her own public speaking engagements and is championed through Head to Head, a mentorship company she founded after retiring from swimming that connects youth with Olympians. She said inclusion is a topic Olympians are encouraged to discuss, with the goal of helping young people build inclusive environments in all the spaces they occupy.

McCabe urges LGBTQ+ people and allies to show their support, which can mean pasting a rainbow flag to a window or donning a rainbow sticker on a shoe. It can also entail participating in Pride, which McCabe did when she marched with the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) in Toronto's 2019 Pride parade and which she and her girlfriend celebrated online this year due to COVID-19.

""I was single for a long time, and although I never felt lonely or like I was missing anything, I'm now very grateful and happy to have a partner who I really want to spend time enjoying all of life's activities with,"" she said.

This year's Pride Month was a factor in McCabe's choice to come out publicly.

""Seeing more and more high-profile athletes speak about the importance of coming out publicly throughout Pride Month made me realize that even though my experience has been pretty seamless, it is not the case for many young people. These young people need role models both for themselves and for the people around them to see that if you're currently not accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, you need to further educate yourself, make sure you understand the meaning behind your words and the way you support others.""

A high-profile athlete who perhaps didn't understand the meaning behind his words this past Pride Month was Christion Jones, a former wide receiver for the Edmonton Eskimos. On June 27 — Global Pride Day — Jones tweeted his opposition to gay and lesbian relationships. Further, he defended his homophobic stance in more than 50 follow-up posts.

Jones has since apologized, but he was released by the team. The Canadian Football League followed by issuing a statement asserting that it strives to be inclusive and that there is no place in the league for disparaging commentary on the basis of religion, race, gender or sexual orientation.

McCabe, who does not agree with Jones' tweets, says the incident highlights a lack of LGBTQ+ education and awareness.

""This, to me, is an issue with more than just one person,"" she said. ""This means education systems, sports organizations and companies need to prioritize this type of learning to make sure all stakeholders have the tools they need to be positive role models and good members of society.

""For me, this is tied to the importance of athlete representation in the LGBTQ+ community. The more out role models we have, the more society will see and understand that this is real and around all of us. The more everyone sees somebody they know, love or see as successful come out, the more acceptance there will be because it will be put in their own life context for them.""

Pride is about authenticity to McCabe, but it's also an opportunity to tell stories typically untold, with the hope that they're given a platform more regularly.

Tewksbury, a director of the COC, said, ""There's a whole bunch of social unrest and change happening. I think one of the things I'm really seeing is the importance of amplifying different voices, listening to people's stories and having dialogue.""

""Young kids need to see this and hear these stories,"" McCabe said. ""I think it's critical for parents to openly talk about their support for the LGBTQ+ community, to watch LGBTQ+ movies and shows and to share LGBTQ+ articles and stories with their kids. If you're not doing that, your inaction is further supporting the fact that being heterosexual is 'normal.'""",[]

Unfortunately, for some marriages during COVID-19, the pandemic has forced a divide. Around the world, divorce rates are increasing.

In China, marriage registration offices saw an unprecedented number of divorce requests when they re-opened in March. Italian lawyers report a 30 per cent increase in the number of couples embarking on divorce proceedings.

The trend of 'COVID divorce' is also showing up in Canada.

It's no wonder relationships are suffering. COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on our emotional and mental well-being. We've been living with health-related stress for months and add to that a lack of financial security and too much time on our hands, it's pushing relationships to the edge.

Social isolation has been hard on couples that are not used to spending this much time together and a lack of outside time to regroup from arguments or stress can take its toll.

But that doesn't mean it has to be over. There are some ways people can take stock of their relationship and make changes if they're motivated to do so.

Is it COVID's fault?

Some may wonder, why the increase in divorce? Isn't it just the pandemic that's making our relationships harder? And the answer to that is complex.

It's playing a role, but it isn't the only reason, particularly for couples who are already dealing with marital problems. Those problems can become highly exaggerated when another major stressor enters the picture.

But the pandemic has been atypically challenging because of the lockdown component. Couples may have already been arguing more frequently, or they've been growing apart and emotionally disconnected from each other and then suddenly they're forced to spend so much time together without a way to escape. The physical proximity can overwhelm couples.

Another issue is the shared responsibility of household duties — often an issue even without a pandemic. New research shows women are working 20 more hours per week to balance family and work obligations. In general people are working 30 per cent more hours in the day to accomplish the same pre-pandemic goals.

This workplace burnout is causing significant stress at home. Add to that, financial stress which happens to be one of the top reasons couples get divorced and there you have it — a recipe for the breakdown of a marriage already on the brink.

People change in a crisis

When we face a major emotional event, particularly one of this magnitude, it forces us to take stock of our lives. We feel the limitations we have on time and our own mortality and that can speed up decisions, particularly about our relationships. Something that seemed acceptable before, may now seem intolerable.

Crises can highlight the disparities in a relationship that won't be fixed after the pandemic is over.

But, for some marriages, the pandemic has created a closeness and a bond that is unlike any time in their history. I've listened to stories of couples who are finally getting time together around the dinner table or one woman who said she finally gets her husband back after years of him travelling for work.

Many relationships are being rekindled for the same reasons others are being divided.

For many of those couples who live somewhere in the middle, this is the time to discuss whether it's the unsustainable stressors of COVID that is taking their marriage off course or if it's more than that. If it's something more, this would be a good time to get virtual access to counselling. Recognizing that this is an intensely challenging time, counselling can help generate a compassion and empathy reset.

If it's the former, and you're a couple looking to find a healthy way back, there are ways to work on and revive your relationships.

The most notable researchers, like Dr. John Gottman from the Gottman Institute and author of How to Make Love Last, believes that it is about figuring out how to really fall in love with your partner's qualities again.

Typically, after the honeymoon phase ends, we fall into what psychologists call the partnership phase. This is considered healthy because it's much more sustainable than the passion-driven highs and lows of those first years. But we can fall into ruts and forget why we loved that person in the first place. The qualities and quirks that we used to love about our partner has over time, become irritating and frustrating. When that happens, we stop admiring and respecting those behaviours and actions.

Recreate the spark

One of the ways to revive that part of the relationship is to make your relationship novel again, like how it was in the honeymoon phase.

New or novel experiences elicit a high level of neurotransmitter activity in the brain. When you engage in new experiences with your partner, feelings similar to those you both experienced when you were initially dating can become activated. This happens because dopamine and norepinephrine levels — our brain's reward system – tend to increase dramatically when you engage in new experiences.

I've had people say, well what can I do? Even in a pandemic, there are plenty of things we can still do that is novel. Couples therapist Dr. Brian Gersho suggests people be creative, cast a wide net, and don't hold back.

For example:

Try a new hobby, craft, or skill.

Play a new sport.

Take musical instrument lessons together.

Enjoy outdoor recreation activities together such as hiking, fishing, bicycling, etc.

Try to create new food together.

Don't plan anything and see what happens.

Just make sure that these are things that other partner will not despise and flat-out reject. Make sure it's a plan you make together. And, schedule your date nights/outings in advance and allow each partner to take turns planning the activity.

This may seem oversimplified in the middle of everything feeling like it's falling apart around you. I want to make clear that I am not diminishing the pain of divorce or suggesting that a divorce can be fixed with a list of novel ideas. For some, divorce is the right decision for them and their families.",[]

The first time Sonja Wild saw a dolphin using an empty seashell to scoop an unwitting fish into its mouth, she got so excited she almost forgot to photograph it.

This rare and unique hunting technique is called ""shelling"" or ""conching."" A hungry dolphin will chase a hard-to-catch fish into an empty seashell, then ferry the shell to the surface where the dolphin uses its beak to jostle the prey into its mouth.

""Seeing it for the first time was just a 'wow' moment because you do not expect a shell popping up right next to the boat that is being carried by a dolphin. You kind of, like, drop everything,"" said Wild, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Konstanz and the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany.

""I was definitely mind-blown,"" she told As It Happens guest host Duncan McCue.

Wild is the lead author of a new study in the journal Current Biology that documents how conching has spread through dolphin populations as the clever creatures teach each other how to do it.

Scientists have observed instances of conching going back at least 10 years, though it has always been a rare sight.

Wild says there was a major uptick in sightings in Shark Bay, off the coast of Western Australia, after a 2011 marine heat wave killed off a large number of sea snails, leaving their shells ripe for the picking.

Wild and her colleagues have been observing the Shark Bay dolphins for years, mapping their social and genetic relationships. Between 2007 and 2018, they identified 1,000 individual dolphins and saw 19 of them engage in conching 42 times.

While conching still appears to be quite rare, Wild says all the dolphins who do it know each other.

While analyzing their population data, the researchers found that conching spreads horizontally within dolphin generations, meaning from peer to peer, as opposed to vertically, from mother to calf.

""That is indeed quite special because dolphins normally rely very much on their mothers for foraging behaviour,"" Wild said.

""And we're now showing for the first time that they are, indeed, capable of learning foraging behaviour outside of the mother-calf bond.""

Janet Mann, a dolphin researcher at Georgetown University who wasn't involved in the study, told the New York Times it's impossible to say definitively that peer imitation is the only way dolphins learn about conching, noting we've ""barely scratched the water's surface"" when it comes to understanding the behaviour.

Wild agrees.

""It is very much possible that some dolphins may have learned this by themselves, by just interacting with their shells and then by accident kind of lifting them above the surface,"" she said.

She says it's possible, too, that some dolphins are passing the skill down to their young. But her team's models ""clearly show that the majority have learned from their peers.""

Why do they do it?

Wild says she's not sure why dolphins use shells to trap and eat fish.

She says they are very playful creatures, and it could be as simple as ""just a little bit of fun to get your meal in a different way than usual.""

But whatever their motivation, it proves they can adapt to a changing environment and pick up new skills — an ability that could help them survive as climate change alters ocean populations and makes food more scarce, she said.

Wild has been studying the dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia, for years. (Sonja Wild/Dolphin Innovation Project)

""Learning from your mother is very useful in kind of stable environments that don't change, because the parental behaviour is tested and stable and adapted to the environment. But as soon as the environment changes, the behaviour may become outdated or inefficient or even maladaptive,"" Wild said.

""And in that case, it's beneficial if you start looking around to see what other dolphins are doing.""

'Humans are not the only ones with culture'

Picking up new tricks from friends is rare in the animal kingdom, Wild said. It's a form of learning that's usually only observed in primates, including apes, chimpanzees and, of course, humans.

""It certainly helps to understand their intelligence by knowing that they are capable of innovating such remarkable behaviour, but it also helps us to understand that dolphin societies are maybe not that different from us humans,"" Wild said.

""They have very complex social relationships. They use tools. They are able to learn to use tools from one another. So it kind of helps our understanding that humans are not the only ones with culture.""

The Raptors, who'd been based in Naples, Fla., for the past two weeks, but limited in practice to one player per hoop, took the floor for the first time Saturday at Walt Disney World for the NBA's restart after the team passed its COVID-19 tests.

It felt partly like the first day of training camp, they said. But also a little like the NBA champions had never been apart.

""For the most part it was really good . . . the trust factor really, really showed up,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""A lot of guys are doing a lot of things that we normally do, just right from the get-go here which was great.

And we back, and we back, and we back. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WeTheNorth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/vhFhpWRrOL"">pic.twitter.com/vhFhpWRrOL</a> —@Raptors

""Obviously there was some rust and some things that stick out that you have to keep an eye on, or that we're going to have to change, but from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us.""

The defending NBA champions made the two-hour trip from Naples on Thursday in style, pulling into Disney World in two black buses that, unique to the Raptors, had ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in huge white block letters.

They were immediately tested upon arrival in the NBA semi-bubble, which is home to 22 teams. They were tested again at 7 p.m. local time on Friday, then got the all-clear Saturday at 10 a.m.

Nurse said the testing protocol has become the new normal.

""I think the first couple times we did it here and certainly going way back to March 11 (the day the league suspended play), when we went off and got tested, your level of anxiety was a lot higher then for sure,"" Nurse said. ""But I think it's always: cross your fingers, knock on wood, good thoughts, all that stuff every time.""

The Raptors, who tip off the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, could be at Disney World for the next three months. Nurse packed his guitar. Marc Gasol arrived with his own Nespresso coffee machine. The players checked into rooms decorated with family photos — courtesy of Raptors staff.

'I miss playing basketball'

Pascal Siakam said he spent the 36 hours of hotel quarantine playing video games, and thinking about ""being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team.

""We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere, and that's all I really care about.""

Mask On <a href=""https://t.co/neUWDUTcA8"">pic.twitter.com/neUWDUTcA8</a> —@Raptors

Nurse said he felt his way through the first practice he'd coached in four months.

""I had some thoughts about what the structure of the practice would look like and we did it totally different than we normally would,"" he said. ""Again just based on the situation I think it's important for us to play, but I also think it's important to kind of ease in or taper in a little bit because we're conscious of health in general.""

The coach, who'd raved last week about the fitness level of his players, went heavier than he'd expected to, and ""I just told the guys to please self-monitor and let's not let's not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.""

Siakam said while there was some rust, the Raptors, who were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shut down, were all excited to be back on the floor together.

""That's what you wanna see, you wanna see people wanting to play,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how long you were off, once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that's what you wanna see from a team.""

'Long way to go'

Fred VanVleet said there was a ""first day of school type"" feeling for the entire team.

""We've got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we've still got a long way to go,"" the guard said.

In Naples, the Raptors hadn't left the hotel grounds except for practice. They had gotten in a few rounds of golf and tennis games on the hotel grounds.

Siakam got a new appreciation for tennis.

""I love tennis. I watch tennis all the time. Even back home, I used to watch tennis a lot,"" he said. ""I thought it was fairly easy to be honest until I got there. They're definitely some tough athletes in the things that they do. I definitely respect it more. It's hard. I don't think it's for me. Marc is pretty good, actually. I feel like Marc is definitely the best that I have seen play.""

The Raptors will have a chance to explore their new digs in the next few days.

Good couple weeks training in Naples. Ready for the bubble!! <a href=""https://t.co/9IVHuT9Ge6"">pic.twitter.com/9IVHuT9Ge6</a> —@Theiceman_21

""I think there will be a little bit more stuff for us to do as time goes by, and everybody gets tested and safe and locked in, I think we'll have more things to do,"" VanVleet said.

Florida has been ravaged by COVID-19 in the past few weeks. The Sunshine State has topped 250,000 cases with about 10,300 new cases reported on Saturday.

VanVleet said there's a greater sense of safety in the NBA bubble.

""When we were in Naples, we couldn't control everybody else,"" he said. ""I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that's probably the biggest difference.""",[]

81,cbc,http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tenino-covid-economy-1.5643409,U.S. town prints its own wooden money in move to revive local economy sickened by COVID-19,"['Thomson Reuters', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Tucked away under lock and key in a former railroad depot turned small-town museum in the U.S. state of Washington, a wooden printing press cranked back to life to mint currency after nearly 90 dormant years.

The end product: $25 US wooden bills bearing the town's name — Tenino — with the words ""COVID Relief"" superimposed on the image of a bat and the Latin phrase ""Habemus autem sub potestate"" (We have it under control) printed in cursive.

With the coronavirus pandemic plunging the United States into a recession, decimating small businesses and causing job losses across the country, some local governments are looking for innovative ways to help residents weather the storm.

For Tenino, the answer was the revival of the local currency that had bolstered the town's economy in 1931 in the wake of the Great Depression.

""It was kind of an epiphany: Why don't we do that again?"" Mayor Wayne Fournier told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It only made sense.""

Tenino, a town of less than 2,000 people located about 95 kilometres southwest of Seattle, started printing the local banknotes in April, five weeks into Washington state's lockdown.

$300 a month per person

Anyone with a documented loss of income as a result of the pandemic is eligible for up to $300 US a month of the local currency.

Businesses up and down the town's quaint Main Street accept the wooden note for everything except alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and lottery tickets.

Tenino's city government backs the local currency, which merchants can exchange for U.S. dollars at city hall at a 1:1 rate.

Susan Witt, executive director of the Schumacher Center for a New Economics, a Massachusetts-based think tank, said alternative currencies like Tenino's banknote are better than direct cash payments at boosting local economies.

""The City of Barcelona gave donations (in 2017/18) to sports teams and cultural groups as well as social programs (then) watched these donations go to big box stores,"" she said in emailed comments.

""So, it created a local currency so that these 'discretionary' funds in its budget would circle back to support locally-owned businesses.""

Old idea

Mayor Fournier noted that, for long-time Tenino residents, the wooden notes are nothing new.

The tiny town founded around a sandstone quarry achieved national prominence in 1931 when civic leaders printed a wooden local currency to restore consumer confidence after the town's bank failed during the Great Depression.

""This is woven into the DNA of the community,"" Fournier said. ""My great aunt Erlene has the family collection all stashed away.""

The mayor brought the idea of resurrecting the town's legacy project to the city council as a way to provide economic relief to businesses and residents suffering as a result of lockdown measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.

In April councilors approved the proposal to issue up to $10,000 in local scrip.

So far, 13 residents have successfully applied for the funds and some $2,500 worth of wooden bills have been issued, Fournier said, with donations upping the total funds available to $16,000.

The town prints the money on a printing press that dates from the 19th Century. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press)

Fournier views the project as the kind of initiative towns and small cities must take upon themselves to survive the coronavirus outbreak amid what he views as an inadequate federal response.

He pointed out that the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a fund of forgivable loans designed to keep businesses afloat through the pandemic, is not scaled for the businesses in Tenino that have just a handful of employees.

""A federal program dumps money from the top and these blue-chip companies steal it all,"" Fournier said. ""If we do it from the ground up, there's no stealing. It's a direct ballast to Main Street.""

From the outset, the unprecedented first-come-first-served program struggled with technology and paperwork problems that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds they did not necessarily need.

""From mom-and-pop shops on Main Street to local employers who are anchors in our community, we have seen the PPP save millions of jobs and keep small firms moving forward,"" said Jeremy Field, the regional administrator for the Small Business Administration, which oversees the program.

He noted in emailed comments that 86.5% of loans granted nationally were for less than $150,000 and that the program covered almost three-quarters of the small business payroll in Washington state.

'Hacking the system'

Fournier said he has already fielded queries from towns across the country looking to emulate Tenino's effort.

""What if 5,000 other small cities did that same thing and took it upon themselves to put $10,000 into Main Street?"" he asked.

""That's $50 million US directly into small businesses. It totally hacks the system.""

So far, however, Tenino's currency does not appear to be circulating much among local businesses.

At the grocery and hardware store that anchors Main Street, manager Chris Hamilton said that by mid-June customers had spent $150 US in the local bills to buy necessities like groceries and a new faucet to replace a broken tap.

""I'll redeem it for cash at city hall,"" he said. ""I hadn't thought about recirculating it.""

Next door at Don Juan's Mexican Kitchen, owner Juan Martinez Jr. has four of the wooden $25 notes sitting in his cash register.

In a case of history repeating, he said coin collectors have offered to buy the bills from him for double their value in U.S. dollars.

Back in the 1930s, coin collectors fueled a speculative rise in the value of the town's wooden scrip, according to Washington state online encyclopedia HistoryLink.

50 local currencies currently in use

The Schumacher Center for a New Economics has documented more than 50 local alternative currencies globally that were active as of summer 2019.

They range from the artfully designed Brixton Pound in London, England, to the Mumbuca, which bankrolls the basic income scheme in Marica, Brazil.

The centre also sponsors BerkShares, a local currency that has been circulating in the Berkshire region of western Massachusetts for 14 years.

Witt cautions that notes backed by U.S. dollars are only a halfway measure, because the amount of local currency available is limited by the amount of federal dollars the town has on hand to exchange it with.

""A truly independent currency would allow for issuing currency as needed,"" she said.

That ""new"" money would circulate through the local economy and then eventually go toward paying property taxes over the course of several years, she added.

But, for now, Witt said, Tenino's project is an effective way to empower a community being brought to its knees by factors beyond its control.

""I don't believe the good people of Tenino meant for their wooden (banknotes) to serve as a robust local currency,"" she said.

""They are instead making an important point. COVID and the lack of federal response to the crisis has motivated municipalities to explore what could be done with their own currencies.""",[]

Over the course of the summer, we'll be highlighting some of the individual performances that were included in the cabaret.

Teiya Kasahara 笠原貞野 is a true treasure of our queer world, and it was an absolute honour for us to have them included in CBC Arts Presents Queer Pride Inside: A Buddies in Bad Times Cabaret. A queer, gender non-binary, multidisciplinary performer and creator, Kasahara comes from a background of over a decade of singing both traditional and contemporary operatic roles across North America and Europe. They were most recently praised as ""a force of nature"" by the Toronto Star and ""an artist with extraordinary things to say"" by The Globe and Mail.

Kasahara combines opera, theatre and taiko in their artistic practice and co-founded Amplified Opera, a new initiative which is bringing an injection of inclusivity to Toronto's opera community, with their recent inaugural concert series AMPLIFY highlighting stories of international equity-seeking artists.

Teiya's original work The Queen in Me is planned to premiere in Toronto once theatres reopen following the COVID-19 global pandemic, and it was an except from that show that they performed for Queer Pride Inside — from a Toronto rooftop, no less. In the performance, Kasahara takes inspiration from their career in opera, alongside their lived experience as a queer, biracial, non-binary artist, to re-imagine the Queen of the Night, one of opera's most infamous fallen women. They also took the opportunity to address unrest both in the operatic community and the world in general.

""We are in a critical time right now,"" Teiya says as they introduce the piece. ""It would be remiss of me to not use this platform to especially call out the systemic racism and violence by Black and Indigenous friends and colleagues face every day in the operatic community and in their lives at large. This excerpt from The Queen In Me is my callout to the opera industry and the world.""

Ashley Singh says her toddler, Drake, left for a 45-day stay with his grandparents at the beginning of March, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Now, after nearly four months, she's wondering when she'll be able to see her son again.

At the time he left with her in-laws, she said they didn't know COVID-19 would become a widespread pandemic that would close borders and ground flights around the world.

Drake was supposed to return to Canada with his grandparents in April, but all of their flights have been cancelled.

Finally, they were booked on a Lufthansa flight set to leave New Delhi on July 7. But when they went to check in, the airline wouldn't let them through, despite having all the necessary paperwork to fly, Singh said.

According to the federal government's website, Canadian citizens and immediate family members of Canadian citizens or permanent residents are allowed to enter Canada during the pandemic.

'We don't understand'

Singh said her in-laws brought several documents along to show that they were family members, including her son's birth certificate, her marriage certificate, and a letter from her saying they were his grandparents. Singh said the agents didn't even look at the paperwork that her in-laws tried to provide.

""They just saw that my in-laws have Indian passports and they're like, 'nope, you can't fly, you're not allowed,'"" she said.

""We don't understand. If they meet all of the criteria, why were they turned away?""

She said she's contacted everyone she can think of from the airline and different government agencies to try to figure out why they weren't allowed on the plane and ask for help getting her son home, but says she feels like her pleas are falling on deaf ears.

""Excuse my language, but what the hell am I supposed to do?"" she said.

""When you talk to people … like the airlines and stuff, they try to be empathetic. But at the same time you can kind of tell that they're like, 'Don't really care. It's not my problem, not my kid. Too bad for you.'""

Airline looking into matter

Tal Muscal, Lufthansa's director of communications for the Americas, said this is the first he has heard of the Singhs' situation and he will investigate the matter with his colleagues in India.

""We of course are all eager to reunite Drake with his family,"" he said, but the airline needs ""more information to understand why he and his grandparents were not able to board their flight.""

A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said that while they couldn't comment on specific incidents due to privacy concerns, the department is doing everything it can to help Canadians stranded in India under these ""unprecedented circumstances.""

However, the spokesperson said flights that aren't organized by the High Commission of Canada in India are subject to the boarding rules and eligibility requirements of the airline and local authorities, not the government of Canada.

Though passengers do not require authorization from the embassy to take any relief flights, they are responsible for verifying their eligibility to travel through other countries.

Singh said her in-laws had lived with her and her husband and helped take care of their son before, and thought Drake's 45-day stay would be a good experience for them.

She and her husband were also finding it challenging to find child care at the time, and one of them would have had to quit their job in order to take care of him.

""That's mainly why we let Drake go with them, was because we knew that he would be well taken care of, and we didn't really have another choice.""

She said she knows her son is in good hands with his grandparents, but still worries about him being overseas during a pandemic.

""You just never know what could go on in another country, especially overseas. Things can get volatile very fast.""

At this point, she and her husband are trying to book her son and his grandparents on another flight.

Tickets have been very expensive, however, and they're worried about shelling out money for another flight only to have their hopes dashed yet again.",[]

Five of them were fatal. The CBC Docs POV film Above the Law looks at the stories of three individuals who appear to have been the victims of excessive force by Calgary police.

One of them is Godfred Addai-Nyamekye. In December 2013, the then 26-year-old student and immigrant from Ghana, was detained late at night by two police officers who maintain he was intoxicated — a claim Addai-Nyamekye refutes. They put him in a police vehicle and drove him to an isolated location, abandoning him in the cold wearing only a tracksuit and sneakers.

When he called 911 for help, another officer arrived and proceeded to beat and Taser him. Addai-Nyamekye was later charged with having assaulted the officer but was acquitted, in no small part because a Calgary police helicopter captured the violent arrest on video.

After being abandoned by police in a desolate construction site in -28 C weather, Godfred Addai-Nyamekye called 911. After 15 minutes, a different officer, Const. Trevor Lindsay, arrived on the scene, and Addai-Nyamekye was tasered and beaten. Following the incident, Addai-Nyamekye was charged with having assaulted Const. Lindsay, but helicopter footage of the event helped to prove otherwise. 0:54

In 2018, the Calgary Police Service released an independent review on the use of force by Calgary police containing 65 recommendations pertaining to officer recruitment, training, use of force and provincial oversight.

Harpreet Aulakh is an associate professor in economics, justice and policy studies at Mount Royal University in Calgary who studies diversity issues in the criminal justice system. Here, she discusses how policing needs to change in Canada to address issues pertaining to systemic racism and use of force.

Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Harpreet Aulakh, associate professor at Mount Royal University (Lost Time Media)

Why is now a good time to discuss changes in policing?

This is the perfect time to have the conversation around addressing the use of force, around systemic racism. These events have exploded among racialized communities and police forces around the Western world.

It cannot just be a matter of choice, but a matter of necessity for the police departments to address these issues because positive relations between community members and police are essential for safer communities.

What are some of the problems with policing right now?

It has a lot to do with our racist history, our racist past. The history of our country was based on racism, including the foundations of policing in Canada.

The whole philosophy around policing strategies needs to change because the traditional practices have damaged the police–community relationship. These policies are enforced in low-income and high-crime neighbourhoods, which are more likely to be inhabited by ethnic minorities.

Traditional policing strategies provide incentives for the officers and are designed to reward officers for the number of stops conducted, arrests made, [the] number of civilian contact cards completed. And these interactions increase the negative contact with the residents.

Even a very non-violent, non-confrontational interaction with the police officer and a racial minority member could be perceived under the anxiety that, ""Am I being singled out?"" Even if the right police officer is being unbiased, he would have that anxiousness in mind, ""Will I be judged a racist?"" These tensions need to be resolved.

What changes need to be made to policing?

If we want to change the whole policing strategy, we need to change it in practical ways. The officer should be aligned with the cause of increasing trust and positive engagement with the community.

For example, there should be incentives for how many young offenders were diverted away from the justice system. Or whether the police officers engage with the community members and how many positive, constructive relationships are built. The number of times they were able to resolve a situation without an arrest. Those things should be built into policing itself.

What new skills do officers need to make these changes?

There needs to be a harsh look at all the major branches of the department right from [the start in terms of] education criteria, skills requirements, [recruits'] age and experience.

In many countries in Europe, they look for at least an undergraduate degree. Education is important for applicants in understanding how society works. Think about [the fact that] you can be in the police force just after grade 12. How much experience do you have?

We need to look at the qualifications of the recruits, our skill requirements, our training programs. There should be a mandatory communications skills training program, and year after year, [officers] should be developing their skill sets.

If we expect to not use force or use force less — and also increase the use of verbal communication [in] resolving the situation — then we need to equip them with those skills.

Everything should be on the table for open discussion. This is the time to set the tone for job culture in the department.

Are there any concrete examples of police departments that have successfully changed their relationship with their community?



There is a small police department in California, Stockton PD . What they do is they involve community members in some of their training. They talk about the local history of police with racialized members of the community, and they give local incidents of police brutality from the community perspective.

When do you think change will happen?

I want to be hopeful. This is the perfect time. If we get good command and leadership in different levels of the police departments, I think they have a chance. Change is slow, but it has to happen.

But this week also happens to be McCue's last at the helm of Checkup — for a while, at least.

Following a summer break from the show, McCue is taking an eight-month leave to join four other journalists for Massey College's William Southam Journalism Fellowship. CBC Radio Fresh Air host Nana aba Duncan is also part of this year's cohort.

As part of an ""exit interview"" of sorts, Ram spoke to McCue about his plans to study the Anishinaabemowin language for the fellowship. Here is part of their conversation.

So first of all, I want to thank you for inviting me here on Cross Country Checkup. It's an honour to be a part of a historic show for CBC. Can you tell me a bit about your career as a radio host?

I've been a TV reporter for most of my career. I started out in television news in the [CBC] Vancouver newsroom, became a current affairs reporter for The National, and that's where I spent most of my career.

But four years ago, I got an opportunity to sit in the chair here at Cross Country Checkup. I decided I'd apply, and here I am.

You know, this show is older than me. And so, it was a real surprise when I when I got the job. And it's just such a real pleasure for me to be talking to Canadians every Sunday.

Taking time to pause, reflect, learn- it’s important.<br><br>Got some news to share. I’ll be on sabbatical next year, so I can devote more time to studying Anishinaabemowin. Thankful to <a href=""https://twitter.com/MasseyCollege?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@MasseyCollege</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/UofT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@UofT</a> for making space to do that & opportunity to connect with other amazing Fellows <a href=""https://t.co/8ZJ3ITsRJ5"">https://t.co/8ZJ3ITsRJ5</a> —@duncanmccue

Did you ever think, when sitting in your first episode of you hosting Cross Country Checkup, that you would ever be a radio host? Like, hosting your own radio show?

There are so many venerable and respected young people who have been on the CBC Radio airwaves over the years. You know, whether it's Peter Gzowski or Barbara Frum, and the list just goes on and on of people that I grew up listening to.

So for me to be on the CBC Radio airwaves, I need to pinch myself every once in a while and remind myself that I get to be part of the national conversation. I just feel very lucky and very privileged to be able to do that.

I understand you'll be leaving Cross Country Checkup — only for [about] a year, don't worry — to go study at Massey College, because you've received the prestigious Massey Fellowship award. So congratulations. That's amazing.

Thank you.

How were you feeling when they announced that you would be receiving this award?

It's not easy to step away from the mic, Arjun. Honestly, I really enjoy my job, and I had to think long and hard about taking eight months off.

But ... I really am looking forward to a chance to take a break and have a think about the things that I really care about. And so what I want to study at U of T is the Anishinaabemowin. It's the Ojibway language.

I am from the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, and my grandparents spoke fluent Anishinaabemowin.

McCue started attending drop-in Anishinaabemowin classes at the Native Canadian Centre in Toronto three years ago. (Duncan McCue/CBC)

Unfortunately, they didn't pass it on to my dad or my uncles. And so I don't speak my own language.

[For] the past three years, I've been taking night classes to try to start to learn Anishinaabemowin. And it is my happy place, Arjun. It connects me to my ancestors.

How important is it to connect to your roots, whether it be learning your language or exploring the culture?

It really is. You know, when you look at the place where we live Arjun — Spadina Road is an Anishinaabemowin word, Ishpadinaa. Place names [such as] Mississauga, Oshawa — all of those things are Anishinaabemowin.

And so when I start to learn more about our language, I begin to connect to the way that my ancestors saw the world in a way that I don't when I'm speaking English. It helps me connect to our ceremonies. So that's why it makes me so happy to learn the language.

But also, I go to night classes at the Native Canadian Centre [of Toronto] after a day of work. And I'm tired. And I'm a terrible student, frankly. I don't do my homework.

That's why I want to take a little bit of time when I'm on the Massey Fellowship to be able to really focus on my Anishinaabemowin studies. And hopefully I can get to that next level that I haven't been able to achieve yet.

Anishinaabemowin is one of the many languages that are disappearing due to language suppression in Canada. It's a huge problem for many different languages.

What do you think we should do as Canadians to make sure that different communities are being taught the languages that were once spoken by their ancestors?

There are a couple of things, Arjun. In my Anishinaabemowin class, I'd say it's about 50/50.... There are Indigenous people, but there are lots of non-Indigenous people who are wanting to learn the language so that they can be strong allies, and so that they can understand more about their neighbours.

I think when we start to see street signs, for example, or we start to have schools that are renamed to recognize the original language of this land, I think that's really important as well.

The Spadina Road street sign at Davenport Road in Toronto includes the word Ishpadinaa, which means 'going up the hill.' (Paul Borkwood/CBC)

And I also think that some of these attempts to revitalize Indigenous languages, they need to be supported and they need to be financially supported.

People shouldn't have to do them off the side of their desk. They need to have the resources to put out proper textbooks, and to help students like me learn the language.

And so that's a really important part of the Indigenous languages legislation that the federal government has passed. And the people right across this country who are language keepers, they need to be supported financially, as well as politically.

What do you think about the action Canada has taken in the past few years of… talking about the different communities and the different types of people in schools, and educating them on First Nation[s] ... or different cultures that we've never really seen before or heard about before?

I think of the words of Sen. Murray Sinclair when he was doing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

An awful lot of damage occurred with the residential schools over the years. And Sen. Sinclair said it was education that got us into this mess, with regard to the way that the Indigenous peoples have been treated. And it's education that's going to get us out.

So when I see young people who are learning about the history of residential schools or who are learning more about their First Nation neighbours, then it's encouraging to me.

That, to me, suggests we're on the right path.

I want to thank you. How the tables have turned! We were just talking before, but I finally get to interview you. It's truly an honour.

I am going to be gone for eight months. So maybe you want to throw your name in the hat? Maybe you can host Cross Country Checkup while I'm gone.

Yeah, I'd love to! ... Thank you so much.

Thank you, Arjun.

They also know plenty of hurdles remain.

With the backdrop of a global pandemic and the potential for economic catastrophe just over the horizon, the NHL and the NHL Players' Association announced Friday the two sides had ratified the plan to resume the pandemic-halted season this summer, and agreed to a four-year extension to the collective bargaining agreement through at least September 2026.

Getting hockey back on the ice during these unprecedented times brought together two parties that have previously gone toe-to-toe in bitter labour disputes. The NHL has seen three lockouts during Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner, including one that scratched the entire 2004-05 season.

But in a world where COVID-19's impact will likely be felt for years to come, there was only one reasonable path forward.

""I wouldn't even say it approached a negotiation,"" Bettman said on a video conference call with reporters Saturday. ""It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult and unprecedented situation. And that to get through it, for the good of our constituents and good of the game, and for the good of our fans, we needed to work together.""

WATCH | Outlining NHL's return plan:

The NHL is officially returning to the ice this summer as the league and its players' union ratified an agreement on Friday. 2:19

Fehr, the NHLPA's executive director and former head of Major League Baseball's union, said there was common understanding in the wake of the league's shutdown on March 12.

""No one knew what the future would bring,"" he said. ""This wasn't, and for all practical purposes could not be, normal collective bargaining.""

The extension to the CBA that was previously set to expire in 2022 includes a flat salary cap of US$81.5 million until revenues return to pre-pandemic levels, an agreement to lessen the impact of escrow — which guarantees a 50/50 split of revenues — on players, and opens the door for a return to the Olympics.

In short, it gives the NHL and NHLPA a framework to try and navigate what could be a difficult few years.

""This is probably not something that a lot of people are going to call a perfect agreement,"" Fehr said. ""A lot of people are going to find faults with one thing or another. That's always the case. And I'm pretty sure there's going to be unanticipated events and perhaps even unintended consequences.

""But I do think this agreement meets the challenge.""

Shifting focus to the return, training camps are set to open Monday for 24 teams taking part in the return-to-play plan. Those clubs will then travel to the hub cities of Edmonton and Toronto on July 26 before the games begin to count Aug. 1 with as many as 52 contests in a nine-day stretch.

The 12 clubs from the Western Conference will be located in secure ""bubbles"" away from the general public in the Alberta capital, while the other dozen from the East will do the same in Canada's largest city.

""We're switching from one grind to another,"" Bettman said. ""We've got a lot more work to do.""

That also, somewhat surprisingly, includes ironing out a few final details with the Canadian government.

While the ink on the NHL's return and the CBA extension is still drying, the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs both abruptly cancelled media availabilities scheduled for later Saturday.

That raised some eyebrows, since it was believed everything had already been signed off on.

""We're buttoned down at the provincial level in Ontario and Alberta,"" Bettman said. ""There are still a couple of details that we're just finalizing with the federal government.""

WATCH | NHL's escrow, explained:

Hockey fans hear the word escrow a lot, but do they know what it actually is? Rob Pizzo explains it in simple English. 2:26

Deputy commissioner Bill Day said on the same video call that a spike in novel coronavirus cases in Las Vegas — which had long been viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured — was among the reasons the league eventually decided on two Canadian markets to stage its restart.

""We wanted to pick two hub cities that were really the best from a health and safety standpoint,"" Daly said. ""And we were concerned, given what was happening in Vegas that was not the case there.

""It certainly led into the decision we made.""

While players will be tested daily inside the bubbles, the chance of one or more positive tests remains. The league has said that wouldn't necessarily mean shuttering the restart, and has been vague about what number would constitute an ""uncontrolled outbreak"" as described in its return-to-play protocol.

'There's no hard and fast numbers'

That didn't really change Saturday.

""We look to our medical professionals more than anything else as to whether we're in a high-risk situation,"" Daly said. ""We have to be very cognizant of player health and safety. If we have an outbreak situation, it turns into a different judgment at the end of the day. There's no hard and fast numbers.""

After 142 days on the sidelines, the NHL is on course to return at the start of next month — on a Saturday, no less.

Still outstanding is the league and its players resolving issues such as health insurance, travel costs and marketing rights with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Earlier this week, IIHF president Rene Fasel didn't foresee major stumbling blocks in reaching an agreement ahead of the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.

""We believe the negatives outweigh the positives,"" he wrote in an email to the AP following a meeting with Fasel in New York. At the time, he suggested the issues of Olympic participation could be resolved if it were tied into CBA negotiations.

""I can't figure out why anybody would not want to go and take advantage of this opportunity because it doesn't come around every day,"" NHL Players' Association executive director Donald Fehr wondered.

Canada 3-time Olympic champs with NHLers

In 2018, the NHL didn't send players to Pyeongchang, South Korea, after competing in five consecutive Olympics from 1998-2014, with commissioner Gary Bettman noting in June 2019 the cost of sending and insuring athletes costs the league around $20 million US.

Travel costs to Pyeongchang were projected to be $15 million, which the IOC refused to pay. The NHL was also denied control of using Olympic game footage to promote the league and players.

""It's not that I'm not a fan of the Olympics,"" he said. ""I'm not a fan of disrupting our season. We're not going to pay for the privilege of shutting down [the season for two weeks].""

Canada won Olympic gold medals in 2002 (Salt Lake City), 2010 (Vancouver) and 2014 (Sochi, Russia) with NHL players on hand.

""Everybody wants to play in the Olympics,"" Canucks forward Bo Horvat was quoted in an NHL.com story. ""I think that's a big thing that we wanted [in a new CBA], not only for ourselves to represent our country, but to grow the game.""

Forward Justin Williams, who returned to the Carolina Hurricanes on a one-year deal at age 38 in January after sitting out the start of the season, believes the Olympics is a way to promote hockey worldwide.

""I just think it's great for the game of hockey to be able to showcase the best players,"" the three-time Stanley Cup champion said this week. ""The Olympics are a special event in itself but having NHL players there, you love to see the best on best.""

The 2026 Olympics are to be co-hosted in Italy by Milano Cortina.

The Los Angeles Lakers superstar won't wear one of the NBA-approved social justice messages on the back of his jersey when the NBA resumes competition later this month in the Orlando bubble.

""It was no disrespect to the list that was handed down to all the players,"" James said Saturday in a confernece call from Florida. ""I commend anyone that decides to put something on the back of their jersey. It's just something that didn't seriously resonate with my mission, with my goal.""

As part of the NBA's recognition of the nationwide invigoration of the social justice movement sparked by the death of George Floyd, NBA players are allowed to choose from a lengthy list of possible messages for their jerseys during the league's restart. James is among just a few who declined to choose one of the messages, he said.

""I would have loved to have a say-so on what would have went on the back of my jersey,"" James said. ""I had a couple of things in mind, but I wasn't part of that process, which is OK. ... Everything that I do has a purpose, has a meaning. I don't need to have something on the back of my jersey for people to understand my mission or know what I'm about and what I'm here to do.""

Long history of social advocacy

The 35-year-old superstar has a long history of social involvement and advocacy for progressive causes. James speaks frequently of what he feels is a responsibility to campaign for positive social change from his powerful position in sports and pop culture.

""This is the mission I've been on for a long time now,"" James said. ""It's great that a lot of people's ears are opening. A lot of people are understanding, a lot of people are recognizing. A lot of people still don't get it, and a lot of people are still afraid to talk about the racism that goes on in America, especially for our people. ... But we have some ears, and we will continue to push the envelope and let everyone know that we are human as well. We don't want to be just be used for our God-given abilities.""

JaVale McGee, the Lakers' veteran centre, said he will wear ""Respect Us"" on his jersey in Orlando.

""It's a blessing to have this platform,"" said McGee, whose asthma has him being particularly cautious during the pandemic. ""We have way more of a voice playing basketball ΓÇª Our fans are basketball fans over anything. This is the biggest platform we can speak about social injustices. That's the best time to talk about it.""

James also said he didn't consider not playing in the NBA's restart, believing the league can be a positive force through its visibility and competition. He expressed no concerns for his health inside the bubble.

""I believe the NBA and [Commissioner] Adam Silver, they took all precautionary measure to make sure that we as a league are as safe as we can be,"" James said. ""Obviously, in anything that you do, there can be things that can happen, so we will cross that line if it happens. But we're doing everything to make sure everyone stays safe during this pandemic. Adam Silver has given me no reason to not believe him since he took over. I have no concerns. I'm here 100% and in great health.""",[]

The Raptors, who'd been based in Naples, Fla., for the past two weeks, but limited in practice to one player per hoop, took the floor for the first time Saturday at Walt Disney World for the NBA's restart after the team passed its COVID-19 tests.

It felt partly like the first day of training camp, they said. But also a little like the NBA champions had never been apart.

""For the most part it was really good . . . the trust factor really, really showed up,"" coach Nick Nurse said. ""A lot of guys are doing a lot of things that we normally do, just right from the get-go here which was great.

And we back, and we back, and we back. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeTheNorth?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WeTheNorth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/vhFhpWRrOL"">pic.twitter.com/vhFhpWRrOL</a> —@Raptors

""Obviously there was some rust and some things that stick out that you have to keep an eye on, or that we're going to have to change, but from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us.""

The defending NBA champions made the two-hour trip from Naples on Thursday in style, pulling into Disney World in two black buses that, unique to the Raptors, had ""Black Lives Matter"" painted in huge white block letters.

They were immediately tested upon arrival in the NBA semi-bubble, which is home to 22 teams. They were tested again at 7 p.m. local time on Friday, then got the all-clear Saturday at 10 a.m.

Nurse said the testing protocol has become the new normal.

""I think the first couple times we did it here and certainly going way back to March 11 (the day the league suspended play), when we went off and got tested, your level of anxiety was a lot higher then for sure,"" Nurse said. ""But I think it's always: cross your fingers, knock on wood, good thoughts, all that stuff every time.""

The Raptors, who tip off the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 versus the Los Angeles Lakers, could be at Disney World for the next three months. Nurse packed his guitar. Marc Gasol arrived with his own Nespresso coffee machine. The players checked into rooms decorated with family photos — courtesy of Raptors staff.

'I miss playing basketball'

Pascal Siakam said he spent the 36 hours of hotel quarantine playing video games, and thinking about ""being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team.

""We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere, and that's all I really care about.""

Mask On <a href=""https://t.co/neUWDUTcA8"">pic.twitter.com/neUWDUTcA8</a> —@Raptors

Nurse said he felt his way through the first practice he'd coached in four months.

""I had some thoughts about what the structure of the practice would look like and we did it totally different than we normally would,"" he said. ""Again just based on the situation I think it's important for us to play, but I also think it's important to kind of ease in or taper in a little bit because we're conscious of health in general.""

The coach, who'd raved last week about the fitness level of his players, went heavier than he'd expected to, and ""I just told the guys to please self-monitor and let's not let's not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.""

Siakam said while there was some rust, the Raptors, who were second in the Eastern Conference when the league shut down, were all excited to be back on the floor together.

""That's what you wanna see, you wanna see people wanting to play,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how long you were off, once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that's what you wanna see from a team.""

'Long way to go'

Fred VanVleet said there was a ""first day of school type"" feeling for the entire team.

""We've got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we've still got a long way to go,"" the guard said.

In Naples, the Raptors hadn't left the hotel grounds except for practice. They had gotten in a few rounds of golf and tennis games on the hotel grounds.

Siakam got a new appreciation for tennis.

""I love tennis. I watch tennis all the time. Even back home, I used to watch tennis a lot,"" he said. ""I thought it was fairly easy to be honest until I got there. They're definitely some tough athletes in the things that they do. I definitely respect it more. It's hard. I don't think it's for me. Marc is pretty good, actually. I feel like Marc is definitely the best that I have seen play.""

The Raptors will have a chance to explore their new digs in the next few days.

""I think there will be a little bit more stuff for us to do as time goes by, and everybody gets tested and safe and locked in, I think we'll have more things to do,"" VanVleet said.

Florida has been ravaged by COVID-19 in the past few weeks. The Sunshine State has topped 250,000 cases with about 10,300 new cases reported on Saturday.

VanVleet said there's a greater sense of safety in the NBA bubble.

""When we were in Naples, we couldn't control everybody else,"" he said. ""I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that's probably the biggest difference.""",[]
98,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/indycar-scott-dixon-july-11-1.5646669,Scott Dixon wins at Road America for 3rd straight IndyCar victory,"['Steve Megargee', 'The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Scott Dixon raced to his third straight victory Saturday with an improbable triumph in the opener of a weekend doubleheader at Road America, as IndyCar welcomed fans to its races for the first time this season.

Dixon took the lead shortly after a caution flag and beat Will Power by 2.5386 seconds. They were followed in order by Alex Palou, Ryan Hunter-Reay and Colton Herta.

Dixon has won each of the three IndyCar races in the pandemic-delayed season. He's the first IndyCar driver to start a season with at least three consecutive victories since Sebastien Bourdais reeled off four straight to start the 2006 campaign.

The only other drivers to open an IndyCar season with at least three straight victories are A.J. Foyt (seven in 1964) and Al Unser (three in 1971).

This marked the first time spectators were allowed in an IndyCar event this season after they weren't permitted in races at Fort Worth or Indianapolis. IndyCar is treating each event separately and following local and state health regulations at each track as it decides whether to allow fans.

""It's so cool to be back on a track with fans,"" Dixon said. ""And there's tons of them here today.""'

Saturday's race took drivers 55 laps around a course that's just over 4 miles long with 14 turns.

Dixon qualified ninth Saturday for his worst starting position of the young season, as he'd started second in Fort Worth and seventh in Indianapolis. He wasn't a factor early in this one as Josef Newgarden was in command for the first half of the race.

Newgarden had grabbed the pole position earlier in the day and seemed on his way to winning at Road America for the second time in three years until he stalled coming out of his second pit stop and fell back in the pack. He ended up 14th.

Power owned a narrow lead over Dixon when Jack Harvey went off the track to produce a caution flag with 17 laps remaining. Dixon pulled ahead of Power coming out of the pits on the restart and stayed ahead after two more caution flags.

The second caution flag came when Conor Daly slid off the course after making contact with Pato O'Ward, knocking Daly out of the race and wrecking his Chevy. The final one came when Dalton Kellett went off course.

49th career victory

Dixon's latest victory was the 49th of his career, putting the New Zealander him behind only Foyt (67) and Mario Andretti (52).

Road America's setup made it an ideal venue for IndyCar to start allowing fans. The sprawling, 640-acre layout surrounding the course allows fans to practice social distancing and roam the property rather than crowding into a grandstand.

""Since we've been here before, we know there's plenty of room,"" said Jason Shelley of Indianapolis, who said he usually attends four or five IndyCar races each year. ""It's kind of like watching a race in a state park, so this is the one place where I feel comfortable and safe because I know I can get away from people. I'm not going to be stacked on top of people. That's why we came.""

Steve Lemon, a fan from Kankakee, Illinois, who usually attends about three races a year, said that ""if it had been an oval, we wouldn't have gone.""

Safety measures for fans

Fans received temperature checks at gates and received masks and hand sanitizer as they entered.

Wearing a mask was encouraged but not required, and a stroll through along the Road America property indicated the majority of spectators were spending at least part of the time unmasked.

""All the staff and drivers and everybody are wearing masks, but I don't think the fans are quite as good about it,"" said Jim Cossaart, a spectator from Bristol, Vermont. ""Human nature, I guess.""

IndyCar also plans to have spectators next weekend for a doubleheader in Iowa, where the oval track has grandstands. IndyCar is hoping fans will fill 50% of the speedway's capacity for the Indianapolis 500 on Aug. 23.",[]
99,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/martha-mccabe-olympian-swimmer-come-out-lbgqt-1.5643261,Retired Olympic swimmer hopes her coming-out story helps normalize it for other female athletes,"['Matthew Pariselli', 'About The Authormatthew Parisellimatthew Pariselli Is A Writer', 'Communications Professional In Toronto. He Has Covered Ballet', 'Film', 'Most Recently Health Sciences Research.', 'Matthew Pariselli Is A Writer', 'For Cbc Sports', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et']",,"Over the course of her eight years as a swimmer on Canada's national team, Martha McCabe estimates she had at least 10 teammates who identified as LGBTQ+.

She says there were probably 30 to 40 members of the community competing during her time swimming at the university level.

At her first Olympics in 2012, she marched into London's Olympic Stadium alongside Mark Tewksbury, an Olympic champion swimmer and a vocal advocate for gay rights since coming out publicly in 1998.

But what McCabe noticed was that none of the LGBTQ+ swimmers she knew was a woman. And that lack of a visible role model played a part in preventing her from recognizing her own sexuality.

""For me, swimming was the world,"" the 30-year-old two-time Olympian said. ""Sure, I probably knew a couple of lesbians outside of swimming, but I was barely paying attention to my life outside of swimming.

""The people I looked up to were in swimming. The people I was constantly surrounded by and giving my full attention to were in swimming. I think if there was an out lesbian within that circle, someone I could have potentially looked up to, it would have been normalized a little bit more.

WATCH | CBC Sports panel details challenges of being LGBTQ+ in sports today:

CBC Sports panellists Devin Heroux, Erin McLeod, Wade Davis and Anastasia Bucsis explain why this year's Pride demands tough conversations about the intersectionality of class, sex, race and ability. 54:01

""I think because there haven't really been any superstars in the sport publicly come out as lesbian and advocate for women in the LGBTQ+ space, it makes it more challenging to realize these things about yourself,"" she said.

McCabe is fresh off her first Pride Month as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. The world championship and Pan Am Games medallist is coming out publicly in the hopes of inspiring other young athletes and increasing LGBTQ+ representation in swimming, specifically on the women's side, where she says it is severely lacking.

""I want to be an example to young female swimmers and help ones who are struggling with this, so they can see it's normal,"" said McCabe, who specialized in the 200-metre breaststroke and placed fifth in the London 2012 Olympics. ""Parents also need to recognize that this needs to be normalized. Kids don't see this everywhere, and when you don't see it, it becomes this hurdle you have to get over.""

It wasn't a hurdle McCabe confronted during her career; it was after she hung up her swimsuit that she explored her sexuality. She says she was never attracted to women throughout her years in the pool, but admits it would have been helpful — and could have changed her trajectory — if she knew out women in swimming when she competed.

""I think because I didn't see it in people I looked up to, the thought never crossed my mind. I didn't question the norms society had built around me because I didn't even realize there was something to question,"" she said.

I want to be an example to young female swimmers and help ones who are struggling with this, so they can see it's normal. - Martha McCabe

Tewksbury agrees that knowing LGBTQ+ women in the sport could have benefited McCabe.

""Obviously Martha is not the first one. I even know of women who were members of the community, but very private about it,"" said Tewksbury, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics and was Canada's chef de mission at the London Olympics in 2012. ""I'm realizing how unfortunate that is. Even some Olympic medallists, I think they could have been really good role models for Martha.

""This is so important, Martha sharing her story. I don't know how many women have ever been on the national team and have publicly identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community before. It's great; it starts a whole different level of conversation, hopefully in places across the country that need it.""

Coming out to family and friends isn't a painless process for every LGBTQ+ person, but it has been for McCabe, a Canmore, Alta. resident originally from Toronto. She says she has only received love and support from those closest to her, for which she is thankful.

McCabe emphasizes the importance of coming out, especially in the sporting arena where she says it doesn't happen enough.

""Young people need to be able to see themselves in the people they look up to,"" she said. ""We need minority voices from different races, sexualities, gender identities, etc. — people bold enough to speak out, to share and to be themselves publicly so that younger generations can see they are not alone, and that you can be successful despite your differences,"" she said.

Inclusivity is crucial to McCabe. It's a component of her own public speaking engagements and is championed through Head to Head, a mentorship company she founded after retiring from swimming that connects youth with Olympians. She said inclusion is a topic Olympians are encouraged to discuss, with the goal of helping young people build inclusive environments in all the spaces they occupy.

McCabe urges LGBTQ+ people and allies to show their support, which can mean pasting a rainbow flag to a window or donning a rainbow sticker on a shoe. It can also entail participating in Pride, which McCabe did when she marched with the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) in Toronto's 2019 Pride parade and which she and her girlfriend celebrated online this year due to COVID-19.

""I was single for a long time, and although I never felt lonely or like I was missing anything, I'm now very grateful and happy to have a partner who I really want to spend time enjoying all of life's activities with,"" she said.

This year's Pride Month was a factor in McCabe's choice to come out publicly.

""Seeing more and more high-profile athletes speak about the importance of coming out publicly throughout Pride Month made me realize that even though my experience has been pretty seamless, it is not the case for many young people. These young people need role models both for themselves and for the people around them to see that if you're currently not accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, you need to further educate yourself, make sure you understand the meaning behind your words and the way you support others.""

WATCH | Tewksbury, Thormeyer share experience as LGBTQ+ athletes:

A high-profile athlete who perhaps didn't understand the meaning behind his words this past Pride Month was Christion Jones, a former wide receiver for the Edmonton Eskimos. On June 27 — Global Pride Day — Jones tweeted his opposition to gay and lesbian relationships. Further, he defended his homophobic stance in more than 50 follow-up posts.

Jones has since apologized, but he was released by the team. The Canadian Football League followed by issuing a statement asserting that it strives to be inclusive and that there is no place in the league for disparaging commentary on the basis of religion, race, gender or sexual orientation.

McCabe, who does not agree with Jones' tweets, says the incident highlights a lack of LGBTQ+ education and awareness.

""This, to me, is an issue with more than just one person,"" she said. ""This means education systems, sports organizations and companies need to prioritize this type of learning to make sure all stakeholders have the tools they need to be positive role models and good members of society.

""For me, this is tied to the importance of athlete representation in the LGBTQ+ community. The more out role models we have, the more society will see and understand that this is real and around all of us. The more everyone sees somebody they know, love or see as successful come out, the more acceptance there will be because it will be put in their own life context for them.""

Pride is about authenticity to McCabe, but it's also an opportunity to tell stories typically untold, with the hope that they're given a platform more regularly.

Tewksbury, a director of the COC, said, ""There's a whole bunch of social unrest and change happening. I think one of the things I'm really seeing is the importance of amplifying different voices, listening to people's stories and having dialogue.""

""Young kids need to see this and hear these stories,"" McCabe said. ""I think it's critical for parents to openly talk about their support for the LGBTQ+ community, to watch LGBTQ+ movies and shows and to share LGBTQ+ articles and stories with their kids. If you're not doing that, your inaction is further supporting the fact that being heterosexual is 'normal.'""",[]

Masvidal isn't mad about the twists that sent him to Abu Dhabi this week with minimal time to train for his fight with Kamaru Usman on Saturday night. Three spectacular wins last year turned Masvidal into one of the UFC's top rising stars at the tender age of 35, and he plans to ride his momentum all the way through the reigning welterweight champion at UFC 251.

""The reason I'm here is because I've taken opportunities like this in the past,"" Masvidal said. ""I've just got to take advantage of it. It's what I love to do. It's what I've done since I was a child. I've just got to give it everything I've got.""

The showdown between Masvidal (35-13) and the hard-nosed Usman (16-1) headlines the UFC's biggest show of the summer on Yas Island, the tourist destination that has been taken over by the UFC and rechristened ""Fight Island.""

UFC 251 also features featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski's first title defence against long-reigning champ Max Holloway, along with vaunted Petr Yan's bout against former champ Jose Aldo for the vacant bantamweight belt.

But the most compelling fighter on an extremely interesting card is likely Masvidal, whose tenacity inside and outside the cage has turned him from a cult hero into a mainstream MMA star.

A former backyard brawler in his native Miami, Masvidal didn't crack the UFC roster until his late 20s, and he endured a handful of tough losses that slowed his progress. Consecutive stoppages of Darren Till, Ben Askren and Nate Diaz last year turned him into a major draw, and he has been determined to capitalize on it.

""I had a good year for myself to reset my mind,"" Masvidal said. ""To get everything right in mind, body, soul, spirit, and then come back to the sport and give it my all again. It's just amazing that the world took notice this time.""

He negotiated with the UFC for this shot at Usman, but the talks fell apart over money, and the promotion made the curious decision to give the title shot to Brazil's Gilbert Burns instead.

But Burns tested positive for coronavirus last week, and the UFC went back to Masvidal to keep its card intact. Masvidal quickly headed to the Middle East for his first title shot after seven years and 18 fights in the UFC.

""I'm as prepared as I need to be for Usman, but it's not like a full training camp,"" Masvidal said. ""But my mind is ready, and my heart is ready. There are other guys I could have fought that would have made it hard on six days' notice. I think [Usman] is the perfect one. ... I think he's weak-minded.""

Usman stopped Colby Covington last winter to retain his belt, and his superb wrestling could turn a matchup with the hard-hitting Masvidal into a tactical fight that would greatly favour the champion.

""He took the fight on short notice, but let's not act like he hasn't been training for this,"" Usman said. ""He's only had to train for one guy, and that's me. I was training for a completely different guy. ... It didn't really matter to me. I trained and was prepared to get into a scrap. It didn't matter who the face was.""

Volkanovski, Holloway run it back

Volkanovski (21-1) won his belt last December with a clear decision over Holloway (21-5), one of the UFC's most popular recent champions. The promotion ordered an immediate rematch, and Holloway has vowed to avoid his mistakes in the first fight. But the athleticism and activity showed by Volkanovski in the first fight provide a clear path for the Australian champ.

Vacant belt

Aldo (28-6) was the UFC's long-reigning featherweight champion until Conor McGregor dethroned him in 2015, and he absorbed back-to-back knockout losses to Holloway in 2017. Aldo also has lost his last two fights, but he curiously got this title shot from the UFC after Henry Cejudo abruptly retired. Also faces a stiff task against Yan (14-1), a younger, gifted Russian on a nine-fight winning streak against quality opponents — albeit none with Aldo's skills and pedigree.

Return of Thug Rose

Former strawweight champion Rose Namajunas (8-4) is back for the first time since losing her title in May 2019 to Jessica Andrade (20-7), who subsequently lost the belt to Zhang Weili. Namajunas and Andrade will fight a rematch at UFC 251. The popular Namajunas appeared to be winning their first bout until Andrade ended the fight with an astonishing power slam, but Andrade insists her victory wasn't a fluke.

Early risers

To accommodate the pay-per-view audience in North America, the fights will start well before dawn on Sunday morning in Abu Dhabi, with the main event still in the early hours.

""Not only did I have to get adjusted to the time rather quick here, I have to get adjusted to fighting at 8 in the morning,"" Masvidal said. ""It makes the journey a little bit more memorable.""",[]

""I had wheels flying off in front of me, cars going off in braking zones and cars spinning,"" Latifi told CBC Sports this week. ""Your first initial reaction is to not get caught up [in the accidents] and then you realize you've gained a position.

Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas won a chaotic season-opening Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday while his teammate, Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton finished fourth after getting a late time penalty. 0:46

Latifi, along with Montreal's Lance Stroll, marked the first time at least two Canadians lined up at a F1 race since the Canadian Grand Prix in 1969 that saw three drivers — Bill Brack, Al Pease and John Cordts — compete. Latifi and Stroll are also set to become the first Canadian drivers to complete an entire F1 season together.

Stroll, with the Racing Point Mercedes team, has been in the sport since 2017. The 21-year-old's race Sunday ended prematurely with mechanical problems.

""I think it's something quite cool that we have two Canadians full time now,"" Latifi said. ""It's obviously been quite a long time and I've always said representing my country on the world stage is something I take quite a lot of pride in.

""When I was in the junior [racing] categories in Europe I was the only Canadian and now too have two in Formula One is very cool.""

Unconventional route

Born in Montreal, Latifi and his family moved to Toronto when he was a boy. As Canada's 15th driver in the sport's 70-year history, Latifi took the unconventional route to the highest level of single-seater auto racing.

""The biggest challenge for me was that I started quite late compared to most of my competitors,"" said the 25-year-old, who began racing competitively at 13. ""When I started, I had already been competing against people who had been racing for quite a few years.

""The average age most kids start at is eight but it's not to say you can't make it if you start later. I'm a perfect example of that.""

Latifi went on to compete in Europe's junior circuits before reaching Formula 2, the penultimate step on the motorsport ladder.

In 2019, he finished runner-up in the competition and earned his seat at Williams where he had previously done work as a test driver.

""All of us at Williams have been immensely impressed at what he has achieved in Formula 2,"" deputy team principal Claire Williams told reporters following the announcement. ""Nicholas has become an established and well-respected member of Williams as we look to fight our way back to the midfield.""

Managing expectations

Jacques Villeneuve has the honour of being Canada's only F1 champion and was the last to claim the Drivers' World Championship for Williams in 1997.

Since Villeneuve's triumph the team has faced many challenges over the years and last season managed just one point in the constructor standings.

Despite not yet having a competitive car to challenge for the checkered flag, Latifi is accustomed to staying patient.

""One of the difficulties I had when I was younger was managing my expectations,"" Latifi said. ""I'm very competitive and I always wanted to win but then again I was racing against people with so much more experience than me and not getting the results I wanted was quite difficult.

""You have to put in the time on the track — that's how I caught up for lost time — there's no other way around it in this sport.""

'Knock off the rust'

Unsure if he'd get to compete in 2020, Latifi's debut was previously set for March 15 at F1's traditional opener in Australia.

""I wasn't even sure if we would be able to race this year,"" Latifi said. ""Going into the first race of the season there's always going to be a lot of excitement and anticipation and then with the race in Australia being cancelled it was obviously a very strange time.

""Having all the time off, of course, made it difficult having to knock off the rust but I'm happy to be back.""

The season continues this weekend in Austria, then moves to Hungary as part of an 10-race European swing over 13 weeks.

The rest of the Formula One schedule remains uncertain.

""My goal heading into the next few races is to build upon performances and learning from the next few ones,"" Latifi said. ""The beginning of each session I'm going to be learning so much and hopefully taking that step forward. I'm not going to base my success off of results because we know in Formula One so many things can happen with car performances.

""I'm a big fan of Rowdy Tellez, I've always been a fan of the kid,"" said Montoyo. ""He's having a good — if you want to call it this — spring training. His approach at the plate looks really good.

""I don't think anything has changed when it comes to him. He can rotate into that designated hitter spot, he can also play first. If he keeps swinging the bat the way he has, he's going to see a lot of playing time.""

Tellez hit .227 with 21 home runs and 54 runs batted in 2019, his first full season in Major League Baseball. He was hitting .238 through nine spring training games before the break.

Guerrero made his MLB debut in 2019, hitting .272 with 15 home runs and 69 RBIs. He hit .286 with three homers through 12 exhibition games in March.

The 21-year-old son of Hall of Fame outfielder Vladimir Guerrero is one of baseball's most heralded young players. The Blue Jays asked him to drop weight and boost endurance during the off-season. He injured his left oblique muscle in spring training last year, and later missed occasional games because of right knee pain.

Two of Toronto's top prospects, Jordan Groshans and Austin Martin, are infielders. Moving Guerrero to first will make room for them in future years.

Tellez said he has been helping Guerrero adapt to the new position, working with the 21-year-old on the intricacies of fielding at first base, especially foot work.

""He's always asking questions, he wants to learn, he's always trying to be better,"" said Tellez. ""He's a great teammate to start with so he's not too worried about certain things like playing time or any of that, he just wants everyone to be happy and at their best.""

Tellez stayed with his father and sister in California when spring training was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said he's neighbours with his trainer, who has a gym in his garage. Tellez also built a batting cage at his house to keep working on his hitting in the down time.

""Nothing's changed with the swing or the mentality,"" said Tellez, who said he worked with teammate Bo Bichette and Bichette's father, former MLBer Dante Bichette. ""Just coming back I'm feeling really good. I liked where I was when I left spring training, I was very confident with the work I put in during quarantine.""",[]

New York manager Aaron Boone said Saturday that Chapman ""overall is doing well"" but ""will not be here for the foreseeable future.""

The AL East champions are scheduled to start the virus-delayed season on July 23 at Washington.

Hours after Chapman's diagnosis, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge was scratched from a simulated game with a stiff neck. The 2017 AL Rookie of the Year was set to bat second and play right field at Yankee Stadium but was taken out of the lineup shortly before first pitch.

Judge declared himself ""game ready"" earlier this week after being diagnosed with a broken rib in March. The 6-foot-7 slugger used the coronavirus shutdown to get healthy and had been swinging at full strength for at least a couple of weeks before reporting for preseason camp last week.

Chapman threw a bullpen session Tuesday, and Boone wouldn't comment on whether the left-hander had been at Yankee Stadium since. Boone said the team had done contact tracing, and no other players or personnel would be forced to isolate because of Chapman's positive test.

""We're following all protocols,"" Boone said. ""We have not had any other positive tests. We adhere to all the contact tracing things. We feel like we've handled it and are handling it.

""Again, you know, this is something that even moving forward, a positive test is probably going to come our way. It's about doing all the things that hopefully as a whole keep us safe and healthy,"" he said.

LeMahieu, Cessa remain away from team

Through the first week of monitor testing across all 30 major league camps, 17 out of 7,401 samples produced positives, a 0.2% rate far below the national average around 9%. Atlanta star Freddie Freeman, Kansas City catcher Salvador Perez, Colorado outfielder Charlie Blackmon and Texas slugger Joey Gallo are among the players to miss time due to COVID-19.

The list now includes the 32-year-old Chapman, a six-time All-Star with 273 career saves, including 37 last season when he had a 2.21 ERA.

New York is also without infielder DJ LeMahieu and right-hander Luis Cessa, who both tested positive prior to the start of preseason camp last week and are still isolating at home.

""It's obviously just another reminder,"" Boone said, ""that we have to be vigilant as far as wearing our masks when possible, the distance, the decisions we're making away from the field, to best we can stay out of harm's way.""

The Yankees will open their regular season against the World Series champion Nationals. If Chapman isn't back by then, Boone said left-hander Zack Britton would be a ""natural guy"" to replace him, but a formal decision hasn't been made. The 32-year-old Britton has 145 career saves, most coming with Baltimore from 2014-17.

""Britton has been an elite closer in this game for a long time,"" Boone said.

Right-handed starter Masahiro Tanaka played catch on the field Saturday, one week after he was hit in the head by Giancarlo Stanton's 112 mph line drive. Tanaka is still in concussion protocol and the club doesn't yet have a timeline for his return to the mound. Boone said Tanaka is responding well to treatment and testing.",[]

Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, a co-owner of the team.

The players posted a statement on social media Friday night, hours after Loeffler declared she had no intention of selling her ownership stake in the Dream.

""We are the women of the Atlanta Dream. We are women who support a movement. We are strong and we are fearless. We offer a voice to the voiceless,"" the Dream posted on Twitter.

""Our team is united in the Movement for Black Lives. It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity.""

The post included the signatures of all 12 members of the current team, as well as that of veteran guard Renee Montgomery, who opted out of the season in order to focus on social justice issues.

Stirred controversy

Loeffler reiterated many of the criticisms of the Black Lives Matter movement that she made throughout the week in an editorial published on the Daily Caller website on Friday. She has openly expressed her disagreement with the WNBA's plan to display ""Black Lives Matter"" on the court in Florida and to honour women who have died in connection with police action or alleged racial violence.

Loeffler has co-owned the franchise since 2011 and is a junior U.S. senator from Georgia. The conservative Republican stirred controversy when she appeared on Fox News and termed Black armed protesters in Atlanta as ""mob rule."" Georgia is an open carry state.

I don't see how Sen. Kelly Loeffler from Georgia remains in her role as co-owner of the ATL Dream. Her messaging, her brand & what she's aligned with does not seem to align with the inclusiveness of the WNBA. This might be the WNBA's Donald Sterling moment.<a href=""https://t.co/jvTsjqYqIo"">pic.twitter.com/jvTsjqYqIo</a> —@ShannonSharpe

Loeffler urged WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert in a letter to scrap plans for players to wear warmup jerseys reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Say Her Name"" — in honour of Breonna Taylor — and instead put an American flag on all uniforms and apparel.

The WNBA issued a statement earlier in the week in regard to the situation.

""The WNBA is based on the principle of equal and fair treatment of all people and we, along with the teams and players, will continue to use our platforms to vigorously advocate for social justice,"" the statement read. ""Sen. Kelly Loeffler has not served as a Governor of the Atlanta Dream since October 2019 and is no longer involved in the day-to-day business of the team.""",[]

The team's news cycle followed a similar model Friday.

Infielder Travis Shaw got things rolling with a string of tweets about the team's closed environment at Rogers Centre and adjoining hotel. Manager Charlie Montoyo then dropped news that Vladimir Guerrero Jr., would be moving to first base. And finally there was word that players who spent the week in Florida had arrived in town.

There is no shortage of storylines in this one-of-a-kind summer that's only just beginning. Where things go from here is anyone's guess.

A main issue remains where the Blue Jays will play home games this season. The federal government granted the team approval to modify the 14-day quarantine rule during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing training camp to begin this week at the domed stadium.

""I'm glad that we're here,"" Montoyo said on a conference call. ""I really am and we're going to follow all the guidelines. I promise you that.""

WATCH | Jays broadcaster discusses upcoming season:

Blue Jays broadcaster Mike Wilner joined CBC News Network to talk about the Blue Jays return to Toronto, and the upcoming MLB season slated to begin at the end of July. 7:47

Earlier in the day, Shaw voiced his concern about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman, who spent five seasons with the Blue Jays, added more fuel to the social-media fire when he replied to Mitchell's tweet.

""This is absolutely ridiculous,"" Stroman tweeted, adding in a subsequent post: ""Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol.""

In an email reply, the club confirmed that before arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

CBC Sports' Devin Heroux breaks down the Toronto Blue Jays return to Canada, and how the team and league plans on proceeding ahead of tentative Opening Day. 1:35

The team has expressed its desire to play home games at the dome during the 60-game regular season. A decision is expected in the coming days.

Players are expected to be advised of specifics on the setup for the upcoming campaign once a finalized plan is in place.

Exhibition games at Fenway Park

Toronto will travel to Boston for pre-season games July 21 and 22 before the season opener July 24 at Tampa Bay. The Blue Jays' first home game is set for July 29 against Washington.

If Rogers Centre is ruled out for the season, the Blue Jays would likely play at TD Ballpark at their spring-training facility in Dunedin, Fla., but that backup plan has not been finalized.

Florida has been dealing with a spike in COVID-19 cases of late. The state reported 11,385 new cases on Friday while Ontario reported just 116 new cases.

Shaw, who signed with the Blue Jays last December, posted two additional tweets after his original reply but they were later deleted.

""1) Let me be clear. We are on board with the TWO week quarantine. I currently have a PAID for condo a block away from the stadium that I can't use. At no point would I risk public safety or not follow rules. Is it wrong to want to live in a place that I've already paid for...""

He added: ""2) to be able to go on a walk (WITH A MASK) to be able to get fresh air, walk to go get takeout food (not eat inside). We aren't looking to party, hit the patios, go out at night, anything like that. Public safety is priority number 1....""

As Major League Baseball's lone Canadian team, the Blue Jays face an additional hurdle because of the border and quarantine rules during the pandemic. Players and team staff have been isolating from the general public in the so-called 'bubble' of the stadium and hotel at the north end of the building.

""I wanna make it clear, we're not asking for special treatment,"" Blue Jays outfielder Randal Grichuk tweeted Friday. ""We understand that we need to stay in a ""quarantine bubble"". We wanna make sure everyone is safe.

""The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That's what makes it tough for a lot of guys.""

The Blue Jays have not commented on reports that a single player recently tested positive for COVID-19 in Florida. The positive result forced 12 players to remain in Dunedin, according to USA Today.

Most players — about 46 in total, Montoyo said earlier in the week — flew to Toronto on a charter last Sunday.

Without providing specifics, Montoyo said other players arrived in town Thursday and planned to work out before the team's intrasquad game Friday evening.

During his 15-minute video call with reporters, Montoyo confirmed that Guerrero would cross the diamond and focus on first base.

""It's all about a player having the best chance to compete,"" Montoyo said. ""It's going to be a short season. So for me, the best [plan] for Vlad is to play first, DH and also play third.""

Guerrero, who hit 15 homers and drove in 69 runs in his rookie season, said he was on board.

""Wherever the team needs me, I'm going to be ready,"" he said via translator Hector Lebron. ""So I'm OK with that.""

MLB confirms 66 new positive tests

There were 66 positive tests for COVID-19 during the intake screening process for the upcoming season, Major League Baseball and the MLB Players' Association announced Friday.

The number includes 58 players and eight staff members out of 3,748 samples tested, a rate of 1.8 per cent.

It sure didn't feel that way to Brooks Koepka, Justin Rose and others who missed the cut at the Workday Charity Open.

The second round was completed Saturday because of two storm delays in Dublin, Ohio. With gentle morning conditions, Koepka had little chance of having enough players fall back to let him get within the top 65 to make the cut. Koepka closed with five birdies in seven holes Friday evening, but his 74-69 was one shot short.

Collin Morikawa takes a three-shot lead into the weekend at 13-under 131, one shot away from the 36-hole record at Muirfield Village that Jason Dufner set three years ago at the Memorial. So the course must have felt easy to him.

But the cut came at 2-under 142. That's the highest score to make the cut since the PGA Tour restarted its season after a three-month shutdown from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Canadians Nick Taylor and Mackenzie Hughes began Saturday's third round in a tie for 11th at 6-under, one shot ahead of Adam Hadwin and Roger Sloan of B.C.

Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., was two-over through his first four holes in Saturday's third round to move to 2-under while David Hearn of Brantford, Ont., missed the cut.

American Collin Morikawa shot a 7-under 65 to lead the first round of the Workday Charity Open, while Abbotsford, B.C. golfers Adam Hadwin and Nick Taylor are respectively one and two shots behind. 1:31

Muirfield Village will be set up harder for the Memorial next week. The Workday Open is a one-time event that replaces the cancelled John Deere Classic. It's the first time in 63 years the PGA Tour has had consecutive events on the same course.

Rose had an 80, one of six rounds at 80 or higher. It was the seventh time in his PGA Tour career that Rose failed to break 80, and the first since The Players Championship three years ago.

Threesomes in 3rd round due to rain delays

The 67 players who made the cut included M.J. Daffue of South Africa, who got into the Workday Open as a Monday qualifier. Needing birdie on his final hole, he hit his short iron to two feet on No. 9 for a 69 to make it. The 31-year-old Daffue is playing only his second PGA Tour event.

Justin Thomas and Kevin Streelman were three behind and in the final group with Morikawa. The third round featured threesomes because of the rain delays.

Nick Watney, Dylan Frittelli and Denny McCarthy missed the cut. They all tested positive for the coronavirus this week but were allowed to play because they already had tested positive, got through self-isolation and showed no symptoms.

The tour cited federal health guidelines and research that the virus can still be detected for weeks after recovery but that it no longer is contagious.

As an extra layer of caution, they played in the same group. If they had made the cut, they would have played as a single amidst threesomes.",[]

So is the 5:30 a.m. pre-game meal.

Toronto FC gets one heck of an early start to the MLS is Back Tournament on Sunday when it faces D.C. United at ESPN's Wide World of Sports complex in the Orlando area.

The league has scheduled games in the morning and evening to avoid the Florida heat.

Toronto and D.C. may not be getting much of a break Sunday. The forecast Sunday calls for a temperature of 30 C at kickoff, which will feel like 36 C. There's a chance of a thunderstorm around the final whistle.

Toronto captain Michael Bradley is no fan of the morning kickoff.

""It's a shame we're playing games at that time,"" he told a virtual media call Friday.

It's a time that seems at odds with the league wanting to have as many people watching as possible, he suggested.

Not to mention that the conditions are hardly conducive to sterling play.

""When you think about what a 9 a.m. game in Orlando at this time of the year is going to means in terms of the weather and the humidity, I'm not sure it makes a ton of sense,"" he said with a slight chuckle. ""But obviously those decisions get made above our heads.

""We're going to deal with it like we always do and make sure that it's no excuse and make sure that we're ready to go when that whistle blows.""

Toronto and D.C. were supposed to play Friday evening but the game was pushed back to Sunday morning due to Toronto's late arrival in Florida, following the need for more COVID-19 testing before departure.

Experimenting with shorter warmup

Toronto coach Greg Vanney said he plans to delay his pre-game talk slightly, so the players can have a little more time after breakfast to wake up.

""I'll do a team talk before we get on the bus because I feel like they'll at least have been up for an hour, an hour and a half. Hopefully guys won't go back to sleep. And they'll be a little bit more awake and a little more engaged.""

The time spent in the locker-room is shorter than usual at this tournament, so teams arrive closer to kickoff. The bus ride to the playing field is only five to 10 minutes.

Vanney said the team has experimented with shortening its warmup to keep the players out of the heat.

Toronto has a quick turnaround after Sunday's game, facing the Montreal Impact in a game Wednesday evening. Then it's another early morning wake-up call for a July 21 contest with the New England Revolution.

WATCH | Revolution upend Impact in rusty start:

Revolution designated player Gustavo Bou scored the lone goal as New England beat the Montreal Impact 1-0 in both teams' first game of the MLS is Back tournament. 1:17

One plus of the Florida heat is the hydration breaks during play, which allow Vanney and his coaches a chance to communicate directly with the players.

""I think the hydration breaks are mini-timeouts,"" he said. ""You get an opportunity to address your whole group ... and try to put them back out in the best way possible.""

Training for adjusted routine

Vanney says he has been getting up by 6 a.m. in Florida with the staff taking the field an hour before the players to make sure everything is set up for training.

They have started training between 8 and 8:15 a.m., with players hitting the gym afterwards.

""I said to somebody today I accomplish more by 11 o'clock in the morning while I'm here than I have in a lifetime really,"" said Vanney. ""So a lot of things happen early but it's been nice. And then at the end of that, there's a lot of rest and recovery.""

Vanney said he and his players and staff are no strangers to spending time on the road in hotel rooms.

""It's what we have to do to play and, for me, playing is why I'm here and it's what my life is about. We're here to try to win and to play and do the best we can. (And) stay safe obviously in the process.""",[]

I didn't know what to say.

That question has bothered me ever since I graduated high school.

Fear held me back

I remember hearing the announcements calling for valedictorian submissions. I kind of wanted to do it, but I figured I would have no chance at all. If I had no chance, why try?

Phung at age 17. (Submitted by Andrew Phung)

I'm a Calgary kid, born and raised. I grew up in the heart of northeast Calgary, an area filled with immigrant families trying to make the best life possible.

All my parents wanted for me was to be happy, healthy and stay out of trouble. And I did.

My career today is built on risk-taking, but in Grade 12, I played it safe. I wasn't someone who was ambitious.

Embracing failure

As a teenager, I didn't try because of the fear of failing. As an adult, my mentality has completely changed because of my work and the years I spent learning how to embrace failure through improv comedy.

If I have no chance, who cares? I should try anyway.

So when Now or Never challenged me to finally give my valedictorian speech at Scarborough's Wexford Collegiate School of the Arts, I didn't think I'd be nervous, but I was!

This wasn't even my school, but I felt like a 17-year-old kid again!

Hearing the students waiting for me in the auditorium got my heart racing, which is uncommon for me. I perform for a living, but this wasn't an improv or comedy show.

That all went away as soon as I started speaking. I spoke from the heart and I genuinely felt like the audience was with me the entire time.

In the moment, I took a risk and turned one section of my speech into a call and response from the crowd. The crowd was fantastic and it felt so right to include them.

The fiction of Michael Crummey has revolved around the rich history and heritage surrounding the place of his birth, Newfoundland and Labrador. His novels Sweetland and Galore were both set in the region, as is his latest, The Innocents.

The Innocents is a tale about a young brother and sister who live in isolation in a Newfoundland cove during the 18th century, surviving on knowledge their parents left behind.

Crummey won the Thomas Raddall Atlantic Fiction Award for his novel The Innocents. The 2019 novel was also shortlisted for the 2019 Scotiabank Giller Prize, the 2019 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and the Governor General's Literary Award for fiction.

Crummey spoke with Shelagh Rogers about writing The Innocents.

Downhome connection

""I came across an old Newfoundland newspaper and found a paragraph-long account about a clergyman. He was travelling along the coast and happened on a brother and sister living alone in a cove. The sister was pregnant. The clergyman assumed — and quite rightly I'm sure — that the brother was the father.

""Being a clergyman, he had a few things to say about that. The brother ended up driving him off with a rifle. I knew immediately that was a story without giving it a second thought. It never left me, the notion of those two children — what life must have been like and how they ended up in that circumstance.

Every book I've written has felt completely different in terms of how it's come about, how it's been written and how I feel about it afterwards.

""Every book I've written has felt completely different in terms of how it's come about, how it's been written and how I feel about it afterwards. This book happened quickly. I had this notion about these two siblings for a long time. But I didn't want to go near it because of the fraught subject matter. When I decided to do it, I just wanted it done. For this book, I wrote every day for three and a half months.""

Employment and labour

""I was thinking of my own father when writing this book. He started working with his father in the Labrador fishery when he was nine. He never had a childhood. This was in the 1930s into the 1940s, not the 18th century. I imagine that those children would have been pretty well versed in work. Everybody had work just to survive.

""In the book, the two main characters — being 11 — are pretty close to an adult, in terms of work. But they know almost nothing about the world and nothing about life outside that cove. They have nothing to fall back on except their own wits.""

Down by the ocean

""This book is an adventure story, in a weird way — almost like a road novel. The characters don't move but the road is the ocean, the tides and the currents. Whatever comes by becomes the next chapter in the book.

A lot of the book was about getting inside the heads of these children who are so innocent and ignorant of the world.

""A lot of the book was about getting inside the heads of these children, who are so innocent and ignorant of the world. How they would try to make sense of things they have no words for. They don't have a word for anything that happens between them as they grow older. As they get older, they become more of a mystery to themselves.""

The government's Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG), which was meant to be administered through the We Charity, has been put on pause in response to an ethics probe into the Liberal government's decision to outsource the program to an organization with ties to the Trudeau family.

""The student service grant would have been a really good opportunity for [students] to give back to the community, but to also earn some money for school,"" said Alfred Burgesson, a 23-year-old member of the Prime Minister's Youth Council who also works in youth employment.

Burgesson was asked to serve on an advisory board for the student grant project. He told The House that while he had positive experiences with the organization, he turned down the offer.

""I have not come across many people who've had great things to say about their experience with WE, so as a youth service provider, I decided not to get too close to that initiative,"" he said.



Aside from the fallout from the CCSG, the COVID-19 pandemic has been especially hard on young Canadians and their careers.

Burgesson spoke to The House about some of those challenges, what the federal government should do to help, and how Ottawa should do more to combat racism.

What does WE mean for the prime minister's future?

The ongoing controversy over the WE organization has become a growing thorn in the side of the Liberal government. The decision to give a sole-sourced contract to administer a program worth nearly $1 billion to an organization with links to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his family and his government has exploded into a potential conflict of interest.

Federal Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is looking into the matter. On Friday, the federal Conservatives called on the police to launch a criminal investigation.

To sort out what this means for the Liberal government going forward, guest host Catherine Cullen asks CBC chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton and Toronto Star political columnist Susan Delacourt for their views.

Economic recovery from an unparalleled crisis

Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled the government's fiscal snapshot this week, revealing that Canada's deficit is expected to hit a staggering $343 billion this year.

That update was the first real glimpse of the federal government's finances since the pandemic brought much of the country's economy to a halt and the government began shelling out billions in emergency aid.

Warm and fuzzy polar fleece jackets might be one of the best ways to stay warm in chilly Canadian winters, but the environment would be a lot better off if you didn't put them through your laundry's spin cycle.

They're one of the culprits in a new report that describes how different types of clothing materials shed tiny fibres and become one of the most ubiquitous kinds of pollution on the planet: microplastics.

Microfibres shed by synthetic clothing wind up in the environment. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

""To put it really simply, everywhere we look on the planet, from the furthest reaches of the Himalayas to the Marianas Trench, from the Arctic waters of Canada down to Antarctica, from zooplankton, plankton, to fish to birds to marine mammals, we're finding microplastics,"" said Peter Ross, the vice-president of research at Ocean Wise, and an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Victoria.

It turns out every time you wash your clothes, they release tiny fibres into the wastewater that goes into streams, lakes, oceans and marine organisms. Wastewater treatment systems can capture most of these fibres, but a large volume still escapes. If those fibres are synthetic, like nylon or the polyester in fleece garments, they enter ecosystems and stay for very long times.

Home laundry releases massive amounts of microfibres into the environment every year. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

Ross's organization teamed up with industry, companies like Patagonia and Mountain Equipment Co-op, to get a handle on this problem as it relates to fibres our clothing shed.

He said the science is showing the microplastics in our environments are dominated by tiny microfibres originating from the washing of textiles, so they decided to look into how much different types of textiles shed.

Scientists tested 38 types of materials to see how much they shed. (Ocean Wise Conservation Association)

""The first finding, of course, is that every single item shed fibres. And the second finding is that despite the variation we found, even within polyester — the polyester fleece or the fluffy, the warm, the soft, cushy kinds of fabrics — those were the ones that shed the most,"" said Ross.

A kilogram sample of polyester fleece released as much as 4.5 million fibres in a single wash.

Nylon performance gear-type material didn't shed nearly as much likely due to design features such as the length of fibre and its tighter weave.

While natural fibres like wool and cotton also shed, those will eventually be broken down, unlike their synthetic counterparts. That said, Ross cautions against ditching synthetic materials because he says it's important to consider the entire footprint of the production process as well as its staying power in the environment.

Ratliff uses his experience (and the fact that he's still hung up on it) as a jumping off point for this podcast. He's here to solve the mystery: why did Tom Hanks fire him? Fans have likened his dogged pursuit of answers to something you'd find in true crime. Along the way, he also speaks to some notable friends from the entertainment industry about their own stories of failure. It's mystery-meets-personal audio journal-meets-pop culture interview show.

I've always been a fan of ""how I made it big"" type stories, but I love that podcasting has become a home for shows about failure. It's comforting to hear Cool People tell relatable stories about being awkward or crestfallen or unable to let go.

Wilson Cruz knows firsthand the power of television to alter perspectives and change lives.

The openly gay actor, who played gay teen Rickie Vasquez on the popular 1990s TV drama My So-Called Life, says the show helped him reconnect with his estranged father.

Cruz is one of the executive producers of Visible: Out on Television, a new docuseries from AppleTV+ that traces the highs and lows of LGBTQ representation on TV.

In an interview with Day 6 guest host Saroja Coelho, he looked back on that history and how his own onscreen roles have changed since the 1990s.

Here's part of that conversation.

In this TV series you describe your audition for My So-Called Life. What did you say to the casting director when you walked out of that audition?

We had just gone through the scene. I hadn't had many professional acting credits at that point, and so I didn't know if my audition was going to be good enough to get a callback.

And so before I walked out the door, I just had a real need to turn around and say to [the] casting director that had I seen a Rickie Vasquez on TV when I was 15 to 16 years old, it would have made a world of a difference to me.

I understood in my very first job the power of television and the responsibility that comes with it. - Wilson Cruz

To be able to see someone who looked like me, who represented my experience ... would have gone a long way to help me understand that things would be all right.

You were barely out of your teens yourself when My So-Called Life came out. How did the show affect your own life?

You know, I came out to my parents because of the show. My father threw me out of the house before we started filming the series and we didn't speak for a year.

It was the show that allowed me to have a conversation with my father again, because he was watching it and could ... understand a bit more about what my life has been like. [It] gave him the ability to reach out to me because of that.

It set me up for the rest of my career, as well, in the sense that I understood in my very first job the power of television and the responsibility that comes with it when you're making something like My So-Called Life. It's a gift to your audience that you're offering a view of the world that they perhaps wouldn't have received had it not been for you.

So it changed everything for me.

That really goes to the heart of what you're trying to do with this series. How important has TV been in changing public perception of the LGBTQ community?

I would argue that television has been our greatest tool, and that's really what the series is about.

It's about how the movement used this agent of change in order to tell the truth about who LGBTQ people are. We did it through scripted television, but it also came through the way we were covered in the news. And those depictions happened because people were fighting behind the scenes in order to make sure that they were being done in an honest and sensitive and truthful way.

And so this series is really about all of the people that really risked everything in order to do it.

When gay characters first started to appear on TV, most of them were played by straight actors — in part because so few actors were actually out at the time. How do you feel about that?

I'm grateful to them. You know, I think about somebody like Jane Alexander, who did a TV film with Gena Rowlands about a lesbian woman who was trying to keep parental rights after she divorced her husband and got into a relationship with a woman.

There weren't any openly lesbian actors who were willing or capable of taking on that role, and had someone like Gena Rowlands and Jane Alexander not stepped up with their name recognition and their respectful careers, that movie may never have been [made].

When you look back at some of those shows that were the early depictions of gay people on television, like Three's Company or Soap, which really walked a fine line between representing gay people and completely mocking them, how do you feel about those shows now?

Well, you know, there are two sides to those coins. We needed visibility, and I think especially in terms of Billy Crystal on Soap, it was a transitional time between when it was acceptable to mock LGBTQ people and the beginning of when we were being depicted as sympathetic.

And so you could tell that the audience didn't quite know how to react yet. They hadn't really been given permission to see themselves in these people yet. And so it was a difficult time in storytelling for LGBTQ people, who were still informing them about the truth of our lives.

When you look back on it, it was a very awkward growth period.

When was the first time that you watched television and thought, ""Yes that's that's close to my life. I can see myself in that""?

You know, I've said this before and I mean it: I didn't really see myself on TV until I saw myself on TV.

So many people talk about how we would try to find ourselves in shows that had nothing to do with us directly. That's why people love The Golden Girls so much: that's a chosen family, you know, with humour that was taken directly out of our own community.

So we would try to replace ourselves in those lives. It's this thing called the Tennessee Williams effect; you know, every female character that Tennessee Williams ever wrote was really a gay man. And we saw elements of that on television as well through shows like The Golden Girls or Designing Women or Sex in the City.

Now we're at a point where we're allowed to be those characters ourselves.

It has been 25 years since you played Rickie Vasquez on My So-Called Life. How have the characters you've played since then been different?

I think they've become different because I'm different. I think there's less explaining now about what being a gay man is. I'm given much more permission to just be and to exist without having to explain.

I mean, I think My So-Called Life and Rickie Vasquez were really an introduction. It was, you know, ""Gay Boy 101."" And now on Star Trek Discovery, there's no mention of the fact that we're gay.

It's just these two people are in love and are part of an epic love story ... and the most important thing about them is that they're part of a team that saves the world.

They are just like every other couple on that show. And that's the way it should be.

This is a two-part conversation: Listen to Part 1 | The Unconventional Diplomat: Breaking The Rules

Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein is perhaps best known as the outspoken UN High Commissioner for Human Rights — considered the world's moral-arbiter-in-chief — from 2014 to 2018. But he refused to run for a second term because he says it might have meant ""bending a knee in supplication"" before the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: United States, France, Russia, China and the United Kingdom.

""I didn't see my job as defending governments. Governments are more than capable of defending themselves. My job is not to defend them. Why should I excuse their behaviour? Why should I play to them? Why should I grovel before them?"" Al Hussein told Ideas producer Mary Lynk at his home in Harlem, New York.

""The job is to speak on behalf of all of those who are in detention, who are arbitrarily arrested, who are denied basic services, the right to education, the right to health, the right to adequate housing, clean drinking water.""

Al Hussein also points out Canada's failure to ratify the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. A bill supporting its implementation did pass the House of Commons, but not the Senate.

To those against the bill, Al Hussein says:

""... have some shame. Recognize what human suffering is. Money isn't everything. If it was, we would still have slavery. At some point, you draw a line and you say we will not, we will no longer behave in the way that we used to behave. And, we're going to change.""

Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein's granduncle was Iraq's last monarch, King Faisal. He led the Arab Revolt from 1916 to 1918, along with T.E. Lawrence, before becoming the ruler of Iraq. (Wikimedia)

A learned, eloquent man, Al Hussein has a PhD in philosophy from Cambridge University. He's been President of the UN Security Council and was the founding president of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.

But his pivotal moment in life came as a UN peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia in 1994 and 1995. He refers to this time as a formative experience and an anchor to his career.

Al Hussein admits that being a staunch defender of human rights does have side-effects.

""If you're a human rights defender, I think you've ought to have enough self-awareness to realize that within us, deep within us, we have the very failings of humanity itself.""

That humanity extends to devoting part of life to being of service to others, something he believes achieves deeper happiness and satisfaction in life.

""If everything revolves around you, everything is about you and the material, wealth or well-being, no matter how much of it you have, you're going to be still searching.""

""The question now isn't simply when and how our public bathrooms will reopen. It's whether the pandemic will be the tipping point that teaches people the truth about public bathrooms,"" Lezlie Lowe, a Halifax journalist and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs, wrote this week in The Walrus.

""[F]ar from being unhygienic, unsafe, or simply unimportant, with the correct distancing and cleaning measures, these facilities are a crucial part of any effective plan for preventing disease and easing inequity.""

Here is part of Lowe's conversation with As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal.

If you left the building that you're in right now in Halifax, how far would you have to walk to find a public bathroom?

Oh, my gracious. I don't even actually know how far I would have to walk. Quite a distance, I think.

How much more has this pandemic revealed about the issue of public bathrooms in this country?

What we've seen during the pandemic all across the country is that, in Canada, we really have a culture of relying on publicly accessible toilets, which is to say toilets that are in private businesses ... rather than public bathrooms, which are bathrooms that would be on streets, paid for by taxes and just considered part of the kind of basket of goods that we know we need to use our cities safely.

Stop signs and sidewalks and benches and trash cans — we know we need all those things. We don't really question paying for those things out of our municipal tax dollars. But bathrooms have really been left out of that in Canada and in other other parts of North America.

What we've seen with COVID is there's been this really big shutdown. And so not only have the few public bathrooms that are in many cities closed, but we've seen all these publicly accessible bathrooms closed. And all of a sudden people are like, ""Wait a minute, wait a minute,"" who really actually had pretty good access before. And now they're feeling what it's like to have diminished access.

Lowe is a Halifax journalist and journalism professor, and author of No Place To Go: How Public Toilets Fail Our Private Needs. (Riley Smith )

You've also written that bathrooms are about mobility. Elaborate on that.

When you look at any sort of municipal plan for any cities — and I did a lot of this research for my book — cities talk about walkability, they talk about livability, they talk about being pedestrian friendly and cyclist friendly, and a lot of talk about people aging in place.

None of those things are possible without a reasonable, accessible grid of public bathrooms because there is absolutely no way around the fact that bathrooms are needed by everybody every day of their lives.

Everybody uses the bathroom. And what we see in cities is you can go farther and you can stay out longer when you have access to that grid of public bathrooms.

We're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are. They're also kind of a joke - Lezlie Lowe, journalist and author

What's the holdup, then, here, do you think? You know, in Paris, I've seen automated toilets. In Istanbul, you can go to a mosque or WCs [water closets]. You know, you pay a few cents. Right across Europe, there's all of those examples. What's the hold up here?

We have a really different attitude toward bathrooms in, I would say, North America, and Canada particularly, than other places in the world.

The way I always describe it is when we're kids, we're taught that bathrooms are places where you do private things, which they are. They're also kind of a joke. You know, I wrote a book about public bathroom access. There's only two responses. People are either like, ""Ew, that's gross."" Or they're kind of like, ""Ha ha ha!""

So we have these really kind of almost neurotic responses to public bathrooms and we're taught that as kids. And what happens is when we become adults, we sort of lack the capacity for talking about, you know, the basic need to go to the bathroom, in a serious way. And I think that is actually borne out in the policy decisions of cities.

And people experiencing homelessness in cities, including Toronto, have talked about this in recent weeks as well. Access for them is an issue.

Yeah. And I mean, I'm sure that is exacerbated now.

We talk about COVID, but we also have to think about the other health risks that are actually around when we look at public bathrooms. And there's ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks due to public defecation. I mean, there's very serious health concerns that we need to take into account when we think about what the value of having public bathrooms is.

And on the issue of COVID, I suspect some municipal leaders might say, you know, we just can't keep up. You have to clean these facilities. They wouldn't be safe, especially during a pandemic. But in your most recent article about this in The Walrus, you say public bathrooms aren't really riskier than any other high-touch public spaces.

We do automatically think of public bathrooms as these sort of paragons of filth. And, yeah, they can get really dirty. But so can other spaces.

Public bathrooms are not a high risk for COVID for a couple reasons. One is that COVID is a respiratory illness. And so what we know is that we need to stay out of small spaces with shared air with strangers. That's the same as an elevator. Nobody is talking about closing every elevator in every high-rise because they're too risky. We're just putting mitigation factors in place. So, you know, we say only two people in an elevator.

The other issue is high-touch surfaces. Yes, there are high-touch surfaces in bathrooms, but there are also high-touch surfaces entering, you know, malls and public libraries and restaurants and elevators, for that matter. And so, yeah, there needs to be enhanced cleaning. That's no different than any other space right now as we're coping with the pandemic.

The one thing that I would say sets public bathrooms apart when we're talking about COVID is, ironically, the fact that we practise hand hygiene in public bathrooms. Public bathrooms are the places we go to help get the virus off of our hands. So that sort of puts, I would say, a greater onus on cities to do those reasonable control of access and sanitizing solutions, but also keeping bathrooms open because people need to wash their hands more than ever when it comes to this virus.

Andrew Chang looks into whether you’re likely to contract COVID-19 from using a public bathroom. 1:02

Any sense of the costs for cities to put these public washrooms in?

Bathrooms are not cheap. They are, if you're looking at the on-street automated toilets that you mentioned earlier, those can cost, you know, a quarter of a million dollars to install.

I think we have to ask ourselves, who do we want to be? What do we want as a society? Because when we talk about livability, we talk about walkability, when we talk about people aging in place, if we say we want those things, then we actually have to put in place the supports that support those things.

So I think that, yes, they are costly, but they are also necessary to human dignity and to the full and reasonable use of our cities.

Do you think the pandemic, as you wrote, will be a tipping point?

I can say that, you know, as the person who wrote the book on public toilets, I have never talked about public toilets so much as I have in the last four months. And I think that's fantastic.

Ontario will be the first province to release the app, even as some people raise privacy concerns.

But will it work?

To find out, Dr. Brian Goldman, host of The Dose talked to Dr. Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michael's Hospital, and professor of epidemiology at University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

So how do contact-tracing apps work?

They work on the premise that people who test positive have to voluntarily enter the information into the phone. By looking at who's been close to that phone through Bluetooth connections, they're able to let people know that they have been in contact with someone who might have had an infection. Then it's supposed to prompt those people to potentially get tested.

Bluetooth contact tracing: First, users download an app and enable bluetooth on their smartphones. Second, the app sends out a unique anonymized beacon to other devices nearby using the same app. Third, each phone records and securely stores beacons it comes in contact with. Fourth, the app downloads a list of beacons associated with anonymous app users who have tested positive for coronavirus. The device cross-checks those beacons with ones it came into contact with. If there is a positive result in the list, users receive a notification. (CBC)

How does the app know that I've tested positive for COVID-19?

It will only know if you enter that information into the app.

So there's two big conditions for the app. One, it involves people voluntarily putting in their positive status if they've been tested. The second is it works much better if it has high coverage.

What is the biggest benefit of a contact-tracing app?

If it encourages people to get tested then that's a good thing.... the app could help identify who's at higher risk, and those are the populations that need to get tested. But that'll all depend on how wide the coverage is. The experience of Iceland wasn't so positive. They found that only something like 35 per cent of the Iceland population took up a free app and it wasn't very useful. Likewise, the U.K. experience has been not so useful .

On the other hand, the German experience has been more positive . But I attribute that to the fact that they relied on not just the app but they also had people calling you when there was a positive case.

I think there's a human nature part of this. If I get a call from a concerned public health official saying I might have been exposed, I can interact with them. It's a human voice that's assuring me to get tested so I think the German results are good because they had a lot of people on the phones along with the app.

A recent poll of Canadians found that over half disapproved of mandating a contact-tracing app. Are we as Canadians too suspicious of the government for this app to even work?

We have to have the right balance. I think we should have more requirements to have everyone who is positive be reported and to perhaps be required to have the app.

I'm not too concerned about the privacy concerns personally because if the app is housed under public health agencies, they're not working with commercial vendors to sell your information or others. So in that sense, I trust the government more than I would Apple or Google because you know they're kind of figuring out ways of monetizing it.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveils a new smart phone application designed to warn people when they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. 2:39

We have to ask: What is our objective for the pandemic? The main objective is to prevent deaths in older people. If you're looking after older people or working at a nursing home, then you've got an extra obligation to make sure that you are protected. So in that case I would use the app.

If we get a second wave, our core strategy should be really that we're not going to prevent a little bit of infection here and there in the general population as much as we'd like to, but we should absolutely focus on stopping entry into seniors' homes because they're the ones getting killed by it.

121,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/books/80-things-to-know-about-master-short-story-writer-alice-munro-1.4088507,80 things to know about master short story writer Alice Munro,"['Cbc Books', 'Posted', 'Apr', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Literary legend Alice Munro celebrates her 89th birthday on July 10, 2020. The Canadian writer is revered worldwide as a master of the short story, with 14 acclaimed collections and a Nobel Prize to prove it.

Here are 80 facts about her remarkable life and writing career.

1. She was born Alice Laidlaw on July 10, 1931, in Wingham, Ont. Munro was raised on what she calls a ""collapsing enterprise of a fox and mink farm.""

2. Munro turned to short stories when she started writing because, as a housewife with three young daughters, she didn't have the time to devote to a novel. She thought she'd write short stories for a while, and found the form captivated her.

3. She would think about her stories during her babies' naps before she ever put pen to paper. But the problem with this scenario was that if another housewife knocked on the door, Munro couldn't really use ""thinking"" as an excuse to shoo the person away.

4. Despite her stratospheric success with the short story form, Munro often spoke of her wish to write a novel. ""I'm always trying,"" she told the Guardian in 2003. ""Between every book I think, well now, it's time to get down to the serious stuff.""

5. By the age of 14, she knew she wanted to be a writer. ""But back then you didn't go around announcing something like that,"" she said. ""You didn't call attention. Maybe it was being Canadian, maybe it was being a woman. Maybe both.""

7. Her first book of short stories, Dance of the Happy Shades, was written over a 15-year span.

8. When Munro got copies of the book from her publisher, she hid them in a closet so she wouldn't have to look at them. One night, she finally took out a copy and read it, and thought ""It's not as bad as I thought."" This book went on to win the Governor General's Literary Award in 1968.

9. Margaret Atwood read Dance of the Happy Shades in 1968, the year it was published in Canada. Atwood remembers being curled up beside a bar heater in freezing cold Edmonton when she read it and thinking ""This is the real thing — wow.""

10. Dickens's A Child's History of England was full of grisly beheadings. Munro would reframe the stories in the book with herself as the heroine, and change the endings: ""If I really liked my heroine in the story I didn't get her head chopped off — I changed the story so that wouldn't happen.""

12. Munro's childhood home was turned into a beauty parlour called Total Indulgence.

13. She graduated from Wingham District High School with the highest standing in her class in 1949.¹

14. She didn't attract much attention outside of Canada until her work began appearing in the New Yorker. Her first New Yorker story was Royal Beatings in 1977.

15. Acclaimed Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar based his film Julieta on a trio of Alice Munro stories — Chance, Soon and Silence from her 2004 collection Runaway.

16. According to Munro, no one in Clinton, Ont., where she's lived since the 1970s, knows who she is, ""or if they do, they're a little embarrassed.""

""I like that nobody here cares much about writing,"" she said. ""It allows me to feel quite free.""

17. Reading wasn't really encouraged in her family. Once it was obvious that Munro had turned into a serious reader, her mother referred to her as ""another Emma McClure!"" McClure was a recluse relative of theirs who, according to Munro, ""had been reading day and night for 35 years, with no time out to get married, learn the names of her nephews and nieces or comb her hair when she came into town.""

18. Munro's mother, Anne Laidlaw, started suffering the effects of Parkinson's disease when Munro was about 13 years old. As the eldest child, Munro had to take over much of the housework, but she said, ""It gave me a sense of responsibility, purpose, being important. It didn't bother me at all.""

19. Even when Munro became a housewife herself, it wasn't the housework she resented: ""Housework never really bothered me... what bothered me about it later was that it was expected to be your life... when you're a housewife you are constantly interrupted. You have no space in your life. It isn't the fact that you do the laundry.""

20. Out of high school, Munro won a two-year scholarship to the University of Western Ontario, but there was no money to continue. She thinks that had she finished her university degree, ""It might have made me a lot more cautious. It might have made me scared of being a writer.""

21. Going to university instead of staying home to look after her mother is something Munro still feels guilty about. She's called writing about her mother her ""central material in life... If I just relax, that's what will come up.""

22. Her first published story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, appeared in the University of Western Ontario's undergraduate creative writing magazine, Folio, in the spring of 1950. When the editor of the magazine read it, he ran down the hall waving his hands around, yelling ""You've GOT to read this!""

23. The Royal Canadian Mint issued a commemorative Alice Munro coin in 2014 to celebrate her Nobel Prize win. The coin's design includes a passage from her short story Messenger.

(Chad Hipolito/Canadian Press)

24. One of Munro's early stories, published in university, ended with a character saying ""Jesus Christ!"" This was very hard for her family.

25. She met her first husband, James Munro, at the university library. She was always hungry in university because she had little money for food. He was eating Peps — peppermints coated in chocolate. He dropped one on the floor and looked around before picking it up and eating it, to make sure no one saw him eat something off the floor. Alice looked at him and said ""I'll eat it.""

26. They got married at Christmastime. Alice Munro was 20 years old. She couldn't afford a big white dress, so she wore a burgundy velvet dress.

27. After her first story collection won the Governor General's Literary Award in 1968, Munro felt a lot of pressure to write a novel. She tried, to no avail. Her publisher, Douglas Gibson, told her, ""Alice, they're all wrong. You're a great short story writer. If you want to go on publishing short stories for the rest of your life, I'll go on publishing them.""

28. She spoke out against banning books on CBC in 1979, after the school board in her native Huron County banned her book Lives of Girls and Women from the Grade 12 syllabus.

The author speaks out against a Huron County school board that seeks to remove certain books from reading lists. 8:26

29. Both of her husbands, James Munro and Gerald Fremlin, were understanding and supportive of her writing, which she has described as a ""marvellous gift.""

30. From the ages of 25 to 35, Munro feared she didn't have the talent to be a writer. During this time, she threw out more writing than she finished and suffered from horrible writer's block and anxiety.

31. In 1963, she and her husband James opened a bookstore in Victoria, B.C. She credits working in Munro's Books with helping her overcome writer's block: ""The writing ceased to be this all-important thing that I had to prove myself with. The pressure came off."" She wrote two stories during her three years working in the store, and both were published.

32. The first day the bookstore opened they made $175, which they thought was ""marvellous.""

33. Munro credits her success as a writer partly to not heeding something that was often repeated within her family: ""You must recognize your limitations.""

34. She admitted in an interview that she'd smoked marijuana before, but didn't say what she thought about it.

35. She originally met her second husband, Gerald Fremlin, during university. Alice used to ride the bus with Fremlin's girlfriend, who would tell Alice all about him. Based on the stories, Alice thought the girlfriend was ""the most fortunate girl in the world.""

36. Fremlin sent Munro her first fan letter, about one of her stories published in the university magazine.

37. After Munro moved back to Ontario in 1973 upon the dissolution of her first marriage, Fremlin saw her being interviewed on the CBC by Harry Boyle. In the interview, Munro said she was divorced and living in London.

38. Fremlin phoned her up and told her he had one of her books, but then said, ""Well, it was Book of the Month Club.""

39. Canadian singer Measha Brueggergosman is such a big fan of Munro's that she once wrote her a fan letter, urging Munro to keep writing. ""I am so glad she followed my advice,"" Brueggergosman said jokingly. Brueggergosman defended Munro's The Love of a Good Woman on CBC's Canada Reads in 2004.

40. Munro said that she's drawn to writing about small towns because ""the small town is like a stage for human lives.""

41. After Munro won the Nobel Prize, 22 Minutes did this sketch in which Margaret Atwood (Cathy Jones) backhandedly compliments her.

42. She's thrown stories away and said she's never regretted doing it.

43. In her early story The Office, a woman rents an office to write and is so bothered by her landlord that she has to move out. This is autobiographical: Munro has never been able to write in an office, even when the landlords aren't bothersome.

44. Her grandmother used to read her stories when she was a young girl, and she remembers it being a wondrous experience — perhaps too good: ""It was a great disappointment when I tried to read them myself.""

45. Munro calls waiting around for reviews of her books ""a dumb way to live.""

46. Munro was the 13th woman — and second Canadian, after Saul Bellows — to win the Nobel Prize in literature. She was 82 when she won it.

47. In 2006, Margaret Atwood described Munro as having achieved ""international literary sainthood.""¹

48. She's been known to take her stories back from her publishers and re-work them after submitting them, even when the publishers don't agree that the story needs changing.

49. Sarah Polley adapted Munro's story The Bear Came Over the Mountain into the acclaimed feature film Away from Her after reading it in The New Yorker on a plane.

51. Munro's editor at The New Yorker since 2001, Deborah Treisman, has said that when she's reading Munro's stories, she'll sometimes cross out a line or a paragraph that seems extraneous, only to discover 20 pages later that it was absolutely vital.

52. Munro was very fond of a restaurant called Bailey's Fine Dining in Goderich, Ont.² The restaurant was decimated by a tornado that hit the town in 2011 and it never re-opened.³

53. As a young reader, she had a violent reaction to the misogyny in the work of Leo Tolstoy and D.H. Lawrence, saying it was ""like claws trying to fasten [her] down.""² It made her wonder, ""How can I be a writer when I'm the object of other writers?""

54. One of the most popular games amongst Munro's friends at elementary school was ""funerals,"" where one person got to be the corpse and the others would stage a mock funeral, complete with ""flowers"" (weeds) and a tearful viewing.²

56. Munro said that her own stories start in ""almost any old way at all that I can get into it.""

57. When Munro's father, Robert Laidlaw, was dying, he wrote a book. Munro made sure that it was published posthumously.² The novel was about pioneer families in the Southwest Interior and Munro said, ""he has real gifts as a writer.""

58. Munro once told her father that Margaret Laurence was a friend of hers, and he said, ""But Alice, she's a really good writer!""²

59. Two reporters from the Paris Review visited Munro in Clinton in 1994 and asked if she knew of any other local writers. She drove them past a tumbledown house where a bare-chested man sat on the back stoop typing on a typewriter, surrounded by cats. ""I don't know him,"" Munro told them, ""but I'm dying of curiosity to find out what he's up to.""

60. It typically takes her at least a month to write a story and she doesn't show works in progress to anyone.

61. While she was writing The Lives of Girls and Women, Munro was looking after her three daughters as well as one of her daughter's friends. She also worked at Munro's Books two days a week. She would write until 1 a.m. and wake up at 6 a.m., and became concerned she would die of a heart attack.

62. She named Audrey Atkinson, the nurse character in her story Friend of My Youth, after a real person. There was an auction to raise money for the Blyth Theatre near where she lives in Clinton, and one of the prizes was to have the winning bidder's name go into Munro's next story. The honour cost Ms. Atkinson $400.

63. Munro taught creative writing at York University in Toronto in 1973, but quit because she hated her class, which was all male except for ""one girl who hardly got to speak."" She called their writing ""incomprehensible and trite; they seemed intolerant of anything else.""

64. She credits the Southern writers Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter and Carson McCullers with validating her desire to write about small towns and rural people.

66. Munro sees herself as ""a friendly person who is not very sociable.""

67. In her house in Clinton, Munro would write at a small desk in the corner of the dining room, facing a window overlooking the driveway.

68. She acknowledges that she wrote a lot about people's clothes in her early stories, and credits that to not having the clothes she wanted when she was younger.

69. Munro fell in love with the stories of Anton Chekhov as a teenager and was dazzled by the ""extreme importance he'd give to ordinary life and ordinary people."" She calls discovering his literary style a ""revelation.""

Fact: Global News⁹

71. Of the autobiographical pieces in her collection Dear Life, Munro said, ""I never kept diaries. I just remember a lot and am more self-centred than most people.""

72. Growing up, Munro was hounded by her aunts and grandparents to ""master the arts of knitting and darning."" She once shocked them by telling them she planned to actually throw things out when she grew up, rather than mend them.

73. She knows a lot about her characters: ""what clothes they'd choose, what they were like at school, what happened before and what will happen after the part of their lives I'm dealing with.""

74. She said she finally ""came out of the closet"" as a writer at about 40 years of age.

Well, this guy can't","['Paul Aflalo', 'Posted', 'Sep', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated', 'December']",,"In 2010, Tom Ebeyer learned that something about his brain was different.

Walking home from a party with his then-girlfriend, he discovered there was such a thing as a mind's eye — and he didn't have one.

As Ebeyer remembers it, he and his girlfriend were chatting about an old friend they hadn't seen in a while, ""when my girlfriend says to me, 'Joanne was wearing the same thing that she was wearing last time we saw her, a year ago.'""

""I was like, 'How on earth do you remember what she was wearing? And she says to me, 'Oh, I see a picture of her clearly in my mind.'""

""And I just did not understand,"" the Mississauga, Ont., man said.

Ebeyer would go on to learn that he had something called aphantasia — though, at the time of the party, it didn't even have a name yet.

Tom Ebeyer, left, with his sister and mom. Growing up, Ebeyer couldn't describe how his mind was different. (Submitted by Tom Ebeyer)

No mental pictures

What exactly is aphantasia? Close your eyes and picture a horse — what the horse looks like, what's around it.

If you were able to see a horse in your mind, then you have a mind's eye. But aphantasics like Ebeyer can't visualize anything in their minds.

For Ebeyer, this would come to a head whenever he was told to imagine something, like in a guided meditation — and he could never figure out what that meant.

""I remember feeling confused, I remember feeling extremely frustrated with the 500 blogs about how you could just meditate and you can visualize,"" remembered Ebeyer, ""and it would just drive me crazy… what are you talking about?""

When Tom Ebeyer realized he couldn't picture things in his head, he thought he was missing out on something. But once he learned there was a name for the way his brain worked — aphantasia — he started to see the strengths. 1:00

After Ebeyer discovered this about himself, he talked to anyone who would listen, and realized that his differences extend further than the mind's eye. All of the senses are involved.

""If you go to a restaurant and you see something on the menu that you enjoy, you can smell and taste it. I can't do that.""

""Or if you think of a song that you like, you can hear the sounds of the instrument in your mind. I could maybe hum to the rhythm of the music, but I don't actually hear the sound.""

So what does imagination mean for those with aphantasia? Ebeyer described it as ""words and numbers just in my head,"" a kind of inner monologue.

Professor Adam Zeman coined the term 'aphantasia' in 2015 after gathering data from 21 people around the world. (Submitted by Adam Zeman)

The science of aphantasia

Research into aphantasia is still in its infancy, and there's lots to explore. For one, aphantasia, exists on a spectrum, where there are some who lack a mind's eye, but have a mind's ear. There are also hyperphantasics, who are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum. Those with hyperphantasia have very strong mental imagery.

Descriptions of the trait started popping up in medical journals as early as the 1880s, but the term ""aphantasia"" is fairly new.

It all started in 2005, when Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology at the University of Exeter in the U.K., encountered a patient who had lost the ability to imagine after undergoing a medical procedure.

""He was a very bright man in his mid-60s who had previously had a very vivid, visual imagination,"" said Zeman. ""And following this coronary procedure, he just found that he no longer could call images to the mind's eye.""

After running a series of tests, Zeman published an article describing this patient's case as ""Blind Imagination.""

Nearly a decade later, Ebeyer was talking to a colleague about his inability to imagine, and she brought up Zeman's paper. Ebeyer got his hands on the paper and eagerly reached out to Zeman, in the hopes that he might have some answers.

It turns out that Ebeyer was one of 21 people who contacted Zeman, ""who said that they recognized themselves in the description of [the patient], but they'd always been this way,"" Zeman said.

Zeman sent Ebeyer and the 20 others a series of questionnaires, including a VVIQ, a vividness of visual imagery questionnaire , which was designed to rate one's visual imagery.

Ebeyer and the others scored very, very low.

Tom Ebeyer can experience his senses — like the view of a lake — in the moment. But he can't conjure them up later. (Submitted by Tom Ebeyer)

After compiling this data, Zeman gave the neurodifference a name: aphantasia. ""Fantasia was the word Aristotle had used to describe the power of imagination,"" explained Ebeyer, ""so aphantasia is without.""

Finally, there was clarity for Ebeyer and other aphantasics. There was a word to describe how they perceive the world, but more importantly, they were no longer alone.

Two of a kind

Ebeyer had never actually met another aphantasic in person until this past summer, when documentary maker Paul Aflalo connected him with a London, Ont., woman.

Amanda Jacobs, 25, realized she didn't have a mind's eye in early 2019. In fact, her discovery was eerily similar to Ebeyer's.

""I was reading an article… about someone who'd had a form of surgery,"" said Jacobs, ""and he woke up from the surgery and claimed that he could not see in his mind, and I'm like, OK, what is this 'seeing in your mind' thing?""

Amanda Jacobs, 25, had never met a fellow aphantasic before meeting Tom Ebeyer. (Paul Aflalo/CBC)

When Ebeyer and Jacobs met over coffee, they quickly realized their similarities. Like Ebeyer, Jacobs can't conjure any of the senses — sight, sound, taste, smell, touch — independently of experiencing them in that moment.

And for both Ebeyer and Jacobs, this extended further, to emotions and feelings.

""I have an emotional detachment to most of anything that's ever happened, unless it's right after the fact,"" said Jacobs. ""I remember the facts of what happened, but that emotional response, I don't feel it again.""

Tom Ebeyer can remember events, but he can't re-live the emotions he felt at the time. He explains how his aphantasia makes him literally incapable of holding a grudge. 0:46

Ebeyer could relate. In 2007, Ebeyer's mother passed away unexpectedly, and though it was deeply emotional for him when it happened, it's now just a memory with no feelings attached.

""I know that that happened in my past,"" said Ebeyer, ""but that does not in any way affect my emotional well-being at this moment.""

For Ebeyer and Jacobs, meeting each other meant feeling, possibly for the first time, that they weren't alone. ""It's validating,"" Ebeyer said to Jacobs, ""you've explained things… similar to the way I would explain them.""

Now that Tom has a word for the way his brain works, he can better explain his differences. (Paul Aflalo/CBC)

""It's really cool,"" agreed Jacobs. ""Because when I talk to my friends, my family, they just kind of [go] 'Yeah, whatever you say,' and I'm like, 'No, this is real!'""

Nearly nine years after walking home from that party, Ebeyer feels a sense of belonging amidst his difference. He's since started a website devoted to aphantasia and a discussion forum.

""There's an acceptance, and validation. There's also a lot that's happened in the last nine years, and I'm confident we'll know more in the next ten years.""

It wasn't until his twenties that Tom Ebeyer realized that his brain worked differently than others: he has aphantasia, a rare condition where people are unable to visualize things in their mind. 6:12

The nutty-flavoured, crunchy cereal that, perhaps, appealed to generations who responded to advertising slogans like ""it fills you up, not out"" and ""if you love yourself and love staying healthy, eat a nutritious breakfast including Grape-Nuts cereal.""

It's not a common sight in Canadian cereal aisles anymore, but can still be commonly found in many ice cream freezers — as an ingredient in grapenut ice cream.

Unless you are looking for it in, say, Alberta.

""It's something that you just can't find [outside Atlantic Canada],"" according to Karen Walls, who grew up in Nova Scotia but now lives in southern Alberta.

""Once the ice cream is gone, you still have something left to chew. It just added some pizzazz to the ice cream,"" she explained.

Her favourite flavour contains neither grapes nor nuts, but it's one of several unique ice cream flavours that started in Nova Scotia, but is much harder to find elsewhere.

No cereal means no ice cream

According to Industry Canada, there were more than 100 employers in the ""Ice Cream and Frozen Dessert Manufacturing"" category in 2019.

Four of those were in Nova Scotia. And the rest of them don't seem to be making flavours like grapenut.

That drives Karen Walls, well, nuts.

""Two weeks ago we were grocery shopping, my husband I, and I said, 'I need grapenut ice cream!' ... like I'm really missing it. It's like missing lobster to me … feels like home,"" said Walls, who used to be able to get her favourite variety — sometimes described alternatively as brown bread or bran-flavoured — in Western Canada.

But the supply of Grape-Nuts for western manufacturers like the Foothills Creamery in Calgary dried up.

""It became impossible to find the Grape-Nuts cereal. It was actually supposed to be discontinued a few years back,"" explained Alex Kubinski, brand manager at Foothills Creamery in Calgary.

Temporarily, Foothills actually had an employee's friend who lived in the United States bring up Grape-Nuts cereal from Montana for them to use.

""But now, it just got to the point where it's just not feasible to drive down south and buy it.""

Another ice cream shop in Calgary told CBC Radio that they'd bring back dozens of boxes of Grape-Nuts cereal in their suitcases while on vacation in Florida — just to put into their ice cream to sell by the scoop.

Other than smuggling bran-flavoured cereal and bran-like accessories in one's suitcase, your alternative in Canada for mainstream distribution is to get the ice cream from the Scotsburn Ice Cream Company in Truro, N.S.

""We are among the very few manufacturers carrying this flavour in Canada,"" wrote Diane Jubinville in an emailed statement to The Cost of Living.

But Scotsburn would not reveal just how much grapenut ice cream they sell, citing competitive reasons.

It's not the only unusual Nova Scotian ice cream

Grapenut ice cream isn't as odd as it gets when it comes to eastern ice creams.

Try moon mist — a combination of banana, grape and bubble gum ice cream.

""It's so extra! In colour, in flavour, in everything,"" said Jennifer E. Crawford, who is quite possibly the biggest moon mist fan in Canada.

The winner of Masterchef Canada features the flavour — and its colour combinations — on their social media frequently. Not just in food, but in clothing choices, manicures and even a crocheted blanket!

But moon mist, however unusual you may consider it, is less of a challenge to locate across Canada. Instagram posts and social media popularity could be one reason why, but ingredients are also a contributor.

Flavour extracts like banana, grape or bubble gum are far easier to source in Canada than Grape-Nuts cereal.

Why Nova Scotia?

But why are these unusual ice cream flavours — grapenut or moon mist are just two examples — popping up in Nova Scotia and not elsewhere?

""If you look at Atlantic Canada, we were somewhat isolated when it came to the beginning of what is basically the industrial food system,"" explained Simon Thibault, food journalist and author based in Halifax.

Simon Thibault, a food writer based in Halifax, says Atlantic Canada was uniquely positioned to come up with its own ice cream flavours. (CBC)

According to Thibault, the major points where the Atlantic regions were able to gain access to frozen or canned foods were when the regions were having to make these items for themselves.

A flavour like grapenut wasn't just limited to Nova Scotia, but it was regionally focused. For example, Thibault said the ice cream is easily found in Maine.

Dear <a href=""https://twitter.com/cbccostofliving?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cbccostofliving</a>, grape nut ice cream is essentially a *key* dessert choice in Jamaica, alongside rum n raisin... —@thornhillyardie

As well, there's a unique appeal to going to a creamery or ice cream parlour for a distinctive treat in a province like Nova Scotia.

""Halifax has a population of nearly half a million people, but the province itself has just close to a million … that means that half of the entire province lives in a rural area and so not everybody is going to gain access to all those kind of fun summer treats in their grocery store,"" explained Thibault.

While a grocery store might need more extensive availability and distribution, smaller regional ice cream parlours can experiment more, according to Thibault.

""A lot of those flavours are not available usually in your grocery store. So things like, for the longest time, moon mist … was not available in grocery stores for a very long time.""

Okay but back to grapenut — how do they get it?

So at the end of the day, how does Nova Scotia get its grapenut ice cream? Remember, the Grape-Nuts cereal has been discontinued in Canada, which Post Consumer Brands confirmed in a Facebook post online.

And while the Scotsburn Creamery would not explain their sourcing for CBC Radio, it's unlikely they are stuffing boxes of healthy cereal in their suitcases to come across the border after Florida vacations.

A former president of the company did tell CBC that Scotsburn's supply, at least during his time, was legitimately imported from the United States.

But for anyone else looking to buy large quantities of grapenut ice cream outside of Atlantic Canada, you may be out of luck until and unless Grape-Nuts — the cereal — comes back to Canada.

For now, the bran-flavoured treat may remain a very small scoop in the more than $55 million ice cream industry in Canada. Maybe try switching to moon mist if you need a Haligonian frozen treat?",[]

Promises by Montreal's police chief to conduct street checks in a less discriminatory manner are ringing hollow for community members who have been advocating for an end to the practice shown to disproportionately target people of colour.

Chief Sylvain Caron announced the new street check policy Wednesday to guide how the SVPM will stop and question people unrelated to a specific crime. Street checks often involve collecting identifying information, or carding.

Last year, a report commissioned by the city of Montreal found that Black and Indigenous people were four to five times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.

But Caron stopped short of banning the practice outright, despite calls from community organizations to do so.

Activist and law student Balarama Holness is one of the people who has been pushing for police reform in Montreal. He spoke to As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal. Here is part of their conversation.

Montreal's police chief said today street checks will now be based on observable facts and not, ""discriminatory motives."" Do these changes go far enough for you?

They're just conforming with existing law. It's unclear by that statement if they're admitting that previously those street checks were based on discrimination…. It is nothing new.

Before this, there were no rules at all about when a police officer could stop someone in Montreal. Do you see some progress here at least?

There were rules because, the Canadian charter establishes that you cannot arbitrarily detain someone or you cannot arbitrarily arrest someone.

But in terms of what Montreal police were adhering to, they didn't have a code of conduct for this in their guidelines.

Yes, but the Montreal police for many years have established that any form of racial profiling was against the policy, was against the Canadian constitution, was against the Quebec Constitution. And anti-discrimination policies were part of the SPVM framework. We community organizations have been through multiple commissions throughout the years stating this fact.

So for us, what we are looking for is sanctions that would be attributed to discriminatory behaviours, and possibly, people in management, giving them the tools to be able to identify police officers who are disproportionately targeting people of colour. That, we didn't see.

Perez, leader of Ensemble Montréal, said the SPVM's plan gives false hope and only re-enforces the status quo. 1:57

Let's go through some of the reasons the chief, Sylvain Caron, says that street checks will still be allowed. The first that they outlined is to help someone in need.

That's an interesting component because there have been multiple killings [by police] in Montreal. And the [reason for police action] was because someone was in need, but it was someone under psychological duress. So Pierre Coriolan, for example — he was going through a psychosis and police came and he ended up being shot and killed.

So there are certain instances where we do not need police officers intercepting or carding people in need. Rather, you need a psychologist or a social worker. They're intervening in the wrong circumstances [and] that sometimes results in death.

Montreal Police Chief Sylvain Caron says the goal of the SPVM's newly unveiled policy is to maintain a climate of trust during police interactions. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada)

One of the other reasons the chief says that street checks should continue to go ahead, and will continue to go ahead, is to ""collect information in line with a Montreal police mission."" What do you make of that exception?

Their mission is certainly to protect Montrealers or public security, but that's very vague. So I think that that's not ... a good reason to continue street checks.

I would remind people that Nova Scotia banned police street checks and carding because they found that it was not resulting in any additional catching [of] criminals or anything of the sort.

So when you have vague statements like that that say we're doing this to uphold, you know, our mission or our vision, that opens the door for arbitrary detention. And that's why people are unhappy with the report.

So, have you been stopped?

I was stopped when I was 18 years old; I was thrown in the back of a cop car for loitering. My friends and I were in the streets playing basketball and kind of being rowdy. And we were intimidated. A police officer put me in the back of his car. He let me go because I didn't commit any crime.

But there are multiple instances where especially young people of colour are intimidated by police officers. And Dr. Anne- Marie Livingstone, a fellow at Harvard University, did research [that found] police officers do intercept, card and intimidate especially young, vulnerable, people. And that is a continuing problem.

Boreal peatlands around the world, including Canada's vast north, are important for storing carbon, but a new study suggests that climate change may slowly dry them. This could lead to persistent carbon releases and increase the risk of fires in peatlands as well as in surrounding forests.

The boreal forest covers a large parts of the northern terrestrial landscape, and about 15 per cent of it is peatland. However, the way that peatlands interact with the atmosphere has not been well understood. As a result, most global climate models make the assumption that the boreal landscape is entirely forest. This could mean they don't model the north accurately.

A new study led by Manuel Helbig, from the School of Geography and Earth Sciences at McMaster University, working with a team of nearly 60 scientists from around the world, may help change that.

Peatlands serve as natural fire breaks as long as they stay wet (Manuel Helbig)

Warm air may dry out peatlands

Peatlands are generally very wet areas in which the ground is saturated and mosses and shrubs build up on top of each other, so a thick layer of dead organic material is overlain by a living layer.

Helbig and his colleagues looked at the critical question of how fast peatlands will dry in a warming climate. Trees have adaptations to hold onto their water in warming conditions. But Helbig and his colleagues observed that because the mosses that make up the living layer of peat have no such mechanism, peatlands have no way of retaining water. As a result, in warmer conditions, increased evaporation can literally suck the water out of peatlands.

Observations of evaporation from stations in boreal landscapes around the world demonstrated this.

Observation towers like this one in the Scotty Creek watershed in the Northwest Territories can monitor evaporation from the landscape (Manuel Helbig)

Where there's dry peat, there may be fire

As the peatlands dry, the living plants no longer absorb carbon, and the drying dead plant material decomposes, releasing stored carbon, which contributes to further warming.

This, according Helbig, is not the end of the story. Not surprisingly, drier peatlands may also burn more easily than wet ones, releasing more carbon dioxide. And wet peatlands tend to act as fire breaks in the boreal landscape. Drying peatlands will be less effective.

Climate models do suggest the possibility that increased rainfall will compensate for increased evaporation in a warmer climate. Helbig is concerned, however, that there may not be enough precipitation to keep pace with the rate at which peatlands are losing water due to warming temperatures.

Now, he says the opposite is true.

Neasloss is the elected chief councillor of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, and the co-author of a new study on the genome of the spirit bear, a.k.a. Kermode, a rare, white-furred variant of the black bear in B.C.'s Central and North Coast regions.

The research found that the bears — which are culturally significant to Indigenous Peoples in the area — are less common than previously believed, and that more work needs to be done to protect them.

""It's probably one of the rarest bears on the planet,"" Neasloss told As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal. ""And through our latest research, we found out it's a lot more rare than we thought.""

The study was published in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence .

His first 'magical' encounter with a spirit bear

Neasloss is the resource stewardship director of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation, whose people have a deep connection with the spirit bear.

But he didn't even know they existed until he saw one up close for the first time in the early 2000s.

He was working as an ecotourism guide in central B.C. when his supervisor told him to go look for one.

""I thought they were just pulling my leg,"" he said. ""I never heard about it in my community.""

Nevertheless, he set off on a hike to explore the forest.

""A few minutes into the trek, I basically almost came face-to-face with a spirit bear. And here he was walking across the forest with a salmon in his mouth,"" Neasloss said.

""I'll never, never forget that moment.""

As the creature plopped down in front of Neasloss to feast on its fish, he says the clouds parted and the sun shone down.

""And there was the spirit bear, pure white coat. And he was sitting there eating the salmon, and you see all the blood on his face,"" Neasloss said.

""And that was certainly a very magical moment and kind of helped propel me into sticking with tourism.""

Combining science with First Nations knowledge

When Neasloss asked his nation's elders why he had never heard of the bear, he says they told him they kept quiet about the animal to protect it from those who would hunt it for its fur.

""So it was kind of a big secret. Up until, you know, kind of the late '90s, nobody really knew about spirit bears,"" he said.

Now, the spirit bear is the provincial mammal of British Columbia, a major tourist draw, and a powerful symbol for conservation efforts.

""[In] today's day and age, I think we're starting to shift our focus and trying to be a bit more vocal with it, because ... these bears are under a number of threats.""

Still, Neasloss says very little is known about spirit bears. That, he argues, makes it hard to enact policies to protect them.

It's also why he participated in the study, which was an eight-year collaboration between First Nations stewards from the Kitasoo/Xai'xais and Gitga'at First Nations, the University of Victoria, the Spirit Bear Research Foundation and the Raincoast Conservation Foundation.

""We thought we would drive the science ourselves,"" he said.

""We also merged our science with First Nations knowledge and hopefully are able to provide some strong information to decision makers so we can do more to protect them.""

Researchers worked with members of the First Nations to collect fur samples from 385 black bears along 18,000 square kilometres of the Great Bear Rainforest using non-invasive wire corrals and ""extremely stinky"" scented lures.

The bears were drawn to the alluring scent of fish oil or beaver anal gland secretions and would rub up against the wire for a good scratch.

Scientists were then able to study the samples in the lab to determine how many bears carried the recessive gene that produces the unique reddish-white coat on some black bears — the same gene that causes red hair in humans.

""CSI-style, from each hair, we determined the individual bear's genetic fingerprint, sex, species and for black bears, the specific carriers of the spirit bear gene,"" Christina Service, wildlife biologist for the Kitasoo/Xai'xais Stewardship Authority, told the Vancouver Sun.

The gene that produces the spirit bear's white fur is rarer than previously believed, according to a new study. (Jonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press)

They discovered the genetic variance is 50 per cent rarer than previous estimates.

They were also able to map the populations and found that only half of the areas with high concentrations of spirit bears are protected.

From science to advocacy

Armed with this information, Neasloss now hopes he and his colleagues can convince governments to create new conservation areas aimed specifically at protecting the creatures.

""The spirit bear is very important in our part of the region. There's a few communities that revere it as a very sacred animal,"" he said.

""I would say it's not just important culturally, but also in terms of economics. I mean, we built a tourism lodge and this is one of the only places in the world that you can come and view a spirit bear.""

127,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/how-ramy-youssef-finds-humour-in-religion-and-his-own-muslim-faith-1.5642656,How Ramy Youssef finds humour in religion — and his own Muslim faith,"['Cbc Radio', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"When comedian Ramy Youssef was doing stand-up, he began to notice a pattern.

When he performed for conservative Muslim audiences, they would get uncomfortable when he started talking about sex.

When he performed midnight shows at comedy clubs, audiences would get just as uncomfortable when he talked about having genuine religious faith.

Those tensions helped to inspire Ramy, an eponymous comedy show about an Arab-Muslim family living in New Jersey.

The program — which also features Oscar winner Mahershala Ali as Sheikh Ali Malik — captures the push and pull between religion and everyday life, or as Youssef puts it, ""Friday prayers and Friday night.""

""That central tension was really important for me to bring out because I felt like there were no depictions of faith or being religious that felt organic to me in the on-screen world,"" says Youssef in an interview with q host Tom Power.

The Christian film genre feels highly sanitized, almost a commercial for the religion, he says, and other films feature priests gone bad or Muslim leaders linked to terrorist organizations.

""All these really blown-out concepts. So for me, this space that is so real for people who do believe, and for people who are navigating that, was the central focus of what I wanted to make,"" he explains.

""If anything, it's more about a person of faith of my generation than it is even specifically about being Muslim.""

'If other people are the problem then so am I'

Religion itself has become such a punch line in modern society, adds Youssef, that tackling religious belief in comedy actually seems edgy.

However he doesn't fault people who are averse to religious culture because, as he puts it, religion has become an industry.

""The way that these real emotions and these real ideals have been manipulated for a lot of bad and a lot of darkness and a lot of shame that is leveraged toward entire societies, the idea that there would be so much anti-religion is completely justified,"" he says.

""And I am very anti-religious culture on the whole. But I connect to faith — and those are different things.""

Youssef says he doesn't have a problem with Islam; rather, he has a problem with its followers. But Youssef isn't pointing fingers at his Muslim culture or community; rather, the show is about pointing a finger at the follower he knows best: himself.

""The core of my work is self-examining, because if other people are the problem then so am I,"" he says.

""I'm not exempt from looking at my hypocrisies and my gaps between what I believe and what I actually do.""

'I'm going to keep this to myself'

For his performance, Youssef won a Golden Globe earlier this year, a Peabody this week, and is a likely contender for Emmy consideration later this year.

The show primarily centres around Youssef's character, but it also features his family and friends — a fact not lost on his father, who has adjusted his behaviour accordingly.

""He'll be in the middle of telling me a story and he'll just cut it off and be like, 'You know what? I'm going to keep this to myself. I'm not trying to have this show up in your stand-up,"" recounts Youssef, who tells the story of his dad's unlikely connection to Donald Trump in his HBO special Ramy Youssef: Feelings.

""And I'm like, 'No, man, I only told, like, two bits about you. I don't mention you that much. We can just talk.'""

In the show, Youssef plays a version of himself — a millennial who's trying to forge his own identity and figure out how religion, relationships and his family fit into his life.

But Youssef, who is Ramy's co-creator, writer and executive producer, reserves the most cutting humour for his own character, and avoids protecting the protagonist or trying to make him look good.

""I really wanted to look at the ego-heavy version of myself. I really wanted to look at what would my life looked like if I went left in the fork as opposed to right,"" says Youssef.

'We all walk around with questions'

He's always been fortunate, he adds: his family is communicative, he has a passion for his work, and he got involved in comedy and film at a young age.

""I've always had this focus, but so much of the character I created for the show is, 'What if I didn't have that? What if I was really succumbing to my ego? What if I didn't find answers to certain questions and I was a little bit more stuck?""

Many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind. - Ramy Youssef

The second season of Ramy was just released on Hulu and Crave. And while the subject matter is serious, and the show tackles pressing issues of racism and anti-Muslim sentiment, Youssef emphasizes that the last thing he's aiming to do is offer answers.

""I think we all walk around with questions and there's even a thought that we're all actively trying to answer our questions, but I would argue that many of us live our lives numbing ourselves, hoping that we don't have to think about the things that are actually in our heart, and in our mind,"" he says.

""My goal in opening up some of these things is to bring people closer to whatever questions they might have.""

Imagine a human-powered trampoline with two dozen people pulling a seal hide tight, while a person stands in the centre. That person is then thrown 20 feet into the air.

That's the blanket toss — or nalukataq as its known in northern communities — and it's a common practice for celebration in the northern parts of the Northwest Territories and Alaska.

But, the first time Reggie Joule tried the blanket toss, he was shaken up.

Joule stood on the seal hide and was thrown 20 feet into the air — but instead of landing back on the hide, he drifted in the air and was about to hit the ground.

Then, he was caught by someone in the crowd he didn't know. After he thanked the man, he walked away — but, unbeknownst to him, he walked right back onto the seal hide.

""The men, the pullers, immediately lifted the skin back up and threw me again,"" Joule said.

""I think that experience, walking back on it, even though accidentally, unintentionally cured my fear.""

Joule, who is also a retired Inupiat politician, said the blanket toss was first used as a way for Inupiat to see for miles down the horizon while hunting. It took a lot of people to see a little ways, and it was retired once they figured out a better way to look for game.

""I think people quit using the blanket toss for looking off in the distance once the binoculars were introduced,"" Joule said.

Reggie Joule, a former Alaskan politician, is also a blanket toss champion at the American Indian Eskimo Games. (The Associated Press)

Today, the blanket toss is used for celebration and competition. Joule's accidental walk on to the hide spurred an award-winning career at the World Eskimo Indian Olympics, and he was even on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in 1973 to talk about it.

Joule was invited back 10 years later by Carson, even though the cohort from the World Eskimo Indian Olympics gave Carson an oosik, or a whale's penis, as a keepsake from their time in 1973 as a joke.

Joule remembered Carson dropping the oosik upon learning what it was, but afterwards being very gracious.

The World Eskimo Indian Olympics brought Joule to the southern parts of the U.S. for the first time and gave him a chance to see other parts of the world — and he's not done yet.

The 67-year-old jumped back on the skin this summer.

""I've gained a little weight and I had to find a way to energize the guys because I'm a little heavier than I should be,"" Joule said. After teasing them, saying there was no way he could do a backflip with their energy, he started to feel it.

""I felt that energy — sure enough, I got at least enough height to pull off a backflip and land on my feet and keep my balance.""

The blanket toss has been a huge part of Joule's life, and he said it represents many Inupiat values.

""If you were to take quite literally the saying, 'it takes a community to raise a child,' and apply it to the blanket toss, that's it,"" he said.

""While we may get to a certain point of progression … the back story is there's a lot of people along the way that helped to make all of that happen.

""I think that, to me, is the biggest takeaway and I think that applies to just about anything we do.""",[]

To say that Cherie Dimaline's last book, The Marrow Thieves, was a hit is an understatement.

Featured on Canada Reads 2018, the YA novel was #1 bestselling Canadian book in independent booksellers across Canada in 2018, won a host of awards, including the Governor General's Literary Award for young people's literature — text.

Dimaline's latest book is a novel for adults titled Empire of Wild. Inspired by the Métis legend of the werewolf-like Rougarou, the book follows Joan, a broken-hearted woman whose husband disappeared a year ago — only to return with a new name and with no memory of his past. The novel was selected as Indigo's best book of the year in 2019 .

The Vancouver-based writer spoke with Shelagh Rogers about writing Empire of Wild.

The pressure of success

""I honestly have never been more terrified in my life to write a book after The Marrow Thieves — and I've given birth three times! I visited a lot of schools while touring for that book and one of the first questions the students would have for me is, 'When is the sequel coming?'

""I would say, 'I don't have a sequel. I'm working on a different story.' They would literally boo me! The kids were so invested in The Marrow Thieves. And after the amazing success of that book, suddenly people wanted to know what was next. So I felt a lot of pressure.

Empire of Wild was the book that comes after The Marrow Thieves because it is based on a traditional story that my grandmother used to tell me all the time.

""But this great thing happened — I remembered that I am here to tell stories. The stories I tell are from the community, my heart and from my family. Empire of Wild was the book that comes after The Marrow Thieves because it is based on a traditional story that my grandmother used to tell me all the time. Writing the book really allowed me to fall in love with the art of story — and forget about the business of story.""

The legend of the Rougarou

""My community is across the bay from an Ontario town called Penetanguishene. There was one road that would lead from the town to the community and back. When I was a little girl, one of the stories that we used to hear from my grandmother and her sisters — to keep girls like me in line — was of the Rougarou.

""I know the Rougarou is different in every Métis community. In mine, he's a big black dog who also kind of looks like a man. He is a snappy dresser — he wore suits, a fedora and moccasins — and he is an amazing fiddler. He had a seductive quality to him, he would lure women and would cause great harm to those girls who stayed out too late, strayed off the main road and were in places they weren't supposed to be.

""For the people who identified as male in our the community, the Rougarou was the story of what you could turn into if you broke the rules of the community. It was like a curse.""

Writing female characters

""I had so much fun writing Joan in Empire of Wild. One of my earliest experiences with how women and sex are perceived in publishing was when I had just written the first part of my 2013 novel The Girl Who Grew a Galaxy. I initially wrote a female character in that book who was very sex positive. She made her own decisions and she wasn't victimized.

""She was an Indigenous woman character who enjoyed sex — within consent lines — but didn't make any apologies. But no one in the publishing industry knew what to do with it. Literally the response was, 'We don't really know what to do with this character.' It confused some people and that stayed in my head.

I decided that I was going to write a real woman. The women that I know, the women that I love, the women who raised me, the woman I hope I am.

""When I was writing Joan, I decided that I was going to write a real woman. The women that I know, the women that I love, the women who raised me, the woman I hope I am. Women who have the great gift of having autonomy, of having power and being full of passion.""

Culture never dies

""I spend a lot of time talking to Indigenous story keepers and elders. I am lucky to be surrounded by such brilliant minds, including Lee Maracle and Maria Campbell. There were times where I would be concerned about our community in a very earnest way. I'd worry that we were forgetting our roots and we have lost our culture.

""Lee would always laugh at me and say, 'Did you put it in a shoe box and leave it under the bed? How can you lose your culture. It's a living thing. It exists outside of you!'

""We absolutely need to move things in our culture forward but those women reminded me it always lives. When I think about my own community — and the changes that have happened over the years — it continues to change and evolve.

""But the land will always remember; it's not going to change. It will find ways to crack its fingers through and it will always be there.""

Climate change could bring agriculture to the North,"['Cbc Radio', 'Posted', 'Feb', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Originally published on February 15, 2020.

A recent study shows that a warming climate could open up a new ""farming frontier"" in Canada's north.

But the authors of the study warn that developing this land in the ""southern"" style of agriculture could be disastrous for the area.

""Our worry is that that will have huge environmental — and potentially social — impacts,"" co-author Evan Fraser told Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald. ""So this is a cautionary tale, really.""

In the study published in February 2020 in PLOS ONE, the international team of researchers looked at climate and weather models, and found that 4.2 million square kilometres of Canada's north could become prime farmland over the next 60 years.

""We see the the northern edge of soybean production and corn production creeping upwards at a bit from its current conditions,"" said Fraser, the director of the University of Guelph's Arrell Food Institute. ""Almost all of the north becomes potentially suitable for producing potatoes or wheat, which for me was the jaw-dropping result.""

These new farmlands will be needed to help provide food to a growing population, however, Fraser warns that the Canadian government needs to be careful about how it approaches development of this land.

""Our population is growing and many people say that we're going to need globally 70 percent more food by 2050, 2060 just to keep up,"" said Fraser. ""Looking into the future we need to be, as a global society, thinking about all the possible ways we have of producing food in an efficient way.""

'The terrible scenario'

There could be terrible costs in opening up this land for farming. If all of this potential farmland is developed — in Canada as well as around the world — then, according to Fraser, ""gigatons and gigatons"" of carbon would be released into the atmosphere.

""We have to realise that the boreal forest and the peat soils up north are some of the biggest carbon reservoirs on the planet,"" he said. ""If we start imagining a scenario where we, one field at a time, start cutting those trees down and ploughing those fields, then we will have the potential of releasing a lot of carbon into the atmosphere""

He also cautions of the affect on biodiversity, and hydrological impacts, which would lead to toxic agricultural runoff heading into the Arctic Ocean.

""I just want to make sure that ... we don't simply just take a southern form of agriculture, that then results in boreal forest being cleared, wetlands being drained, soybean fields being put in for a few years while we exhaust the thin soil, and emit a lot of carbon into the atmosphere as a result.""

""That would be the terrible scenario.""

'Guided by principles of sustainable development'

Fraser's biggest concern is for the Indigenous communities who currently live in these areas.

""Not only do we have to be mindful of the environmental consequences, we also have to put indigenous governance and community empowerment at the centre of that,"" he said.

The researchers suggest that action be taken now so that if it's decided that we develop some of this new land, we do it in a sustainable way, in order to learn from past mistakes, and perhaps make the most of this growth opportunity.

""By being more participatory and deliberative and putting northern communities at the centre, guided by principles of sustainable development, we can we can be much more proactive about how this this process can unfold,"" he said.

""We can do this in a way that's responsible.""

There's no time like a pandemic to test out universal basic income in Canada, says Sen. Yuen Pau Woo.

Woo, a B.C. senator and head of the Independent Senators' group, recently asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to analyze the potential cost of providing a basic income to all Canadians for six months.

The PBO says the project could cost anywhere from $47.5 billion to $98 billion, depending how much the government claws back payments to people who earn other income.

The analysis is based on Ontario's basic income pilot, under which individuals received $16,989 annually, and couples received $24,027. That program was launched under the previous Liberal government in the province and cancelled by Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford.

With the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) set to expire in October, Woo says now is the perfect time to pilot a national basic income program in Canada. Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens guest host Nil Köksal.

This idea of creating a universal basic income has been discussed and debated, as you know, for many years. Why do you feel the federal government should do this now?

The starting point is the grim economic outlook for the balance of this year and into 2021. We've just had a fiscal snapshot from the finance minister, which suggests that the recovery will be modest and possibly very erratic. That suggests to me that we will need income support of some sort into 2021.

To the extent that we need special income support, this is an opportunity to pilot basic income, perhaps at a provincial level, to see if this might be a better way to help Canadians and to reap the benefits that the proponents of basic income have been touting for many years.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivers the federal fiscal 'snapshot' to the House of Commons on Wednesday, July 8. 17:19

Is there, do you think, now the political will and support from the public to actually make it happen this time?

Well, frankly, no, I don't think there is political will. But there is a lot of public discussion and sympathy for the idea.

I'm a realist here and I'm also mindful of the political resistance to this idea. But this may be a better time than any to put the idea to test in a way that really does fill a need.

You did ask the parliamentary budget officer to figure out how much this might all cost. The estimate for a six-month program is somewhere between $47.5 billion to $98 billion. Can the federal government actually afford to keep spending like that?

The parliamentary budget officer produced the gross costs that you cited ... but they also came up with estimates of offsets, fiscal offsets, that would defray the costs of the basic income. And they pegged the offsets as as high as $46 billion.

Of course, there are political choices to be made as to which offsets to use. But the point here is that a basic income does not and will not be as costly as the gross cost.

And to the extent that we have to spend money on income support — and, you know, we'll spend $60-$70-billion dollars on CERB — most people would say that this is money well spent. If we're going to have to provide this kind of support, why don't we look at a range of options, including basic income?

How do you go about convincing people, though, who are already concerned about the money that the government has paid out since this crisis hit? A lot of resistance for people who say it's too open to abuse, that it gives people an incentive not to work. So how do you change that thinking?

Well, this is not CERB, and that's precisely my point. The government could well decide to simply extend the CERB. I don't think they will do that. But if they were to do that, we would be left to the same problem that the critics have raised, which is that there's no incentive to work ... to earn money beyond the $1,000 threshold.

The basic income concept that the PBO has modelled includes a number of scenarios where there would be some benefit reduction, but not 100 per cent benefit reduction.

That, I think, addresses many of the concerns about disincentives to return to work.

It will take a leap of faith. And that's why I'm saying that this is an opportunity for us to, at the very least, conduct an experiment. - Sen. Yuen Pau Woo

Another criticism that some folks have is that, you know, it's too blunt an instrument.... For example, an out-of-work university student with wealthy parents doesn't have the same needs as someone, for example, who may have lost a spouse in a workplace accident. What do you say to that?

We already have a number of basic income-type measures, you know, wage supplement, guaranteed income supplement, childcare benefit and so on. So this is not, in principle, different from those, but it would have a wider coverage.

But the underlying principle here is that all Canadians are vulnerable to shocks in the economy, shocks in their personal lives that may put them in a situation where they are, all of a sudden, vulnerable. And we saw that very starkly in the COVID-19 crisis.

The basic income does not provide for a lavish lifestyle, not by any means, but it provides individuals with, fundamentally provides them with freedom. Freedoms to, obviously, house themselves, feed themselves, freedoms to pursue education, for example, to not put themselves in precarious situations. These are particularly important for disadvantaged communities. You know, whether we're talking about a lot of First Nations communities and other racialized minorities.

If there's one thing we've learned from the COVID-19 crisis is that there are many gaps in our social safety net system. And there seems to be a determination on the part of Canadians of all political stripes to patch these gaps. Basic income would be one way of doing that.

The federal government today is facing a lot of criticism about the numbers it's released [in] its fiscal snapshot out today. How hopeful are you ... that they will hear you out as you push for this plan?

You have to work with the groups that are willing to do the work and to make the investment, and that's why I suggested that the provinces that have already talked about basic income as part of their own provincial platforms and talked about pilot projects and so on may be the easiest to persuade.

I don't underestimate the political challenges, but this is an opportunity that's before us. We all know that major social policy reform happens after big crises — you know, after the war and after the Depression and so on. This may be the equivalent for Canada and other Western industrialized countries.

It will take a leap of faith. And that's why I'm saying that this is an opportunity for us to, at the very least, conduct an experiment, if you will. Maybe a time-limited experiment that can be used to demonstrate if, in fact, [there are] benefits.

And I'm talking about benefits that go beyond monetary gain. I'm talking about health benefits, education benefits, social benefits. If these come to pass, then the political consensus on the value of a basic income might come together much more quickly than we had previously thought.

The U.S.-Canada border should remain closed until next year unless ""something miraculous"" happens to lower COVID-19 rates south of the border, says infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch.

""They're having over 50,000 new cases per day in the country, and on top of that, it doesn't appear like they are getting this epidemic under control,"" said Bogoch, a physician and researcher based at Toronto General Hospital.

""I can't think off the top of my head about what a number or a metric would look like, but I can tell you that [reopening the border] is going to be a long, long, long way away,"" he told The Current's guest host Rosemary Barton.

Nova Scotia and P.E.I. confirmed new cases of COVID-19 this week, believed to be connected to a man in his 20s who flew from the U.S. to Halifax via Toronto. He came to Canada on a student visa, but failed to self isolate upon entering Nova Scotia.

""This is just a stark reminder that we can't let our guard down and that … places that have been COVID-free for some time can certainly import this and this can cause an outbreak,"" said Bogoch.

Infection control epidemiologist Colin Furness predicts the Canada-U.S. border will only open if a COVID-19 vaccine is created or if enough people have been infected with the virus and build herd immunity. 9:17

The man travelling from the U.S. was trying to get to P.E.I. but stopped at the provincial border because he did not have the right paperwork. He is believed to have spread the virus to another man who visited Nova Scotia on June 26, and who returned to the island three days later, leading to the new P.E.I. cases.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness told The Current in an email that the man was a foreign national who arrived in Canada from the U.S., but did not give any other details.

Bogoch said new outbreaks resulting from travel between provinces is a possibility, but ""far less likely to happen than if we had free international travel.""

""On the worry-ometer, this is much lower than international travel.""

He said that Canada has ""to be very, very careful about travellers, and especially with travellers coming from high-burden areas, namely the United States.""

The daily number of new cases across Canada has been below 500 for the past month, but the number of new cases in most U.S. states is rising. On Wednesday, the country reached 3 million cases and more than 130,000 deaths.

As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates, the United States has already paid a ruinous cost in human life, and it’s hidden by inequality and fuelled by division. 5:43

Bogoch said that even if the U.S. implemented the most stringent public health measures right now, it would take time to turn the corner — but ""they're not taking those measures, unfortunately.""

""I'm not a betting guy, but if pushed I'd say that the vaccine is going to get here before the U.S. has their epidemic under control.""

Rules need to be enforced: Bogoch

Canada and the U.S. agreed in March to temporarily close the border to non-essential travel, while keeping it open to commercial traffic and essential workers who cross for work. The agreement has been extended every month, most recently to July 21.

However, among certain exceptions, U.S. citizens are allowed to drive through Canada to reach Alaska for essential reasons.

While travellers are supposed to take a direct path, there have been several reports of U.S. cars stopping in B.C., Alberta and Yukon for sightseeing and shopping.

Yukon resident Murray Lundberg says he met a U.S. couple in a line-up at a grocery store in downtown Whitehorse.

""They were from the eastern states, I think Pennsylvania, and they were going to Alaska, where they apparently have a home,"" said Lundberg.

""So I asked: 'What brought you down here?'""

He said they replied: ""Well, we heard that the shopping was good here.""

""I guess never mind the regulations,"" he told Barton.

While some U.S. travellers have been fined for stopping en route to Alaska, Bogoch thinks the rules need to be more stringently enforced — including the requirement for anyone returning to Canada from abroad to isolate for 14 days.

""The risk of reintroducing this infection is high, not just from the United States, I'd say globally,"" he told Barton.

""If you don't isolate for a period of 14 days, there should be consequences, and I think those consequences should obviously be applied and also publicized,"" he said.

""It's not a free ride.""

The actor and comedian was in Hawaii, on a call about his semi-autobiographical novel, when his assistant, Linda, FaceTimed him from the other side of the island with the news.

""She said, 'There are missiles coming, and they're going to land in 10 minutes. This is real.' And as she was strenuously clutching her iPhone, she accidentally took a screenshot of my face,"" remembers Carrey in a q feature interview with co-author Dana Vachon.

""So the book's cover is an actual shot of my face after being told that I have 10 minutes to live,"" says Carrey, pointing out the look isn't one of panic or hysteria.

""It was more a wave of calm coming over me and a sense of 'Oh, that's strange. Huh, what a funny way for this all to end.' And that's the feeling I got,"" he says.

The alert, which warned of a ballistic missile headed for Hawaii, sent the islands into a panic, with people abandoning cars on a highway and preparing to flee their homes.

Carrey recounts how, in that moment, he tried to decide what to do next: hide under the stairs? Get in the car?

""I tried to get off the island on the phone to my daughter and I couldn't get through,"" says Carrey, his voice cracking.

""And finally I just said, 'You know what? I've had a wonderful life.' And I decided to sit there and watch the ocean and go through all the ways in my head that I could be grateful for what I had. And I started this list of gratitudes that could have gone on forever.""

With just two minutes left, Carrey got a call back from co-author Dana Vachon, letting him know it was a false alarm.

""It's a part of me. It's a part of this book,"" says Carrey, reflecting on whether the experience changed him. ""When all is lost, then all is found.""

'Real is an illusion'

It was a harrowing moment in Carrey's life, but one that seemed tailor-made for Memoirs and Misinformation, which twists together biographical moments and fiction to the point where the line between is indistinguishable.

Jim Carrey co-authored his new semi-autobiographical novel Memoirs and Misinformation with writer Dana Vachon. (Jim Carrey)

And that, says Carrey, is exactly the point. Our personae are constructed from fictions that others impose on us and that we tell ourselves, he argues, whether they're religious ideas, nationalities, or even our basic sense of self.

""'Real' is an illusion. I really think it's as simple as that,"" says Carrey, who describes the Buddhist belief that there are no two things, but rather just the absolute and the relative.

There is also no distinction to be had between Jim Carrey the actor that legions of fans have come to know and love, and the ""real"" Jim Carrey, he adds.

""There is no difference. They're both ideas, and abstract constructions. I truly believe that,"" he says. ""And this is not an arrogant thing. I'm not being supercilious when I say we all have this.""

Carrey describes how he started playing with the line between the self and the rest of the world, imagining a coffee table was his foot, for example.

""It started to expand itself until I become the walls around you, and I become you, and the air we breathe. And we have everything in common. There's nothing we don't have in common. We are one thing. Try to breathe without the trees, and you'll find out — quickly.""

'He was just lovely to me'

In the novel, moments from Carrey's real life are woven together with flying saucers and fire bombings, raging wildfires and female eco-terrorists, a Hungry Hungry Hippos movie and an alien-battling, Excalibur-wielding Nicolas Cage.

At one point Carrey is in a motel on Sunset Boulevard with director Charlie Kaufman and Sir Anthony Hopkins — who is dressed in Lone Ranger pyjamas and toting a gun — trying to channel Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong.

In a particularly tender moment, Carrey's real-life mentor and champion Rodney Dangerfield is digitally reincarnated as a rhinoceros.

""He was an incredible human being and a tremendous support. If he loved you, man, you were under the wing and he was telling you what you needed to know, that you needed to make the tank so strong that no bonehead could stop it,"" says Carrey, describing the legendary comedian who died in 2004.

""And he supported me when I was experimenting and would stand backstage laughing and going, 'Those people are looking at you like you're from another friggin' planet, man.' But he supported me, and kept hiring me. He was just lovely to me.""

'There's nowhere to go'

So when it comes to writing Memoirs and Misinformation, why did Carrey and Vachon opt for semi-fiction rather than writing a novel or a memoir?

Vachon says over the course of many late-night sessions, he interviewed Carrey about his life, gathering a foundation of biographical material to draw from.

From there, the pair added layer after layer of fiction; after all, they argue, even that base layer of biography was a fictionalized tale.

""I thought of the fiction as being a construction, but constructed in service of illuminating these beautiful visions of a true past, much of which was in Canada,"" says Vachon, pointing to the way medieval cathedrals use vaulted spaces and stained glass to illuminate ""true"" stories.

""That the line had already been blurred. And then we got together and we realized not only had it been blurred, but it had been befouled because most celebrity memoirs are messing with the truth anyway, either through omission or distortion.""

And although Carrey has starred in countless hit films, among them How The Grinch Stole Christmas, The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Dumb and Dumber, The Mask and Ace Vetura: Pet Detective, and is himself a celebrity, Memoirs and Misinformation is anything but a show biz homage.

In fact, Carrey says one of the main goals of the book was ""to go through this absurd journey of definition, and the madness of Hollywood and the burning down of old structures to get to at least a taste of that infinite nothingness and everythingness"" and that the Hollywood glitterati are ""a bunch of entities and people struggling to make some sort of relevance for themselves.""

In the end, he says, apotheosis can't be reached as an individual; rather, you have to let go of the individual to get a glimpse of enlightenment.

Ramana Maharshi, a wonderful Indian sage, was on his deathbed and one of his servants came up to him and said, 'Ramina, I don't want you to go.' And he said, 'Where can I go? There's nowhere to go.' - Jim Carrey

""Ramana Maharshi, a wonderful Indian sage, was on his deathbed and one of his servants came up to him and said, 'Ramina, I don't want you to go.' And he said, 'Where can I go? There's nowhere to go.' There's nothing that isn't him,"" explains Carrey.

""I don't think of my father as gone. I don't think of my mother as gone. They'll never go. There's nowhere to go,"" he says.

""So where are they?"" asks Power. ""Where aren't they?"" replies Carrey. ""They're in you.""

Of course, legions of fans around the globe feel they know the individual who is Jim Carrey, even if he is a fictional construction in their — and even his own — minds. So how does he feel about that Jim Carrey?

""It makes me smile to hear it,"" said Raffi Cavoukian from his home on Salt Spring Island.

The song was inspired by a beluga whale Cavoukian had seen at the Vancouver Aquarium in 1979.

""It took my career to a whole new level, and recently, in recent years, in concert, I've heard a whole new generation who I call 'beluga grads' — adults who grew up singing Baby Beluga — who bring their own kids to the concerts.""

'Come Back,' Mustafa feat. James Blake

""Come Back"" marks the second collaboration between Toronto poet and songwriter Mustafa and British artist James Blake. In the video for this new track, Blake is sitting at a piano, kicking off the song's main refrain pleading for someone to return, while Mustafa stands behind him silently soaking in the words and the sunlight beaming through the studio's window. The song is as simple as that, and its pared down production makes it all the more powerful when the two singers come together in harmony, softly singing, ""Please come back/ at least in my dreams.""

""Come Back,"" as Mustafa notes in a statement, was released on the second anniversary of Toronto rapper Smoke Dawg's death. ""I pray the people you lost come back to you in the form that heals you best,"" he wrote. ""If not a memory, a dream, if not a dream, in their siblings' eyes, if not that, then in the way you carry yourself."" This song is a stunning tribute that packs an emotional gut-punch; it may not heal you completely, but it certainly eases the pain. — Melody Lau

'Hard on Everyone,' Kathleen Edwards

The time between making the decision to leave and finally making it out the door is different for everybody. Kathleen Edwards' new song, ""Hard on Everyone,"" is a version of what it looked and sounded like for her. ""This song is me waking the f--k up. And exiting. Written on the floor of my empty house after leaving a bad situation,"" Edwards wrote on Twitter . And there is something defiant and urgent in the guitars moving under Edwards' words. Her vocal delivery, which on many of her most beloved songs is often edged with a wry wisdom, is different here; she's in dialogue with whomever was part of her bad situation, but she's also in dialogue with herself. Edwards is making space for her anger toward this other person, but it never consumes her because it sounds like she's also operating from a place of much-deserved compassion for herself. Boundaries are hard on everyone, and leaving is sometimes the hardest, bravest boundary of all. — Andrea Warner

'Sticky,' Swagger Rite

Toronto rapper Swagger Rite has been making a lot of noise for a couple years now, and released his major label debut, The Swagged Out Pedestrian, in 2019. He's become known for his high energy and trap-influenced sound, but on his latest release, he shows off his softer, slower side. On ""Sticky,"" we see Swagger reflecting on violence in the city, as well as his upbringing in the Jane and Weston area. ""Growing up in the slums in these cold streets, public housing rats and roaches, plus there's no heat,"" he sings through Auto-Tune. It's a side of Swagger we haven't seen before, and shows that the artist is just as comfortable making a ballad as he is a banger, all while keeping to the vivid street scenes he's built his career on. ""Cause it's real when you living in the field,"" he sings. ""You either make it, go to jail, or you get killed."" — Jesse Kinos-Goodin

'Hey Stupid, I Love You,' JP Saxe

JP Saxe is a self-described ""over-feeler, over-thinker and over-sharer,"" and that's what makes his effusive, emotionally vulnerable songs so irresistible. That, and his unpretentious, conversational style of singing. ""If somebody wants more love from you, turns out its a lot easier to just give it to them, than to convince them they don't need it,"" he explained on Facebook , introducing his new single, ""Hey Stupid, I Love You."" Restrained production keeps the focus on the lyrics, as Saxe articulates the insecurities we all feel from time to time — ""I just wish you could lean in and kiss me/ Say nothing's wrong, tell me to settle down"" — and, let's be honest, make us feel a bit stupid. — Robert Rowat

'Out of Love,' Busty and the Bass feat. Macy Gray

Four years ago, Montreal band Busty and the Bass covered Macy Gray's ""I Try,"" adding their own DIY flair to the soulful classic. Fast forward to 2020 and things have come full circle: the two artists have come together on a new track titled ""Out of Love."" Whereas ""I Try"" is a song about feeling stuck and unable to let go of someone, ""Out of Love"" is begging for a relationship to dissolve. ""I just wanna come out and say I'm sick of waiting,"" singer Nick Ferraro kicks off, adding, ""I just wanna hear that it's over now."" Gray's signature raspy vocals effortlessly blend on the second verse as she echoes the exhaustion. ""Drop the ball and hope I make the call but those signs are just a waste on me,"" Gray coos over the track's sparkling disco-inspired production and bright horns. ""Out of Love"" may sound breezy, making it an ideal summer jam, but simmering underneath is a burning desire to move on. — ML",[]

It's a cover of the Beatles' ""All you Need is Love,"" sung by Dan Mangan and accompanied in isolation by members of the VSO and a whole roster of musically gifted health-care workers from B.C.'s Lower Mainland — doctors, nurses, paramedics, physiotherapists and staff at seniors' residences.

""It's an absolute honour to have been a part of this project with the VSO,"" Mangan said via press release. ""I had no idea when I recorded my bit, of how emotional the final result would make me.""

137,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/ennio-morricone-dead-91-1.5638652,Oscar-winning film score composer Ennio Morricone dead at 91,"['The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Oscar-winning Italian composer Ennio Morricone, who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as The Untouchables and the epic Once Upon A Time In America, died on Monday. He was 91.

Morricone's longtime lawyer and friend, Giorgio Assumma, said the Maestro, as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following a recent fall in which he broke a leg.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

""I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,"" began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: ""I don't want to bother anyone.""

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood's and Italy's top directors, including Brian de Palma (The Untouchables), Quentin Tarantino (The Hateful Eight) and Gillo Pontecorvo (The Battle of Algiers).

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: ""There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.""

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called spaghetti western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone.

Morricone was credited with nothing less than reinventing music for western movies through his partnership with Leone, a former classmate. Their partnership included the Dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: A Fistful of Dollars in 1964, For a Few Dollars More in 1965 and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — for instance those played on a harmonica in 1968's Once Upon a Time in the West or another played on pan flute in Leone's 1984 movie Once Upon A Time in America — which would instantly become the film's motif.

The latter movie is a saga of Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone's masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone's evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

'Discipline and curiosity'

""Inspiration does not exist,"" Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. ""What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.""

In a later interview with Italian state TV, Morricone cited ""study, discipline and curiosity"" as the keys to his creative genius. ""Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path"" along life's experiences, he said.

""A great phenomenon of world music"" was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for The Hateful Eight, Tarantino's 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone's Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

""When I say favourite composer, I don't mean movie composer.... I'm talking about Mozart, I'm talking about Beethoven, I'm talking about Schubert,"" Tarantino said.

Italy's head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer's family, wrote: ""Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.""

Morricone's soundtracks, Mattarella said, ""contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.""

Morricone's style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements. His music punctuated the long silences typical of the spaghetti westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly became Morricone's trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of A Fistful of Dollars and thinking: ""What actor wouldn't want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?""

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (The Hateful Eight was his sixth), but until then had never won.

Started career as a trumpeter

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

""I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,"" he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of fascism called Il Federale (known in English as The Fascist). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on The Battle of Algiers, the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French, and later on Queimada, a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with Days Of Heaven, a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside The Hateful Eight, the others were for The Mission (1986), The Untouchables (1987), Bugsy (1991) and Malena (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying: ""I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.""

But he also made no secret that he thought The Mission, with its memorably sweet theme of Gabriel's Oboe, deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock's Round Midnight.

<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/EnnioMorricone?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#EnnioMorricone</a>'s music is so unique, so beautiful, that it often feels like films were made in service of him rather than the other way around.

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa's Carlo Felice Theatre later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city's 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge's replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, such as one version of an eternal summer hit, Sapore di Sale (Taste of Salt), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his ""friendship and admiration"" for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer's piece Voci dal Silenzio (Voices from the Silence), the work elicited ""true emotion"" from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an ""extraordinary"" composer of film scores and classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn't, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on Clockwork Orange. But that collaboration didn't happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife, Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children: Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.",[]

It's a special occasion for musicians and public alike, the result of months, even years, of planning and creative energy.

The world premiere of Vivian Fung's Prayer, which you can watch above, has come about under completely different circumstances.

""In March, when the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to public gatherings for the foreseeable future, I started thinking about how to keep Canadian orchestral musicians front and centre,"" reflects Denise Ball, executive producer of classical programming at CBC Music. ""In collaboration with colleagues at the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, we came up with a plan to create a national 'virtual orchestra' playing a brand new piece that reflects what we're all going through.""

After securing the participation of at least one musician from each of Canada's 28 professional orchestras, Ball reached out to Yannick Nézet-Séguin to see whether he'd agree to conduct the performance. ""He thought it was a fabulous idea and immediately jumped onboard.""

'Extraordinary conditions'

Fung, who's based in New York and has recently written music for Nézet-Séguin's Philadelphia Orchestra, agreed to compose the five-minute work within one month.

""In times of crisis and peril, we have but the reliance of faith,"" she says, ""from the profound faith in humanity, faith in love, and faith that we will persevere and get through this with dignity, to the mundane faith that I would complete the piece within the extraordinary conditions that faced me, with a young child at home 24/7, a bronchial infection, and a very tight timeline (ultimately, a matter of days) to complete the piece in a manner feasible for COVID remote performance requirements.""

That faith resulted in Prayer, based on a chant by Hildegard von Bingen. ""Under no other circumstances ... have I worn my heart on my sleeve as transparently as I have with this piece,"" Fung reflects.

It's performed by 36 individuals in multiple locales — see the full roster, below — and united in a virtual performance that has been produced and edited by CBC Music's Francesco Guidoccio and Doug Doctor.

""Imagining the sounds and the people around me, conducting in front of a video camera, but imagining everyone in front of me — that was something very special,"" conductor Nézet-Séguin told CBC.

""And once orchestras are back in their halls, playing for live audiences, they're all invited to play this beautiful new work,"" adds Ball, ""kind of like a collective musical hug and a testament to the experience Canadians have shared.""

The radio premiere of Fung's Prayer takes place on CBC Radio One and via the CBC Listen app on July 1 at 7:45 a.m. on the Canada Day special Extraordinary Times: Canada Day 2020. It also airs on CBC Music and via the CBC Listen app on Tempo with host Julie Nesrallah at 12:50 p.m.

140,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/patrick-watson-indigenous-land-acknowledgement-censored-canada-day-1.5636152,Montreal artist Patrick Watson says Indigenous land acknowledgement 'censored' from Canada Day performance,"['The Canadian Press', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson says Canadian Heritage edited out a land acknowledgement he made to Indigenous peoples before his Montreal Canada Day performance.

Watson posted on Facebook Thursday, saying he was ""deeply upset"" to discover his statement did not make it into the hour-long broadcast, which was pre-recorded and filmed in Montreal's Olympic Stadium.

The virtual show was funded by the federal government as a replacement for annual festivities held in Montreal to celebrate the national holiday.

Montreal-based communications agency, Tandem Communication, put the show together.

The musician said he made the acknowledgement during his performance but it was not included in the program broadcast to Canadians. A version of the performance, available online, does not contain Watson's homage to Indigenous peoples.

A land acknowledgement is a statement that recognizes Indigenous peoples occupied the territory that became Canada long before colonization.

Watson posted what he called the ""censored"" words he uttered during his performance.

""We would like to acknowledge that we are playing at this event from the unceded lands of the Kanien'keha:ka Nation,"" he wrote.

""Tiohtia:ke/Montreal is known as gathering place for many First Nations, we hope to honour that tradition.""

The musician said he wanted to celebrate ""where I was standing, to point out the connection between the Indigenous struggles with the Black Lives Matter movement, and to include everyone who lives in Canada and their sensibilities.""

A Canadian Heritage spokesperson said it has no involvement in the programming choices of the communities and organizations it funds.

""Each year, Canadian Heritage provides funding to support activities through the Celebrate Canada program. This funding allows communities and organizations across Canada to celebrate the diversity of our country through four days of celebration, including Canada Day,"" spokesperson Martine Courage said in an email.

""Funded communities and organizations are responsible for programming their respective activities.""

Deputy NDP Leader Alexandre Boulerice, an MP from Quebec, said Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault needs to explain why Watson's statement was not included in the official program.

If Guilbeault doesn't explain the decision, Boulerice said in an interview, ""it would be very, very hypocritical for the Liberals to wrap themselves in reconciliation with First Nations and Indigenous peoples and then, censor artists who just want to express their solidarity with certain Aboriginal peoples.""

Guilbeault, however, did mention the country's Indigenous peoples, in a recorded statement edited into the virtual Canada Day performance. In fact, Guilbeault's message opens the show.

The minister said ""Indigenous peoples have taken care of this land over the centuries. Their cultures and traditions are a great source of wealth for this country.""",[]

On it was a track called ""He's a Keeper of the Fire,"" a blazing psychedelic number where Sainte-Marie belts passionately about a man who's ""got a funny kinda voodoo, baby.""

This Canada Day, Indo-Canadian musician King Khan (best known for his band King Khan and the Shrines) is releasing a song titled ""She is the Keeper of My Soul,"" a song Khan describes as a ""response to the epic anthem of Buffy Sainte-Marie.""

The track, which was written by Khan and performed by his daughter Saba Lou, accompanies his short film titled Rat-Tribution Now, a project for the 2020 Pop Kultur Festival based in Berlin. The film, Khan says, ""is an attempt at achieving retribution,"" referencing North America's historical mistreatment of Indigenous peoples. As such, the release of this song is also in dedication to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and proceeds from the song will go to the NDN COVID-19 Response Project.

""I have decided to release this song for Canada Day to be a stark reminder that these women are still ignored by the majority of people in Canada,"" Khan tells CBC Music over email. ""The song asks, 'Who will be the keeper of my soul?' I wanted to write it from the perspective of MMIWG.""

Written in a similar structure to Sainte-Marie's ""He's a Keeper of the Fire,"" Khan's song confronts listeners with powerful questions:

When you put me down

Without a sound

How will the world ever know?



When my judgment day

Seems like it's gone astray

Who'll be the keeper of my soul?

Saba Lou, who is the main vocalist on the track, says that having a woman sing Khan's words ""gives the words another meaning."" She adds: ""These topics need attention and awareness, so again and again they must be mentioned from all perspectives, using different approaches. I was glad when [Khan] asked me to sing it.""

""Buffy's activism always inspired me, she's probably the most important Canadian singer of all time,"" Khan says, of Sainte-Marie's legacy as a musician. Another artist that ""She is the Keeper of My Soul"" is dedicated to is Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq. Khan says Rat-Tribution Now is ""an homage"" to Tagaq's 2016 music video for ""Retribution.""

""I am so happy that such a power frau has emerged from the aurora borealis,"" he adds. (Khan has also commissioned tarot illustrations of both Sainte-Marie and Tagaq by Game of Thrones graphic artist Michael Eaton for a tarot deck he is creating.)

King Khan teamed up with Game of Thrones graphic artist Michael Eaton on an upcoming tarot deck that includes illustrations of Canadian artists Buffy Sainte-Marie and Tanya Tagaq. (Courtesy of King Khan)

In addition to Rat-Tribution Now and ""She is the Keeper of My Soul,"" Khan has spent his time in lockdown working with American social activist Malik Rahim on raising money for people in New Orleans who are in need of insulin supplies. Titled Just Insulin, the fundraising initiative aims to ""uplift a community ravaged by diabetes, no access to medicine, with COVID-19 preying on healthy young people, killing them just like the cops do.""

The hope is to ""set up a source of Canadian insulin and send it to this community in New Orleans."" Through tarot card readings, Khan has already raised close to $2,000 US.

For Khan, the time to be active is now, to confront problems in our reality and to channel change with creativity, especially as an artist. ""This pandemic is not simply a wake-up call, it's utter devastation in your own backyard,"" he warns. ""Creativity is our only way out.""

""If you are not creating something to show your empathy, then you are useless,"" he adds. ""Sorry to be such a Debbie Downer.""",[]

According to a survey of the UK Musicians' Union , one-fifth of all classical musicians believe that coronavirus will be the end of their careers, and similar concerns have gripped classical artists around the world, including here in Canada.

But Victoria-based baroque violinist Chloe Kim has a plan to reinvigorate her music community. The 23-year-old is the artistic director and creator of the ambitious new weekly concert project, Music for the Pause. The online concert series kicks off Friday, July 3, and runs for 11 weeks, featuring mostly Victoria-based musicians performing baroque chamber works on period instruments.

""Music for the Pause is a way of keeping myself and my colleagues, who are like family to me, creatively engaged as well as for staying connected to audiences during a very difficult and strange time,"" explains Kim. ""As someone who thrives on the intensity of a full performing schedule and the togetherness and sharing that comes with that, the concept of a summer without music was inconceivable to me. I like the challenge of having to work within certain parameters, whether it be social distancing regulations or personnel limitations, and I choose to see this period of time as an opportunity to be creative, rather than one of waiting or inactivity.""

Among the artists joining Kim in Music for the Pause are fellow baroque violinists Tyson Doknjas, Christi Meyers, Jeanne Lamon, Elyssa Lefurgey-Smith, Paul Luchkow, Kathryn Wiebe as well as Mark McDonald (organ), Christina Hutten (harpsichord), Mieka Michaux (baroque viola), Katrina Russell (dulcian/baroque bassoon), Soile Stratkauskas (baroque flute), and Christina Mahler (baroque cello).

""It's been an absolute joy to be making music again,"" Kim says. ""To be honest, I almost cried when I first got into the rehearsal space with my colleagues — I can't describe how cathartic it was. It just feels good to be creating and feeling again, especially with such dear friends.""

The series, which is co-presented by Early Music Society of the Islands, Victoria Baroque , Pacific Baroque Series, and Christ Church Cathedral , will be filmed inside Christ Church Cathedral's Chapel of the New Jerusalem, and each performance will include short interviews between musicians and celebrity guests from the international early music community. Starting July 3, each concert in the 11-part series will stream weekly on Fridays at 7:30 p.m. PT, via Facebook Live on each of the co-presenters' Facebook pages. The streams are free, but viewers are encouraged to donate, with proceeds benefiting artists whose incomes have been affected by the pandemic.

Oh, and to complete it within a month.

She set to work, and delivered her new piece, Prayer, on time.

When she wasn't toiling away on that project or looking after her five-year-old daughter, Fung, like the rest of us, turned to music for stimulation and distraction from the increasingly alarming headlines.

Below, she tells us about the music that's been getting her through the pandemic.

'O pastor animarum,' Hildegard von Bingen

""In times of crisis and peril, we have but the reliance of faith — from the profound faith in humanity to faith in love, and faith that we will persevere and get through this with dignity. In the end, I chose a chant from my composer heroine, Hildegard von Bingen, as inspiration for my Prayer.""

O Shepherd of our souls, O primal voice,

Whose call created all of us;

Now hear our plea to thee, to thee, and deign

To free us from our miseries

And feebleness.

Standing Wave

""When the shutdown happened, I was in the middle of working on Corona Morphs for the awesome Vancouver-based new music group Standing Wave. They are working on an online release of the piece, since the premiere was supposed to happen in May 2020. I'll also soon be writing a flute concerto for their flutist, Christie Reside, who is also the principal flutist of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. In the meantime, here is a sample of what Standing Wave can do.""

'Kam Knea Doch Chkae,' Doch Chkae

""I have been experiencing a lot of pent-up emotion, and I thought this song by Doch Chkae was a good outlet for the anger and repression that I was facing. I first heard of this Cambodian heavy metal band through my husband, who is a bit of a metal head. I also took a trip to Cambodia last year to understand some of my family history — my uncle and family were living in Cambodia, they were overseas Chinese living in Phnom Penh, at the time of genocide and fortunately they escaped.""

Wayang No. II (Shadowdance), Anthony Davis

""Fresh from his Pulitzer Prize for his opera The Central Park Five, Anthony Davis has been on my mind. I love the influence of Balinese gamelan in his work Wayang No. II (Shadowdance). I, myself, was inspired by gamelan, especially for my album Dreamscapes, which includes the Juno Award-winning Violin Concerto.""

Civitas Ensemble

""I am very proud of a recent release of my piece Birdsong for violin and piano performed by members of Civitas Ensemble, based in Chicago.

Every time a musician draws inspiration from what's going on around them in the present, or looks to the past to bring an old story into a new light, they're helping to create a canon of songs that tell the story of how we got to where we are today.

From before Confederation to the creation of the railroad that would cut across the country and bring it into the future, through great strife, injustice and the lasting impact of colonialism on Indigenous people; to the disasters that bonded communities through grief and the triumphs that joined them in celebration — it's all there in the words and notes of our musicians.

Below, CBC Music has gathered a selection of songs that tell the stories, both big and small, of Canada.

And on Canada Day, at noon local time, you can tune in to Radio One for a one-hour special hosted by Daniel Greaves called Records of Time: Songs About our History. Greaves will talk with Canadian artists — including iskwē, Joe Sealy and Sarah Harmer — about the stories behind the songs of theirs that have been included in this list.

You can listen to the piece in full below, produced by Arianne Robinson.

Host Daniel Greaves talks with Canadian artists about the story behind their songs: music based on historical events that also reflect our present day. 51:41

Pre-Confederation and colonization

Buffy Sainte-Marie's ""My Country 'tis of thy People You're Dying"" isn't about one thing — it's about everything colonizers have destroyed within and pushed onto Indigenous populations across Turtle Island. Residential schools. Language extinction. Genocide. ""Can't you see how their poverty's profiting you?"" Sainte-Marie sings. ""My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.""

The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens

Our life blood is shut up in your chemical tanks

And now here you come, bill of sale in your hand

And surprise in your eyes, that we're lacking in thanks

For the blessings of civilization you brought us

The lessons you've taught us.

1720-2020: Cape Breton coal mining

Coal mining began in Cape Breton, N.S., in the 1700s to fuel the construction of the Fortress of Louisbourg, and it became a significant industry in the province, with more than 300 underground coal mines having been in operation since 1720. The last coal mine in Nova Scotia closed this year .

Rita MacNeil, who is from Big Pond, Cape Breton, visited the Sydney mines early in her career — and the miners' stories she heard there sparked her hit song ""Working Man.""

At the age of sixteen years

Oh, he quarrels with his peers

Who vowed they'd never see another one

In the dark recess of the mines

Where you age before your time

And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

1755-64: the Great Upheaval

Between 1755 and 1764, more than 10,000 Acadians were forced to forfeit their lands around the Bay of Fundy to the British authorities in a mass expulsion. They were moved by ship to other colonies down the Atlantic, with thousands dying in the squalid conditions onboard. Many ended up in New Orleans, where they helped develop Cajun culture.

The Band's Robbie Robertson wrote ""Acadian Driftwood"" about their plight.

They signed a treaty

And our homes were taken

Loved-ones forsaken,

They didn't give a damn.

Try to raise a family

End up an enemy

Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham.

1813: Laura Secord's heroic warning

Laura Secord is famous for having walked 32 kilometres out of American-occupied territory in June 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack, effectively stopping the invasion.

Ontario folk band Tanglefoot memorialized her journey in their song ""Secord's Warning"" — as did this Heritage Minute .

Come all you brave young soldier lads

With your strong and manly bearing

I'll tell you a tale of a woman bold and her deed of honest daring

Laura Secord was American-born in the state of Massachusetts

But she made her home in Canada and proved so faithful to us

1830-90: the life of Crowfoot

Crowfoot was a Siksika chief and warrior who was known as a voice for peace and reason. He negotiated with the Canadian government on behalf of the Blackfoot, and was key to the signing of the controversial Treaty 7 .

Willie Dunn sang about Crowfoot's life and death, as well as the damaging effects of colonialism, on ""The Ballad of Crowfoot.""

Crowfoot, Crowfoot, why the tears?

You've been a brave man, for many years.

Why the sadness? Why the sorrow?

Maybe there'll be a better tomorrow.

Maybe one day you'll find honesty,

Instead of the usual treachery,

Perhaps one day the truth may prevail,

And the warmth of love which it does entail.

1845: the Franklin Expedition

Sir John Franklin was a British naval officer and famous Arctic explorer. However, he is best known for the tragic 1845 expedition that sought to find the Northwest Passage, a sea route through the Canadian Arctic. His two ships became trapped in the ice, and all crew members perished, making it the worst tragedy in the history of Arctic exploration.

The ships' whereabouts were unknown until they were found in 2014 and 2016 in present-day Nunavut. It's a mystery that inspired Stan Rogers to write one of his best-known songs, ""Northwest Passage.""

Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage

To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea

Tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage

And make a Northwest Passage to the sea.

1848-1970: Halifax's Africville

Africville was a Black community in Halifax, on the south shore of the Bedford Basin. Seaview United Baptist Church, a post office, stores and a school were all part of the neighbourhood, though the City of Halifax would not provide the families with sewage, clean water or garbage disposal — but it did put a dump, a hospital and a prison around the houses. By 1970, the City had relocated the 400 families who lived in the community and razed Africville to the ground.

Jazz musician Joe Sealy's father was born in Africville, and the musician wrote ""Africville"" to ""represent the beginnings of the community, its development and its demise at the end of it,"" as he told CBC's Daniel Greaves for Records of Time: Songs About our History. Sealy would later create an entire album based around the track, called Africville Suites, which won the 1997 Juno for contemporary jazz album.

1859-1959: Rockwood Asylum for the Criminally Insane

For 100 years, inmates who were deemed "" criminally insane "" at the Kingston Penitentiary were moved to the Rockwood Asylum for the Criminally Insane. Not big enough for all of its inmates, the asylum relegated women to the stables until a new wing was built for them in 1868.

When Simone Schmidt, a.k.a. Fiver, came across that information, they embarked on an album of fictional stories of women patients based on in-depth research into the asylum's case files from 1856 and 1881 — giving a voice to the voiceless more than a century later.

1886: the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway

The Conservative government of Prime Minister John A. MacDonald spearheaded the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connected Montreal to Vancouver and was later dubbed ""the National Dream.""

When the CBC commissioned Gordon Lightfoot to write a song for Canada's centennial in 1967, the result was the ""Canadian Railroad Trilogy.""

For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run

When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun

Long before the white man and long before the wheel

When the green dark forest was too silent to be real.

1869-70: Red River Rebellion

Unsurprisingly, when the Dominion of Canada and the Hudson's Bay Company were working on the details of the Rupert's Land transfer in the 1860s, no one had consulted the Indigenous community, whose traditional hunting grounds marked that land. The Métis rallied around a then 25-year-old Louis Riel — a movement called the Red River Rebellion — and seized Upper Fort Garry, creating a provisional government in protest and leading to Rupert's Land's entry into the Canadian Federation and the eventual creation of Manitoba.

Thomas Scott was a surveyor for the government, and singer-songwriter James Keelaghan's song ""Red River Rising"" tells a sliver of the story from his perspective. Scott was captured during the Fort Garry seizing, and later executed.

Well, Thomas Scott he took the lead, we rode to Portage Town

Cory's on the other side

Métis riders on our tail, it's soon they rode us down

Cory's on the other side.

1903: the Frank Slide

The former mining town of Frank sits in the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Alberta, and in 1903 a massive rock slide killed nearly 100 people and took out most of the town's mining infrastructure.

The Rural Alberta Advantage commemorated the tragedy on their 2008 album, Hometowns.

And under the rubble of the mountain that tumbled

I'll hold you forever

I'll hold you forever

They'll build up another on the bodies of our brothers

I'll love you forever.

July 8, 1917: the death of Tom Thomson

Tom Thomson is one of the most famous painters in Canada, but his death, more than 100 years ago, is still shrouded in mystery. Thomson disappeared into Algonquin Park's Canoe Lake, and the only trace of him to be found was his overturned canoe.

His death has inspired history buffs and songwriters for decades, including Trent Severn, who wrote ""The Jack Pine"" about him and his famous painting of the same name .

You think I don't know you're there

But I spy campfire smoke in the air

Ride along prevailing breeze

Wave hello with only branch and leaf.

July 1, 1916: Battle of the Somme

On the first day of World War I's Battle of the Somme, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment made a tragic advance at Beaumont Hamel, all but wiping them out. In total , 324 were killed, or presumed dead, and 386 were wounded. Great Big Sea sang about the event in ""Recruiting Sergeant.""

The call came from London, for the last July drive

To the trenches with the regiment, prepare yourselves to die.

The roll call next morning, just a handful survived

Enlist you Newfoundlanders and come follow me.

Oct. 22, 1966: the death of Chanie Wenjack

Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Ojibwa boy, ran away from a residential school near Kenora, Ont., only to be found dead a week later beside the railway tracks.

Gord Downie sang about the event on 2016's The Secret Path, but it was immortalized more than 40 years earlier by Indigenous musician Willie Dunn in the song "" Charlie Wenjack .""

Walk on, little Charlie

Walk on through the snow

Heading down the railway line

Trying to make it home.

Jan 31, 1970: David Milgard's wrongful conviction

David Milgard was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 20-year-old nursing student, Gail Miller. He was released after spending 23 years in prison.

The Tragically Hip famously wrote ""Wheat Kings"" about the Milgard case.

Late breaking story on the CBC

A nation whispers, 'we always knew that he'd go free.

1970s: the end of log driving in North America

Canada began log driving, a method of moving logs from forests to mills using river currents, in 1806. It was an integral transportation method for decades until the 1970s, when changes in environmental legislation and the use of trucks revolutionized the industry.

To memorialize the tradition, Wade Hemsworth wrote ""The Log Driver's Waltz,"" a now beloved folk song that was originally released in 1979 in a National Film Board animated film soundtracked by a version of the song sung by Kate and Anna McGarrigle and the Mountain City Four.

For he goes birling down and down white water

That's where the log driver learns to step lightly

Yes, birling down and down white water

The log driver's waltz pleases girls completely.

1970: Reggie 'the Riverton Rifle' Leach enters the NHL

Ojibway hockey player Reggie Leach entered the NHL in 1970 and in his 14 years in the league, he won a Stanley Cup, the Conn Smythe Trophy and was selected as an all-star twice. Eligible for the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, Leach has yet to be inducted.

In 2013, Weakerthans frontman John K. Samson put together a petition, and an accompanying song, for Leach to get the recognition he deserves.

(We, the undersigned, put forth his name)

Whereas photos from the old Tribune

Of Reggie smiling with the Stanley Cup

Curled their corners, dropped off bedroom walls

Left a square of where they used to be.

October 1970: the October Crisis

In 1970, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped and killed Quebec's Minister of Labour, Pierre Laporte, in what became known as the October Crisis. Laporte's body was eventually found in the trunk of a car.

The Tragically Hip's ""Locked in the Trunk of a Car"" was written about the event and told from the killer's point of view.

Then I found a place, it's dark and it's rotted.

It's a cool, sweet kinda place where the coppers won't spot it.

Nov. 10, 1975: the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald

The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was a Great Lakes freighter that sank in Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975, resulting in the deaths of all 29 crew members onboard. While technically an American freighter, it sank in Canadian waters near Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.

It became the inspiration for one of Gordon Lightfoot's most famous songs, ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.""

For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

Superior, they said, never gives up her dead

When the gales of November come early.

Feb. 15, 1982: The Ocean Ranger disaster

The Ocean Ranger was an offshore drilling unit 267 km east of St. John's, N.L., that was hit by a major storm and sank, killing all 84 crew members on board.

Folk icon Ron Hynes wrote about the disaster in his song, ""Atlantic Blue.""

What colour is a heartache from a love lost at sea?

What shade of memory never fades but lingers to eternity?

And how dark is the light of day that sleepless eyes of mine survey?

Is that you, Atlantic Blue? My heart is as cold as you.

1988 Summer Olympics silver

Guyanese-Canadian boxer Egerton Marcus won a silver medal in Seoul, South Korea. In ""Nothing at All,"" a song about Black excellence, Maestro Fresh Wes devotes a verse to Marcus's achievement.

I'll talk about my homey Egerton Marcus.

A brother from Toronto who's oh so great.

A little bit of weight champ in 88.

He excelled to the second highest level in Korea

Bringing home a silver medal.

Dec. 6, 1989: École Polytechnique massacre

On Dec. 6, 1989, Mark Lépine entered Montreal's École Polytechnique and killed 14 women in what was the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history at the time. The event, which is now commemorated every year as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, led to stricter gun control laws in Canada.

In response to the tragedy, folk artist Stephen Fearing wrote ""The Bells of Mourning"" and, later on, a followup to that called ""Assassin's Apprentice,"" which Fearing said was ""an attempt on my part to get into the head of Mark Lépine a little bit more.""

Tonight I am speechless

My head is filled with pouring rain

As the darkness falls on Montreal

When violence is shrieking

The city streets will run with pain

Until the moon can shed no light at all.

May 2, 1992: the Westray mining disaster

Twenty-six Nova Scotian miners were killed when the Westray coal mine exploded in May 1992, a result of a methane gas leak. The tragedy led to the creation of the Westray Act, enacted in 2004, which provided new rules for attributing criminal liability to corporations when workers are injured or killed on the job.

It also inspired the song ""Westray"" by Sarah Harmer's former band, Weeping Tile.

A natural disaster comes out wasn't natural after all

In a small town on the East Coast, well they've gathered in a firehall

And who forgot to let the canary out?

Will you be there when they're pulling bodies out?

January 1998: North American ice storm

This massive storm struck a number of Canadian cities, stretching from eastern Ontario to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. In Montreal, the city was forced to shut down for a week, and the event served as the inspiration behind ""Neighbourhood #3 (Power Out),"" a single from Arcade Fire's breakout album, Funeral.

I woke up with the power out

Not really something to shout about

Ice has covered up my parents' hands

Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans.

Sept. 24, 2003: Hurricane Juan hits the Maritimes

Hurricane Juan was the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893. Causing $300 million in damages across the Maritimes, the tropical cyclone also killed eight people.

Two years later, Dartmouth, N.S., artist Joel Plaskett penned a song about the hurricane titled ""Natural Disaster.""

The air was getting heavy, I knew that it was coming

So I started up the Chevy and kept the motor running

A storm came down upon us and flooded all the rivers

Surrounded by piranhas and the doctors who deliver.

July 16, 2012: Danzig Street shooting

A shooting occurred at a barbecue on Danzig Street in Scarborough, killing Joshua Yasay and Shyanne Charles and injuring 24 others. Police described it as the worst act of gun violence in Toronto's history.

Drake used it to make a rare political song, teaming up with Snoop Dogg (under the name Snoop Lion) for ""No Guns Allowed.""

News from back home

This when it hurts to be gone

Two more young names to be carved out of stone

One summer day that went horribly wrong.

May 1, 2016: Fort McMurray wildfire

This wildfire, which swept through the region of Fort McMurray, was the largest evacuation in Alberta history, forcing 88,000 people out of their homes.

Nils Edenloff, frontman of the Rural Alberta Advantage, grew up there and when his band released ""Beacon Hill,"" a song inspired by this event, he wrote : ""Beacon Hill was one of the hardest hit areas and some of the footage that came out of there made it look just biblical — real fire and brimstone sort of stuff.""

While the fire seals our little fate

I'll get you all the way home

No lies living this time, you never never want to grow.

August 2014 and Aug. 9, 2016: the deaths of Tina Fontaine and Colten Boushie

On Aug. 17, 2014, 15-year-old Tina Fontaine's body was found wrapped in plastic and a duvet cover in Winnipeg's Red River. Two years later, 22-year-old Colten Boushie was shot and killed while out drinking with his friends. The Indigenous youths were just two of many lives lost to violence, and the investigation into Fontaine's murder partially led the Canadian government to order the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.

On the anniversary of both Fontaine and Boushie's accused killers' trials — both of which ended in acquittal — Cree singer iskwē released the song ""Little Star,"" a response to racist media coverage during the youths' deaths and subsequent trials.

Have you seen the news today

Did you hear what they had to say

About our lost star

They take in ways I can't understand

Place the blame on her like she was nobody's child

March 28, 2017: Edmonton Oilers clinch playoff spot

The last time the Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup was in 1990 and in 2017, they earned their first spot in the playoffs since 2006.

To mark this momentous occasion, Edmonton-born rapper Cadence Weapon released an ode to the team's captain, Connor McDavid. The team unfortunately got eliminated in the second round, and have yet to return to the playoffs since.

Reppin' Edmo

We don't play for the Flames

Yeah we caught a few L's

Now we back in the game

Hope we see a banner getting raised.

Sept. 25, 2018: Romeo Saganash stands up to Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons

NDP MP Romeo Saganash accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of not caring about Indigenous peoples' rights during talks over the Trans Mountain pipeline. ""Why doesn't the prime minister just say the truth and tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn't give a f--k about their rights?"" Saganash asked the House in September 2018.

A year later, DJ duo A Tribe Called Red commemorated that day by releasing ""The OG,"" featuring powwow drum group Black Bear, which excerpts Saganash's House of Commons speech.

Mr. Speaker, sounds like a most important relationship, doesn't it?

Why doesn't the prime minister just say the truth

And tell Indigenous peoples that he doesn't give a f--k about their rights?

Anti-Black racism, police shootings of Black people

Regis Korchinski-Paquet. D'Andre Campbell. Nicholas Gibbs. Olando Brown. Pierre Coriolan. There is no date on this entry because police killings of Black Canadians and anti-Black racism have many dates — too many to list, and without an end in sight.

In October 2018, Shad released A Short Story About a War, a concept album set in a dystopian desert world of Shad's making, but its themes and allegories of violence and racism are all reality. The song ""The Stone Throwers (Gone in a Blink)"" covers a list of oppressions — slavery, real estate segregation, the water crisis in Flint, Mich., the prison system — that spans centuries, and it came with a video that matches striking images with these standout lines:

We wasn't thought of

We wasn't brought up and taught we was set up

That's why we get caught up

Y'all discarded us

Put them bars up

Of course we got guards up

We hard cuz we're hard up

They got them start-ups and Starbucks'

We got a couple of stars till they turn 'em to stardust

They starve us

Can't even drink water

Up North with that Flint water

All in the sink as they sink farther.

150,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/bet-awards-blm-1.5630961,BET Awards highlight Black voices as artists turn political,"['Mesfin Fekadu', 'The Associated Press', 'Posted', 'Jun', 'Am Et', 'Last Updated']",,"The BET Awards served as an extension of the voices of Black people protesting in the streets about the inequalities Black people face daily, as artists used their performances to highlight the Black Lives Matter movement, civil rights and the lives of those lost because of police officers, including George Floyd.

DaBaby, with his face pressed against the ground as an officer's knee crippled his neck — replicating the last moments of Floyd's life — rapped a verse from the Black Lives Matter remix of his hit song Rockstar.

His performance also featured images from protests, a reflection of the current world in the wake of Floyd's death and the death of others, including Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.

Sunday's show, a virtual event because of the coronavirus pandemic, featured a number of highly produced, well-crafted and pre-taped performances. The BET Awards kicked off with Black artists rapping and singing anthems about the Black experience and fighting for equal rights.

Anderson .Paak and Jay Rock perform ""Lockdown,"" a powerful song about the impact of COVID-19 on Black Americans and the nationwide protests against police brutality. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BETAwards?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BETAwards</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9zWye1BXuv"">https://t.co/9zWye1BXuv</a> —@BETAwards

The 12-year-old sensation Keedron Bryant, who turned heads on social media with his passionate performance about being a young Black man in today's world, started the show with an a cappella performance of his poignant song I Just Wanna Live, which earned him a record deal.

That was followed by an all-star performance of Public Enemy's 1989 anthem Fight the Power, featuring Nas, Black Thought, Rapsody and YG adding new lyrics to the song, even namedropping Taylor and others.

Michelle Obama highlighted Beyoncé's commitment to the Black community before presenting her with the humanitarian award, saying: ""You can see it in everything she does, from her music that gives voice to Black joy and Black pain, to her activism that demands justice for Black lives.""

Beyoncé received the humanitarian award and used her speech to urge everyone to vote. 'There are people banking on us staying at home during local elections and primaries happening in states across the country. We have to vote like our life depends on it, because it does.' (Associated Press)

Beyoncé used her speech to encourage viewers to vote ""like our life depends on it"" in the upcoming election.

""I want to dedicate this award to all of my brothers out there, all of my sisters out there inspiring me, marching and fighting for change. Your voices are being heard and you're proving to our ancestors that their struggles were not in vain. Now we have one more thing we need to do to walk in our true power, and that is to vote,"" she said.

""There are people banking on us staying at home during local elections and primaries happening in states across the country. We have to vote like our life depends on it, because it does.""

Political, artsy performances

Sunday's show celebrated BET's 20th awards show and BET's 40th year as a network. The three-hour event, which aired on CBS for the first time, was hosted by comedian, actress and TV personality Amanda Seales, who starred in several skits, including one about women who identify as ""Karen,"" a common stereotype and term for racist and privileged white women.

Other artists were political during their performances, including Roddy Ricch, who wore a Black Lives Matter shirt while he rapped, Alicia Keys, Anderson Paak and Jay Rock, as well as brothers SiR and D Smoke, who performed with their mother Jackie Gouche.

Lil Wayne paid tribute to NBA icon Kobe Bryant, who died in January, with a performance of his 2009 song Kobe Bryant, weaving in new lyrics. Wayne Brady, in a glittery suit, rolled around on top of a piano as he sang a medley of Little Richard hits.

Nipsey Hussle, who was named best male hip-hop artist and earned the humanitarian award at last year's BET Awards, won video of the year for Higher, a clip he filmed with DJ Khaled and John Legend shortly before he died .

""This is for Nipsey Hussle and hip-hop,"" Khaled said in a taped video. ""Nipsey Hussle, thank you for working with me on this Higher record. I appreciate you. Nipsey's family, we love you.""

The BET Awards, one of the first awards shows to air virtually, featured performances that were sharp with artsy stage production, giving extra life to the songs being performed. It was a welcome break from the ""living room"" and homebound performances hundreds of artists have shared on social media since the pandemic hit in March.

Chloe x Halle, who have successfully performed for various TV shows and events during the pandemic while promoting their new album, gave an epic performance of their songs Do It and Forgive Me. R&B star Summer Walker, who played guitar and sang, was also impressive during her performance, which featured Usher.

Megan Thee Stallion went to the desert with background dancers as she twerked and rapped her No. 1 hit Savage. She won best female hip-hop artist, beating out Cardi B and Nicki Minaj.

""Oh my God, I probably recorded this video like 10 times. It feels so crazy doing this from my house,"" she said. ""I used to watch the BET Awards all the time thinking, 'One day that's going to be me going up there accepting my award' — and now it is.""

Though the BET Awards are technically about handing out trophies, the awards were an afterthought. During the live telecast, Richh won album of the year for his debut Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial; Lizzo was named best female R&B/pop artist; and Burna Boy won best international act. Overall, Chris Brown, Beyoncé and Ricch were the night's big winners, taking home two honours each. Beyoncé won the BET HER award for Brown Skin Girl, shared with daughter Blue Ivy Carter as well as Wizkid and Saint JHN. The song also won Beyoncé and Blue Ivy a Soul Train Music Award last year.",[]

Kelly Peterson told The Canadian Press that as trustee of the late musician's estate, she's always looking for ways to further his legacy and welcomes the effort by a Montreal man to see her late husband recognized.

A petition launched last week by Naveed Hussain calling on the city to rename Lionel-Groulx Metro station after Peterson, who grew up in the nearby Little Burgundy neighbourhood, has been gaining traction, so far garnering more than 16,000 signatures.

""I love the idea of Oscar being honoured,"" Peterson said Thursday. ""It always really warms my heart and thrills me to see him being remembered.""

""To have so many people in the neighbourhood in which he grew up wanting to honour him and remember him that way is really overwhelming.""

However, the City of Montreal and its transit agency, the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), have said that renaming a Metro station is complicated and not likely to happen.

An STM spokesperson said stations are typically named after the streets they exit onto or nearby landmarks.The STM has only ever made five name changes since the Metro opened in 1966, and it's had a moratorium on name changes since 2006.

A previous grassroots attempt to rename Lionel-Groulx station for Peterson in 2008, shortly after the musician's death, did not succeed.

This mural at the corner of Saint-Jacques and Des Seigneurs streets honouring Oscar Peterson was unveiled in 2011. (CBC)

In Montreal, a concert hall at Concordia University bears Peterson's name, as does a park not far from Lionel-Groulx station. There's also a mural across from the green space in Little Burgundy near the Metro station, inaugurated in 2010.

A city spokesperson indicated this week officials would be open to finding a different way of honouring the jazz legend whose career spanned more than 60 years.

Just last year, the city honoured Peterson's late sister, Daisy Peterson-Sweeney, an accomplished music teacher, by naming a park in the neighbourhood for her.

""I would be delighted and thrilled and honoured if the city wanted to do something to honour Oscar even more,"" Peterson said.

""It's not something I ever expect from anyone — I don't just mean Montreal — Oscar was always humbled by every honour he received, and I feel the same way.""

Canadian jazz great Oscar Peterson, who appeared on The Wayne & Shuster Hour in 1964, won eight Grammy Awards over his illustrious career. (CBC)

Kelly Peterson, who lives in southern Ontario, said it's not for her to get involved in Montreal city politics or change its policies.

""I don't live there. I don't feel I have the right to get involved in something that has an impact on the residents, and I'm not one of them,"" she said. ""But the honour? Absolutely, I love it.""

Oscar Peterson does have schools named for him in the Ontario communities of Mississauga and Stouffville, as well as a small square in Toronto's financial district.

Kelly Peterson's focus has been on promoting her late husband's musical legacy — the songs that he recorded and played, but more recently, those he composed himself, so that people can see a more complete version of Oscar Peterson.

""People play Bach. People play Beethoven. I want people to play Oscar Peterson,"" she said. ""I've always felt that his music will outlive all of us: people will be listening to Oscar's music 100 years from now, so it would be nice if there are other things that represent him, as well.""",[]

Featuring illustrations by Ben Hodson, Hey Little Rockabye conveys an important message about finding love and acceptance: a young girl rescues a little dog and tries to convince her parents to let her keep him.

An accompanying song was released and the book features sheet music for readers to sing along.

Sainte-Marie spoke with Shelagh Rogers about creating Hey Little Rockabye.

For the love of pets

""Hey Little Rockabye is about the many wonderful pets who need a forever home. We're hoping that people will consider adopting a little Rockabye of their own through shelters. There are all kinds of reasons why a pet may need a home — and all kinds of people who would do well to have one.

There are all kinds of reasons why a pet may need a home — and all kinds of people who would do well to have one.

""Over the years, I came to be not only a dog people but a cat people. So I'm both. Cats and dogs are very different. Most people who start out with dogs they think that a cat is going to speak the same language as a dog. But you can train cats, you just have to learn a different language. It's like playing the piano is kind of like playing a guitar, but not exactly in crucial ways.""

Longing for a pet

""As a little girl, I had rabbits. There was a dog and there was a cat that everybody ignored. When I was a little girl I wanted to be a zookeeper — and would envision that would get me close to animals!

When I'm on the road, I like to go down to the local shelter or the local pet stores where they have pets out for adoption.

""I'm always longing for a pet. When I'm on the road — when I'm in Toronto or Calgary or someplace — I like to go down to the local shelter or the local pet stores where they have pets out for adoption. I like to go in to socialize with the animals who are there.

""I think it does those pets a lot of good, the more people socialize with them. It makes them a better candidate for adoption if we do that now and then.""

Finding forever homes

""I'm glad that people are finding out about available animals at pet shelters. All of my animals have been rescues. Adopting a pet is a major thing.

It's a major commitment and I'm so proud that people are finding forever homes for these animals.

""In many pet shelters, you have to sign some papers that state you are not going to adopt a kitten and then abandon it when it grows up — or adopt a dog and then find out that there are vet bills involved.

'Differences,' Tona

For well over a decade, Scarborough artist Tona has released some of the best independent rap records to come out of the city. Tona makes rap for rap fans, delivering bar after bar of smart, versatile rhymes in his trademark baritone voice. Over his career, which includes a Juno Award as a member of Naturally Born Strangers, Tona has proven to be one of the most consistent, but also most underrated, rappers — a position he addresses multiple times on his new album, July 26 . ""If I wasn't so unconventional I'd probably make something lighter for radio,"" he raps on ""Differences,"" a standout cut that sees him reminiscing on his early days over a minor-key piano melody and trunk-rattling drums. While the sound of Toronto has changed a lot since Tona debuted in 2007, he's proven to be a mainstay through it all. As he raps on the chorus, ""I do it till they understand the difference."" — Jesse Kinos-Goodin

'Magic Eyes,' Noble Oak

""My intent from day 1 was literally to make the most beautiful songs that I possibly can,"" says Vancouver's Patrick Fiore, a.k.a. Noble Oak. The 10 songs on his new album, Horizon, fulfil that promise with wistful melodies and lush production that conjure expansive, luminous vistas. ""Never say never,"" begins ""Magic Eyes,"" whose optimism gleams through a mist of synthesizer, piano, finger snaps and gentle bongos while Fiore's falsetto ascends. It's music that affords both a worthwhile journey inward and an exhilarating out-of-body experience. — Robert Rowat

'House on Fire,' Plants and Animals

On their first album in four years, Montreal band Plants and Animals is determined to make a bold statement and its lead single does just that. ""House on Fire"" kicks off with a heavy, chugging bass line that's soon joined by a number of other grooving elements: thick synths that jump in unexpectedly, a keyboard part that dances alongside singer Warren Spicer's soaring vocals, and cowbell and finger snap accents to tie it all together. It's a crowded description but it perfectly builds into an inferno of its own as Spicer sings about his concerns over his friend self-medicating, leading Spicer to an image of him falling asleep with the stove on. ""Your house is on fire!"" he shouts over the chorus, howling the word 'fire' with an extra punch of urgency. A bold statement indeed, and one that makes us beg for more. — Melody Lau

'Muddy Tracks,' Bébé Buckskin

As soon as Bébé Buckskin's vocals start on ""Muddy Tracks,"" the lead song on the Nêhiyaw singer-songwriter's sophomore EP, Alanis Morissette comes to mind. Bébé Buckskin's raw, powerful voice has all the emotion and range that Morissette used to tear through the '90s with Jagged Little Pill — and it's hard not to imagine Bébé Buckskin, the Northern Alberta singer known as Danielle Ghostkeeper offstage, doing something similar. Bébé Buckskin unleashes her potency over the blues-rock number, the gritty electronic guitar matching her as they both slowly build to a crashing halt by song's end. ""Muddy Tracks"" is one of five new songs on Askiskiy, which precedes Ghostkeeper's forthcoming full-length album, recorded at FAME Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala. We can't wait to hear more. — Holly Gordon

'To Silver,' Pyne

Alanna Stuart has lent her voice to a number of projects over the years, from providing backup vocals on Arkells' 2018 album, Rally Cry, to the Queer Songbook Orchestra, to her partnership with Ian Swain in Bonjay. Pyne marks a new solo project for Stuart, one that's dedicated to ""freeing up herself and airing out sonic experiments,"" as a Facebook post notes. ""To Silver"" is her debut single, a ""janky dancefloor warm-up track and a love note, in retrospect."" Mastered by Jeremy Greenspan, the track is a small snippet (clocking in at just two-and-a-half minutes) of what we can only assume is something bigger and more boisterous. Stuart's voice alone is a big enough draw here as it simmers and builds atop a stomping beat, but the rhythms and production also point to an exciting, more dance-oriented direction we think can be a perfect fit. — ML",[]

""I first had this idea with my friend Philippe Marinier, we were talking about the long overdue fight against systemic racism and how it had finally gained momentum here in Quebec,"" writes the singer-songwriter via email from Lyon, France, where she's been living since February due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We saw an opportunity to create a more inclusive space for people that are not represented during the Fête nationale celebrations. We don't want anyone to have to choose between their identity and their feeling of belonging here in Quebec.""

Just over a week ago, Quebec Premier François Legault announced he would set up a task force to look at ways to counter racism across provincial services — while also saying that racism isn't systemic in the province . Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, meanwhile, promised systemic action after a report was released detailing racism and discrimination across the city.

At a time when anti-Black racism is being protested widely, Nolin and Marinier, along with drag queen Kiara, took the 20 days they had between coming up with the idea and the actual holiday to create a wishlist of performers who could use the online festival however they wanted to mark the Quebec holiday — and they've pre-recorded what looks to be an incredible event.

Called Saint-Jeanne — a title that follows the ""Fête nationale lingo,"" Nolin points out, while playing outside the binary by incorporating both masculine (Saint) and feminine (Jeanne) names — the festival will feature performers Jeremy Dutcher, Tranna Wintour, Gabrielle Boulianne Tremblay, Karl Hardy, Annie Sama and 2020 Polaris Music Prize longlisters Backxwash and Anachnid, as well as drag queens Kiara, Matante Alex and Gisèle Lullaby.

""It was easy to pitch to the artists because the only mandate we gave them was to be honest about their feelings,"" writes Nolin. ""We did not want to put together a show where people would praise Quebec, a province we know has its flaws. It's important for us that the participants be real and really tell it how it is.""

Nolin, whose father is Algerian, says she's always had mixed feelings about St-Jean-Baptiste Day.

""I come from Quebec City and have often joined celebrations, but this does not change the fact that I faced racism growing up and therefore did not really feel like I was welcomed to celebrate. I now feel like I have to look forward and make this holiday mine. I want to use the platform I have to create a space for others who, like me and for various other reasons, don't think they are welcomed to join the festivities. St-Jean-Baptiste Day, to me, means refusing the status quo and taking a stance.

She also hopes the event sends a message about what it means to be Québécois.

""I want the entertainment industry to see that creating a space where people are not only included but celebrated can and will make a difference in how we look at our past as well as to how we build our future. I also hope that those who feel left out of traditional Fête nationale celebrations and of the usual discourse about the Québécois identity know that this is to shine a light on what makes them who they are.""",[]

(Hickey's Funeral Home)

Kathleen Hearn's obituary isn't your average death notice.

""It pains me to admit it, but apparently, I have passed away … I now will check the obituaries and finally see my name there,"" it reads.

Hearn died on Thursday, but not before she penned her own obituary, one full of wit and wry humour.

Katheen's sister-in-law, Dorothy Hearn, says she wasn't surprised by the obit.

""I expected nothing less from her than to do her own obituary and have a few jokes thrown in,"" she said.

Kathleen Hearn was outgoing, funny and loving, her sister-in-law Dorothy Hearn says. (Submitted by Dorothy Hearn)

Dorothy said she didn't get to see the obit before it was published, but was ""just blown away"" when she read it.

She said Kathleen had an unpredictable and sometimes shocking sense of humour — as her obituary shows.

""As I leave you all behind, I want to thank all those who were part of my life and the butt of my jokes,"" Kathleen wrote.

""In the meantime, I now have the smoking hot body I have always wanted… having been cremated.""

'Kathy was Kathy'

In the 40 years that she knew Kathleen, Dorothy said it was nothing but laughs when they were together.

""Kathleen was full of life. From the moment we met her, until her last breath, Kathy was Kathy,"" she said.

""She was outgoing, funny, loving, a sense of humour like no other person you could meet. Very loveable.""

Dorothy said Kathleen even held a contest to choose an obit, but decided to write her own instead.

""She just had a couple of other people write an obituary to see which one would be the best one, but of course she went with her own. She knew that from the beginning anyway, it was just a fun thing to do,"" she said.

Kathleen had her fair share of tough times in her life, Dorothy said, like her husband Mack's battle with multiple sclerosis and his death at just 45 years old.

But through it all, including her own battle with cancer, she said Kathleen took it all in stride.

""There was never a down day in her life. No matter what came at her, it was a laugh. She dealt with it like no one I have ever known,"" Dorothy said.

""Even during her chemo at the Health Sciences [Centre], the staff there were in constant laughter … she just didn't let anything get her down.""

Even after her sister-in-law's passing, Dorothy Hearn said she's glad Kathleen's humorous obituary could put a smile on people's faces.

""She walked in and the whole atmosphere changed. She was a constant riot, you didn't know what she was going to say next,"" she said.

""There will never be another Kathy.""

Previously', 'Cbc News', 'Posted']",,"As recreational sports gradually resume across Ontario, organizers say they're taking the necessary steps to keep players safe. But do the strict new measures go far enough?

Brockville Braves coach Gene Falsetto, whose players are 15 to 20, said COVID-19 has fundamentally changed the way he runs the organization. Falsetto had to write to Hockey Canada and Hockey Eastern Ontario to outline the steps he would take to try to prevent the spread of COVID-19, in dressing rooms and on the ice, before his team could meet up last week.

He said both the players and their parents, who aren't yet allowed into the arena, are more than happy to comply with the new rules if it means getting back to the game they love.

""They want to see things succeed,"" he said. ""They're ecstatic, and so am I.""

Among the many new rules: only nine players are allowed on the ice at a time during two 60-minute practices each week; the focus is on skill development, and no contact between players is allowed; and water bottles must be placed two metres apart.

No more sharing water bottles. Like the one in this file photo, they must now be kept at least two metres apart. (Cole Burston/Canadian Press)

""I think being able to have a smaller group and being able to control that smaller group is much easier for coaches, for players, and I think it helps the parents ease their minds as well,"" Falsetto said.

Dressing rooms are for putting on helmets, gloves and skates only. That means players must arrive at the rink mostly dressed, like when they were little. Even then, Falsetto tries to keep the number of players in the room at any one time to four or five.

Soccer also making a comeback

Many of the new rules being adopted by recreational soccer clubs mirror those in hockey.

""There is a consumer confidence right now that's very low, hence why it's very important that you have safety and protocols demonstrated in a graduated way,"" said Johnny Misley, CEO of Ontario Soccer, which has set out a three-phase plan to return to competitive play in the province.

Currently, all Ottawa clubs are still in Phase 1 of the plan, and have been since June 12. Players practise in groups of about four that have been told to stick together. For now, they stay two metres apart, even in their groups.

""It's good for the community, it's good for society and it's a nice way to ease back into normalcy,"" Misley said. ""We're contributing to good mental health, and that's a huge concern right now.""

Like hockey, it's unclear yet when games will resume. Misley said the rules will progress in lockstep with the province.

Weigh the risks, expert advises

While players may be champing at the bit to get back to regular competition, Dr. Gerald Evans, medical director of infection prevention and control at Kingston Heath Sciences Centre, says they and their parents should weigh the benefits against the potential costs.

In recent months, professional baseball and hockey players, along with golfers and other athletes, have tested positive for COVID-19, and Evans said that shows there may be something about group exercise that allows the respiratory illness to spread. When that transmission is occurring is harder to nail down, however.

""The part that's hard to sort out is what part of it is the actual sport and what part of it is the social activities that occur around sports. That's a bit of an unknown,"" he said.

""We know that congregating in change rooms, from lessons in health care, is a particularly vulnerable time when transmission can occur.""

Athletes produce more respiratory droplets when they're exerting themselves, and it's difficult to engage in aerobic activity while wearing a face mask, Evans pointed out.

""You've got to balance it. At the moment, as we're trying to get on top of this disease, is it worth the risk?"" he asked. ""There's nothing wrong with having a summer off where all you do is go swimming and hanging out in your backyard and not do anything else.""",[]

The first time Sonja Wild saw a dolphin using an empty seashell to scoop an unwitting fish into its mouth, she got so excited she almost forgot to photograph it.

This rare and unique hunting technique is called ""shelling"" or ""conching."" A hungry dolphin will chase a hard-to-catch fish into an empty seashell, then ferry the shell to the surface where the dolphin uses its beak to jostle the prey into its mouth.

""Seeing it for the first time was just a 'wow' moment because you do not expect a shell popping up right next to the boat that is being carried by a dolphin. You kind of, like, drop everything,"" said Wild, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Konstanz and the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany.

""I was definitely mind-blown,"" she told As It Happens guest host Duncan McCue.

Wild is the lead author of a new study in the journal Current Biology that documents how conching has spread through dolphin populations as the clever creatures teach each other how to do it.

Scientists have observed instances of conching going back at least 10 years, though it has always been a rare sight.

Wild says there was a major uptick in sightings in Shark Bay, off the coast of Western Australia, after a 2011 marine heat wave killed off a large number of sea snails, leaving their shells ripe for the picking.

Wild and her colleagues have been observing the Shark Bay dolphins for years, mapping their social and genetic relationships. Between 2007 and 2018, they identified 1,000 individual dolphins and saw 19 of them engage in conching 42 times.

While conching still appears to be quite rare, Wild says all the dolphins who do it know each other.

While analyzing their population data, the researchers found that conching spreads horizontally within dolphin generations, meaning from peer to peer, as opposed to vertically, from mother to calf.

""That is indeed quite special because dolphins normally rely very much on their mothers for foraging behaviour,"" Wild said.

""And we're now showing for the first time that they are, indeed, capable of learning foraging behaviour outside of the mother-calf bond.""

Janet Mann, a dolphin researcher at Georgetown University who wasn't involved in the study, told the New York Times it's impossible to say definitively that peer imitation is the only way dolphins learn about conching, noting we've ""barely scratched the water's surface"" when it comes to understanding the behaviour.

Wild agrees.

""It is very much possible that some dolphins may have learned this by themselves, by just interacting with their shells and then by accident kind of lifting them above the surface,"" she said.

She says it's possible, too, that some dolphins are passing the skill down to their young. But her team's models ""clearly show that the majority have learned from their peers.""

Why do they do it?

Wild says she's not sure why dolphins use shells to trap and eat fish.

She says they are very playful creatures, and it could be as simple as ""just a little bit of fun to get your meal in a different way than usual.""

But whatever their motivation, it proves they can adapt to a changing environment and pick up new skills — an ability that could help them survive as climate change alters ocean populations and makes food more scarce, she said.

Wild has been studying the dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia, for years. (Sonja Wild/Dolphin Innovation Project)

""Learning from your mother is very useful in kind of stable environments that don't change, because the parental behaviour is tested and stable and adapted to the environment. But as soon as the environment changes, the behaviour may become outdated or inefficient or even maladaptive,"" Wild said.

""And in that case, it's beneficial if you start looking around to see what other dolphins are doing.""

'Humans are not the only ones with culture'

Picking up new tricks from friends is rare in the animal kingdom, Wild said. It's a form of learning that's usually only observed in primates, including apes, chimpanzees and, of course, humans.

""It certainly helps to understand their intelligence by knowing that they are capable of innovating such remarkable behaviour, but it also helps us to understand that dolphin societies are maybe not that different from us humans,"" Wild said.

""They have very complex social relationships. They use tools. They are able to learn to use tools from one another. So it kind of helps our understanding that humans are not the only ones with culture.""

161,cbc,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tenino-covid-economy-1.5643409,U.S. town prints its own wooden money in move to revive local economy sickened by COVID-19,"['Thomson Reuters', 'Posted', 'Jul', 'Pm Et', 'Last Updated']",,"Tucked away under lock and key in a former railroad depot turned small-town museum in the U.S. state of Washington, a wooden printing press cranked back to life to mint currency after nearly 90 dormant years.

The end product: $25 US wooden bills bearing the town's name — Tenino — with the words ""COVID Relief"" superimposed on the image of a bat and the Latin phrase ""Habemus autem sub potestate"" (We have it under control) printed in cursive.

With the coronavirus pandemic plunging the United States into a recession, decimating small businesses and causing job losses across the country, some local governments are looking for innovative ways to help residents weather the storm.

For Tenino, the answer was the revival of the local currency that had bolstered the town's economy in 1931 in the wake of the Great Depression.

""It was kind of an epiphany: Why don't we do that again?"" Mayor Wayne Fournier told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It only made sense.""

Tenino, a town of less than 2,000 people located about 95 kilometres southwest of Seattle, started printing the local banknotes in April, five weeks into Washington state's lockdown.

$300 a month per person

Anyone with a documented loss of income as a result of the pandemic is eligible for up to $300 US a month of the local currency.

Businesses up and down the town's quaint Main Street accept the wooden note for everything except alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and lottery tickets.

Susan Witt, executive director of the Schumacher Center for a New Economics, a Massachusetts-based think tank, said alternative currencies like Tenino's banknote are better than direct cash payments at boosting local economies.

""The City of Barcelona gave donations (in 2017/18) to sports teams and cultural groups as well as social programs (then) watched these donations go to big box stores,"" she said in emailed comments.

""So, it created a local currency so that these 'discretionary' funds in its budget would circle back to support locally-owned businesses.""

Old idea

Mayor Fournier noted that, for long-time Tenino residents, the wooden notes are nothing new.

The tiny town founded around a sandstone quarry achieved national prominence in 1931 when civic leaders printed a wooden local currency to restore consumer confidence after the town's bank failed during the Great Depression.

""This is woven into the DNA of the community,"" Fournier said. ""My great aunt Erlene has the family collection all stashed away.""

The mayor brought the idea of resurrecting the town's legacy project to the city council as a way to provide economic relief to businesses and residents suffering as a result of lockdown measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.

In April councilors approved the proposal to issue up to $10,000 in local scrip.

So far, 13 residents have successfully applied for the funds and some $2,500 worth of wooden bills have been issued, Fournier said, with donations upping the total funds available to $16,000.

Fournier views the project as the kind of initiative towns and small cities must take upon themselves to survive the coronavirus outbreak amid what he views as an inadequate federal response.

He pointed out that the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a fund of forgivable loans designed to keep businesses afloat through the pandemic, is not scaled for the businesses in Tenino that have just a handful of employees.

""A federal program dumps money from the top and these blue-chip companies steal it all,"" Fournier said. ""If we do it from the ground up, there's no stealing. It's a direct ballast to Main Street.""

From the outset, the unprecedented first-come-first-served program struggled with technology and paperwork problems that led some businesses to miss out while some affluent firms got funds they did not necessarily need.

""From mom-and-pop shops on Main Street to local employers who are anchors in our community, we have seen the PPP save millions of jobs and keep small firms moving forward,"" said Jeremy Field, the regional administrator for the Small Business Administration, which oversees the program.

He noted in emailed comments that 86.5% of loans granted nationally were for less than $150,000 and that the program covered almost three-quarters of the small business payroll in Washington state.

'Hacking the system'

Fournier said he has already fielded queries from towns across the country looking to emulate Tenino's effort.

""What if 5,000 other small cities did that same thing and took it upon themselves to put $10,000 into Main Street?"" he asked.

""That's $50 million US directly into small businesses. It totally hacks the system.""

So far, however, Tenino's currency does not appear to be circulating much among local businesses.

At the grocery and hardware store that anchors Main Street, manager Chris Hamilton said that by mid-June customers had spent $150 US in the local bills to buy necessities like groceries and a new faucet to replace a broken tap.

""I'll redeem it for cash at city hall,"" he said. ""I hadn't thought about recirculating it.""

Next door at Don Juan's Mexican Kitchen, owner Juan Martinez Jr. has four of the wooden $25 notes sitting in his cash register.

In a case of history repeating, he said coin collectors have offered to buy the bills from him for double their value in U.S. dollars.

Back in the 1930s, coin collectors fueled a speculative rise in the value of the town's wooden scrip, according to Washington state online encyclopedia HistoryLink.

50 local currencies currently in use

The Schumacher Center for a New Economics has documented more than 50 local alternative currencies globally that were active as of summer 2019.

They range from the artfully designed Brixton Pound in London, England, to the Mumbuca, which bankrolls the basic income scheme in Marica, Brazil.

The centre also sponsors BerkShares, a local currency that has been circulating in the Berkshire region of western Massachusetts for 14 years.

Witt cautions that notes backed by U.S. dollars are only a halfway measure, because the amount of local currency available is limited by the amount of federal dollars the town has on hand to exchange it with.

""A truly independent currency would allow for issuing currency as needed,"" she said.

That ""new"" money would circulate through the local economy and then eventually go toward paying property taxes over the course of several years, she added.

But, for now, Witt said, Tenino's project is an effective way to empower a community being brought to its knees by factors beyond its control.

""I don't believe the good people of Tenino meant for their wooden (banknotes) to serve as a robust local currency,"" she said.

""They are instead making an important point. COVID and the lack of federal response to the crisis has motivated municipalities to explore what could be done with their own currencies.""",[]

Ashley Singh says her toddler, Drake, left for a 45-day stay with his grandparents at the beginning of March, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Now, after nearly four months, she's wondering when she'll be able to see her son again.

At the time he left with her in-laws, she said they didn't know COVID-19 would become a widespread pandemic that would close borders and ground flights around the world.

Drake was supposed to return to Canada with his grandparents in April, but all of their flights have been cancelled.

Finally, they were booked on a Lufthansa flight set to leave New Delhi on July 7. But when they went to check in, the airline wouldn't let them through, despite having all the necessary paperwork to fly, Singh said.

According to the federal government's website, Canadian citizens and immediate family members of Canadian citizens or permanent residents are allowed to enter Canada during the pandemic.

'We don't understand'

Singh said her in-laws brought several documents along to show that they were family members, including her son's birth certificate, her marriage certificate, and a letter from her saying they were his grandparents. Singh said the agents didn't even look at the paperwork that her in-laws tried to provide.

""They just saw that my in-laws have Indian passports and they're like, 'nope, you can't fly, you're not allowed,'"" she said.

""We don't understand. If they meet all of the criteria, why were they turned away?""

She said she's contacted everyone she can think of from the airline and different government agencies to try to figure out why they weren't allowed on the plane and ask for help getting her son home, but says she feels like her pleas are falling on deaf ears.

""Excuse my language, but what the hell am I supposed to do?"" she said.

""When you talk to people … like the airlines and stuff, they try to be empathetic. But at the same time you can kind of tell that they're like, 'Don't really care. It's not my problem, not my kid. Too bad for you.'""

Airline looking into matter

Tal Muscal, Lufthansa's director of communications for the Americas, said this is the first he has heard of the Singhs' situation and he will investigate the matter with his colleagues in India.

""We of course are all eager to reunite Drake with his family,"" he said, but the airline needs ""more information to understand why he and his grandparents were not able to board their flight.""

A spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada said that while they couldn't comment on specific incidents due to privacy concerns, the department is doing everything it can to help Canadians stranded in India under these ""unprecedented circumstances.""

However, the spokesperson said flights that aren't organized by the High Commission of Canada in India are subject to the boarding rules and eligibility requirements of the airline and local authorities, not the government of Canada.

Though passengers do not require authorization from the embassy to take any relief flights, they are responsible for verifying their eligibility to travel through other countries.

Singh said her in-laws had lived with her and her husband and helped take care of their son before, and thought Drake's 45-day stay would be a good experience for them.

She and her husband were also finding it challenging to find child care at the time, and one of them would have had to quit their job in order to take care of him.

""That's mainly why we let Drake go with them, was because we knew that he would be well taken care of, and we didn't really have another choice.""

She said she knows her son is in good hands with his grandparents, but still worries about him being overseas during a pandemic.

""You just never know what could go on in another country, especially overseas. Things can get volatile very fast.""

At this point, she and her husband are trying to book her son and his grandparents on another flight.

Tickets have been very expensive, however, and they're worried about shelling out money for another flight only to have their hopes dashed yet again.",[]

They're so easy to make they kind of make themselves.

Yet some are even easier than others, like these (lacto-fermented) pickles here, which require no separately-made brine. For instance, sauerkraut is one of the easiest fermented foods to make: massage salt into sliced cabbage and it makes its own brine.

That's the extent of the work — the rest is know-how. Once you know the importance of keeping the process clean and the cabbage submerged, how much salt to add and how to keep an eye on it, you'll make and enjoy delicious sauerkraut any time. Which is why we created this guide that walks you through making a batch successfully.
