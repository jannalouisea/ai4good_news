Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

B.C.’s food and beverage processing industry alone (not including primary production) is the second largest manufacturing sector in the province, after forestry. With so much to choose from, incorporating local food into our daily diet is easy.According to Canada’s new food guide, a healthy and balanced meal consists of 50 per cent fruits and vegetables, 25 per cent protein, and 25 per cent whole grains. If we look to local food to fill our plate, here are some of the options.

B.C. is a leader in Canada when it comes to farm sales of fruit and vegetables. In 2018 our province was number one in the nation in sales of blueberries, sweet cherries, rhubarb, raspberries, prunes and plums, blackberries, apricots and pears, and second in greenhouse vegetables, mushrooms, brussels sprouts, kale, lettuce, and beets.

While the majority is seasonally dependent, many farmers offer options for consumers to eat locally all year round. Sky Harvest is Canada’s first certified organic urban farm located in Richmond B.C., growing high-quality organic microgreens indoors all year round. Another way to eat local vegetables no longer in season is when they are preserved. Located in North Vancouver is Ms. Lee’s Natural Foods offering vegan Korean kimchi in three traditional flavours. Each small batch is handcrafted and full of beneficial live probiotics. A must try recipe is Kimchi Pancakes!

When it comes to protein, North Vancouver offers a great variety of local food brands specializing in this muscle builder. For those that prefer plant-based options there is Tempea Natural Foods and Modern Meat.

Tempea Natural Foods makes hand-crafted, organic, unpasteurized and non-GMO tempeh in a gluten-free facility. Tempeh is a popular food item in Indonesia that is made by fermenting cooked soybeans. Compared to tofu, tempeh has a meatier texture and the fermentation brings out a savoury and nutty flavour. It cooks quickly by frying, grilling, or baking and is a protein rich addition to any meal.

Modern Meat offers plant-based meat alternatives. The company’s products include burgers, meatballs, crumble, and their most recent innovation, crab cakes. All of their products are free of soy, gluten, nuts, GMOs, artificial preservatives or additives.

Also located in North Vancouver is family owned business Two Rivers Meats, offering farm to table meat from a handpicked group of small farms in B.C. Their promise is locally sourced and ethically raised meat without hormones, antibiotics or chemical feed additives.

A new North Shore food brand is Mitch’s Catch offering seafood sustainably caught off the coast of Haida Gwaii and Oregon. Their specialty is Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna – you don’t want to miss out on their pre-cut poke packages and marinade. The company was created by two West Vancouver families, one with roots in commercial fishing and the other with roots in storytelling.

North Vancouver based Tao Organics produces a sprouted quinoa that is the perfect whole grain option. Soaking and sprouting grains makes the food easier for our bodies to absorb the nutrients. Tao Organics cafe was a long-standing go-to spot in North Vancouver for those wanting to eat organic, raw, plant-based cuisines. Her products are now offered online since closing this March.

And what meal would be complete without a beverage.

Tality Kombucha brews flavourful kombucha in North Vancouver by infusing whole organic roots, fruits, flowers or herbs directly into the kombucha instead of adding juices and concentrate. The product is low in sugar and rich in probiotics. Not only does it taste good, you can feel good drinking it knowing the glass is 100 per cent recyclable, the labels are made of 100 per cent post-consumer recycled material, and one per cent of their sales is donated to a local environmental NGO.

Eating locally is not only easy and delicious, it also has positive benefits to our local economy and environment. According to LOCO BC, an organization dedicated to the buy local movement, local businesses recirculate up to 4.6 times more revenue in the local economy than multinationals by keeping 63 cents of every dollar a consumer spends within the B.C. economy, versus only 14 cents from a multinational. Purchasing locally grown and made products also minimizes your consumer ""FoodPrint,"" as less transportation distance is needed for the food to make it to you.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

And now, that relationship is over.

Everything you once held to be true is in turmoil and you have to find a new way to move forward.

Finding a divorce lawyer who will serve your best interests is not the same as finding a friend who will take your side on everything. The best family law practitioner is someone who will be a fierce advocate for your rights but who also acts as a knowledgeable and objective guide through a complicated legal system.

“The process can be so overwhelming,” says Janneke Lewis, a family lawyer, mediator and parenting co-ordinator with Pettit and Company Trial Lawyers. “It takes knowing the legal system to be able to function effectively within it.”

Lewis has been a family lawyer in British Columbia since 2001, when she first worked with the firm’s founder, Tim Pettit. “He is incredibly hard working, ethical and knowledgeable—all characteristics that are important to me,” she says about her recent decision to join the firm.“Pettit and Co. are strong litigators which is essential, especially when it comes to family law. If one party is reluctant to disclose all their assets or income, it’s important to go to a lawyer who knows how to obtain the relevant information. Once you have full disclosure, it’s easier to come to a settlement.”

Divorce transforms a relationship that was based on love into something that becomes, in essence, a business transaction. Assets get appraised and divided; monetary value is given to things that are freighted with emotional meaning.

When there are children involved, it becomes even more complex. “Adults make their own decisions but children are tied to their parents’ decisions,” Lewis says. Her advice to parents is that “divorce will disrupt your child’s life but it doesn’t have to destroy it as long as you both can be respectful towards them. Don’t pull them into this. This is their mom. This is their dad. This is half of them. You might have every right to be angry with your spouse but that’s different from how your children feel.

“My experience,” Lewis adds, “is that if we get caught up in angst and anger it will protract the litigation, perhaps when there doesn’t even need to be litigation in the first place. I am very direct right from the beginning. I say, ‘I hear you, I get it, but this is what we need to do.’”

“For me it’s about empathy and fairness,” agrees Caitlin MacDonnell, who has also recently joined Pettit and Company’s expanding family law practice on the North Shore and Squamish. “Someone in a divorce is going through one of the worst times in their lives so they’ll be emotional; then there are all these legal issues that they have to deal with. A lot of our work is about supporting them through that process.”

Divorce law assigns rights and responsibilities, which can have serious and long-term consequences.

“The court system is extremely complex, whether it’s always right or the best way to do things,” says MacDonnell, who notes that, in B.C., a couple is a legal entity if they’ve been together for two or more years, whether they’re married or not. “When I’m meeting with a client, I’m listening to everything that’s going on and pulling out the legal issues that we can speak to a judge or opposing counsel about.

“Without a lawyer, people can feel it didn’t end up fairly for them. My job is to have already seen all of these things and how a judge will view them. I protect the interests of my client. For them, divorce is often quite lonely and it’s nice to have someone on their side.”

Founded in 2011, Pettit and Company has built its reputation on an innovative handling of legal strategies. The firm is also pleased that Alexandra (Allie) Booth is bringing her 20 years of experience to the practice, and to be working again with Amanda Groves, who worked closely with Pettit when they were first at North Shore Law.",[]

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

Around the province, communities are divided between those that want tourism, and those without medical facilities that plead for people to stay away. For folks on the North Shore, there is a third option. We can enjoy “staycations” right here at home in places we have never visited before. It’s easy if you just know where to go. To save you some time, I have spent the last 30 years exploring our wilderburb and it’s amazing what you can discover in just a few decades, especially using Google Maps.

What the heck is a “wilderburb?” According to American historian Lincoln Bramwell, it’s those rare and special places where the wilderness and suburbia interconnect. No finer example in the world can be found than the North Shore, where the mountains meet the sea amidst a paradise of forests, beaches, coves, cliffs, ponds and lakes. The trouble is that many of the best known are busy and many others are hard to find. Let me share a few with you.

One day I was at Gleneagles Golf Course wondering whether I wished to embarrass myself by playing a round of golf, when I noticed a family emerging from the woods behind the 7th hole carrying what looked to be picnic supplies. There is a tall wire screen just to the right of the tee box, and a paved path starts after the screen to the right. Take the path and walk 100 yards to where a small sign says Larsen Creek. The trail descends steeply down beside the creek. There are rough steps down the trail nicely edged with wire mesh to stop any slips and falls. It’s only a five-minute walk. There is a small sandy beach and the view is terrific. Passage Island can be seen in the distance. You’d never know Larsen beach was there. It’s totally hidden.

At that time we were carrying a baby around, so many of the trails and hikes I’d heard about, like the Grouse Grind, were out of consideration. I don’t like climbing steep mountain trails at the best of times. Even back then, attractions like Cates Park and Ambleside were quite busy, so I pulled out a map from the car and started to study it carefully. These days you simply type in Google Maps on your phone or computer and zoom in as close as you want. Google Street View brings you up close enough to read street signs. Voila!

Seen from the sea on a kayak, there are literally dozens of beaches along the Shore, some private and many public. Whytecliff is well known, but try finding a parking place in summer. Quarry Rock, when I first went, was a secret and now it has security guards stopping the hordes, and Deep Cove suffers from “overtourism.” Then there is the challenge of finding a picnic table or place to eat, because what’s the point of a walk without a snack? Don’t forget to bring a sandwich and a water bottle.

We were sitting on a picnic blanket at Panorama Park (Deep Cove) one time, munching on peanut butter sandwiches, when we learned a very valuable lesson. A family arrived and proceeded to set up shop. Table cloth. Check. Wicker basket. Check. Wine glasses. Fine food. Knives and forks. Hey, if you are going to have a picnic, why not do it right?

As a travel writer I’ve enjoyed the luxury of visiting literally hundreds of destinations in many countries and writing about “off the beaten track” gems, and seen some change and grow, sometimes not for the better. Joffre Lakes, east of Pemberton, now gets over 100,000 people a year. Yikes! When I wrote about Pemberton for a major newspaper chain, half of the folks I met said “you’re going to ruin our village,” and those in tourism said they were thrilled to be put on the map. The secret lies in the writing, especially in the “where to stay, what to do” category.

Most of the secret beaches and picnic places I have found and shared have very little parking. No one is going to want to drive a long way and find no place to park. I usually advise friends to ride a bike, or park elsewhere and walk to the destination. Most have viewpoints and are accessible to children and the elderly. Mother Nature’s Stairmaster, a.k.a. The Grind, is overrun by grinder’s seeking to escape the pandemic through rugged exercise. Why not a place of peace and relaxation instead, with a nice wicker basket of fine food prepared at home or picked up at the local deli?

The late great artist Gordon Smith lived in a lovely little cottage on a laneway just next to Lighthouse Park, where the parking lot fills up before noon. My family visited him at the cottage once, and after dinner he pointed out a little path leading down to the ocean far below, accessible only by a set of stairs and a steep walk down the hill. It led to a spectacular series of cliffs where you could sit and watch the sun go down and see eagles flying by. There was a sign on the lane and space for two cars to park. He was too old to walk it, he said, but encouraged us to go. There are literally dozens of such gems hidden around the North Shore, and you don’t need to drive all the way to Whistler to enjoy them. Stay home this summer and explore your own back yard. Our own wilderburb is truly a piece of paradise.

And one of the surest sources of local small business is the community farmers market!

article continues below

Fortunately, the North Shore is blessed with two popular farmers markets: Lonsdale Artisan Farmers’ Market that operates every Saturday at Lonsdale Quay, and Ambleside Artisan Farmers’ Market that happens on Sundays at Ambleside Park. Both markets are directed by the Artisan Farmers’ Market Society who also run two markets in Burnaby.

Earlier in the pandemic, before health and safety guidelines were defined, the Society faced the uncertainty of being able to open their markets this season. However, within a short time, farmers markets were declared an essential service. This allowed Artisan to open with similar health and safety guidelines to grocery stores, except with a fresh air experience!

One of the beauties of these local markets is that you’ll often meet and speak directly with the people who are growing, baking and making your food and other products. You can ask them about their growing practices, the product ingredients, and the best way to prepare or use the products.

The markets feature small start-up and more established local businesses from all over B.C. Here are a few of the wonderful vendors with ties to the North Shore that you can meet at the market this summer

Little by Little Farms

Pablo and Karla Wilkinson are passionate about sustainable farming and operate Little by Little Farms, based in Aldergrove. Raised in North Vancouver, Pablo gained an appreciation early on for good food. He learned about how food is grown and to value the taste of fresh produce from his grandparents, Hazel and Jack. Having spent years learning organic and sustainable farming practices, Pablo and Karla decided to start Little by Little Farms in 2016. Believing in the importance of safe, healthy food, they do not use chemical pesticides or fertilizers. This season, Little by Little Farms is offering a delicious selection of produce including arugula, micro greens, carrots, tomatoes, baby kale and more!

Bad Dog Bread

Bad Dog Bread has become a favourite at all the Artisan Farmers’ Markets. Based out of their North Vancouver location at 1600 Mackay Road, owner Vadim Mugerman not only bakes a wide variety of tasty baked goods, but he even mills his own flour!

Market customers are advised to get to the market early because Bad Dog usually sells out of their locally handcrafted organic bread and pastries very quickly, especially their delicious cinnamon buns, brioche buns and mouth-watering cookies. Yum, Yum!

Coconama Chocolate

Coconama Chocolate is another local gem that can be found at the North Shore markets. Takanori Chiwata is the owner and chocolate engineer at Coconama and his mission is to connect people with chocolate. Chiwata has a fascinating background as a chocolate researcher in Japan but finds great joy in interacting with customers and providing a fantastic chocolate that people love to savour. You can enjoy Coconama’s delectable gluten- and nut-free creations like the melt-in-your-mouth ganache truffles at the weekly markets and also at their store located on First Avenue East in North Van.

Bob the Dog

Named after their own dog, Bob, Bob the Dog is another North Vancouver-based business that supplies all sorts of treats and accessories for dogs. Each one of their leashes, bandanas, and toys are handmade and sure to be a hit with your beloved four-legged friend. Business owner Carra Hodgson joined Artisan Markets in 2018 and quickly gained many repeat North Shore customers.

Whichever Artisan Farmers’ Market you choose to attend, you’ll be supporting small businesses based in B.C. and on the North Shore. May through October, you can shop at Lonsdale Farmers’ Market on Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in the East Plaza next to Lonsdale Quay. Ambleside Farmers’ Market is open on Sundays, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and you’ll find it in at the west end of Ambleside Park in West Vancouver.

For much of the 1970s and 1980s the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre was regarded as one of Canada’s foremost modern-dance companies.

article continues below

In 1975 it became the first modern dance troupe to tour Canada and went on to become one of the most travelled companies in North America, taking its dance productions to India, Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe and Mexico.

The company also appeared in films and headlined at the National Arts Centre.

“She was a foundational matriarch of a mini-dynasty of dance in Canada,” said her ex-husband Max Wyman, a dance critic, biographer and historian.

Born in Austria, Wyman started dancing at age four and in her teens danced with the Graz Opera Ballet company and at the State Opera in Vienna.

In the late-1940s, Wyman moved to London to continue her study with dance artist and theorist Rudolf von Laban, whose Laban movement analysis, a method for describing and visualizing human movement, had an impact on the young dancer who would go on to employ the method when it came time to develop her own practice as a teacher and choreographer.

She emigrated to Canada in 1967 with her then-husband Wyman and children.

Her arrival coincided with a flowering of interest in the arts in Canada, and she launched The Anna Wyman Dancers in 1971 with a series of performances at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

In a 1985 article published by the New York Times looking at the company’s New York debut, the paper notes: “Any visitor to Canada interested in dance has often heard Miss Wyman’s name mentioned. There is no doubt that she has played a role in the burgeoning dance activity now evident in major Canadian cities.”

A lover of collaboration between dancers and artists of various trades, Wyman’s tenure running her dance company was marked by an emphasis on improvisation, which was novel when first introduced, as well as other remarkable flourishes – such as lights, props, film, and even lasers – which would have seemed more suitable for the theatre than the dance stage.

But this was modern dance and the rules were being broken.

Wyman commissioned costume and set designs with some of the era’s most prominent composers and artists, among them Jack Shadbolt, Toni Onley, Sylvia Tait and John Mills-Cockell.

“It was choreography dance theatre, it wasn’t just dance. It was dance theatre, which involved a lot of things and involved a lot of other artists working with me. We worked together as a team,” Wyman told the North Shore News in December.

With her 1972 piece, Here at the Eye of the Hurricane, Wyman was a winner at the International Young Choreographers Competition in Cologne, Germany.

Another one of her best-known pieces, Dance Is This and That, incorporated Wyman’s philosophy that all movement is a form of dance by showing how a football player crashing on the field, a tennis player in their flow, or even simply walking to get groceries, could be considered dance, if it were observed the right way.

“Dance is life. We are all dancing, but we formalize the dance. It’s living,” said Wyman.

After two decades, the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre completed its run in 1991, but not before the company had accomplished a number of amazing feats, including being the first modern dance company from the West to tour China in 1980.

Wyman continued to administer and teach at her dance school in West Vancouver, nestled between 14th and 15th streets on Marine Drive.

Wyman was there in December when the dance school celebrated 50 years.

Wyman died in hospital Saturday following a heart attack at her West Vancouver home.

Predeceased by her husband, Neil Christopher Wortley, she leaves a son, Trevor Wyman, and a daughter, Gabrielle Capewell.

19,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/opinion/columnists/older-and-wiser-seniors-should-enjoy-the-summer-sun-safely-1.24170871,OLDER AND WISER: Seniors should enjoy the summer sun safely,['Margaret Coates'],,"Finally, it seems summer has appeared. After a month or so of iffy weather, the sun is set to shine a bit more, encouraging people to get out and enjoy the good weather.

For seniors who have been more isolated and challenged because of COVID-19 curtailing their usual activities, such as going to the seniors and recreation centres, the library, shops and so on, the good weather promises a bit more freedom.

article continues below

The municipalities have opened some activities previously closed and some organizations have started a cautious reopening. Older people can now visit the park, attend or hold backyard physical distancing parties, walk along the beach or perhaps sit at the beach in anticipation of a swim or picnic lunch, and possibly take a class at a seniors centre.

However, older people need to continue to be careful as the COVID-19 virus is still prevalent in our communities. Seniors are still the major causality of the virus with most deaths occurring in the seniors population. Many older people have compromised immune systems and other age-related health issues which make them more susceptible to contracting the virus. In a recent update on COVID-19 in British Columbia, Dr. Bonnie Henry says let’s not let our guard down, things could worsen, so everyone should keep up with measures to prevent transmission.

So, continue to take the sound advice from Dr. Henry and others to practice beneficial safety techniques, including washing your hands, physical distancing, perhaps wearing a face mask, especially indoors in crowded public spaces, avoiding big groups of people and keeping your social bubble small and safe. I have to say I am perhaps one of those people that others laugh at because of my restrictive measures, but getting the virus or maybe transmitting it to others is not something I am willing to risk.

Throughout the last few months of the pandemic, older people have been isolated more than usual, and it seems appropriate to allow more in-person (but with physical distancing) social connectedness. It is worrisome that some seniors are so isolated that this might impact their mental health and well-being. As I have often quoted before, one study found evidence that shows that lacking social connections can increase one’s chances for early death to a similar degree to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Balancing opening on-site activities in organizations and keeping seniors safe has been challenging for those that want to see seniors regain their social connections. Organizations on the North Shore have been cautiously reopening some of their on-site activities such as pre-registered classes and outdoor events. Libraries are starting to let people visit their site but with reduced hours and many safety measures. I have been hearing “so far so good” news. Phone your nearest organization and see what they have to offer.

Apart from the COVID-19 virus challenges, summer heat can pose a risk to older people. A May 2019 article in Health Companions for Seniors says “Older adults do not adjust as easily to sudden changes in temperatures. Chronic medical conditions can impact how seniors’ bodies react to heat. Prescription medicines can affect an older person’s ability to regulate or adjust to temperatures, control perspiration, and handle sun exposure.”

But with some simple and maybe some more complex strategies, older people can enjoy this time of year. Generally, the tips for staying safe in the summer heat are simple. One step is to stay hydrated. An article in an issue of On Health: Consumer Reports says “aging can dull your sense of thirst and temperature, increasing your risk of heatstroke, which can be dangerous or even deadly.”

According to Health Canada, symptoms of heat illness can include dizziness or fainting, nausea or vomiting, headache, rapid breathing and heartbeat, extreme thirst, and decreased urination with unusually dark yellow urine. Health Canada suggests: “If you have any of these symptoms during extreme heat, move to a cool place and drink liquids right away.”

Wear sunscreen and a hat – getting a burn is not fun and could cause other issues. Wear light clothing. While you do not have to get out the short shorts, you can get clothing in a protective, breathable, and light fabric to keep you cool. Exercising wisely is a good technique to enjoy the summer without getting overheated. You could spend time in your garden to improve endurance and reduce stress and if you do not have a garden, you might be able to set up some potted plants on your windowsill or balcony. Perhaps now you could also try some physical distancing walking with a friend or family member – the parks are open.

Getting older people back to some semblance of normal is a good thing, but let’s do it responsibly to reduce the risks for seniors.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Documents filed in B.C. Supreme Court say more than 100 children, most of them Indigenous, were left homeless and vulnerable to sexual exploitation and physical or psychological harm.

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 alleged social worker Robert Riley Saunders siphoned away rent and other funds from those under his guardianship while he worked for the Ministry of Children and Family Development in Kelowna.

The settlement, which still needs to be approved by the court, says all claimants would be eligible for a basic payment of $25,000, with a maximum award of up to $250,000 for those who were Indigenous, left homeless, were physically harmed or whose education was delayed.

The court documents say the province has identified 107 foster children who may have been involved, two are dead and four have settled in separation actions. Ninety are believed to be Indigenous.

Jason Gratl, the lawyer for the plaintiff, said the allegations date back to 2001 and there may be more children involved. But poor or false records were kept.

""The records created by Riley Sanders tended to be false and self-serving because Riley Saunders was known to be a con-artist and a self-serving fraudster,"" Gratl said in an interview Wednesday.

He said employment records show that Saunders was insensitive to Aboriginal cultural and history, yet he was assigned to work with high-risk Indigenous children by the ministry.

Saunders has never commented on the allegations or filed a statement of defence in court.

In Victoria on Wednesday, Attorney General David Eby said it has always been the government's goal to ensure appropriate compensation for those affected.

He said additional financial controls have been put in place and there's more training and oversight of the ministry's workers to ensure no child faces the same situation.

""That is of vital importance to the government that we protect these kids. It's an incredibly heart-breaking situation that this happened.""

In its reply to the lawsuit filed in court, the ministry admitted to ""vicarious liability"" for the acts and omissions of Saunders.

The reply said the ministry detected financial irregularities involving Saunders in December 2017 and he was suspended a month later.

""Steps were taken under the direction of the local (ministry) office to ensure the immediate safety and well-being of the children, youth and young adults on the case load of Mr. Saunders,"" the response to the civil claim said.

The prosecution service said it has received a report on Saunders from the RCMP and possible charges are being assessed.

Two lawsuits filed against the province and Saunders in 2018 alleged Saunders moved the children from their homes in order to make them eligible for financial benefits from the ministry, then opened joint bank accounts for each youth.

""Saunders stole the funds deposited by the ministry into joint bank accounts by moving them to his own individual account at Interior Savings and by paying his personal expenses by electronic transfer from the joint bank account,"" the statements said.

They also alleged Saunders was aware of the youths' vulnerability and aware that he exercised parental control over them.

A certification hearing for the class action is scheduled for July 28. If approved, it would allow an individual's case to stand in for all the class members.

A decision from the court on approval of the settlement is expected after the certification hearing.

That's causing angst for organizations such as Souls Harbour Rescue Mission in Halifax, which has already taken on seven students but now doesn't know whether the government will actually cover the payments the volunteers have been promised.

""I wish they would just come out with a statement to say: 'It's taking us a while, but charities, we won't leave you hanging for it,'"" said Souls Harbour CEO Michelle Portman. ""They haven't said that. So that's why we're all twiddling our thumbs and biting our nails.""

Souls Harbour's board of directors has decided the charity will honour the commitment made to the seven students who are now volunteering in its thrift store, even if the government kills the program.

But Portman said that will have financial implications across the rest of the organization, which provides lunches and a safe space for hundreds of people every week.

""We have decided that if the government decides not to pay then we will uphold it in some way and pay the grant for them,"" she said. ""But we have no way of knowing. ... My HR lady is just completely stressed about it because she knows how much that will cost us if the program folds.""

The fate of the program is just one of many unanswered questions about the student-volunteer scheme, which has been left in turmoil after the government and WE ended their partnership on Juy 3.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced general plans for the grant program in April with details following June 25. The government promised students could receive up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours through the program.

Souls Harbour isn't the only one waiting for word from the government since the $20-million contract with Toronto-based WE was terminated amid questions about the Trudeau family's links to WE co-founder Craig and Marc Kielburger.

""We have had no communication,"" said Toronto Zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey ""One of the last communications from the WE folks was just that they were working on transitioning everything back over to the federal government, but there's been nothing further.""

Charities like the Toronto Zoo, which had planned to take on five students to conduct research on animal behaviour during COVID-19, weren't the only ones in the dark. Tracey said her daughter had also heard nothing after applying to work at a centre for Indigenous women.

YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale also said there has been no word on his organization's desire to take on 391 students at branches across the country, adding he was ""starting to wonder if this is going to happen.""

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office and the Employment and Social Development Canada, the federal department that has taken over the program, have said the government will help students dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet they have offered no update on the program, including whether it will even continue.

""The government of Canada remains committed to supporting students and the not-for-profit sector and is working diligently to develop a transition plan, including looking at options on how best to proceed,"" ESDC spokeswoman Isabelle Maheu said in an email Wednesday.

""This means there will be delays, but more information will be provided as soon as it is available.""

The department has also declined to say how many positions the $912-million program was supposed to create for students, how many positions had been approved, the number of applications received from students or how many positions have been filled.

Those questions are in addition to what other organizations were considered to run the program before cabinet decided to award a sole-sourced contract to WE. Trudeau has said WE was recommended by the public service and was the only organization capable of running the program.

Putting the lemons in harms way of people and pets has prompted Coquitlam RCMP to ask people to stop the activity and to encourage people to call police if they see one of these spiky, hanging lemons instead of disposing of the evidence.

So far there have been two instances of someone tying lemons stuck with sewing needles to tree branches — both in Port Coquitlam — police say.

The first lemon was found hung from a branch in Gates Park on June 22. A report was made in an email to the city of Port Coquitlam. The second lemon was found on Tuesday, July 14, tied near a trail by the Coquitlam River at Whyte Avenue. That discovery was reported with an email to a closed Community Police Station.

One of the lemons was reported on Facebook and subsequently commented on in the Tri-City News.

Are they a dangerous new trend?

Police want to know if sticking needles in lemons and tying them to trees in a public park is an attempt to harm people or for some other purpose.

Some have claimed that it’s connected to witchcraft or voodoo, and a report four years ago in the U.S. found a similar occurrence.

What ever the reason, police want to hear from those who are tying these potentially dangerous lemons to a tree.

“If you see something that could be a deliberate attempt at harm, you must call police on the phone rather than send an email,”, stated Corporal Michael McLaughlin in a press release.

“Both of these lemons were thrown into the garbage by the people who found them. By the time police received the emails, the evidence was gone and an investigation was virtually impossible”.

One theory is that the person who left the lemons had no intention to hurt anyone. Until police speak to that person, it’s hard to be sure.

“If you are leaving these lemons full of needles in public, we ask that you stop, and then talk to us to explain what you were doing”, McLaughlin further stated.

If anyone spots someone doing this, they are asked to call the Coquitlam RCMP non-emergency number at 604-945-1550, or call 911 “if it’s happening right in front of you”.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Those were stories we expect from other countries, ones without our medical system or social safety net. Suddenly we had to rethink that.

Closer to home, stories of family members involved in the earliest days of the Lynn Valley Care Centre outbreak should cause us to rethink the idea that significant problems don’t exist in B.C.’s long-term care system as well.

Lynn Valley had the bad luck to be the first care home hit by COVID-19. There were lessons learned there.

But along the way, vulnerable elderly were subjected to conditions they should not have been. What family members saw was not the “situation normal” described by health officials.

Families add lack of adequate care in seniors’ homes in general isn’t an isolated experience.

It’s important to hear their stories.

Nobody dreams of moving into a care home. When it happens, we want to know our elderly loved ones will be comfortable and have their needs taken care of.

But that’s not what happens at least some of the time, thanks to chronic understaffing.

Unless you have a family member in care, you’re unlikely to be exposed to this. The frail elderly are a group who can’t advocate for themselves.

That there are large gaps in seniors care is not new information, however.

B.C.’s Seniors Advocate has been pointing out the problems for years.

But a functioning care system costs a lot of money – a priority that competes with others for dollars.

Incrementally the system is improving, but those in care now, at the end of their lives, don’t have time to wait.

If the situation is to change, it’s incumbent on the public to pay attention and to advocate for change.",[]

The Vancouver Park Board passed a motion late Tuesday which includes provisions to ""more effectively manage temporary structures and tents for those seeking shelter in parks.""

article continues below

The board says the move reflects recent B.C. Supreme Court decisions recognizing the charter right to stay in public spaces when adequate shelter is not available.

The motion passed 4-3 after two nights of debate and submissions from dozens of speakers.

Chrissy Brett, an organizer of a tent city in Vancouver's Strathcona Park and a spokeswoman for other recent Vancouver encampments, said she's upset with the outcome.

""I would say that I'm disappointed in the lack of humanity in this decision,"" she said Wednesday.

Brett said she would have preferred the board defer the motion to allow for more discussion its impact on the homeless.

She compared the encampments in Vancouver with the plight of refugees in foreign countries.

""If we can send that refugee money overseas, we need to create Canadian refugee-style camps,"" Brett said. ""I'm tired of the government saying we need to work on housing first when there's nothing that comes second. There's no wraparound support services, there's no detox or treatment.""

By refugee-style, Brett said she means a camp which has formal access to toilets, running water and social services.

Shane Simpson, the minister of social development and poverty reduction, said the government is looking at an array of options to address the camp sites.

He said he questions whether a refugee-style camp would meet the approval of current campers.

""One of the things about a camp like that, if you chose to do that, is that it would be pretty heavily managed. It would need to be,"" he said. ""In terms of the campers, I'm not certain about how well it would be received by the people who are camping there.""

Simpson added that he expects the number of tents at Strathcona Park to grow and he doesn't know how the bylaw will be practically enforced.

""I'm not sure that anybody quite understands what the impact of this bylaw will be,"" he said.

The city had been dealing with a long-running tent city in the Downtown Eastside at Oppenheimer Park when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.

Officials were able to place the majority of those residents in housing, but two more tent cities popped up in the wake of its shutdown.

The first, on property owned by the Port of Vancouver near CRAB Park, was dismantled after the B.C. Supreme Court granted an injunction in early June over health and safety concerns.

The encampment at Strathcona Park has swelled to about 200 tents.

Dave Demers, a commissioner who voted for the motion, said the board was left in an untenable situation.

The current bylaw restricting sleeping in parks was unconstitutional and officials needed to come up with a solution, he said.

""It's a pretty dire situation that is not new,"" Demers said. ""I think people fail to understand or grasp the gravity of the situation.""

The provincial government needs to sit down with local officials to help plot a way forward and ensure there are more services offered for the homeless population, he added.

28,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/home-sales-continue-to-rebound-in-june-after-pandemic-freeze-earlier-in-year-1.24170491,Home sales continue to rebound in June after pandemic freeze earlier in year,[],,"OTTAWA — Real estate agents across the country saw home sales in June nearing or even beating pre-pandemic levels.

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

“This project is a good news story in my mind. It’s an opportunity for West Vancouver to not only meet its immediate needs but also to lead in the region,” said Mayor Mary-Ann Booth, casting her vote in favour at the July 14 meeting. “We actually are the most expensive city in North America. We actually have a higher price-to-income ratio than Manhattan. When we talk about affordability, this is ground zero.”

Using the money from the sale of the former West Vancouver police station on Marine Drive to Grosvenor, council purchased the Gordon Avenue land from Vancouver Coastal Health in 2014 for $16.4 million. After two and a half years of study and consultations, they narrowed down their options for the site to include a mix of 50 strata condos in an eight-storey tower at the southern portion of the land and 167 below-market rentals and seniors day facility in two six-storey buildings on the northern portion.

The below-market rentals will be offered at an average of 70 per cent of market rates, which should put them in reach of households earning $50,000 to $120,000 per year. Working age people 25 to 44 make up only 16 per cent of West Van’s population compared to the 28 per cent Metro Vancouver average, staff noted.

With the rezoning in place, the district may now start a procurement process looking for developers partnered with non-profits who will either buy or lease the land on a long-term basis and build the housing, which district staff estimate will provide a $26-million return to the municipal coffers.

The vote followed a lengthy public hearing in which supporters outnumbered opponents about 7:1, although significantly more people wrote to council urging them to vote down the project.

Those who opposed the project questioned the wisdom of providing below-market rentals for households that make more than $100,000 per year when the municipality could sell the land outright for the benefit of existing residents.

Resident Duncan Pearce argued the best way to get the lower rents council desires is to let the private sector increase supply to meet demand.

“The issue can be resolved by council at very little cost with widespread density bonuses applied to privately owned sites that are developed as rental,” he said. “With the Gordon Avenue project … council is engaging in a very substantial social experiment that, with respect, hasn’t been carefully thought through.”

Most, however, argued the project would be an important first step in making the municipality more hospitable for working families and less reliant on commuters.

Jonathan Lloyd, rector of St. Stephens Anglican Church, said he has been astonished by the number of health-care workers he’s met while serving as chaplain at Lions Gate Hospital who drive long distances because they can’t afford to live on the North Shore. He urged council to approve the rezoning or risk “becoming an island for seniors.”

“It is imaginative, transformational and it will build our community. If there are two things the COVID-19 pandemic has taught me, it's that dollars do not make our world go round but rather community does.”

Michael Markwick told council he raised his five children just a block away, but today, none of them could afford to live in the city they grew up in.

“If we do not have families in West Vancouver, then we cannot have a West Vancouver. It seems to me that is the measure of the highest and best use of this land,” he said.

The majority on council agreed. Couns. Bill Soprovich, Craig Cameron, Nora Gambioli and Marcus Wong joined Booth in voting in favour.

“It's a difficult decision. I have to weigh: do we sell the land for an immediate benefit? Or do we invest in it, as it were, for the next generation and generation after that?” Wong said. “Surely the soul of humanity is faithful service to the unwritten commandment that says: we shall give our children better than we ourselves received.”

While everyone on council agreed to changing the official community plan to allow development on the site, Couns. Peter Lambur and Sharon Thompson both voted against the rezoning because they felt it was too restrictive, either because the municipality would be leaving money on the table or because it targeted the wrong group for affordable housing.

“I get the sense that a lot of the people that are in support of affordable housing on this site, or whatever passes for affordable housing, don't appreciate what the opportunity cost is to achieve that,” Lambur said. “And I'm still concerned that the breadth of affordability that we're contemplating right now … is too narrow and leaves a lot of the more vulnerable people in our community that we think we would like to serve and help on the sidelines.”",[]

In a statement, Banks said she’s a fan of the contest's approach of ""fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances ... it’s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk.""

Banks lauded Bergeron, host of the show since its 2005 debut, as having set ""a powerful stage"" and said she’s excited to continue the legacy.

Co-host Erin Andrews also is leaving the series, which is getting a ""creative refresh"" while honouring America’s affection for it, ABC said. Andrews was not expected to be replaced.

When the show will get to unveil its new approach in season No. 29 remains clouded by the pandemic-caused production halt affecting the return of most TV series.

The announcement that Banks is joining the show followed word Monday of Bergeron and Andrews’ exits. In a Twitter post, Bergeron called working on ""Dancing With the Stars"" an ""incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career.""

Last year, Bergeron drew attention when he expressed concern over the show’s decision to include former White House press secretary Sean Spicer among the contestants for last fall's season.

Bergeron tweeted then that he had suggested to producers the new season be a ""joyful respite from our exhausting political climate"" and urged them to avoid ""divisive bookings.""

ABC thanked the departing Bergeron for his ""trademark wit and charm"" that helped the show succeed and Andrews for her sense of humour.

It was the day after families had been summoned to a meeting and assured their loved ones would be isolated in their rooms and looked after.

article continues below

Mikhail’s first concern had been whether there was enough staff to help feed residents in their rooms. Families were reassured that extra staff would be coming in.

Mikhail and her partner Althea Gibb-Carsley got Isabelle settled in her room that day and fed her dinner. Then they went home.

They returned to check on Mikhail’s mom about 24 hours later.

The scene that greeted them was shocking.

Isabelle was in the same position as when they’d left her. Her unchanged diaper was bulging. “She was cold, shivering and she was disoriented,” said Gibb-Carsley. Untouched breakfast and lunch trays were piled up.

Mikhail says her mom never truly recovered from that.

“She was frail. She had just turned 94,” said Mikhail. “And so we knew that she probably would not be able to recover from COVID. And people were dying every day.”

On March 18, Isabelle Mikhail became the eighth resident of Lynn Valley Care Centre – and in Canada – to die of COVID-19.

In early March, the Lynn Valley Care Centre was the first care home in the country to become an epicentre of the virus. Before the outbreak was declared over two months later, 53 elderly residents and 26 staff contracted the virus and 20 residents died.

Over 129 deaths – or 69 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths – since the beginning of the pandemic in B.C. have been among people over 80 years old, according to B.C.’s Centre for Disease Control. Deaths in care homes have made up 72 per cent of the total.

A group of daughters whose parents all contracted COVID-19 in the Lynn Valley Care Centre outbreak are now speaking up, describing their experiences in a care home system that was ill-prepared to handle the added stresses of the virus in an environment of chronic understaffing.

The women said in light of the deficiencies that COVID-19 revealed in the long-term care system, both provincial and federal governments need to take a serious look at the way long-term care is funded and supported. So does the public, they say.

On March 7, families had arrived to the meeting to find medical health officers from Vancouver Coastal Health along with the director of care for the Lynn Valley Care Centre present. A number of care centre staff were also there, lined up against a wall. They looked frightened, said the women.

Kelly Shellard, whose 82-year-old father Bill Shellard has dementia and lives in the care centre, went to the meeting. Afterwards she went back to her Lynn Valley home and stewed. She stayed home for a few hours, then decided she had to go back to the care home to check on her dad.

There were no extra staff, as promised. In fact, many of the staff who were scheduled to work that day hadn’t shown up for their shifts.

“That was the first day that we ended up having to hand out food to the residents because there were so few people that showed up to work,” said Shellard.

“We realized on Sunday that the help was not there,” said Gibb-Carsley. “And there was not much time to think about whether we would or would not participate, because we were thrust into this situation.”

Family members said rather than extra cleaning they might have expected, there was little evidence of even regular cleaning for the first week of the outbreak. “So instead of enhanced cleaning it was reduced cleaning. Because the [cleaning staff] didn’t come in,” said Gibb-Carsley.

Shellard said she went to one man’s room to help “and he had peed all over the floor. And it was there the next day because there was no cleaning. It wasn’t until a week later that they actually brought in a cleaning company to come every night and fully clean the place.”

Debra Drew, whose 96-year-old dad Graham Drew lives in the care centre, said some staff who turned up were clearly uncomfortable being in the care home at the time of the outbreak. “Others couldn’t leave after their shifts because there was nobody to replace them. … People were working 16-hour shifts.”

“All the while we’re hearing [Health Minister] Adrian Dix say everything’s been taken care of,” said Drew. “For us, what we were seeing did not jive with the official report.”

In response to issues raised by the families, both Vancouver Coastal Health and Lynn Valley Care Centre issued statements.

“Like other care facilities, the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged our facility, spreading at an alarming rate, which added to our challenges of getting ahead of the outbreak,” according to the statement from the care centre. “Professional replacement staff was brought in as soon as possible, following a short time when we had some staff shortages.”

According to Vancouver Coastal Health, in the early days of the outbreak, the Lynn Valley Care Centre “experienced staffing shortages because some staff were sick, and others, afraid of becoming infected, did not come to work.”

A rapid response team to deal with infection control was put in place and “extraordinary measures were put in place to restore and maintain staffing levels,” according to the statement.

Putting their parents in care had not been easy for any of the families.

Shellard and her son lived with her dad for almost four years until Bill’s health deteriorated and his dementia worsened. When her dad was found wandering down the street in the middle of the night, Shellard said it was clear she could no longer manage his care.

Mikhail’s mom had moved out from Alberta 15 years ago and bought a condo close to her. She had 10 good years before being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. “She wasn’t managing her medications very well. So I had to take that over,” said Mikhail. Medical staff eventually suggested Isabelle needed to move into care.

But at the care home, staff were often stretched, especially during the night shift.

“Dad would fall and nobody would find him,” said Deanna Harlow, Debra Drew’s sister. Often they didn’t know how long it took until somebody noticed.

“He couldn’t get up himself and he doesn’t know to push the call button or maybe the call button was too far away.”

Staff never had enough time – to help with brushing teeth or even simple tasks like turning on a TV.

Gibb-Carsley said she saw care aides wheel residents from one room to the next without even telling them what was happening.

“You don’t just move someone,” she said. “But you do if you’re in a hurry.”

Baths or showers for residents were infrequent and minimal, say the women. Shellard said her dad went three months without a shower.

There was little time for conversation.

“We are not saying that these are bad people. They are people who try really hard to do their best,” said Shellard. “It’s a really hard job.”

It’s an impossible job when there aren’t enough people to do it, she said.

When COVID-19 hit the care centre in March the same caregivers – already stretched to their limits – had to deal with residents who were now sick and dying in some cases. “There’s another skill set that needs to come into play but it just wasn’t there,” said Mikhail.

The women acknowledge not all families with parents at the care home had the same experience. Some only wanted information from official sources. Some seemed angry and uncomfortable at the questions they raised.

“My own thinking is that if you have a loved one in there ... you have to do certain things psychologically, to make peace with that,” said Gibb-Carsley. “And one of those things is minimizing the difficult information.”

“A lot of people don’t want to know the truth about elder care in this country,” she said. “It’s a very difficult truth. It’s very inconvenient. And that plays a role in what we have done for years in this country with regards to elder care.”

Gibb-Carsley said in her opinion, while the long-term care residents who died of COVID-19 were medically vulnerable, they were made more so “by the level of care that’s inadequate” in care homes.

“When my mom was dying, there was one [licensed practical nurse] on for 92 patients, running up and down the stairs because ... the elevator wasn’t operational,” said Mikhail.

Although Isabelle was supposed to have a minced diet, at the end of her life “often sandwiches would show up or things that she was not able to chew or swallow,” said Mikhail.

“They were getting lunches in a bag and muffins in plastic wrap that 90 per cent of the people there couldn’t open.”

Mikhail and Gibb-Carsley cared for Isabelle for 10 days until she died.

She didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms until the very end, they said, when they would frequently have to seek out nurses for pain medication.

“Had we not been there she would have died really struggling,” said Gibb-Carsley.

The parents of all the women who spoke to the North Shore News for this story contracted COVID-19 at the care centre. All except Isabelle survived.

At various points when their parents were not expected to survive, family members were allowed in to the care centre to see them.

Kathie Lloyd said in the case of her 82-year-old mom Donna, she’s convinced family help probably made the difference to her mom’s survival.

One of the concerns about the recent lockdown on family visits to care centres is that it has meant there have been no independent observers in the nursing homes, say the women.

“There are no neutral parties that are checking to make sure how things are going,” said Gibb-Carsley.

Several weeks after her mom died, Mikhail was told she could come and get Isabelle’s possessions. Staff came down with a trolley with some of her mother’s things, she said, but many items were missing, including family photos that had been on a bulletin board in her room and all her mother’s clothes.

A caregiver told her she had thrown Isabelle’s clothes in the trash.

Mikhail later received an apology letter. “It felt pretty flat,” she said.

The women say their experience with COVID-19 revealed fault lines in the care of the elderly that need to be addressed.

“It’s not going to go away,” said Drew, who adds she questions why for-profit care homes are allowed and is aghast that B.C. Premier John Horgan doesn’t see the need for a public inquiry.

Harlow said she wants to see elder care added to the Canada Health Act to ensure national standards. She’d also like to see an examination of care for the elderly in other parts of the world.

Not all nursing homes are the same, said Gibb-Carsley, “but the problem is the standards and the expectations across the board are very low.” The system tolerates that, she said, “because there aren’t enough resources to go around.”

Drew hopes what the pandemic revealed about elder care will be a catalyst for change. “It’s such a fragile system. And so how do we fix it?”

RCMP said in a release that around 6 a.m. on July 11 a dog alerted two teens to an object on the beach below the 800 block of Bayview Road.

The teens went to a nearby home for help, and the homeowner contacted RCMP.

According to police, the remains were in “an advanced state of decomposition.”

The BC Coroners Service said the remains were partial, which is likely the result of being in the water for some time, which leads to disarticulation – something the Coroners Service said they’ve seen with body parts found on shorelines in the past.

“This has happened in past investigations with feet we found on shorelines across the province in the past decade and a half,” Andy Watson of the Coroners Service told Coast Reporter.

RCMP said they will be looking into outstanding missing person files as they work with the Coroners Service to attempt to identity the remains and Watson said a forensic identification specialist is being brought in to perform DNA testing on the remains.

He said the investigation is still in the early stages so there’s little other information they can release.

RCMP also said on Monday that a social media post from author and artist Douglas Coupland on July 10, the day before the grisly discovery, showing what appeared to be part of a human leg on a beach and tagged “Roberts Creek,” was an unfortunate coincidence.

Police contacted Coupland at his home in the Lower Mainland and confirmed that the photo was of a prop Coupland had used for an earlier project.",[]

In a letter, the Canadian Mental Health Association’s North Shore executive director Julia Kaisla asks mayors Linda Buchanan, Mike Little and Mary-Ann Booth to be accountable.

article continues below

“The North Shore has been experiencing a growing housing crisis for 10 years. Despite task forces and committees to discuss actions, little has happened to provide the kind of housing we need,” she wrote. “The housing we lack more than any other: supported, low barrier, harm reduction-based housing.”

Kaisla said she was inspired to write the letter after seeing drastic measures taken by government in response to COVID-19, while non-profits and social service agencies have been left to deal with the pandemic and a worsening overdose crisis on their own.

“We got to a point where a lot of people are going to die,” Kaisla said.

While most North Shore residents have been able to stay comfortably home, people experiencing homelessness have been forced to stay in “overcrowded, decrepit, infested rooming houses, encampments, and in a temporary shelter filled to capacity.”

“Somehow, this combination of terrible has become the low-barrier housing solution in our community. It is not good enough,” Kaisla wrote. “What is most unsettling and harmful is our complacency with their death and poverty, and the privilege of the status quo that many are so desperate to maintain.”

The letter is co-signed by Paul Harmon, manager of the Lookout Housing and Health Society’s North Shore Housing Centre, and by Sandra Edelman, chair of the North Shore Homelessness Task Force.

There is provincial funding on the table right now, Kaisla said, but she hasn’t seen any of the North Shore’s local governments attempt to meet them halfway. The sticking points, she feels, are NIMBYism and unwillingness to put up municipally owned land.

“We have three municipalities that don’t want to be the only one giving up land or taking unpopular actions in some people’s eyes. It’s a lot of passing the buck,” she said.

Kaisla acknowledged the challenge of getting a neighbourhood to accept low-barrier housing but, she argued, the people in need of a home are already here.

“We’re asking for a compassionate response,” she said. “It is going to create safety for the whole community.”

City of North Vancouver Mayor Linda Buchanan said she understands Kaisla’s frustration because she feels it too.

“I feel extremely saddened that people are living in our communities who have no other options,” she said.

Kaisla’s letter was dated a week after the City of North Vancouver council adopted a motion from Buchanan calling for the creation of a new North Shore cross-jurisdictional working group to find short, medium- and long-term actions to prevent homelessness and offer people a way out of it.

“We are certainly motivated and dedicated and had taken action prior to receiving [the letter] and the three mayors including myself and my council are committed to doing that,” Buchanan said. “I don’t want a lot of time spent on researching this and that. This is very action oriented. We need to be moving forward. We need to be finding a site. We need to be co-ordinating that with health services,” Buchanan said.

Still, that will take some effort, so city council voted July 13 to reallocate $228,000 from other projects to temporarily hire someone to oversee the work. Buchanan said all levels of government need to be at the table and choosing which land “makes the most sense.” The province has been buying land and older hotels to provide housing elsewhere in the Lower Mainland, Buchanan said, and it’s time they did that on the North Shore too, she added.

West Vancouver council voted to join the working group on July 6.

“Really, this is going to force us to do some things that we should have done a long time ago,” said West Vancouver Mayor Mary-Ann Booth.

But, Booth added, solving homelessness is more complicated than finding available land in the short term, as the same people will also likely need wraparound health services that the province can’t download onto municipalities.

“We’ve got a big problem and it’s not just up to the municipalities to solve it. In fact, it’s not even our jurisdiction,” she said. “We don’t have that much land and we don’t have that much money, and so our position is that we’re willing to be part of the solution, but we don’t have the resources to be the solution.”

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

RCMP Sgt. Murray McNeil says it's lucky no one was killed considering the extensive damage to each vehicle and the length the semi travelled before coming to a stop.

The survey of 1,401 member businesses from groups including the BC Chamber of Commerce, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade and Business Council of B.C. indicates owners want a bold, long-term recovery plan.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

Bridgitte Anderson, president and CEO of the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, says business viability hinges on those measures.

Val Litwin with the BC Chamber of Commerce urges policy-makers to ""stay sensitive"" to the vulnerability of the business sector.

""A bold economic recovery plan that helps small businesses compete is non-negotiable for a prosperous B.C., and when small businesses thrive so do communities and people,"" Litwin said in a statement.

""Governments must keep focused on delivering their recovery plans swiftly.""

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

Mark says the province is also providing another $400,000 to support the development of more resources covering a wide range of courses and subjects in B.C.'s growing open textbook collection.

The minister says students may also now apply to StudentAid BC to be automatically considered for a free access grant announced in this year's provincial budget.

She says the grant means more than 40,000 eligible low- and middle-income students could receive up to $4,000 per year to help with costs associated with degree, diploma and certificate programs.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

Dylan Perceval-Maxwell was removed on July 8 from the race to succeed Elizabeth May as the party's leader.

The party says ""several"" recent statements by Perceval-Maxwell are inappropriate and the party's leadership contest authority decided it would not stay silent and allow him to continue his campaign.

Perceval-Maxwell appealed the decision and lost.

The Montreal environmental activist says in a Facebook post shared Wednesday that he is apologetic for saying in a June 23 debate that police should be forced to pay $20 to every person of colour they stop, as compensation for the trauma and an incentive for police to think twice before stopping someone.

Montreal lawyer Meryam Haddad, who is also running for the leadership, told Perceval-Maxwell during the debate that the comment was ""super racist.""

Perceval-Maxwell said in his Facebook statement that putting the dollar figure out there was a mistake but also shared the Oxford dictionary definition of racism to defend himself.

""According to this definition, my idea was not 'racist' as was claimed during that debate,"" he said. The idea is not prejudiced or antagonistic against members of minority groups, he said.

He said he agrees that he should not have included a specific dollar figure on compensation, and said he has apologized many times for the comment. He also said that attacking people who are not ""actively"" engaged in oppression is how genocides happen.

Perceval-Maxwell added that his ""dear Jewish mother"" survived the Holocaust by hiding in a garbage can in Hungary and that he firmly believes ""standing up for the rights of all regardless of race and class is the thing we have to do.""

In its written statement, the Green party said it expects ""those who are called out for making discriminatory statements will reflect, learn and commit to doing better.""

""The party respects every individual’s right of free speech but we will not provide a platform to normalize racism and discrimination,"" the statement says. ""We are committed to creating a forum where contestants can debate the solutions that Canada needs to survive and thrive in the 21st century.""

Haddad told The Canadian Press she knows the party got many complaints about the comments and that she is happy to see the party take quick and decisive action.

""It shows that our organization will just not tolerate someone who makes racist comments,"" she said.

Haddad also said Perceval-Maxwell's attempts to apologize are not thorough enough.

""When people that live racism tell him that it's a racist comment, like he should apologize and he never apologized properly,"" she said. ""He apologized for me to feel that way.""

Perceval-Maxwell acknowledged many people do not think his apologies are full and sincere. He said he is relieved to not be in the race any more because he can now get more sleep and exercise.

There remain nine people in the contest to find a permanent successor for Elizabeth May. The race will be decided by online and mail-in ballots this fall. The winner is to be announced the first weekend of October.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that had been set to expire July 21.

The extension comes with COVID-19 resurgent across the U.S. — cases are on the rise in all 50 states, and southern states like Florida, Arizona and California are facing a fresh crisis with overcrowded hospital wards, refrigerated truck trailers serving as makeshift morgues and another shortage of personal protective medical gear.

The escalating emergency has also exposed a deep divide between Canadians dead-set against reopening the border and U.S. lawmakers in northern border states who continue to press both countries for a blueprint for doing exactly that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the extent of the pandemic in the U.S. a ""constantly evolving"" situation, but won't say whether officials have considered extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The managing director of Cirque's largest creditor, Catalyst Capital Group, says the co-operation from creditors has been extraordinary to achieve the goal of recapitalizing the acrobatic company.

The lenders, who hold Cirque's about $1 billion of secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

The new offer would supersede the US$420-million bid by current shareholders — the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec — that was presented June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

article continues below

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

Barrick is to report its second quarter financial results on Aug. 10.

The Toronto-based company says it has reassigned about 220 of the complex's 475 workers elsewhere within its Canadian organization since the suspension began in April.

However, Kirkland Lake Gold says it now believes that the best course of action is to provide severance packages for the remaining employees who can't be reassigned.

The mining and milling complex near Matheson, Ont., was designated as non-core to Kirkland Lake Gold's business in mid-February.

That was followed by a suspension of operations as of April 2 under protocols that Kirkland Lake Gold put into effect to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Holt, Taylor and Holloway mines and Holt mill accounted for nearly 12 per cent of the 975,000 ounces produced last year by Kirkland Lake Gold, according to its website.

Kirkland's other properties include the Macassa mine and the Detour Lake mine in northern Ontario and the Fosterville mine in Australia.

His wife Nancy Smith recalls him, well into his 70s, breaking right through the floor of a rotted out deck while carrying a 50-pound planter, falling more than eight feet to the bushes and bramble below.

article continues below

He picked himself up, fought his way out from the deck’s underbelly and around to the front of the house where he located his wife. He was covered in dirt and blood and branches and scratches.

“Nancy, I’ve had a bit of a tumble,” he announced. He was still carrying the planter.

“He was really a strong guy, and just had boundless energy,” says Nancy. How did he bounce right up, at that age, after a fall like that? There was a phrase that Mike, a well-known coach and teacher on the North Shore, used for such occasions: “tuck and roll.”

His daughter Megan Frederick laughs as she remembers the famous phrase.

“We’d have a fondue dinner and the fondue would catch fire and he’d just pick it up, flames coming up his arms, and he’d just say ‘tuck and roll!’”

Mike almost never got sick or injured, and when he did he would never take medication.

“He would just ‘hunker down,’” says Nancy. “And his response, if you were worried, was he’d say ‘I’m alright. I’m alright, I’m alright, I’m alright.’”

Walk it off. Tuck and roll. Hunker down. Those guiding principles powered Mike through 90 years of a remarkable life in which he followed passions ranging from rugby to musical theatre to lifeguarding to sign language, all the while providing a strong support system for thousands of students and athletes across the North Shore.

He stuck to his strengths, even when a global pandemic hit.

It seems a little odd to say that someone who died when they were 90 years old is “gone too soon,” but that’s exactly how Mike Smith’s family feels. So strong, so supportive, so resilient all his life, even into his 90s. And then came COVID-19, and the way his family tells it, he hit this challenge the way he tackled every other one in his life. This, however, was finally an affliction that wouldn't allow him to just walk it off.

A passion for coaching

It’s tough to find true Vancouverites – it seems almost everyone around here came from somewhere else – but you can’t get any more true blue Vancouver than Mike Smith. Born in Vancouver in 1930, he grew up swimming and playing football and rugby for Kitsilano High and then the University of British Columbia. At age 14 he worked in a logging camp on Vancouver Island, while other summer jobs included driving a taxi around Vancouver and working on a whaling ship off the coasts of Japan and Russia.

Safer summer employment came from his swimming expertise, as Mike worked as a lifeguard at Ambleside Pool and at beaches across Vancouver. It was while lifeguarding at Spanish Banks that he met Marlene Wright and it was “love at first sight.” They married and had three kids: sons David and Paddy and daughter Megan. Mike and Marlene were married 35 years, until Marlene’s death in 1991. In 1994 Mike married Nancy (Herman) Parker, and they lived together in West Vancouver for 25 years.

Mike’s teaching career began at Vancouver’s Jericho Hill School for the Deaf where he learned sign language as well as lip reading, a skill he claimed helped him as a coach later in life. He moved over to West Vancouver’s Ecole Pauline Johnson in 1956, the start of a North Shore teaching career that included a long stint at Hillside Secondary, where he became vice-principal, and later at West Van Secondary where he taught until retirement. A common thread through it all was his passion for coaching.

Mike kept mementos from old teams, books in his basement full of rosters and plays and practice plans. On a recent sunny summer afternoon Nancy and Megan sat flipping through the pages of an album filled with team photos. There’s the Jericho Hill basketball team, 1952. In that photo Mike looks like a strapping young student himself. There’s Pauline Johnson gymnastics, 1956. There’s the first ever Hillside rugby team, 1957-'58. There’s the year Hillside junior rugby won the prestigious Province Cup, 1961. The pics go on for decades. There’s Hillside senior basketball, 1981, with Mike sporting a natty cardigan.

At West Van Secondary he helped form the school’s first-ever girls rugby team. Long after retiring as a teacher he stuck around the field, helping coach wherever he was needed.

In 2001, Mike became the first ever coach recognized for 50 years of service by the North Shore Secondary Schools Athletics Association. He was there when the NSSSAA was formed in 1958, acting as the association’s first secretary-treasurer while his friend and Hillside co-coach Gary Sinclair served as the first president, a role Mike later filled as well.

He was head of grounds and equipment for the annual North Shore track and field meet, which used to be held on the cinder track at Empire Stadium where all the lanes had to be lined out with whiting. Mike was always there, always ready.

Bill McKitrick, who coached and taught alongside Mike for decades, was just 23 when he first met him. He was assigned to Hillside as a student teacher, and the first face he saw when he walked through the door was Mike Smith.

“Mike was in the foyer, so I introduced myself to him and he said ‘I think I’m going to be your sponsor teacher,” McKitrick recalls. “He sort of took me under his wing right away. That was quite reassuring.”

McKitrick remembers Mike as a man of incredible youthful energy. He was surprised one day to hear Mike grumbling about “getting too old” to take another swim test to renew his lifeguarding certification.

“I said ‘what do you mean? How old are you?’ He told me he was 43. Well, I thought he was 30.”

Mike never lost that vigorous enthusiasm for coaching, and hundreds of young athletes were enriched by that, says McKitrick.

“He was a real straight shooter, looking out for the best interest of the students and the school always,” he says. “The teams that he coached were always strong teams, and I don’t mean like they were super athletes or anything like that. They were well coached, the students respected their opposition. He was not one to pat himself on the back or build himself up or blow his own horn. … It was all about the team and representing the school well. I think the kids learned a lot from that.”

His standard attire, which he often wore even while acting as vice-principal, was pure sporty goodness: running shorts, whistle, clipboard in hand and pencil behind the ear.

“He was very good as a coach – I learned a lot from him,” says McKitrick. “He was very much a team member, and he expected that basically from everyone that was in the athletic department. And it was a great athletic department – everyone just got along really well. … I just watched how he dealt with the department, how he dealt with colleagues, how he dealt with students. It was not necessarily out of a textbook – just things you learn as a young teacher, a young coach, and you try to model that.”

Musicals and marathons

There was much more to Mike than just coaching though. He sang in all the school musicals and was a lifetime subscriber to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. A childhood stamp collection inspired him to become a geography teacher. He was the catcher on the school slo-pitch team and later took up marathon running, breaking off on epic training runs with his little terrier Sadie, who often tuckered out and would be scooped up and carried much of the way home.

He was 64 when he married Nancy.

“I knew him mainly as a history and geography teacher, a music lover and a constant reader,” she says. “He was a great travelling companion because he was interested in everything and he had so much energy.”

He and Nancy tended their fabulous backyard garden well into his 80s, and just last fall, though he was suffering from Lewy body dementia, which can affect a person's thinking, movement, behaviour and mood, he was still singing with the Londoners, a multi-generational choir that often would entertain seniors in care homes.

A fall put him into Lions Gate Hospital earlier this year while the pandemic was still a frightening mystery that was far from figured out. He caught COVID-19 there, on the hospital’s fourth floor.

“Mike, oh my God, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” says Nancy. There’s still anger, confusion, sadness in her voice as she describes what happened to her husband. After he was diagnosed, he was moved to a care home and then bounced right back to Lions Gate a few days later. Through it all, the family was banned from physically visiting him due to COVID-19 restrictions. Megan’s last contact with her dad was as he was being loaded into an ambulance for his final trip to the hospital.

“I called out to him, and he stopped and looked for [me]. I was keeping my distance, so I said ‘I'm over here, dad.’ And then I go, ‘can you hear me?’ And he nods.”

The family says he was not admitted into the intensive care unit when he was taken back to the hospital, instead quickly sent to palliative care. They fought for more urgent care for him, but to no avail. Mike was deemed to be unresponsive. Looking back now, Megan and Nancy say they know what Mike was trying to do as COVID-19 was shutting his body down.

Walk it off.

“All of his strength and determination really worked against him, kept him silent and not taking medication and just in survival mode,” says Nancy, adding that convalescing was never Mike’s style. “He never was in bed. Never. … He wasn’t going to survive in bed with an oxygen tube in his nose.”

The restrictions of COVID-19 made everything infinitely harder for the family.

“What was so tough was dealing with all these doctors and not being able to be there in person,” says Megan.

“Everyone was in a complete panic mode,” adds Nancy. “It’s just really unfortunate that that happened to him.”

Mike died April 2, 2020. Ninety years of extraordinary life, ended by COVID-19.

“It was very sad that it was the virus that took him,” says Megan. “It didn’t seem appropriate. In his life, nothing kept him down in bed.”

Mike Smith leaves behind eight grandchildren, a great-granddaughter, and countless other friends and family members. COVID-19 restrictions have also denied the family a chance to hold a proper memorial service for Mike.

The family has taken great comfort, however, from comments left on an online obituary page for Mike. The comments come from students and teaching colleagues, coaches and friends, neighbours, choir members, and even an old lifeguard from the 1950s.

“Mr. Smith was an important part of my formative years as a kid growing up in West Van,” writes a former student. “He taught me to swim at age five and instilled a sense of self-confidence that I could do what, at that time, I thought was impossible.”

There are dozens of comments [see below for more], all adding together to colour in a picture of a man who touched many lives.

The family has set up the Mike Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund through the West Vancouver Foundation. The post-secondary scholarship will go to a graduating student in the West Vancouver public school system who “demonstrates enthusiastic participation in school athletics, including good sportsmanship and service to school.”

It’s a fitting legacy for a fine man, says Nancy.

“Mike never hesitated to help other people,” she says.

“He had the time for anybody, no matter the skill,” adds Megan. “If you were willing to put the work in and be a good teammate, there was always room for you on the team.”

Mike Smith remembered

Here is a selection of comments, edited by the North Shore News, left on Mike Smith’s online obituary page:

“Not tall in stature but had a giant presence,” writes a student. “I can still see him hustling down the hall with clipboard in hand and a whistle around his neck!”

“Will miss his bright smile and twinkly blue eyes, he always cheered up a rainy day,” writes a choir mate. “He was much loved by everyone. He always threatened to sing rugby songs but was never allowed to.”

“I worked with Mike in the '50s as a lifeguard,” writes an old friend. “He had the Vancouver Sun delivered to old Locarno Bath House and heaven help ANYONE who touched it before him!”

“He was one of the nicest guys I ever met,” writes a fellow coach. “Always positive always smiling. He loved being out in the field which explains why he did it for over 50 years. Mike’s contribution to youth is enormous and he inspired us all.”

“He was my homeroom teacher in Grade 9 and I have two vivid memories of him,” another student writes. “First of all, he had such fine perfect handwriting, which didn’t seem to go with his big physique. The second was a class assignment to complete a job study, and mine became my lifelong occupation.”

“Mr. Smith was my VP in the early ‘80s,” writes another student. “He got me back on track and believed in me when I didn’t. He was a great leader and cared. Rest In Peace, sir.”",[]

Many Canadian kids grew up with some variation of bubble hockey in their basement or local arcade, a game in which plastic players attached to swivelling and sliding rods battled for the puck while gliding up and down the mini rink in fixed slots. The Hollyburn Huskies, a hockey association attached to the private Hollyburn Country Club, has taken that idea out of the arcade and onto the ice for a new version of hockey for the COVID-19 era.

For the month of July, youth players from the club are taking part in the Hollyburn Summer 3 on 3 League – Bubble Hockey Edition, with rules that mimic bubble hockey in that players must stick in their own lanes, eliminating any chance of physical contact between players. Other rules encourage quick puck movement and lots of shots on goal, resulting in a fun and fast-paced game that the players are loving, said Hollyburn hockey director Adam Hayduk.

“Our little experiment has been a huge hit with the players and it will help develop skills that maybe weren’t priorities for some in ‘normal hockey,’” he said. “It has been very interesting to watch how players adapt to new rules and begin to figure things out on their own to gain an advantage.”

Hollyburn's modified 'bubble hockey' setup features six zones drawn onto the ice with buffer areas between each zone, eliminating contact. Each player must stay in their zone and must pass or shoot within five seconds of receiving the puck. photo Hollyburn Huskies

The basics of the game are that each team has three skaters and a goalie on the ice. The rink is divided into vertical zones, three on each half of the ice, with buffer areas between each zone so there is no chance of contact. Leaving your zone results in a penalty shot for the other team. Attacking players occupy the outside two zones while a central defender and goalie play defence down the middle, basically making all attacking situations a two-on-one. To force the action, a rule is in place that requires players to pass or shoot the puck in five seconds or less.

“There are many races for the puck,” said Hayduk. “Players have used deception and look-a-ways to try to fool the defender and goalie. Transitions happen very quickly up-ice – players are forced to look up-ice for stretch passes. … There is a lot of offence and the scores have been very close. Goalies get plenty of shots.”

The association's coaches have all relished seeing the players back on the ice and enjoying the new game.

“We all felt that this would provide our players the competition and social connections they have been missing while putting players in a position to work on skills that will benefit them once hockey as we all know it is permitted to return,” said Hayduk. “I have been pleasantly surprised how much the kids enjoy the Bubble Hockey Edition of our three-on-three concept and just how competitive they have been playing it.”

Asked on a media conference call Monday whether Vancouver might get back in the picture, Colin Smith said FIFA was focused on the original three Canadian candidate cities.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers.

Ryan entered the NHL/NHLPA Players' Assistance program on Nov. 20 to get help for alcohol addiction. After going public with his story in an effort to help others with addiction issues, an emotional Ryan returned to the ice Feb. 27 and scored three times in a 5-2 win over visiting Vancouver.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

Columbus announced Thursday that it has named McMillan vice-president, soccer administration and operations.

McMillan stepped down as Toronto's senior director of administration and operations in March. So did husband Corey Wray, who was Toronto's assistant GM, team operations and strategy. Toronto did not announce the departures at the time.

The latest move reunites McMillan with Columbus president and GM Tim Bezbatchenko, who stepped down as Toronto's senior vice-president of soccer operations and GM in January 2019 to join his hometown club in Ohio.

""We are thrilled to welcome Jaime McMillan to the club,"" Bezbatchenko said in a statement. ""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

In fact, given that she’s one of the preeminent scribes of British Columbia’s history of murder, mayhem and the macabre, it makes perfect sense.

And now, the true crime writer has become a true crime podcaster herself.

article continues below

On Friday, Lazarus, a longtime North Vancouver resident, released the first episode of her new podcast, Cold Case Canada.

The podcast, which is slated for a 12-episode run in its first season and is available wherever you get your podcasts, is based off of Lazarus’s acclaimed 2015 work of non-fiction, Cold Case Vancouver, about some of the region’s most baffling unsolved murders.

Episode one of the podcast takes another look at a story that anyone who’s read her cold case book will remember well: the unsolved murder of Jennie Eldon Conroy.

Jennie was a 24-year-old born and raised North Vancouver resident who worked at the Shipyards and grain terminal during the war effort. It was 1944. Jennie had just finished her shift and had rushed home to her place in Lower Lonsdale to change before catching the bus to West Vancouver to visit her brother and family for a late Christmas dinner.

“She realized she’d missed it by one minute,” explains Lazarus.

Jennie decided to walk the seven kilometres instead. Although her murder has never been solved, the best guess is that she was picked up along the way by someone in a car – and her body was discovered the next day at the West Vancouver cemetery which, as Lazarus describes it, “is just that exit above Taylor Way, which is still pretty bleak and deserted now.”

In Lazarus’s new podcast, she recounts how North Vancouver Museum and Archives research archivist Daien Ide first brought the case of Jennie Eldon Conroy to her attention while she was first working on her book, which led to her becoming completely immersed in the case.

Of particular note, Lazarus has also re-interviewed Jennie’s niece, as well as the daughter she gave up her for adoption who now resides in New Zealand, for the podcast’s inaugural episode.

“I found Cold Case was a really tough book to write because it was unsolved murders. I found it really difficult, it’s taken me a really long time to revisit,” she says. “It’s a real obligation to me to get it right and be sensitive about it, and to get the story out. In Jennie’s case she was brutalized in the press after her murder – her family was brutalized because she was an unwed mother. Seventy-six years later, that’s still resonating with her daughter and with her children.”

Lazarus’s first foray into podcasting came last year, when she released a 12-episode series called Blood, Sweat and Fear, a show based on her similarly titled book from 2017 about forensic investigator John F.C.B. Vance, who was known internationally as Canada’s Sherlock Holmes.

“It became such a challenge, in a sense, just to take my work and put it on something completely different,” she says. “I liked writing for the ear.”

Her new podcast will feature at least five more North Shore individuals with connections to some of Vancouver’s most bizarre unsolved murders.

Lazarus has a new book, called Vancouver Exposed, set to be released this fall which is a scrapbook-style piece of non-fiction inspired by her popular blog and will feature snapshots of the city’s eccentric past – from nudist colony tales and buried houses, to belly-flop contests and more.

With her current podcast, however, she hopes to keep the dialogue going when it comes to some of these cases.

“Maybe some more information will come forward and maybe we’ll solve some of these cases. I really believe that a lot of them are still solvable,” she says.",[]

Navigating our way through COVID-19, the worst public health crisis in recent memory, would be unthinkable without the throngs of nurses, doctors, care aides and other health-care professionals leading the charge. And with many of us having spent the better part of the year holed up at home, neglecting in-person social contact and staying far enough away from the office, we’ve turned to the arts – to entertainment, to culture – as a necessary salve to get us through the long days.

As a former longtime nurse turned accomplished painter, North Vancouver resident Donna Giraud has straddled both worlds.

She started her nursing career in 2005, spending the next 14 years at busy St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver. For the first five years she was a bedside nurse, tending to the needs of patients experiencing all manner of different health crises, before becoming a head nurse in the hospital’s acute medicine ward.

“It was a lot,” she says, offering her solidarity with the nurses and other health-care workers who’ve spent months managing the pandemic right there on the front lines. “As a nurse, you’re a giver.”

But even before she started her nursing career, there were other parts of herself that Giraud felt compelled to give.

In nursing school, she would play around with the paintbrush in order to burn off some creative energy and steam after a long day.

“It turned out people were interested in what I was doing and then I started doing shows, started selling,” she says.

She was drawn to the abstract – paintings that don’t exactly say what they are, but hint at meaning by conjuring a mood, a feeling, a memory through non-linear textures, shapes and colours.

“My favourite thing about it is when somebody does say the actual emotion or the feeling or the theme that I intended on – for me to tell a story through my art that people can then interpret – I absolutely love it,” she says.

Three years ago Giraud decided to take a leap of faith and give herself over to the arts completely.

“I’d given so much of myself with the nursing for so many years,” she says.

She now co-runs an arts studio in Yaletown and her work has been featured in art shows around the world.

As fate would have it, her plans for her first official solo show in Vancouver were disrupted when everything shut down back in March due to the spread of novel coronavirus. But like any creatively-inclined person, she find away around it.

Her solo show, Lost and Found, which touched on the prescient themes of isolation and loss coupled with trying to figure things out, couldn’t be experienced in person due to quarantine restrictions – but Giraud used video footage and her website’s chat function to put on an interactive, virtual show.

Describing her work as large-scale abstract textural work, which is particularly influenced by the West Coast’s surrounding nature, Giraud has taken inspiration from our collective time in lockdown for her upcoming show.

In Together Is Always Better Giraud has drawn on the notion that COVID-19 is one thing we now all have in common. From viral images of people in Italy singing to one another from their patios to the sounds of people cheering and banging pots and pans during the nightly celebration of front-line workers, she’s sought to pay homage to this moment in history through her paintings.

“We all experienced this really horrible thing, but out of that I saw so many beautiful moments,” she says. “I just thought it was so poignant.”

Due to British Columbia’s phased reopening, hopefully small groups of people will be able to attend the show in-person this time, says Giraud, though she notes that after the accidental success of her first virtual show she’ll likely offer some kind of online component going forward as well.

“Really all I want you to do is for you to feel something when you’re in front of my work. Usually it’s feelings of hope, kindness, positivity – there’s always a positive twist.”

The show is slated for this September. Giraud will be inviting two people at a time to enter The Space gallery for the appointment-only show. Visit Giraud’s website, donnagiraudart.com, any time after Aug. 12 to sign up for a showing.",[]

The by-donation museum is limiting visitors to eight at a time and encouraging people to wear a mask, though it’s not required, according to the museum’s website.

“If the gallery is at capacity, staff will ask you to wait outside until it is safe for you to enter. Once inside, please practise physical distancing and stay two metres (six feet) apart,” the website states.

The museum’s current exhibition, Dissonance, features photographs by Iranian artist Gohar Dashti which “explore notions of home and sanctuary,” according to a press release.

Public libraries across the North Shore reopened to the public today.

When it comes to the reopening of other public programs and facilities, the District of West Vancouver has already jump-started some summer camp programs and limited outdoor health and fitness programs, according to Donna Powers, district spokeswoman.

“If all goes well in the coming weeks, the next phase will include limited reopening of facilities like the community centre, under new protocols, including reduced class sizes and operating hours,” stated Powers, in an emailed response. “West Vancouver also co-ordinates resumption of services with other municipalities. Residents are encouraged to get updates on recreation programs and facilities at westvancouverrec.ca.”",[]

Every year the BCLA invites the library community to nominate individuals and organizations across the province for awards highlighting outstanding work in libraries.

This year’s awards were announced at the association’s annual general meeting last month, according to a press release.

Referring to the program curation and community librarianship as “novel and inspirational” at North Vancouver District Public Library, which includes three branches, Taylor was given the award for fostering a welcoming environment for the community to learn new things, share ideas and discuss a multitude of topics, stated Christine Middlemass, BCLA president, in the release.

“During a time when many social issues and crises are gaining significance and, at times, becoming divisive, it is more important than ever that libraries create spaces for communities to engage with and exchange and ideas,” stated Middlemass.

The four-person team which makes up West Vancouver library’s youth department was recognized primarily for establishing a partnership with the West Vancouver school district to a create a “seamless learning environment where students can move from school to library and back again with support for their learning in either environment,” according to the release.

Of specific note was the departments Tell Your Story program, an ebook publishing program for students in grades 5-8 to create and publish their own original work in digital form.",[]

Constructed in 1906 as the Palace Hotel, the impressive three-storey brick building boasted the province’s first rooftop garden.

Along with the Hotel North Vancouver and the St. Alice Hotel, the Palace Hotel welcomed visitors and holiday-goers to North Vancouver’s booming Lower Lonsdale neighbourhood in the early 1900s.

When ferry service between Lower Lonsdale and downtown Vancouver was cancelled in 1958, the neighbourhood started to decline. Many longtime businesses were closing, and the once elegant St. Alice and Olympic hotels (as the Palace Hotel was known after 1949), became not so elegant beer parlours.

What are your memories of the Lower Lonsdale and Shipyards District in the 1970s to the 1990s?

Roughen up the surface. All like poor soil, even near sand. Sprinkle the seed sparingly on top of the bare patch of earth and water in well. Do not cover and ensure that tall weeds do not encroach on the area. Leave it all alone. Do not mow it and avoid walking on it if possible. Remember to water in dry spells and in an amazingly short period of time (four to six weeks) a substantial stand of seedlings will appear and eventually flowers.

Depending on when you sow the seeds, they may flower in summer, fall or next spring.

In any event, the bare spot will no longer be bare and you will have a cheerful display.

Many will self-seed for years to maintain your colourful patch.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

article continues below

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos. When this band sings ""We Strike Back,"" you'd best believe it, in the most literal sense.",[]
76,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/usa-today-navarro-s-anti-fauci-column-didn-t-meet-standards-1.24171362,USA Today: Navarro's anti-Fauci column didn't meet standards,['David Bauder'],,"NEW YORK — USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

USA Today did not immediately return messages seeking comment on how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro also did not immediately return a message.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. But Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

That’s the forecast for three proposed housing developments in the District of North Vancouver following a committee meeting held Monday afternoon.

Although the projects, which are still in their preliminary stages, weren’t up for a formal vote, district council members were invited to give their early input on the proposals for Capilano University, Lynn Creek and Edgemont.

Council members were most amenable to CapU’s request to build its first student housing on what is today a parking lot on the north side of the campus. The 207-room, 362-bed dormitory project doesn’t require rezoning but it will require council to grant variances for a building permit.

The school’s leadership is hoping to have it fully built by August 2022 when their current lease on older dormitory buildings at a former international school off campus on Dollarton Highway expires.

Rental rates are projected to be $800 a month for a shared room or $1,000 for a private room, and students would be required purchase a meal plan and eat in the shared cafeteria.

The only concerns raised by council were a potential shortage of bicycle parking and whether the 191 lost vehicle parking spaces would send CapU students looking for street parking in the surrounding neighbourhood.

“Obviously that area is under stress now,” said Mayor Mike Little.

Others, however, saw the loss of parking as a positive.

“I’m really pleased to see a proposal that is on a parking lot. It’s a much better use of space,” said Coun. Megan Curren.

Council also appeared largely receptive to developer Norman Laube’s proposal to redevelop five single-family homes at 1547-1599 Crown St. into a six-storey purpose-built rental building.

The proposal includes 85 rental units, nine of which would be rented at below-market rates for people earning roughly $30,000 to $85,000 per year.

“New rental of this type is obviously needed. It’s obviously part of the solution to our crisis around housing affordability and we obviously need the below-market feature of this and others like it. I’m totally supportive of rental projects of this type coming forward,” said Coun. Jim Hanson.

Coun. Mathew Bond noted that only about three per cent of the district’s housing stock is purpose-built rental.

“And the overwhelming majority of those existing purpose-built rentals are old,” he said.

The only debate by council was whether the 0.75 parking stalls per unit was too much or not enough.

A proposed heritage revitalization project at 3700-3718 Edgemont Blvd., however, will face a much more difficult prospect of being passed by council if the comments at Monday’s committee meeting are any indication.

The proposal would see a 1951 fourplex designed by local architect and early West Coast Modern master Fred Hollingsworth restored and given heritage protection while the remainder of the property is built up with either 25 duplex units or 33 row houses.

The proposal has the backing of heritage advocates but most members of council expressed reservations about so many new units being added outside a town centre.

“This just seems, with a 25-unit increase, that it’s a larger increase in density than I was contemplating for the site,” said Little.

Hanson said he too had that same impression, but he added if council intends to follow through on its strategic plan to save heritage buildings from demolition, they would have to entertain projects like the one before them.

District staff and the proponents will use council’s input to further refine the proposals.

The boy was mountain biking on the Bobsled mountain bike trail, a run with some advanced features, when he lost control and crashed.

The boy was knocked unconscious for a short period of time, when a parent who was with the boy and other mountain bikers arrived on the scene.

David Dales, assistant chief of operations for District of North Vancouver Fire and Rescue, said firefighters got the call around 3:30 p.m. and raced to the scene with a vacuum splint that six firefighters used to immobilize the boy and carry him off the mountain.

“They basically ran up the trail,” he said.

Dales had no further information about the boy’s condition but firefighters treated it as a case of possible spinal injuries.

“We really try to treat these as a traumatic medical call.”

Dales cautioned the public to be careful, warning that local trails have been very busy lately.

The mountain bike rescue was the second trail rescue of the day for North Vancouver firefighters. Earlier Sunday, firefighters helped a woman in her 50s who had fallen and injured her shoulder on the Homestead Trail while hiking. She was able to walk out on her own with assistance, said Dales.",[]

A number of ICBC employees who were in close contact with the person testing positive have been notified by the health authority and have been sent home to self-isolate, said Wilkins.

Office areas at ICBC are undergoing a deep clean, said Wilkins, in addition to the regular cleaning, physical distancing, meeting and washroom occupancy limits already in place at head office.

Wilkins added there was no risk to customers as the employee only works at ICBC’s head office, which has been closed to the public since March 17.

According to the recent statistics from B.C.’s Centre for Disease Control, cases of COVID-19 remain low on the North Shore, with 261 cases reported in the North Shore Coast Garibaldi health region between Jan. 1 and July 9. That number is actually down from the 263 cases reported June 21. Recently health officials subtracted 51 cases of COVID-19 that had been detected in B.C. in people who normally live in other countries, including 42 in the Vancouver Coastal Health area, which includes the North Shore. About half of those 51 people were temporary foreign workers who had been quarantined in hotels upon entering the country.",[]

Referred to as a puma, cougar, and a mountain lion, these wild cats cause a scare wherever they are found. Not only do they stealthily stalk their prey through dark woods, but they are also incredibly powerful. In fact, one of these sleek felines can leap a jaw-dropping 40 feet in a single bound.

article continues below

With this in mind, the sand-coloured cats are relatively reclusive, and they tend to avoid human contact. Attacks on humans are rare, but they can be fatal. However, there are a number of thingsyou can do in an encounter to stay safe.

How do they hunt?

Wildsafe B.C. notes that mountain lions will, ""stalk an animal and then use an explosive series of bounds to leap on their prey.""

A large male puma can weigh over 100 kg, but most adults are in the 60-80 kg range; females are about 25 per cent smaller. They have a flexible spine that allows them to easily maneuver around obstacles, and they have keen eyesight.

According to the University of Victoria, roughly 4000 of the solitary creatures live in Canada. Of that number, a whopping 3500 call B.C. home. Astonishingly, a quarter of the B.C. population live on Vancouver Island, yet the Island only represents 3% of the total land mass in the province. As such, the Island has the highest concentration of cougars anywhere in the world.

The cougars of the island are primarily found in forested mountain areas, but there is a higher density in the northern half of the Island. UVIC states that the population hovers around the 600-800 range, but population estimates are difficult because the animals are solitary. In addition, the university reports that the animals, ""tend to remain on the eastern side of the island, where there is less climatic variation, and a higher density of black-tailed deer.""

When mountain lions are hungry, however, they will search for alternative sources of food. Unfortunately, this often means that the big cats will prey on house pets and livestock, and are subsequently killed. Nevertheless, the Island puma population is considered healthy, and their primary prey, the black-tailed deer, is plentiful. UVIC adds that pumas, similar to wolves, also serve as an important control for, ""lower trophic levels, starting with the deer.""

On June 27, MacDonald and his two kids, ages three and seven, hopped into their 1990 Toyota TownAce, a 4x4 diesel camper van they’d taken to calling “Space Van” because of its futuristic appearance.

“I call it a Westfalia on steroids,” says MacDonald. “They’re kind of a head-turner. There’s only like three of them in Canada.”

The plan was to take their camper van from their home in North Vancouver for a rip through Stanley Park. But as MacDonald turned onto Highway 1 from Lynn Valley Road, around 11:30 a.m. on June 27, something happened.

“We were accelerating up the onramp and all of a sudden the engine starting revving incredibly high. It was redlining, and I immediately took my foot off the accelerator and it just kept revving all by itself,” he says.

He pulled over to the side of the road and killed the engine, but that didn’t do anything – the car was off but the engine kept running.

Besides the horrendous sound the engine was making, black smoke was shooting from the exhaust and, most critically, plumes of white smoke started to quickly envelop the cabin of the van – where MacDonald’s two young kids were nestled in the back seat.

He jumped into action, getting his kids out of the car, throwing them over his shoulder and getting to a safe distance.

A passerby called 911 and firefighters were summoned to the scene. They assessed the situation and determined the vehicle wasn’t an imminent fire risk, though the vehicle is still being examined by a mechanic who’ll let MacDonald know if the rare vehicle can be saved or not.

The family had hoped to take the beloved camper van on their planned vacation to the Sunshine Coast this weekend. Instead, they’re opting for a much smaller, more road-ready vehicle in its place.

MacDonald says he's grateful for the quick, kind-hearted and skilled work of District of North Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services members who attended the scene last Saturday, which disrupted traffic for some time and sent shrouds of smoke high into the air.

“I can’t thank the North Vancouver District fire department enough. It wasn’t just going through the routine of their job, they really seemed to care that we were OK and that the kids were OK. It was nice to see that level of empathy from first responders,” says MacDonald.

It’s an encounter his kids won’t soon forget either, he says.

While houses of worship have successfully turned to the online realm in order to offer salvation and spirituality in the age of physical distancing, it’s been just as important to make sure congregants and members of the public at large who are still in need of the odd meal or food item have access to the necessary nourishment, according to at least one North Shore minister.

St. Andrew’s United Church transitioned easily to hosting its congregation and services through a weekly livestream in the era of COVID-19, but it was more of a challenge to make sure its food programs didn’t fall victim to the virus as well, according to Rev. Judith Hardcastle.

“Food security is a big issue,” says Hardcastle. “That’s why we started again as quickly as we could.”

For years, the North Vancouver church has hosted a free community lunch every Thursday which has routinely drawn in between 70 and 80 people, in addition to a drop-in bread program.

Whether it was regular congregants of the church or someone passing by on the street, a wide swath of people – from families, seniors, or people experiencing homelessness, to those living with disabilities or going through tough financial times – could be expected to drop by every week to enjoy a bowl of soup and a sandwich as well as receive some much-needed companionship, according to Hardcastle.

But like most facets of society, that all came to a halt on March 12 due to novel coronavirus.

“We suddenly were all working from home. I was lost. Now I’m a minister without a flock,” she remembers feeling.

While Hardcastle knew it would be awhile before she would be able to conduct an in-person service again, she was committed to jump-starting the church’s food service program as soon as possible, at least in some form or another.

After consulting with Vancouver Coastal Health to find out how they could safely resume some sort of community meal program, St. Andrew’s launched a meal-to-go program where people could pick up a dinner, dessert and a loaf of bread back in April.

Last month, the church re-launched an express version of its lunch program providing those in need with a soup and sandwich.

And this month, the church is slated to resume what’s referred to as its “bread ministry” – a weekly partnership with Cobs Bread where staff distribute unsold bread goods for anyone who needs it, says Hardcastle.

After launching its takeaway food program, more than 60 people lined up during that first day while maintaining physical distancing, she says.

“We had a maximum of four people at a time come into the kitchen,” says Hardcastle.

In the era of COVID-19, food security has become a pertinent issue. In the early months of March and April, many non-profit organizations and charities that have food programs had to find creative ways to reach out to their usual clients and provide services.

It’s been no different for many churches, religious institutions and houses of worship, many of which provide those kinds of services as well, according to Hardcastle.

“We welcome everyone,” she says. “That’s where food banks original started – in the church basements.”

St. Andrew’s staff also manage 16 community gardens along St. Georges Avenue, four of which are gardened by volunteers at St. Andrew’s to use in the church’s own food programs.

Although Sunday in-person worship currently isn’t taking place at the church, St. Andrew’s has opened its sanctuary area to the public, from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m.-1 p.m., for open prayer and meditation.

Visit st-andrews-united.ca for more information about COVID-era food programs and church services.

Asked why she felt so compelled to re-start their food programs when the pandemic came swiftly into people’s lives, Hardcastle says it’s an essential part of their ministry.

“This lunch is known to people who live in the area,” she says. “When you welcome your neighbour, you provide hospitality and you feed them.”",[]

These trees were sacred and the felling of one was a spiritual act. Northwest Coast canoes are usually made by a specialist canoe carver with one or more assistants.

Everyone involved in the construction had to observe specific rules of behaviour.

As their primary source of transportation, canoeing was very important to coastal First Nations. Canoes linked villages, transported goods, and provided access to local resources and hunting grounds.

By the 20th century, systematic repression by the church and government as well as rapid social and technological change saw the canoe culture of the Pacific Northwest virtually disappear.

Today, First Nations canoe culture is kept alive through canoe racing.

She’s talking about the waterways – not necessarily the cynics.

article continues below

For the last seven years, groups like Wildcoast Ecological Society, of which Brennan is the outreach co-ordinator, as well as project partners Echo Ecological and a host of streamkeepers, green thumbs and volunteers, have helped transform Mackay Creek in North Vancouver into a welcome environment for native plants, birds and other wildlife.

“The site has its own microclimate now, it’s quite amazing – because it’s grown in so well,” says Brennan.

But there’s still more work to be done.

Earlier this month, Echo Ecological put out a time-lapsed video on YouTube of the work that has been going on at the Mackay Creek headwaters since 2013 in order to help preserve the habitat for salmon and the species that depend on them.

The video has racked up more than 5,000 views since it was released.

“We were a little bit surprised with the response, but we wanted to showcase all of the hard work that goes into preserving an urban stream like this,” says Brennan. “I think a lot of people don’t really realize a lot of the behind-the-scenes things that streamkeepers might do.”

Like most great projects, this one got underway due to the enthusiasm and perseverance of students.

In 2013, students in BCIT’s ecological preservation program were tasked with picking a site and coming up with a plan to restore it as part of a class project.

An example of some of the work that various groups have done to restore Mackay Creek - photo Krystal Brennan, Wildcoast Ecological Society

Brennan, who officially came on board a few years later, remembers even then there were scores of invasive plants and debris inhibiting migrating salmon. The area, which had been neglected for decades, was also just generally a bit of an eyesore.

Thousands of paid and volunteer hours have been put into restoring the creek, located in North Vancouver’s Capilano Highlands neighbourhood, over the years.

The creek flows down near the top of Grouse Mountain, through local coniferous rainforests, and crosses both North Vancouver City and District into Mackay Park. From there, the creek becomes an estuary which flows under the train tracks adjacent to Marine Drive and into Burrard Inlet from a culvert.

Since greening up the area, Brennan says there’s more songbirds and seabirds using the creek and park area, as well more coho and chum.

“There has been an increase in salmon coming up the creek,” she says.

Last year, a wetland area and pond near the creek, located near the intersection of West First Street and Lloyd Avenue, was restored by a large group of volunteers.

Prior to restoring that part of the creek, it wasn’t even able to function as a proper wetland, according to Brennan, who notes it was completely filled in by invasive species of grass that had sucked up the water table.

“It does have water now,” she says, adding there’s now ducks, raptors and other woodland creatures frequenting the area, and that the group also installed willow stakes to help stabilize the nearby streambank. “We know it’s being used as it’s supposed to.”

And while they don’t have long-term data, perhaps the groups’ best evidence for the success of their work so far has been the comments they’ve received from gleeful passersby.

“I don’t know if we quite knew what we were getting into, but we were able to create this amazing habitat for birds and mammals,” says Brennan. “We even found anecdotal evidence of people that worked in nearby offices who walked by and said they had never seen deer come to that site in the last decade.”

There’ still more work to be done, notes Brennan. There’s always invasive plants and species to curtail and new additions to implement to extend the sustainability of the area.

The groups have had to proceed cautiously, especially when it comes to their usual annual volunteer events, in the era of COVID-19.

The District of North Vancouver and the federal government’s EcoAction Community Funding Program have been great supporters and assets over the years too, she says.

Although the pandemic has caused some grant funding to dry up, Brennan’s still hoping to continue their longstanding Mackay Creek project going forward.

“This has been a special project for us that started seven years ago now and something we continue to work on because we also wanted to show the value of urban habitats like this one,” she says. “I think often times they get forgotten.”",[]

Boat traffic and globalisation has increased dramatically since then, bringing in and killing off many species of seaweed.

As a biology student at UBC, I’m working with my phycology (study of seaweeds) professor, Dr. Bridgette Clarkson on such a study this summer and we need your help.

article continues below

I would like to invite all of you to help participate in science to help our coastal waters by collecting seaweed photos and uploading them to iNaturalist (a free app available for Android and Apple). The objective is to create a summary of all the species in the area and where exactly they are found. Typical maps of species habitats are very vague. Species may be listed as being found from Alaska down to the Baha Peninsula, but the individuals may be picky about where they live. If you have ever been out to Tofino, you’ll have noticed that the types of habitats and species therin can be very different from those on Bowen. There are even noticeable differences between places on Bowen. The Cove has fairly different speciation compared to Hood Point.

Using iNaturalist, anybody can contribute to and collect data for the scientific community while also learning something. The app is very simple, even for elementary school aged children. You find a seaweed on the beach, photograph it, then use the app to choose from its suggested IDs, and share. Datapoints such as GPS coordinates, time of day or year and the identification (or observations) are all kept together and uploaded to a massive database, which is then connected to an even bigger international database (GBIF). Your phone automatically collects all of this data but if you don’t have internet, or have location services turned off, adding these points of data is still very easy and quick.

You can use iNaturalist for identifying any form of life - seaweed, trees, bugs, fish, birds- basically anything you can get a good photo of. I want to see how many observations the Bowen Island community can make this year. I challenge Bowen Island to make 500 observations of seaweeds this summer. Even if someone has already identified the one you find, it’s still valuable information.

Whether scouring the beach or on an evening amble through the forest, iNaturalist drives you to find different types of life, not just the common ones. You can observe species in your backyard (be sure to mark any ‘captive’––i.e. plants in your garden––observations as such), or seaweed species on the beach. Please, introduce this app to your kids, your friends, your students, anyone and everyone. Citizen science becomes more effective as more people take part.

I would like to mention as a heads up that many species of seaweed can look very different from one another and still be the same species (similar to dogs) and some species of seaweed may look very similar but be completely different species (similar to mushrooms). If this happens, please label your observation as best you can as this will result in more people having the chance of reviewing your observation, this could be as vague as “algae.” Anything helps. Observations that have not been reviewed by other people won’t be uploaded to the databases until they have been reviewed.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions: tobinsparling@gmail.com.

Thanks everyone, I look forward to seeing your observations!",[]

Other times smaller orcas including very young ones just swam along side the injured sea lion. ""After two hours of repeated pummelling, the sea lion slipped beneath the waves off our house never to be seen again: Nature in the raw! ""You wouldn’t want a pet orca!""",[]

“However, I made it to the top and was treated with one of the most spectacular surprises I've ever seen. I'm not usually one to be in awe of nature, but the beauty of the view truly gave me chills.”

Their dream was to host the alpine skiing portion of a Winter Olympics on the mountain.

""Their bid for the 1968 Winter Olympics was ultimately turned down,"" says Kevin Small, Marketing Manager of Resort Reservations Whistler, ""but they didn't give up. They renamed the mountain Whistler and officially opened the first ski run in 1966.""

Fifteen years later, nearby Blackcomb Mountain opened its first ski run. When the owners of Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain merged in March 1997, they gave birth to one of the largest and most exciting mountain resort companies in the world.

""Today, Whistler Blackcomb is a four-season resort,"" says Kevin. ""With over 50 kilometers of hiking trails, the largest Mountain Bike Park in the world, and five Terrain Parks, people ski, snowboard, hike, and bike all year round.""

To cement its reputation as a resort destination, Whistler Village now boasts 134 restaurants and bars and more than 200 retail stores.

""We're not just a pleasant place for a skiing day trip anymore,"" Kevin notes. ""We're a renowned international resort destination where both locals and tourists come for a few days or a few weeks.""

Resort Reservations Whistler opened in 2001 and operates as the booking channel for everything Whistler Blackcomb - from accommodation and lift tickets, to activities and nightlife.

""Whistler is on the top of bucket lists for people around the globe,"" Kevin says. ""And we're right here on your doorstep if you live on the Lower Mainland or surrounding areas.""

Rick Kim, General Manager and co-owner of the Olive & Anchor restaurant in Horseshoe Bay believes he's found a winning recipe to finding and hiring the right staff.

""Employees are an important part of our business,"" Rick says. ""At the Olive & Anchor, we believe in being inclusive, in giving kids a chance. We're rewarded with people who enjoy working here and stay right through high school and into university until they've decided on a full-time career.""

article continues below

Here are four tips from Rick to find and keep restaurant staff, based on his experience in the Olive & Anchor:

1. Don't take stock answers

When asked to name their strengths, candidates often say ""I'm always on time"" or ""I'm hardworking.""

""I tell them, 'whoa, stop right there,'"" says Rick. ""Those two things are a given. I don't give my chefs merit points or a reward for the quality of food, because that's an expectation. I want people who can think for themselves, who are willing to make decisions when necessary. I want the Olive & Anchor to be remembered for giving people chances.""

2. Don't micro manage

""At the Olive & Anchor,"" Rick explains, ""we believe in macro managing. We give kids positive reinforcement and challenges every day. I'm not concerned if they make mistakes. I want to know if they can fix those mistakes and move forward.""

3. Close one day a week

The Olive & Anchor is closed for business on Sundays.

""I want employees to have a guaranteed time off with their families,"" Rick says. ""I've had staff tell me that closing on Sundays means much more than just a day off. It's a day they can spend with their families – their partner isn't working, and the kids are home from school.""

4. Empower your employees

Along with not micro managing, Rick and his team at the Olive & Anchor, believe in empowering young employees to make decisions when they're comfortable.

""I'm not here all the time,"" Rick says. ""I want staff that can take initiative. I give them parameters within which to work, so they don't feel uncomfortable or confused, but basically I want them making decisions related to their work.""

148,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/standout/north-shore-community-needs-a-bigger-splash-1.23290672,North Shore community needs a bigger splash,[],,"If you’ve ever been turned away from your local pool because it’s being used for lessons, aquacise or training, then you can benefit from a 50m pool. Same goes if you have a kid who wants to participate in sports but doesn’t fancy soccer or hockey, or you have a business near the Harry Jerome Pool site on the North Shore.

“A lot of people think that a 50m pool is just for elite swimmers who want to swim laps,” says Mike Dowling, a member of the North Shore Aquatics Society (NSAS). “Actually, 25m pools can usually only accommodate one activity, so they are targeted towards laps, to the exclusion of activities like diving, aquacise, water polo, synchronized swimming or just public aquatic fun. A 50m pool can be divided into two or three, so many activities are possible at the same time.”

article continues below

Linda Sullivan is a member of the NSAS, and her three sons participated in aquatics when they were growing up. “As with any kids’ sport, there are early morning starts and events, and the North Shore has never had a pool large enough. I had many years of ferrying my sons around the province,” she says. “A 50m pool in our community would be for anybody to learn and practice aquatics. It would also attract events, which would bring revenue to businesses – a three-day synchronized swim event in a local pool recently generated $1 million to the local business community.”

That raises the issue of costs. The NSAS have crunched the numbers. “The capital cost of the whole Harry Jerome project will be mainly borne by the developer which is developing the existing site,” explains the organization’s Bruce Tout. “In terms of annual operating costs, we have done extensive research to compare the cost of running a 50m eight-lane pool with a 25m 10-lane one. The likelihood is that there would be no additional cost, but a worst-case-scenario estimate is $400,000 a year, which works out to about $3 per North Van resident, per year – less than the price of one admission.”

Sullivan says this cost can be offset in a number of ways: Event organizers will pay to hire a portion of the pool; a larger pool will be used by more people; and there are also opportunities for sponsorship that won’t exist unless the pool becomes a venue for events. Says Sullivan, “North Vancouver is a wonderful place to live, and our population is growing all the time, so let’s make sure we have a community resource that can accommodate everyone’s aquatic needs for the next generation.”

People usually choose Vancouver, Toronto or Ottawa as their first choice for immigration in Canada because these are the cities most frequently talked about and advertised. However, there is an abundance of opportunities available in other cities and provinces across the country.

article continues below

Young professionals who have obtained a bachelor’s or master’s degree have a better chance of immediately attaining that goal and becoming successful in the bigger cities. But, if they don’t have the post-secondary education, it is worth considering other cities as an option for immigration too.

With a high school diploma as the highest level of education, the best path to citizenship is by going where there are many jobs available, says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “Be flexible about where you’re willing to move to,” she adds.

Manitoba has the most flexible eligibility requirements in Canada because of its small population, Gary says. It’s also the only province that does not require applicants to pass an English language test. Saskatchewan is another province that makes it easier for people to immigrate.

“We can submit their application to move to Vancouver right from the start, but I can almost guarantee they won’t be in the pool,” she says. “We always tell them the truth because immigrating to Canada is not a cheap process. We don’t want to submit people’s applications and not get them here. If they only have a high school diploma and want this opportunity to come to Canada, they have to go to Manitoba.”

Gary explains that starting in Manitoba or Saskatchewan doesn’t mean immigrants have to stay there. Once they earn enough points to get resident status, they can easily apply for jobs in other provinces.

The same principle applies to the type of work people are willing to do. If they agree to work jobs with the most demand, they can get their start in Canada and earn the points that lead to residency either on their job or by going to school.

Described time and time again as an honest restaurant manager and businessman by his peers and employees, Mroke is humble about his ownership of Palki Restaurant. His success, he says, simply stems from knowing and understanding all of the parts of his business. The results, Singh says, are clear.

“This man has figured it out,” said Singh of his boss, Bhupinder Mroke. “It is because of Bhupinder that this restaurant is an autopilot machine and he runs an amazing, amazing operation.”

But that is not to overshadow the ambrosial food that awaits you at Palki Restaurant.

When asked what the customers love at Palki Best Indian Cuisine, Singh responded “the food, of course,” and without hesitation, he added, “it’s all about the food, food, and food.” Some dish highlights include Chicken Reshimi Kebob, Lamb Barra Kebob and Tandoori Vegetables.

At Palki, Singh promised, you don’t only get great food, you also have great service and ambiance.

""Often, when that conversation doesn't happen, children are unclear as to their parent's wishes,"" Nicole explains. ""I've seen cases where one child has said that their parent wanted to buried and another felt that cremation was wanted. It leads to family arguments and the possibility that your wishes may not be carried out.""

The Memorial Society of B.C. has been encouraging members and their families to have an end of life planning conversation for more than 60 years. With in excess of 242,000 members around the province, the Society is the largest memorial society in North America.

""Your survivors can benefit from our help when the time comes,"" says Nicole. ""Their first phone call should be to the Society. We can have your wishes for the disposition of your remains on file. We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents. I've been at information sessions where a parent has shared that they have a pre-paid plot for their remains, but their child sitting next to them was totally unaware. They can't carry out your wishes if they don't know what they are.""

It seems natural that we all plan for our vacations and retirement, but we don't want to plan for the end of life. This is a mistake, says Nicole.

""A man I know opens his lectures by saying, 'Dying is not a choice. It is going to happen.' With that in mind, it is important that we plan for the end and make sure our loved ones know our wishes. It will save them money and heartache at a difficult time.""

Hanson and Company is the North Shore’s largest personal injury law firm and offers assistance to victims of vehicle (ICBC claims), pedestrian, cycling accidents, and victims of assault.

Jim suggests following these five steps if you’re involved in an accident:

article continues below

1. Medical attention: “Make sure you get the medical attention you need right away,” Jim advises. “Call an ambulance if you need one; make an appointment with your doctor, if you don’t need an ambulance; go to emergency if your doctor is not available. Take care of yourself first.”

2. Contact details: Obtaining the names and contact details of everyone and every vehicle involved in the accident is vital. “That includes vehicle license and registration details, plate numbers, and the driver’s license information,” says Jim.

3. Photos of accident scene:While a diagram of the accident scene can be helpful, a photo or two can explain much more. “If at all possible, try and snap a few photos with your smart phone. These could be very useful in any potential claim.”

4. Witness details: When possible, compile a list of contact details of any witnesses to the accident. “Phoning the police would also be a good idea,” Jim says. “Make sure you supply them with the witness details.”

5. Legal representation: Finally, make sure to phone either your lawyer or insurer, or both. “Call one or the other right away,” advises Jim.

Failure to take immediate action or forgetting to get the contact information of everyone involved, including potential witnesses, could mean you might lose your right to compensation at the time of a personal injury claim.

Hanson & Company has a free App for smart phones to help people who have been in accidents deal with getting the important details of the incident on the spot. Jim hopes you will never need it but it pays to have it in your phone just in case.

“People are obviously quite distraught and rattled after an accident,” says Jim Hanson. “Our smartphone app will prompt and remind them of the things that need to be done right after an accident occurs.”

“I recognize that buying or selling a home involves some of the biggest decisions that most people will ever make,” says Michelle Vaughan, a Realtor® with Royal Le Page Sussex Realty on the North Shore. “I’m excited to be able to facilitate such an important process.”

article continues below

Michelle has put together 8 tips for first-time buyers to take into consideration when they’re navigating the ins and outs of the real estate world:

1) Always talk to a mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers will help you determine what you can afford. Otherwise, you end up looking at homes out of your price range, and that can be discouraging.

2) Beware of extra costs. There are typically costs associated with buying a home that aren’t in the purchase price including closing costs (legal paperwork) and property transfer tax (PTT). If you purchase a newly built home, you may also be charged GST, though these regulations change frequently. Check with your Realtor® if you’re not sure (which brings us to point #3).

3) Find a Realtor®. Finding a Realtor® who understands that you are new to house shopping and is willing to help you through the process will make the whole experience easier, less risky, and more productive. Ask people you know for recommendations. And don’t ever be afraid to ask your Realtor® questions!

4) Needs vs. wants. Make sure you differentiate your NEEDS from your WANTS. These can evolve when you start looking, but you need to start somewhere. Your Realtor® can help you with this part of the process, too.

5) Let your Realtor® be your guide. Your Realtor® can guide you through writing an offer, including the best subjects to incorporate, such as financing and inspection. If you are looking at a strata property, make sure you request all the documents and thoroughly check the minutes (to see what is going on in the complex), the financial records, and possibly a depreciation report, if available. And don’t panic when reading through it—all buildings need maintenance!

6) Once you’re accepted, be diligent. After getting an accepted offer, do anything that needs to be done to satisfy your subjects. This can include working with a mortgage broker on financing, or getting a house inspection done.

7) The deposit cheque: now it’s official. When you remove your subjects and give your deposit cheque, you have what is called a firm and binding contract. This means you are committed to following through on the sale. If you need advice on hiring a lawyer to do your closing, ask your Realtor®.

8) Home insurance. Make sure you obtain home insurance before you close.

""Even though we often have amazing financing offers, such as our current Volksfest promotion of 0% financing for up to 84 months on select vehicles, leasing is still a popular option,"" he points out.

article continues below

Garry and his colleague, Shaun Openshaw, Assistant Sales Manager at Capilano VW offer five reasons why people often consider leasing a vehicle instead:

1. It's an opportunity to try out a vehicle: ""You have the option at the end of the lease to decide if that vehicle is right for you,"" explains Shaun. ""If it is, you have the option of moving into another lease and driving a newer model.""

2. You can buy-out the lease: Buying-out the lease at the end of the term means you're buying a used vehicle that you know has been well-cared for over the past three or four years.

3. No depreciation concerns: ""If you have a lease,"" Garry says, ""and someone hits you and causes, say, $10,000 worth of damage to your car, you no longer have to worry about the long-term impact on your car’s value. Instead, you just drop the vehicle off at the end of the lease. When you own the vehicle, any accident is going to impact the price of the vehicle when it’s time to sell it.

4. Low monthly payments: Lease payments usually work out to be lower than loan financing. ""With a $400 lease payment, for example,"" Shaun explains, ""you can get a high-spec car with more options—such as leather seats—for a much lower monthly payment over the same term. If you finance, you'd have to go to a much longer term to get the same payment. For instance, on a five-year financing term that same vehicle might cost you $600 or more.""

5. It’s ideal for students: Often, parents are looking to buy a used car for kids heading off to university. ""Maybe they want to spend $10,000-$15,000 on a used vehicle,"" says Shaun. ""If they put that into a lease over four years, their son or daughter can be driving a brand new, zero kilometre vehicle that they know is going to be reliable and safe. Conversely, with a used vehicle, you may not know it’s history—and you may get stuck with a large repair bill down the road.""

“The latest trend is large openings that join interior living spaces with the outdoors,” says Stuart Ilott, Vice-President of Sales and Marketing for Wizard Industries. “As a result, we’re seeing a lot of movement toward bi-fold and stacker doors in new homes and renovations. We’re also seeing a lot of interest in products like VistaView that allow access to the outside world without allowing any unwanted guests into the home.”

article continues below

Burnaby based Wizard Industries has been a well-known and well-respected supplier of retractable screen doors and awnings for more than 15 years. VistaView is their feature retractable screen product. It can cover openings of up to 29' 5” feet.

Ilott says everyone is asking about VistaView screens because of their unique features. We’ve listed a few of them here:

• They work exactly like any standard retractable screens, retracting into a discreet housing on either side of the opening.

• Wizard can retrofit any VistaView screen onto any sliding or stacked door or window system.

• A handle breaking system allows you to open the screen only part way and stop it where you want.

• It’s the only truly pleat-less system that can cover openings up to 29.5 feet.

• Screens are wind rated to 150 mph.

• The secure zipper track and professionally calibrated screen tension allow the screen to cover the large distance without blowing out of the track.

• Screens can be customized to work on interior or exterior corners.

• The screen tracks can be recessed if the design is included with the original building plans.

• The frames can be colour-matched and also come in wood grain, anodized to look like metal and classic bronze.

“People might wonder why you would even want a 30-foot opening in your home,” says Ilott. “But if you explore the concept a little further, you quickly come to realize how functional it is. Not only does it allow you to maximize the space and open things up, it also maximizes the amount of fresh air circulating through your home.

“We saw the need for this kind of product,” he adds. “And we led the rest of the industry in developing it.”

By setting a target of welcoming 350,000 new arrivals each year by 2021, Canada is telling the world that it is willing to open its doors to talented individuals.

“We are 40 million people and yet we don’t have enough people living here to fulfill all the opportunities for growth,” says Rachel Gary, COO of Canada Direct. “The Canadian government is giving people the chance to have a good life here but there is the expectation that you contribute to the economy as well.”

The immigration system in Canada operates on a points basis. Those with a dream of moving to Canada can accumulate points for such things as work experience, education and English or French proficiency. Points can be earned in your home country, as well as in Canada.

The experts at Canada Direct can help make the application process much smoother. First, a team member will take you through a questionnaire that outlines the client’s qualifications. Then, an assessment report will be sent to one of Canada Direct’s regulated Canadian immigration consultants.

Education is an important factor in Canada’s immigration process. Bachelor and master’s degrees from other countries are usually accepted, while complications can arise if the degrees are from a technical school.

Work experience comes secondary to education. For instance, Gary says that in many Central American countries, a person can have management experience without a university degree. It’s not that they’re not educated; rather, the level of education is not as stringent a job requirement as it is in Canada.

In cases like these where the applicant wants to continue working in their chosen field in Canada, Gary suggests that they arrive on a student visa. Then, they can work towards obtaining their university degree or college diploma in Canada. Canada Direct can help applicants in this situation get a work visa that allows them to earn both an income and more points for immigration.

But what happens if you are older than 35 and you possess a high school diploma, but no post-secondary education? Gary says this is a more challenging, but not impossible, situation. While B.C. and Ontario are popular arrival points for immigrants, Manitoba is actually the most lenient province when it comes to eligibility criteria. It doesn’t require applicants to pass an English language test, for instance. Another option is that applicants of all ages can apply for a student visa which can allow them to study for the qualifications they need for employment.

2) Christine’s on Blackcomb.

The menu showcases the flavour of modern West Coast cuisine. With panoramic views of the Coast Mountains, the experience is just as savory as the meal itself. Open June 30 – Sept 2.

3) Winemakers Dinner. Winemaker-hosted après and dinners are a Whistler Blackcomb must-do, with a B.C. winemaker speaking and a new winery featured each month in the winter, and once in the summer. Saturday, July 28, the mountain is featuring SunRock Vineyard with presentations by viticulturalist Troy Osbrone, of Arterra Wines Canada. Brush up on all your vine knowledge, and toast at the new Umbrella Bar at the Roundhouse Lodge. As Jennifer Smith, Public Relations Senior Specialist with Whistler Blackcomb Vail resorts, puts it: “A winemaker’s event, whether summer or winter, is a beautiful way to connect with your inner foodie, and having access to a viticulturist to learn about the way the grapes are grown really will really take the mountain-top dining experience to the next level.”

Ecole André-Piolat is part of a network of 37 French language schools in B.C. administered by the Conseil scolaire francophone (CSF). Founded in 1990, the school offers an education in French to children of French-speaking parents or those whose siblings have been educated in French.

""In 2015,"" says M. Brisebois, ""our school was ranked fifth in B.C. by the Fraser Institute, and this year we are likely to rank in the top three. We offer an International Baccalaureate (IB) program in French and encourage our students to graduate with high school certificates in both French and English.""

According to M. Brisebois, students at André-Piolat often go on to study at universities such as McGill or Concordia in Montreal, or the bilingual program at Simon Fraser University.

""Our students have no difficulty being accepted to a university with two languages and an IB program,"" explains M. Brisebois. ""A second language opens up opportunities for students—it's one more tool in their toolbox for succeeding in life.""

For the French community on the North Shore, André-Piolat fills a need for a place to meet and socialize outside of school.

""Outside of school activities,"" says M. Brisebois, ""we offer a place for the French community to come together. We have a great Parents' Advisory Committee (PAC) and we have very strong support from our community for all of our social and school events.

At the same time, we're all bilingual so we're also a part of the broader North Shore community.""

The knowledgeable staff at Advanced Medical Healthcare Equipment can provide you with all the information you need to find the right product. In general, mobility equipment or walking aids fall within the following categories:

· Rollator (Walkers with four wheels): If you are worried about keeping your balance while walking outside or if you feel you need support to go longer distances, this is the ideal solution for you. Walkers provide maximum stability, and for older adults travelling outside of the home often, they’re a good option for those who tire easily. These come in different styles and seat heights, with carry bags for your belongings. The handles can be adjusted based on your height and reach.

article continues below

· Walker with forearm trough supports: This walker puts the pressure on the user’s forearms and shoulders instead of their wrists, so it’s ideal for those who have arthritis in their hands or wrists, or those who have poor posture or balance.

· 2-wheeled walkers: Designed to be used in-doors for recovery periods, these are super light. A tray can be clamped on to carry your belongings. However, they don’t have brakes and a seat, so they shouldn’t be used outside.

· Canes: These are the most basic aid for those beginning to experience mobility issues. Advanced Medical carries a good variety of canes with different grips, such as anatomical or ergonomic style versus round type. There are also quad (or four-point) canes versus single-point canes. Different cane tips can be used for different types of walking surfaces and terrain. You may want to consult with your occupational therapist/physiotherapist to see if this is the right product for you.

When deciding between different rollator styles, it’s important to consider the user’s hand strength and walking ability. Most walking aids are adjustable, but finding the right height range along with taking into account the user’s weight and lifting capability will provide the most fitting product. This is what Advanced Medical expert staff will assist you with. They’ll also take time to practice using the equipment with you to make sure your posture and gait (pattern of walking) are correct.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia.

The answer is you get the trip of a lifetime. In the summer of COVID-19, taking a self-sufficient trip with your family is sounding like a pretty decent idea. To explore that idea more, we found a North Vancouver family that did just that last year, heading out into the great beyond in their cool custom van. Here’s what they found along the way.

article continues below

We are Matt and Connie Buechler with our two kids Valerie and Zoe (11 and eight years old) and Bailey, our 13-year-old Labrador retriever.

For 13 years we have lived in the Lynn Valley area in North Vancouver, and after 20 years of working in our careers, our family decided to explore North America beyond our awesome province of British Columbia. We wished to spend more quality time together as a family and explore as much of Canada and the United States as possible. We then started to look into how we were going to make this trip happen.

We considered many ways, from a truck with a fifth-wheel trailer to an RV, an SUV/trailer, or even flying from city to city and booking Airbnb stays.

After researching our options and keeping in mind our preference of having the ability to explore remote areas, we contacted Nomad Vanz, a custom van converter based locally in North Vancouver. We started a discussion with them about converting a van for travelling that could comfortably sleep four people and a dog, combine all the creature comforts of a home, can be used in all four seasons and on top of that has off-road capabilities so that we could explore the rugged and remote areas as well.

The result was Cloudhaus, a 2018 Mercedes Benz 3500 4x4 Sprinter Van 170 EXT as a base vehicle, featuring a full custom conversion from Nomad Vanz. The conversion included a bunch of fun and functional features ranging from a safari rack and bumper winch on the outside, a shower and water purification system inside, convertible beds, a gourmet kitchen and more, all tied together with a custom colour scheme.

We had the van, now it was time to hit the road.

In the spring of 2019, our family set off on our adventure across North America and headed east. Our family tracks led us through the Rockies, across the Prairies, through Ontario, Quebec, all the Atlantic provinces, France (yes France!), the Midwest and the western United States, all over a four-month period.

All parts of the trip were memorable, but some stood out. We were in awe of the vastness of the Prairie skies, but equally impressed by the rugged beauty of the Atlantic provinces.

We enjoyed the French culture in Quebec and the visits to the fromageries and boulangeries along the Gaspé Peninsula.

We can also testify that the people in Newfoundland and Labrador are amongst the most hospitable people we had the pleasure of meeting.

Here are 10 trip highlights, in no particular order (and many more could be mentioned):

• Canada is big – While enjoying an Iceberg beer at the Quidi Vidi Brewery in St. John’s, Nfld., we hit ‘Home’ on our cellphone map – more than 8,500 kilometres until home!

• The water in Bruce Peninsula, Ont., is as turquoise as shown in pictures, but don’t be fooled by the colour – it is freezing cold!

• With the help of amazing people at North Vancouver’s Flicka Gymnastics Club, our daughter Zoe was able to attend a gymnastics camp in Halifax with Ellie Black, our Canadian Olympic gymnast.

• Two spots in Canada are tied on our list for the best star gazing: Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, and remote camping anywhere along the Trans-Labrador highway between Churchill Falls and Happy Valley-Goose Bay.

• The best beaches we found were in P.E.I., with the finest red sand and the warmest water (in the summer, anyway).

Oh hi! photo Buechler family

• The most scenic highway we experienced was the Cabot Trail in Cape Breton, N.S. – a winding road, stunning views and so much wildlife everywhere.

• The best natural hot tub we found was in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. We spent probably more time hanging out in the Boiling River than is recommended, but the warm water mixed with the early morning sunrise and stunning scenery made it really difficult to leave.

• The best mountain biking on our trip was in Sun Valley, Idaho. We found wonderful trails for all skill levels all around this rural community.

• We experienced the most amazing sunset at the most eastern point in Canada – Cape Spear, Nfld.

• France really is only an hour boat ride away from Newfoundland (look up St-Pierre et Miquelon).

Our trip allowed us to spend quality time together and created memories for a lifetime.

The fact that we got to travel in a Nomad Vanz vehicle allowed us to camp in remote places, carried us safely across the rugged Trans-Labrador highway, allowed us to climb steep mountains for great views, and kept our batteries charged with solar panels.

But the best was that we could go where other RVs couldn’t go. We met amazing people wherever we went, learned fascinating things about our country and heard many people’s stories. We learned that our country is beautiful and amazing everywhere, and our hope is that many other people have the same opportunity to experience what we were able to – make memories, and create their own family tracks.

The A 250 4MATIC hatch is a vehicle that aims to draw in a younger audience with lots of technology and an affordable bottom line.

article continues below

And surprisingly, this compact Mercedes offers features that were only available on high end cars just a few years ago. It delivers a lot of value for those who still want a European marque but also want to save some doe in today’s challenging times.

Design

With AMG-influenced body styling, the Mercedes-Benz A 250 is sleek, thoroughly modern, and sporty. The hood is sloped with a “shark-nose” design which highlights its aggressive front end. A character line moves across the body to a dual-section rear bumper. The dynamic radiator grille is black and features a diamond pattern with the signature Mercedes-Benz insignia.

The interior cabin has a distinctly avante-garde look that makes competitors’ cars appear very dated in comparison. Standard in the interior cabin is an illuminated entry system, outside temperature display, heated power side mirrors, heated front seats, keyless entry, four-way adjustable steering column, cruise control and three years of Mercedes me connect services. Two different types of front seats are available: a standard comfort seat or a sport seat (as part of the sports package).

The body of the A-Class is engineered to reduce noise and vibration to provide a better driving experience. The A 250 seats five passengers and the reasonably useable back seat features a rear centre armrest with dual cupholders. The cargo capacity ranges from 370 litres up to a maximum 1,210 litres with all seats folded down.

A WiFi hotspot is available but requires in-car data to be purchased. Apple Carplay and Android Auto are available but only with the purchase of the premium package. A seven-inch touchscreen centre media display is controlled by touch and features the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) program. A Remote Start system via the Mercedes me mobile app will ensure you will always be able to start your vehicle, near or far.

The Mercedes-Benz A 250 is full of safety features such as attention assist, active brake assist, auto-on rear-window wiper, rearview camera, LED taillights, seven air bags and an in-vehicle one-touch calling feature. However, if you wish to access items such as active distance, steering, blind spot, lane keeping and lane change assist, you will need to purchase the Intelligent Drive package for $1,900.

Performance

The engine is a 2.0-litre inline-four turbo and produces 221 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque, paired with a 7G-DCT seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The A 250 can accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour in just 6.2 seconds – a shockingly impressive number for a small and affordable entry level car.

The A 250 comes standard with Mercedes’ 4Matic all-wheel drive system, something that other automakers simply won’t offer at this price range. A torque vectoring brake system is extremely responsive and quick. In the front, the suspension is a four-wheel independent MacPherson strut/wishbone type, and a multilink suspension in the rear.

I can say with certainly that competitors – namely the VW Golf R, Audi A3 and BMW 2-Series – cannot match the level of features and performance of the A 250 hatch. The overall experience of the A 250 is a notch or two above cars in this price range, and the high tech features will keep you entertained for years to come.

The handling is fast and predictable, and the ride stiff but smooth. The VW Golf R or GTI is completely outdated in comparison (until the new one arrives shortly), and the Audi A3 doesn’t even come in a hatchback form here in Canada. The BMW 2 Series is all new and beautiful to look at, but it’s not as exciting to drive as the A 250. The Lexus UX perhaps is the closest competitor to the A 250, and it does offer hybrid as well – but the Mercedes is still the more fun vehicle to drive.

And if you demand even more performance, there is an AMG version with more than 300 h.p., although it costs substantially more.

Summary

Did you know that the hatchback version of the A 250 is not sold in the U.S., and it’s unique to the Canadian market? And we still get the sedan version that’s offered in the U.S. – so we get all of the models.

The base retails for $38,300 MSRP and as with other Mercedes-Benz vehicles there are plenty of options to add such as the sport package, a night package, and technology, premium, navigation, and intelligent drive packages. In any case, the A 250 is a unique-to-Canada model that provides a practical yet sporty driving experience with surprising amounts of performance and features. I think it’s a winning combination.

He scampers to the garage, barks at the door, demanding to be let in. Most dogs love going for a walk. Lucky likes to go for a drive.

article continues below

On any given sunny day, January through December, you've got a decent chance of spotting Lucky perched in the back seat of Bill Pomeroy's 1963 Corvair. The car would be eye-catching by itself, deep red paint and a white exterior, open to the elements. A self-satisfied looking dog, perched in the backseat and basking in the scents of the world, just adds to the scene.

“Being a beagle, he's all about the smells,” Pomeroy says. “For me, it's a total de-stresser. I just jump in, turn the music on, and go.”

Bill Pomeroy's Corvair is pretty close to its original condition. It has never been repainted or restored. photo Bill Pomeroy

Pomeroy owns Artrageous Pictures and Framing over on St. Georges Avenue. A few years ago, with his two sons grown, he started looking for a classic car, something he'd dreamed about since he was a kid.

He wasn't looking for a potential wallet-crusher like a numbers-matching Shelby Mustang or rare air-cooled Porsche, but rather something accessible and fun. Maybe a Falcon or a Futura. But as he browsed through the auction sites, he kept noticing well-kept Corvairs going for reasonable prices.

“I remember asking, 'If I could have anything, what would I have?' The more I learned about the Corvair, it being the only rear-engined production American car, styled more like a European car, the more it interested me. It was the story behind it. There's nothing else like it.”

The Corvair is perhaps one of the most unfairly maligned classic cars. The subject of Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe At Any Speed, it was criticized for its unstable handling.

In actuality, a Corvair with a proper anti-roll bar up front, and tire pressures correctly set, is not really any worse than any other contemporary car. Remember that expensive air-cooled Porsche 911 we just mentioned? Well, it's got the weight distribution of a rear-mounted engine and the handling compromises of a swing axle too. In the case of the Porsche, the handling quirks are part of the appeal.

Further, the Corvair is a pretty interesting machine. It was eventually outcompeted by the more conventional Ford Mustang, but its rear-engine 2.7-litre flat-six is unique among domestic marques, and its styling is slimmer and more stylish than some other 1960s rivals. You also don't see too many of them around, whereas 1960s Mustangs and Camaros are much more common.

And perhaps the Corvair's reputation is a bit of a boon, as it has kept prices within the reach of ordinary enthusiasts. Pomeroy's 1963 convertible is a manual transmission model, originally sold out of Los Angeles. It spent most of its life in Palm Springs, and then was imported into North Vancouver about a decade ago.

“I'd been looking through the auctions, mostly in the U.S.,” he says, “But then happened upon this one locally. I wasn't originally looking for a convertible, but it just felt like it was meant to be.”

Pomeroy's car is largely original. “Everything is just as it was when the vehicle rolled off the assembly line,” he says. He's gone over necessaries like the brakes and a bit of wiring, but the car has never been repainted or restored.

Best of all, because it's a relatively affordable classic, Pomeroy gets to actually use and enjoy his car. He talks about driving around Ambleside and rolling up next to the likes of a new Lamborghini at a stoplight.

“It's funny that the guy with a car costing ten times as much is asking me about my car,” he says with a chuckle.

“I'm not afraid to drive it,” he adds, “I can go park it at Save-On, and while it would suck to come back to find a dent, it wouldn't be the end of the world.”

Pomeroy drives his Corvair every couple of days, and says that he's had very few issues in the three years he's owned it. The car is happiest when it is kept moving, and so too is the owner. Today, especially, when bad news is on every screen, his Corvair provides a welcome escape.

“I'm following all the rules,” he says, “It's almost the perfect isolation machine. I just go out for about twenty minutes or so and come back. It's so relaxing to drive. And I get to take my dog along too.”

It sounds like just the right way to get through a tough time. Lucky owner. Lucky dog.

170,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-toyota-tundra-trd-pro-is-still-the-king-of-trucks-1.24111231,REVIEW: Toyota Tundra TRD Pro is still the king of trucks,['David Chao'],,"The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Toyota’s Tundra series of full-size trucks have been around for many years now with minimal changes – and it’s definitely one of the older designs in this fiercely competitive market. But even when compared back-to-back with some of the newest models from GM and Ford, for example, there is still something amazing about the Tundra.

article continues below

The Tundra is simple to drive and operate, delivers great performance, and offers the beauty of a solid V-8 engine. And in the top-level TRD Pro, the Tundra is the king of the road.

The Tundra TRD Pro is a limited edition vehicle that blends power, off-road capability, comfort, safety, and heavy duty performance in one full-size pickup. The TRD namesake is an acronym that stands for Toyota Racing Development, and the Pro version is the ultimate TRD model.

The performance tuning and suspension are at the core for TRD Pro – it represents improvements to the suspension system to substantially increase off-roading capability. TRD Pro for the Tundra kicks it up a notch as Toyota’s ultimate off-roading package, and is available in the 4x4 CrewMax and Double Cab versions, all equipped with the proven 5.7-litre V-8.

Design

The Tundra TRD Pro boasts unique items that differentiate it from other TRD models. This includes a TOYOTA heritage grill, TRD stamped skid plate in the front, TRD performance exhaust with a black chrome tip, Rigid Industries LED fog lamps, and 18-inch forged-aluminum black wheels. Exterior colours for the TRD Pro are limited to the Super White, Midnight Black Metallic, Magnetic Grey Metallic, or Army Green, which is new for 2020. Choosing the CrewMax Cab will get you more space for rear passengers, but shorter truck bed for hauling. The Double Cab option will get you a smaller interior space with only two full doors and restricted space for the rear passengers – but a larger area in the back for truck bed. Either option offers spacing for five passengers. The Crewmax provides enormous rear passenger space, almost like a limousine back there.

Inside the Tundra TRD Pro we find attractive black leather seating with red stitching, a 12-speaker JBL Audio System (with the Crewmax option only), and a four-way power passenger seat in addition to all the other interior treats.

Technology in the 2020 Tundra TRD Pro is plentiful, thanks to the new upgraded infotainment for 2020. Connected services offered by Toyota include Remote Connect, Safety Connect, Service Connect as well as Destination Assist. Remote Connect will allow you to use an app to find where you are parked, check status of windows and moonroof, lock/unlocking, and remote start.

You can even connect your Tundra using Amazon Alexa to verbally do these actions as well as check things such as fuel level. Destination Assist features speaking with a 24/7 live agent who will assist you to locate places to go and things to do, and then send the navigation information to your vehicle so you can keep your eyes on the road. Both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are supported.

Safety Connect will help assist in times of emergency to something as simple as a flat tire. As with other connect services, the system will connect you to a live agent who will send the appropriate assistance. A stolen vehicle locator will assist to locate the vehicle in the case of theft. As well, Toyota Safety Sense is included, which features such as auto high beam, high speed dynamic radar cruise control, and pre-collision system with pedestrian detection.

Performance

Only one option exists for the Tundra TRD Pro, a 32-valve 5.7-litre DOHC i-FORCE V-8 with VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing with Intelligence). This produces a strong 381 horsepower and 401 foot-pounds of torque. Paired to this is a six-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy for the Tundra is 18.0/14.2/16.3 litres/100 kilometres for city/highway/combined, respectively – it’s obviously the weak point for the Tundra.

As mentioned, this vehicle comes equipped with special off-road suspension. The TRD Pro comes with 2.5-inch FOX coil-over performance shocks in the front and remote reservoir internal bypass shocks in the back. It’s also equipped with heavy duty brakes as well; four-piston callipers and 13.9-inch front brake rotors will ensure you have ultimate control.

Towing is a breeze for the Tundra thanks to its max towing capacity of up to 9,700 pounds. The vehicle comes factory equipped with front tow hooks, heavy duty tow hitch receiver, four- and seven-pin connectors, transmission fluid temperature gauge, as well as a trailer brake controller.

There are many other TRD trims offered for the 2020 model year: TRD Sport, TRD Sport Premium, TRD Off Road, or TRD Off Road Premium. The TRD Premium models essentially replaced the Limited model that was offered in 2019 (I still don’t understand why Toyota removed the Limited name). While all TRD models represent good value, the TRD Pro still stands out as something special.

Summary

The 2020 Tundra 4x4 CrewMax TRD Pro starting price is $67,270. If you opt for the Tundra 4x4 Double Cab TRD Pro, the price is slightly less at a starting MSRP of $64,400. Either way, you are looking at a significantly higher price than the 4x2 Double Cab SR5 base level model, which runs around $40,190.

For those who think the price is too much to swallow, any of the other TRD models can be a good compromise. They all share some basic elements with the Pro model, such as the aforementioned V-8 engine, spacious cabin and updated technology.

The question is: is it worth it to make the jump to the performance model with the TRD Pro trademark? Combining luxury, safety, heavy duty off-roading performance, style, and technology, the 2020 Toyota Tundra TRD Pro is an excellent choice for those who will settle for nothing less than the very best pickup.",[]

In the midst of a global pandemic, we are all encouraged to think of the greater good, to stay home and stay safe, to take care of ourselves so that we may take care of others. Which is why, as this column goes on hiatus for the next little while, I wanted to leave you with the story of a time when you could order a rocket-propelled axle for your car through the mail.

article continues below

The year was 1962. America was obsessed with rocketry and the potential of towers of flame, propelling us all towards the stars. The interstellar adventures of Star Trek were just a few years away, and popular science fiction promised a time when anything would be possible.

Enter Florida, that crucible of bad ideas and poor parental supervision. Eugene Middlebrooks Jr., then in his early 30s, was a mechanical engineer working on propulsion systems for the Pershing nuclear ballistic missile systems. But Middlebrooks wasn’t content to be merely a cog in a machine. He wanted more.

The key ingredient to Middlebrooks’ plans was N-propyl nitrate, better known as the essential propellant in a solid rocket booster. Needing no atmospheric oxygen to combust, N-propyl nitrate was ideal for both the space race and the concept of mutually assured destruction. Ol’ Gene started thinking about how to adapt it for cars.

He’d already had a go at an idea that was just ahead of its time: the electric supercharger. Interested in racing, specifically drag-racing, Middlebrooks knew that bolt-on upgrades would be a hot seller for anyone looking to get an edge on the driver next to them at the staging lights. Due to the weight of batteries and technical problems, he couldn’t get the electric supercharger to work.

So he brought his work home with him. Turbonique, Middlebrooks’ company, was founded in the early 1960s with its first product, a rocket-powered supercharger.

Superchargers and turbochargers operate on the same basic principle. Since any internal combustion engine is essentially an air pump, ramming more air and fuel into the engine means more power. While turbochargers scavenge exhaust gases to spin their fans, superchargers are usually belt-driven off the engine.

Not Turbonique’s solution. Instead, the Microturbo thrust unit was a sort of Catherine Wheel firework attached to a turbine. Hit a button that sparked the propellant, and the supercharger kicked off at up to 100,000 r.p.m.

How much power are we talking? Well, this was the early 1960s, when factory hot-rods like the Pontiac GTO made just over 300 horsepower from a 6.4-litre V-8. Turbonique promised up to an additional 850 h.p. from their supercharger.

That, obviously, is an insane amount of power. Imagine pushing a button and instantly more than tripling the power of a car that was considered one of the most muscular on the roads. Even by today’s standards, that kind of power is like suddenly getting rammed by a Dodge Challenger Hellcat.

Of course, Turbonique’s mail-order business model wasn’t exactly confidence inspiring. In the days before Amazon reviews, you sent away for your “X-Ray Specs” and you ended up slightly disappointed. However, Turbonique actually made some proof-of-concept vehicles.

One notorious machine was the Black Widow, a humble Volkswagen Beetle. It came equipped with one of Turbonique’s other offerings, the drag-axle.

The drag-axle was simply the same idea as the rocket-propelled supercharger, now applied directly to the rear wheels. When you pushed a button, the fuel would spin a gear attached to the rear axle, and the car would shoot forward. The bolt-on part was made of aluminum, and weighed around 50 kilograms.

When activated, it added a claimed 1,300 h.p. to the output of that VW Beetle. I’ll say that again. One thousand, three hundred horsepower. Never mind how crazy that was in 1966, imagine the insanity of mashing that button today.

The Black Widow ran through the quarter-mile in 9.36 seconds, which is two seconds faster than a Ferrari Enzo. One one thousand. Two one thousand. That’s by how much a humble little economy car just smoked the pride of Maranello.

Now, you may be thinking to yourself, “But why have I never heard of Turbonique before? Were there any drawbacks?” Well, that depends. Is a horrible fiery explosive demise a drawback? I suppose some people might think so.

Should you lift off the throttle after activating your Turbonique power adder, the fuel would pool in the housing, essentially turning it into a bomb. Touch the throttle again, and it’s explodey time.

So, once you light that candle, there’s no turning back. Further, adding that much power at the touch of the button obviously comes with some safety concerns. The Black Widow did manage at least one successful pass, but later crashed spectacularly at more than 300 km/h, flipping end over end as it crossed the finish line. Happily, the driver walked away.

We’re not quite done. Along with the drag axle and the rocket-propelled supercharger, Turbonique also offered outright rocket engines. These weren’t intended for application on a car, as that would be far too dangerous, even for them.

Instead, you were supposed to bolt them on a go-kart.

I once interviewed someone in Edmonton who successfully had a run (just one) in a Turbonique rocket-powered go-kart. It scorched down the quarter mile, easily beating a hemi-powered Dodge, and then nearly got run over at the end when the power stopped. The owner stuck the kart in a garage and never went near it again.

Sadly, the promise of Turbonique never quite lived up to their demonstrations. The parts were not as well-finished as promised, and required a great deal more machining than the average user could perform. They weren’t quite X-ray specs levels of hype, but they weren’t quite the bolt-ons that were advertised.

And then there was the problem with N-propyl nitrate, which Turbonique called Thermoline. Obviously mailing solid rocket fuel wasn’t going to last for long, and the substance was soon impossible to find. You could brew your own alternatives, but that wasn’t exactly safe either.

Thus, poor ol’ Gene Middlebanks found himself convicted of mail fraud, and Turbonique folded. Well, I say poor ol’ Gene, but he chose to defend himself and this was his third indictment for mail fraud and it doesn’t appear that any dissatisfied customers got any refunds. Receiving two years in prison and a fine, he got out of the mail-order game and ran a resort in Florida for the rest of his life. Nobody picked up the rocket-powered-car torch from him, possibly because they were worried about getting their fingers blown off. The end.

As we head into uncharted territory over the next few weeks, you’ll always be able to get sensible, local COVID-19 information here in this paper.

For now, however, I’m told the Friday edition will take a breather, and with it, this column. I hope to return as things get back to a new normal, and in the meantime you can find anything I write at brendanmcaleer.ca.

Stay safe out there everyone. We’ll see you soon. The road awaits.

We had road rage, too much traffic, parking headaches, and pollution. Yet, at the same time, your car was something of an escape pod. It’s the double-edged sword of the automobile: commuting is no fun, but driving out onto some lovely empty backroad is about as wonderful as it gets.

Which is why, as we all face a long season ahead of being shut up indoors and forced to watch all the Fast and Furious movies again, your car might just be the one exposure-free way to get out of the house. Roads are relatively empty right now, and fuel is less expensive than it’s been for years (and, for EV owners, there are more charge points). A blast up the Sea to Sky Highway, with your favourite playlist hooked up to the stereo, is a far better use of your time than staying glued to the latest bad news.

More than ever, though, you need to be a self-sufficient explorer. Here’s how to get your car ready to be the personal escape craft that keeps you sane.

Safe refueling

Whether your car is electric or gas-powered, at some point you’re going to have to get out of the car and grasp a handle for a fuel pump or charger. By doing so, you’re basically shaking hands with everyone who’s touched that surface.

So, as with everything else in your life, it’s all about washing your hands, using gloves, and treating everything outside your car as potentially swarming with disease. To be blunt, we probably should have been washing our hands after touching gas station pumps already. Now, however, there is no excuse.

Tire pressures

Consistently the most overlooked maintenance item on the car, tires are all that are holding you to the ground. Not only should you keep them properly inflated for the best traction and fuel economy, but you should also take this time to check the pressure in your spare tire, and to make sure all the bits for the emergency kit are in there.

Fluid top-off

Every car comes with an owners’ manual that will tell you what kind of fluids your car requires (what weight of oil, for instance), and how to check them. Obviously checking your oil and radiator fluid is important, but don’t forget to glance at brake fluids and power steering reservoirs, which usually have handy markings to let you know when levels are low.

It’s also never a bad idea to carry a little extra of the essential fluids in your trunk. Don’t forget washer fluid, and have a good look under your car to see if it has any leaks. Unless it’s an old British car, in which case leaks are a handy way to know that there’s oil in the engine.

Wipers and lights

Even for a shorter day trip, seeing and being seen are two motoring essentials – as any motorcyclist will tell you. Do a walk-around to make sure your side lights are all functioning, and check your wipers to see if replacement is needed.

One extra tip: set your side mirrors properly. If you can see the side of your car in the mirrors, you’re doing it wrong. Setting them just slightly wider-set helps eliminate blindspots. It’s a simple trick, and motorcyclists will thank you.

Preventative maintenance

The current pandemic might seem like the perfect time to skip on maintenance, and ride things out until calmer times. However, skipping an oil change or belt replacement does come with bigger risks if it strands you. Check with your mechanic to see if they’ve instituted rigorous cleaning procedures, and make sure your car is up to date. You can also consider re-cleaning it yourself when it’s back from the shop.

The simple art of the packed lunch

As someone who grew up with parents who knew money didn’t grow on trees, many of my early childhood road trip memories involve cheese sandwiches. I can happily report that the nostalgia of eating your lunch at an empty pullout at the side of the road still holds up. If your vehicle has a rear spoiler, just think of it as a portable picnic table.

Maps and conditions

Somewhere up between Pemberton and Lillooet, all cellphone service ceases. It’s something of a relief in this day and age to be able to stop for a break and not be bombarded by notifications.

Unless you’ve checked beforehand, however, there’s no guarantee that this particular section of road will be free and easy motoring. Use technology before you leave (I suggest DriveBC.ca for current conditions), and either download a map, print one off, or dig out the old faithful companion that is a proper paper map. The whole point of the exercise is to keep your phone locked away in the glovebox if you can.

Up where the reception is spotty, you’re forced to look up at the looming mountains, and reflect, perhaps, that the uncertainty of the present is only temporary. Pause a moment or two, and drink in that feeling. And be sure to wave to any fellow motorists as you pass. A wave’s as good as a handshake on the road, and in these times, it’s much safer.

173,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-cx-30-brings-mazda3-fun-to-crossover-crowd-1.24102053,REVIEW: CX-30 brings Mazda3 fun to crossover crowd,['Brendan Mcaleer'],,"Not so long ago, you couldn’t move for seeing a Mazda3 hatchback parked on the street or driving by.

Canada’s most popular compact car was the Civic hatchback, but there was still plenty of competition from the sporty little Mazda hatch, which had a little more personality than the Honda.

article continues below

But since then, the automotive landscape has been giving up hatchbacks in general, turning towards crossovers for their higher ride height and theoretical greater practicality. It’s a rising tide that doesn’t raise all ships, as the alternative to buying a compact hatchback means forgoing a compact sedan or hatch entirely. In Mazda’s lineup, that means the CX-5 crossover, a family-sized machine, has become its mainstay vehicle. The CX-3, the smallest crossover the company offers, is a little on the small side, so it’s a big jump up to the ‘5. And, even though the current Mazda3 is the best it’s ever been, that means customers have been shopping elsewhere.

Enter the CX-30, which is essentially a Mazda3 crossover. It’s not any bigger than the ‘3, just taller, and priced about the same. If you’d rather have a lower hatchback for slightly sharper handling, stick with the ‘3. If, however, you’re in the market for a crossover that’s right-sized, with a bit of that Mazda driving charm, then the CX-30 is new best bet.

Design

Over the past couple of years, Mazda’s design language has become the one to beat in the market. While other manufacturers have gone for quantity over quality, especially with faux grille material, Mazda has created a slippery shape that works best on sedans like the Mazda6.

For the CX-30, a little bit of a raised ride height hasn’t hurt the effect at all. Thin LED headlights and taillights anchor a restrained-looking front and rear, with the sides of the car smoothly polished. There aren’t too many angles on the CX-30, and it looks very sharp in a standout colour like the deep red that’s available. Eighteen-inch wheels are standard on mid-level models and above.

Even with a bit of black plastic cladding around the wheel wells to toughen up the stance, the CX-30 looks designed for an urban environment, not a gravel road. Since that’s the place it’ll spend most of its time, that’s not really a drawback. It looks sharp.

Environment

Not much bigger than the Mazda3 on the inside, the CX-30 isn’t something you’ll buy for more space, but rather for the ease of getting in and out of that higher ride height. However, it is more airy in the rear seats, especially compared to the ‘3 hatchback, which has small rear glass.

Everything about the switchgear and instrumentation in the CX-30 has been toned down to be very conventional, and there are no touchscreens. Instead, you get a rotary controller that handles most functions. After a little bit of a learning curve, you can use this without glancing away from the road.

Mazda has also upgraded their vehicles with Apple CarPlay, which is what most owners use for connecting to their smartphones. It’s easy to use, even with Mazda’s proprietary rotary controller.

Beyond that, the CX-30’s interior is comfortable yet also very nicely put together. There’s just enough interior storage, but seems designed to be attractive rather than practical first. As with the exterior, it’s a polished effort.

Performance

Mazda offers turbocharged engines in its larger crossovers, but not in the CX-30. Here, there’s a 2.5-litre four-cylinder engine that makes 186 horsepower and 186 foot-pounds of torque, with a six-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel drive is optional.

There aren’t many tricks here, but what Mazda does offer is a well-tuned driving experience that is so close to the Mazda3 hatchback that most drivers won’t notice any drawback of the greater ride-height. The four-cylinder engine must be stirred up a little for best acceleration, but it’s more than up to the task when asked.

Further, because the CX-30 comes with a well-programmed six-speed automatic, the engine never drones, as sometimes happens with a Continuously Variable Transmission. In top gear, on the highway, the CX-30 is quiet and comfortable, and if you need to pass, the transmission shifts quickly.

Handling and road-holding are better than you’d expect, although come to mention it, that’s Mazda’s cachet. The CX-30 drives 95 per cent as well as the sportiest Mazda3 hatchback, and won’t disappoint anyone who grew up with a ‘3 in their driveway.

Turn-in is sharp, and body roll is well-damped. Overall grip is plentiful, and the CX-30 is really good fun on a backroad. It’s a crossover, yes, but there’s nothing boring about it.

Taken all together, the CX-30 handles all the practical considerations that a modern consumer is looking for, while still being just that little bit more lively to drive. That driving spirit is what made the ‘3 a winner in past years – it should work for the CX-30 too.

Features

At $23,950 to start, the CX-30 is only slightly more expensive than a Mazda3 Sport (the hatchback variant). My GT tester was a healthy $10,000 more expensive, at $33,850, although some of the options it contained were useful considerations like all-wheel drive. The base GS model gets a smaller 155 h.p. engine, and with Apple CarPlay as standard a mid-level CX-30 might be the best choice for power and practicality.

Fuel economy is very consistent, something that’s become a Mazda hallmark. Official figures for the GT all-wheel-drive variant are 9.5 litres/100 kilometres in the city and 7.4 l/100 km on the highway. In real world use, the CX-30 hit these figures easily.

Green light

Sharp handling; good looks; polished inside and out.

Stop sign

No huge advantage over a hatchback; chassis could handle a sportier variant.

The checkered flag

All the joy to drive that made people fall in love with the Mazda3, repackaged for today’s crossover-loving customers.

Competition

Toyota CH-R ($23,650): Smaller than the CX-30, the CH-R is Toyota’s answer to the youth market. It’s priced the same as the CX-30 to start, but the Mazda offers a bit more space, and can be optioned up more to just butt up against the RAV4.

The CH-R is small and a little tinny to drive, where the CX-30 is far more substantial. Toyota is betting that most customers looking for more space might consider the Corolla hatchback, which is a pretty great-driving little car. The CX-30, on the other hand, gives Mazda an offering in its lineup that even the larger manufacturers are missing currently.

Tesla builds its one millionth vehicle

article continues below

As a milestone of how far the company has come, Tesla this week announced the production of its one millionth electric vehicle. The EV in question is a red 2020 Model Y crossover, spec’d out in Performance trim with 21-inch wheels and a few other goodies.

As ever, the announcement was greeted with the usual mix of skepticism and fanfare that accompanies any Tesla broadcast. On one hand, the team of workers that produced this latest machine are to be commended for hitting a major production landmark. On the other hand, Tesla’s financials are still convoluted enough to show that production figures are no indication of long-term viability.

Still, the millionth Tesla milestone provides increased confidence that the Model Y crossover, slated to be the automaker’s first entry in the compact-luxury SUV segment, is on target to begin deliveries this year. The first vehicles out of the factory will be the higher-margin Performance and Long-Range variants. A similarly equipped Model Y to the one shown will cost $86,990 before delivery, or closer to a six-figure price tag if you order the optional $9,200 driver-assist upgrade to Tesla’s Autopilot system.

Mercedes-Benz might bring electric vans to North America

Sold as the Vito in European markets, the Mercedes-Benz Metris is the Sprinter’s little brother, ideally sized for smaller deliveries. To work better in zero-emissions zones in Europe, M-B is offering their Metris as a pure-electric van, as well as diesel and gasoline offerings for longer haul transport.

Currently, the Metris is only available in gasoline-powered form on this side of the water, but Mercedes says it’s considering the business case for the EV variant. While a battery powered Metris would be costly – still the major drawback of EVs – offering emissions-free delivery would be welcome advertising for some companies.

Further, the Metris is a usefully sized vehicle, neither too big nor too small. As plug-in vehicles become more common, the first manufacturer to market with a workable EV van solution will benefit by selling to companies that are waiting for them.

Tiny Toyota Yaris GR costs as much as a Subaru STI

One vehicle we’re very unlikely to see outside of Europe is the Yaris GR. Based on Toyota’s smallest compact car offering, the two-door Yaris GR is actually a rally car for the road, in the tradition of the Subaru STI, or the now-defunct Mitsubishi Lancer EVO.

Essentially, this little all-wheel-drive pocket rocket is the road-going version of the rally cars that Toyota’s racing team fields in World Rally Championship action. And it’s very potent: a 1.6-litre turbocharged three-cyclinder engine produces 268 horsepower (the same output as the current Subaru WRX), and there’s all-wheel drive with limited-slip differentials front and rear.

The cost for all this go-fast tech isn’t cheap, with the top of the range Yaris GR costing just under $60,000 in Canadian money. That’s a lot, especially when there are already cars like the Veloster N, Civic Type R, or, yes, the Subaru WRX available for much less.

Perhaps adjusted for the market pricing, the Yaris GR would make a lot more sense. Either way, it’s still pretty tempting to have that much power in such a small package.

Koenigsegg launches 1,700 h.p. Gemera hybrid

Speaking of three-cylinder engines, the new Koenigsegg supercar is out, and its spec sheet reads like the Swedish company is just making things up. The Gemera is a four-seater coupe with doors that swing straight up, a 2.0-litre three-cylinder engine that makes 600 h.p. and doesn’t have any camshafts, and 1,100 h.p. worth of electric motors to fill out the gap. It’ll sprint to 100 kilometres per hour in 1.9 seconds.

The engine, which Koenigsegg calls the TFG, for Tiny Friendly Giant, is about 20 per cent more efficient than a conventional engine of the same displacement. The company’s Freevalve system offers total control over the exhaust and intake valves, helping keep emissions low. It’ll also run on renewable alcohol, and the whole engine fits in a carry-on suitcase.

While this is all supercar stuff, and not really applicable to anything you might see on the street on a regular basis, the idea of sustainable supercars is becoming less of an oxymoron than it used to be. It’s not the consumption that people are paying for with a Koenigsegg, it’s the technology.

Coronavirus delays launch of Cadillac Lyriq

Cadillac’s new Ultium platform is going to underpin a host of new battery-powered vehicles, as the company looks to get a foothold in the new era of luxury EVs. Unfortunately, 2020 is also the era of a scary new pandemic, and that means that the just-announced Lyriq crossover is already getting pushed back.

The Lyriq was set for its debut on April 2 of this year, but GM has delayed that launch, with no word as to when the rescheduled launch might occur. This move comes after the Geneva International Motor Show was cancelled outright, and the New York International Auto Show was moved to August.

Launches aren’t the only thing that COVID-19 is disrupting in the automotive industry. With supplier networks vulnerable to quarantines and shipping shutdowns, manufacturers are struggling to stay on target.

The Lyriq won’t be the first delay we’ll see caused by coronavirus. But better to be cautious in these times, even when gambling on an all-electric future.

A picture of their Subaru Forester, snapped by the North Vancouver Fire and Rescue Service, was tucked at the bottom of a local news brief discussing a 10-car collision on the Upper Levels highway.

article continues below

Happily, everyone was all right. However, it was certainly not the call I wanted to get when Dad rang me up to say that they’d been rear-ended by no fewer than four other cars, all wedged together in a chain reaction.

I have to say, after things had calmed down, I had a bit of pride in what that picture said. Alone of the cars in the shot, my folks’ Subaru was the only one without any damage to the front. My dad is in his 70s, and no longer has the reflexes he once did in his motorcycle-riding youth. He does, however, still retain some of the lessons he learned back then. He knows to leave a bit of space in case the unexpected happens.

Regrettably, in today’s age, that skill is something of a lost art. When I was in driver training, the rule of thumb was to leave approximately a three second gap between you and the car in front of you. It’s easy to measure if you’re actually doing so: simply pick a lamp-post or cat’s eye on the road, and count how many seconds it takes you to reach it after the car ahead has passed.

You’d be surprised at how big of a gap three seconds is at highway speeds. At the 80 kilometre per hour speed limit on the highway up around Lonsdale (which most people don’t religiously adhere to, it must be said), three seconds is enough time to cover about 65 metres. That’s well more than half a football field.

Let’s say you did nothing else other than maintain this gap, and the car in front of you suddenly stopped instantly. According to data from Car and Driver, the average full-size pickup truck – hardly the best performing thing on the road – can stop from 112 km/h (70 mph) in about 60 m. Thus, if you were leaving enough distance in front, even a Chevy Silverado should be able to stop.

The problem is two-fold. First, modern traffic abhors a vacuum. Second, following too closely is a hard habit to break.

Also last week, I spent some time at the headquarters of Damon Motorcycles, a Vancouver-based electric superbike startup that’s looking to revolutionize motorcycling. Their bike, the Hypersport, is mind-bendingly fast, but that’s not what’s interesting about it.

The Hypersport is, uniquely among motorcycles, equipped with most of the advanced driving systems we’re starting to see on cars these days. These include blind-spot monitoring, side-traffic alert, and a simple system to let a rider know if they’re following too closely.

Everyone at Damon is an experienced rider, with years of riding on the track and street, and they all said that it was pretty easy to get sloppy and start tailgating a bit too closely, over-relying on their reflexes. The safety alert systems didn’t replace rider inputs, they just aimed to give the motorcyclist a bit more time to avoid an accident.

That extra time is something that you can create yourself, by leaving just that little bit more space. However, there’s a problem. Odds are, if you leave a gap, some other entitled driver is going to think it’s a special space just for them, and slide right in front of you. Adjust again, and here comes someone else. It can get frustrating.

Until such time as Transport Canada approves my hood-mounted combination spatula/car-catapult, there aren’t really any solutions for dealing with motorists helping themselves to your space. You just have to remember that you’re leaving the buffer there for your benefit, not theirs.

And you shouldn’t just be leaving a space in front. Another lesson drummed into my head during driver training was to always look for an escape route. If traffic suddenly slows ahead, are you keeping a gap to your left or right that you could move into in the event of an emergency? Modern braking and stability systems are all well and good, but they still can’t touch a human brain with situational awareness for keeping people safe.

It’s probably never been more important to develop these skills, and they’re the kind of things you can work on every day. Here’s why: reporting from Global News, also focusing on events from last week, said that the Burnaby RCMP had seen a 50 per cent failure rate from their recent commercial vehicle safety blitz. The result were 147 trucks deemed not road safe.

Those are just the vehicles that the Commercial Vehicle Safety team caught. When a heavy truck is involved in a collision, especially plowing into a line of cars, things get very serious, very fast.

So, keep your eyes up, and watch farther down the road than just the car ahead of you. Make space for yourself, both to the front and the sides, to buy yourself a little extra time for when you need it. And give trucks an extra-wide berth. Professional truck drivers will appreciate the extra respect, and either way taking a bit of extra care is a smart move.

Taken all together, this advice should be enough to keep you out of the body shop for years to come. And, more importantly, out of the newspaper.

176,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-here-s-a-relatively-practical-porsche-911-1.24089033,REVIEW: Here’s a (relatively) practical Porsche 911,['Brendan Mcaleer'],,"One consistent request from readers is to feature more cars that are pragmatic commuters, priced reasonably, that are also efficient and sensible to own.

Yet what is life without a little spice sprinkled in?

article continues below

Here, then, for your consideration, is the new Porsche 911 cabriolet. Yes, this is a bit of a lottery-win car, at $125,600 for the base convertible, but it is at least a practical dream. Sort of. If you squint.

Compared to other high-end sports cars (such as the Audi R8), the 911 has always offered a certain amount of everyday usability. All-wheel drive is available, and there are rear seats with which to ferry around your kids. Why, it’s practically just a Volkswagen GTI. Sort of. If you squint.

So, when one arrived in the midst of our latest flurry of snowy weather on proper winter tires, I elected to find out just how good Porsche’s latest flagship vehicle is at fulfilling all the pragmatic duties of a daily driver – without that annoying detail of a reasonable price tag. If not for practical consumer advice, then for the fun of it.

Design

You may be forgiven for thinking that Porsche’s design team has been using their computers to play solitaire instead of getting any actual work done for the last several decades. The 911’s shape has evolved, but there has been no radical restyling.

Certainly that’s the case here, with the 992-era Porsche 911. That first little three-letter code is what all Porsche fans use as shorthand for the generations of car. For example, the 993 was the last of the air-cooled cars in the 1990s, the 991 is the previous generation that this new car replaces, and the 996 is the one with the slightly wonky-looking front end that’s relatively affordable these days.

Viewed front-on, the new car is a bit more gawp-mouthed than the previous one, and most of the sheet metal changes are very minor. The new rear end incorporates a strip of LEDs and a much larger deployable rear spoiler. Park next to a 991 and it’s a spot-the-differences puzzle, but the new 911 doesn’t make any waves.

Which, happily, it’s not supposed to. Porsche enthusiasts want more power, more features, and better handling, but they’re otherwise resistant to change. The new 911s look a lot like the old ones, because that was always the plan.

Environment

Back a couple of decades ago, a Porsche interior was quite spartan. Even the most luxurious Turbo models were very businesslike, and the new 911 modernizes that ethos.

The spartan interior of the 911 features a wide touchscreen, while the seats and ergonomics are all set up to enhance the drive without sacrificing comfort. photo Porsche

An AMG GT coupe has a lot more theatre than you find here. The 911 keeps things simple with a sprinkling of LED screens that replace some of the characteristic gauges, and with a centre console that has a wide touchscreen.

There are fewer buttons for a cleaner look, and an odd, stubby shifter. We’ll come back to this. As is Porsche tradition, the cupholder is a bit of an afterthought, while the seats and the ergonomics are all about the drive.

Taken all together, this cockpit is going to be a bit of an adjustment for Porsche fans. It doesn’t quite have the clean, cohesive, and timeless feel of previous cars. It is, however, very comfortable, fulfilling the 911’s mission as a grand tourer.

Performance

On the long road up to Pemberton, the new 911 excelled at its grand touring role. The car feels absolutely solid at normal speeds, which is what you’d expect from a machine designed to blitz the autobahn.

The 911 cabriolet has a clean look accented by an odd, stubby shifter. photo Porsche

A new eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox shifts very quickly upwards to keep the flat-six engine whispering along at low revs. Most people don’t expect a 911 to be an efficient proposition, but Porsche’s coupe has long combined a slippery aerodynamic shape with long gears to make for a great highway cruiser.

In standard mode, the 911’s suspension also absorbs bumps well, and, despite the convertible top, is quiet at speed. The steering is well weighted but perhaps a bit distant, cruising up the Sea to Sky. This is, again, all about the programming.

Waking the car up in the twisty sections is all about pressing the correct button (in this case, Sport). Porsche used to put their drive mode controls on the wheel, with a little button you could hit for a brief squirt of performance. The new control button is on the dashboard, and is just as easy to toggle.

In Sport, it’s a different car. Shifts are much quicker and more aggressive, and the car turns in sharply. Grip is of course abundant, and there’s far more speed than you could actually use on the road.

It’s less playful than a Boxster or a Cayman, but there’s still some tactile fun to be had here. The 991, when it debuted, was a less interesting car to drive. The 992, despite all the electronic improvements under the skin, feels more engaging.

Dash display. photo Porsche

The twin-turbo flat-six displaces 3.0-litres and produces 443 horsepower at a peak of 6,500 r.p.m., and 390 foot-pounds of torque. It’s got plenty of low-end shove to handle the GT portion of the job, but sings rather loudly when you’re winding it up into the higher sections of the rev range.

What Porsche has done here is both sharpened and softened their car. Especially as a cabriolet, the 911 does an even better job of being a cocoon to take you out to where the good driving roads are, and then transforming into a more exhilarating experience when you get there.

Features

As mentioned, we’re into six figures by the time you start looking at a 911, and in Porsche world, adding options requires opening your wallet. As an S model with a handful of niceties, this week’s tester hit the register for more than $170,000. Not quite win-the-lottery-twice, but certainly your birthday and Christmas presents combined.

Fuel economy is very good for this class of car. Official figures for the dual-clutch PDK model are 12.7 litres/100 kilometres in the city and 10.2 l/100 km on the highway. Even with cold conditions and a bit of squeezing the throttle, the 911 actually bettered its highway mileage rating slightly. It’s an economy car! Sort of. If you squint.

Green light

Seats four; comfortable for touring; plenty of performance.

Stop sign

Big price tag; interior doesn’t feel special; maximum autobahn performance doesn’t quite translate to Canadian road limits.

The checkered flag

What’s the Ferris Bueller line? “If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.”

Competition

Audi R8 Spyder ($201,400): The Audi R8 is a Lamborghini that you can get for only – let me just check here – pretty much what a Lamborghini costs actually. There aren’t many mid-level luxury brand cars that can make a 911 look like a bargain, but the R8 perhaps does so.

And it’s less practical, with only seating for two. Having said that, it’s also a bit more of a theatrical performer, and a lot more exciting to look at than the 911. Yet also less practical for everyday use.

Let’s call it a win for the Porsche as the pragmatic choice. There you go: lots of helpful consumer advice found here.

177,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-mercedes-makes-a-world-class-little-wagon-1.24083263,REVIEW: Mercedes makes a world-class little wagon,['David Chao'],,"While the C-Class has always been a top compact vehicle for Mercedes-Benz – often beating BMW’s 3 Series and Audi’s A4 in comparison tests – it’s the AMG-influenced C43s and C63s that are the true stars in the lineup.

These higher performance vehicles have created a niche in the same way the “M” series (for BMW) and “S” or “RS” series (for Audi) have in the ever competitive performance market. While many people might still associate BMW as the “driver’s car,” it’s actually Mercedes these days that seems to provide all around better performance.

article continues below

In fact, driving the BMW, Audi and Mercedes back to back reveals that the sweet spot in this market is the Mercedes C43, because it has just the right amount of performance and features for a surprisingly reasonable price, at least for a so-called performance segment.

Even more intriguing is the fact that the C43 wagon is only offered in Canada and not the U.S. – likely because Canadians don’t mind purchasing wagons while Americans seems to avoid them like the plague.

Yes you can also buy the significantly more expensive C63s but personally, I find that the C43 is the better day-to-day vehicle that provides performance without sacrificing comfort and refinement. The C63 is all-powerful, but it’s awkward to drive in the traffic-heavy towns and cities we live in.

The C43’s dashboard is modern and sleek, featuring a large touchscreen and excellent sound system. photo Mercedes-Benz

If you are wondering why anyone would buy the C43 wagon over the GLC 43 sport utility vehicle (which shares the similar platform), it’s because the lower and more stable C43 actually performs better than the taller GLC 43. The GLC 43 might offer more space here and there, but the C43 wagon is the winner here. The C43 also comes in a coupe format, but our focus of the review is the sedan and the wagon.

Design and features

The styling is showing its age but the C43 lineup is still a handsome bunch. The C43 comes with a special AMG-style front grille and air intake system. The rear of the vehicle offers a quad-tip exhaust system and if you opt for the sedan, there is also a small and inconspicuous spoiler.

The 2020 AMG C43 is all about personalization: a new 64-colour ambient lighting system is a great example of this.

Along with the signature AMG instrumentation, the dashboard is modern and sleek. Rocker switches replace most buttons in the console and the infotainment system is a generous 10.5-inch size. The Burmester sound system offers amazing sound and audio quality.

The cargo capacity in the back of the wagon version is quite good: between 460 litres and 1,480 litres when the back seats are folded down.

Standard in the AMG C43 are a number of safety features including Crosswind Assist, Blind Spot Assist, Attention Assist, Active Brake Assist, Vehicle Exit Warning, multiple air bags and something known as Pre-Safe. Pre-Safe is a feature that will detect when a rollover or collision is imminent, and act to create to avoid injury. This includes tightening of the front seatbelts, closing the windows and sunroof and adjusting the passenger seats.

Performance

The 2020 AMG C43 is a vehicle that is designed specifically for driving performance. The C43 sedan is a wonderful model but once again, I am drawn to the unique C43 wagon.

One of the main benefits of a wagon over an SUV is the lower centre of gravity – a wagon will provide much better handling in similar circumstances. Speaking of a lower centre of gravity, the ground clearance for the C43 is just under nine centimetres or 3.5 inches, meaning the vehicle sits precariously close to the ground.

The AMG C43’s bi-turbo 3.0-litre V-6 engine creates an impressive 385 horsepower and 384 foot-pounds of torque. The engine is punchy, responsive and can accelerate the car from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour in just 4.8 seconds. Paired to the engine is a nine-speed AMG Speedshift TCT transmission with shift paddles that can downshift multiple gears with a double-click of the paddle.

There are multiple drive modes including Comfort, Slippery and Sport+, as well as a personalized mode the driver can set up individually. Driving the AMG C43 around curves is easy thanks to adaptive damping and the suspension that incorporates three-stage electronically-manoeuvred shock absorbers.

The 2020 AMG C43 is reasonably lightweight (1,760 kilograms) and corners exceptionally well thanks to a 69 per cent rear-axle torque bias. The brakes on this vehicle feature large, 360-millimetre multi-piston front calipers that help spread out the heat of braking.

Overall, the Audi S4 compares favorably but the C43 feels more updated and advanced. The BMW 3 Series may have been the standard in earlier years, but these days the 3 Series struggles from steering feel that is disconnected from the driver.

Fuel economy for the C43 is 8.9 litres/100 kilometres for highway driving and 12.4 l/100 km for the city. The limited warranty that comes with the C43 also only covers four years, or 80,000 km.

Summary

The starting price for the 2020 Mercedes-Benz AMG C43 sedan is $59,900, and the wagon lists at $60,900. While there are no additional trim levels, add-ons quickly bring up the total price on both models.

The premium package alone is an extra $5,900 but adds 17 additional features including foot-activated tailgate, keyless entry, 360 degree camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Active Parking assist as well as others. Heads-up display costs a cool $1,500, while adding on climate comfort seats will set you back another $1,200. The Intelligent Drive Package with safety features will cost $2,700.

I’m in love with the C43 wagon, but wagon or sedan, the C43 delivers performance and smoothness that are truly world-class.

That last may surprise you, but the General is a wonderful palate-cleanser to the sea of misinformation and uninformed opinion you find on the internet.

article continues below

His preferred phrase? When asked what his favourite aircraft is, he always bluntly answers: “Depends on the mission.”

Get on the internet to ask what’s the best green car for your needs, and some stranger with a Tesla symbol as their avatar is going to insist that buying anything other than a Model 3 is a huge mistake. Immediately after that, three people will post rebuttals, with articles shrieking that all EVs are built by exploited babies in far-off lands. You’re going to hear a lot of nonsense from all sides.

Do you drive on the highway, or take lots of short trips? Answering these questions helps narrow down your choices. photo Brendan McAleer

So, cut through the noise with Yeager’s maxim. What’s the best car to reduce your carbon footprint and ease your fuel bill? That, too, depends on the mission.

Conventional hybrid

First, and easiest, there’s the choice of switching to a car with a conventional hybrid powertrain. Vancouverites can take a bit of pride in our little footnote in hybrid history, as the first Prius taxi went into service here years ago.

First, the bad news. All the energy that moves a conventional hybrid around comes from fossil fuels. You put gas in the tank, and an internal combustion engine burns it, creating forward momentum, yet also greenhouse gases.

Where the hybrid shines is in taking that precious momentum, and conserving it. Instead of standard steel brakes, which convert inertia into heat, the regenerative brakes of something like a Prius work like miniature generators. Energy is sucked back up and used to charge an onboard battery pack.

Classic hybrids charge their batteries with regenerative braking, while EVs get all their juice from a chord. Plug-in hybrids offer a little bit of both. photo Brendan McAleer

Next, that battery pack discharges its energy into an electric motor, to help get you going again. A hybrid doesn’t stop you burning fuel, but it does make sure you don’t waste a drop of it.

Besides increased fuel efficiency, a conventional hybrid has a couple of advantages. Those regenerative brakes need less servicing, as they’re not burning up brake pads. As the battery packs are smaller than in a full electric vehicle, the environmental cost of manufacturing a hybrid is lessened – and so is the price tag.

And, lastly, you don’t really need to change much about your driving habits to own a hybrid. You can store them outside, don’t need to plug them in, and never need to worry about running out of electricity. Note, however, that a hybrid works best in stop-and-go traffic. City fuel economy is often better than highway, where those regenerative brakes aren’t doing much.

While the odd-looking Prius led the way, there are now conventional hybrids from many manufacturers, and all of them represent fuel savings over a normal car. However, why pay for fuel at all?

Electric vehicle (EV)

The joy of not having to make any trips to the gas station is the argument made by most electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts. In the Lower Mainland, where commute distances are relatively short, a plug-in car might work for you. Most models offer more than 200 kilometres of range, with mid-level mainstream EVs offering up to nearly 400 km of range. That’s more than enough for most consumers.

Besides ignoring fluctuating fuel prices altogether, EVs require even less maintenance than a hybrid. The difference between an internal combustion engine and the relatively few moving parts of an electric vehicle is akin to the difference between the workings of a Swiss watch or a plain ol’ Timex bargain. You’ve got a battery pack and an electric motor, and a plug. That’s it.

No matter what green auto option you choose, you know that you are going to save money at the pumps compared to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. photo Brendan McAleer

As with hybrids, some consumers do have concerns about battery packs. These are expensive to replace, and most of us associate battery-powered appliances with the longevity of our smartphones. Those seem to work fine for a while, but after a couple of years, they’re running out of charge in less than a day.

As most Canadian consumers own their cars for at least eight years, battery longevity is a bit of a boogeyman. Happily, the evidence doesn’t really support these fears. As an example, the Nissan Leaf is the best-selling consumer EV on the market, and very few have needed battery replacement in the decade it’s been on sale.

Even if you did need to buy a new battery down the road, the cost of replacing a battery has come down in recent years. Swapping out a tired battery for a refurbished unit will improve the range and extend the useful life of the car, and replacement unit costs line right up against major recommended internal-combustion maintenance requirements like replacing water pumps and timing belts.

There are two other concerns with EVs. First, winter conditions do tend to sap range. If you’re parking your EV indoors in a garage, the cold soak is less of a concern, but you will see reduced range in cold conditions. As with a gasoline car, it’s rare to get the maximum range.

The other hurdle is cost. EVs are expensive, even the mainstream models. Currently, large provincial and federal rebates defray these costs, although that does lead to large initial depreciation.

Plug-in hybrid (PHEV)

Wedged between pure EVs and conventional hybrids are the plug-in hybrids (PHEV). These are just as you’d expect: a conventional hybrid layout with a slightly larger battery pack.

Plug-in hybrids require similar maintenance as a regular hybrid, and they don’t have the maximum range of a pure EV. However, for those with even medium-length commutes, a plug-in hybrid offers the best of both worlds.

There are more options than ever when it comes to choosing a green vehicle. photo Brendan McALeer

On one hand, the shorter all-electric range of a PHEV might be enough to get you to and from work without burning a drop of fuel. Planning on heading out of town, and not sure you’ll be able to plug-in when you get to your destination? Not to worry – a PHEV can function with no more thought than a conventional hybrid.

As infrastructure improves to support EVs and PHEVs, plug-in vehicles will likely rise in popularity. The electric sound barrier, so to speak, has already been broken, and electrified automobiles of all three kinds will continue to join the mainstream.

A dependable hybrid crossover that doesn’t require an extra thought? A compact EV for your urban commute? Or perhaps a PHEV that’ll become the new, eco-friendly family workhorse.

Which one is best for you will depend on your specific needs, but all have their advantages. So, what’s your mission?

The consensus has been almost universally positive, praising the e’s clever packaging, small turning circle, and zippy electrified powertrain.

article continues below

Yes, there has been a complaint or two about the name. “What are you driving?”

“A Honda e.”

“A Honda-y what?”

And so on.

Silly name aside, the e is a wonderful looking car that’s remarkably close to its concept. The production version is a little larger, with a four-door hatchback layout rather than the sporty three-door that graced the stage as a forward-looking concept in 2017.

Still, to go from new concept to realized production car and retain almost all of the characteristics of the former is pretty unheard of. At least on the exterior, the e is a knockout, with rounded, friendly features. It looks a bit like the futuristic probe-robot that Wall-E falls in love with in the eponymous Pixar movie.

There is, however, one rather large problem with the Honda e, and one that will likely prevent it from arriving in our market. That problem is price.

The Honda e’s 200 kilometre range might not be perfect for all customers, but it is probably more than enough for most daily commutes. photo Honda

The e’s 200 kilometre range might not be perfect for all customers, but is probably more workable than most people would expect. The vast majority of commutes are short enough that the e would easily be able to do them in a round trip, along with the grocery shop, and then silently charge up at night.

It’s not the range, it’s the premium you’ll pay for a small, electrified vehicle. Before rebates, the e will cost the equivalent of $49,000.

That’s a lot. If you feel like the prices of vehicles have been shooting up recently, you’re not alone. Buoyed by cheap credit and long loan times, a wave of crossovers has put many people into more car debt than they can really handle.

Instead of buying an inexpensive sedan or hatchback, many people buy a larger crossover, because it feels safer and rides higher. Designers, encouraged by the added sheet metal to work with, increasingly make these crossovers aggressive to look at. Your average parking lot these days is a sea of gaping grilles and fake plastic fender vents.

Obviously, a nearly-$50,000 electric hatchback that’s only sold in Europe isn’t going to change that. However, the level of interest that the public has shown in the e indicates that maybe there’s an untapped market here.

Buyers are a bit fickle when it comes to retro design and cars that don’t look like they want to murder you. It makes manufacturers skittish. This year, the Golf-based VW Beetle is being discontinued, and Fiat is pulling their 500 out of North American markets. The profits just aren’t there.

However, perhaps that’s because both Fiat and VW have left their designs to sort of wither on the vine instead of refreshing them. The Honda e, on the other hand, is a far more futuristic take on motoring, rather than a look back over its shoulder. Yes, there’s a family resemblance to the Honda Civic, but this isn’t a throwback.

Personally, I think that even with that high price point, the Honda e might actually sell in limited numbers here. Especially in Vancouver, there’s a huge demand for EVs, and the rebates would defray the costs somewhat.

But why can’t Honda take the fancy dashboard-wide screens out of the e, de-content all but the most necessary features, and fit the powertrain out of the Insight hybrid? What if we could have something that looked like the e, but cost about as much as a modestly equipped Civic sedan?

The e looks like a premium product, but it’s not traditionally luxurious in the sense of being large, imposing, and loaded up with leather seats and the like. Instead, it’s a friendly-looking car that appears to be happy when it’s driving. Why can’t they build something like that for the rest of us?

There is a huge disconnect between the way that all environment and efficiency friendly vehicles (the Prius, Clarity, etc) all seem to have been designed to be weirdly futuristic, and how angry most of our regular cars look. We need more cars like the Honda e, which make driving a small car look appealing again.

It worked when BMW brought back the Mini in the early 2000s. There were huge waits for the car, even though it was a pricey and oft-times unreliable homage to the original. If a car was available that looked like the e, but offered the same price and ease-of-operation as your average Honda compact car, it’d be a smash success.

In the meantime, we’ve got to wait while manufacturers look at how Honda’s e performs in the market. It could end up inspiring a new generation of more friendly looking cars, or it could be just a drop in the bucket as factories continue to churn out huge-grilled pickup trucks.

I’d like to be optimistic about it. The interest that people show in the looks of something like the Suzuki Jimny or Honda e mean that we’re still interested in small cars. With many people concerned about reducing their carbon footprint, there’s further demand for something smaller that treads more lightly.

It’s just that, at the present time, most of the small vehicles available today look like bland or angry pods, instead of a friendly companion. I’d argue that your car should make you smile when you look at it. Maybe if our cars were friendlier, we’d be nicer on the roads too.

Once a groundbreaking vehicle with impeccable green credentials, its reputation has been overshadowed by the rise of all-electric vehicles. At the same time, increased customer interest in crossovers means that the Prius lost market share in the same way most hatchbacks have.

article continues below

In order to broaden the interest in their Prius, Toyota has decided to give the little hybrid a bit of a boost. No, not in power output – that’s not really in the Prius mission statement. Instead, the Prius now comes with optional all-wheel drive, for a bit more winter practicality.

And I do mean a bit. This all-wheel-drive system is only available at speeds below 70 kilometres per hour, and consists of an electric motor that produces around 7 horsepower. Not a typo: seven.

The question is, why would you bother with a system of such modest capability when you could just get a good set of snow tires instead? To find out, let’s head out into our current wet and squishy winter conditions and see if this new all-wheel-drive system is going to give the Prius better traction among buyers.

Design

Never the most attractive car, various generations of the Prius have looked either bland or a little over-styled. This current model is a toned-down version of the latest generation’s angular looks, and is still something of an acquired taste.

Having said that, there’s no mistaking the Prius for any kind of other vehicle, and perhaps that’s the point. It doesn’t have a huge (fake) grille, like most of the rest of Toyota’s model lineup, and doesn’t appear aggressive in the least.

Yes, it looks a bit catfish-y, but at least the Prius is friendly. LED headlights keep the styling looking fresh, and the overall hatchback profile hints at the practicality contained therein.

Environment

Being a top of the range Technology-trim model ($33,450), this week’s tester had a standout feature that immediately drew the eye. Dominating the dash, a huge touchscreen added a bit of Tesla-style futurism to the Prius’ interior.

Well, sort of. The Toyota’s screen isn’t quite as tablet-like as you’d find in any Tesla. On the plus side, it’s bright and easy to read, and feels like it should last, as you’d expect from any Toyota product.

Some changes to the interior trim make the Prius a little more conventional-looking inside, with no more white shiny plastic between the seats. Those seats are very comfortable, and the Prius continues to feel spacious and airy inside.

The seat coverings are synthetic leather, which will be hard-wearing if not quite luxurious. Combined with a large hatchback trunk, the Prius is still a great choice for pet owners.

The all-wheel-drive system might be modestly powered, but it is also so small that Toyota has been able to package it so as not to intrude on interior space. You get the same amount of room in an e-AWD Prius as you do in the standard car. That means 697 litres of space, plenty for most owners.

Performance

Because of the way electric motors stack with gasoline engines to produce power, the Prius e-AWD is no quicker than its normal sibling. With just 121 h.p. on tap, it’s one of the slower cars out there.

An all-wheel-drive option gives the Toyota Prius a little more capability for winter driving. photo Toyota

Still, the torque of the electric motors does mean that the Prius has some off-the-line scoot. And, with all-wheel drive helping you get all that twisting power to the tarmac, the e-AWD variant is at least nicely quick off the line in an urban environment. You might wish for a little more power when passing on the highway, but for around town it’s just fine.

Don’t expect any handling improvements from the all-wheel-drive system. More complex offerings elsewhere combine the torque-vectoring capability of electric motors to allow better turn-in, and a more nimble feel. The Prius e-AWD comes with better low-end off-the-line grip, and that’s it.

However, handling prowess was never the point of the Prius, which remains a quiet, secure, and low-effort place to spend your commute. The little bit of extra low-speed grip is just a nice bit of added security. For the Technology models, the AWD system costs a paltry $500 extra, and barely affects the fuel economy.

Basically, this variant of Prius is the same recipe of fuel-savings without needing any special ownership requirements, just with a bit of added grip to get out of a slippery parking lot, or home during a freak snow storm. It’s not ground-breaking technology by any means, but does make the Prius an even more sensible choice.

Features

The basic Prius e-AWD starts at $28,990, with heated seats, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, and 15-inch alloy wheels. Because Apple CarPlay is standard, you might not need anything else. The Technology package adds the bigger touchscreen, synthetic leather, and the nicety of a heated steering wheel.

Fuel economy results, as you’d expect, are great. Official figures for the CVT model are 4.4 litres/100 kilometres in the city and 4.9 l/100 km on the highway. Even with the cold starts and slushy conditions, the Prius e-AWD returned a steady 5.0 l/100 km in mixed real-world use.

Green light

Practical hatchback; comfortable, roomy interior; easy to own.

Stop sign

Very basic AWD functions; large touchscreen more flash than function; still quite slow.

The checkered flag

The best all-round, all-weather Prius you can get.

Competition

Hyundai Konda Electric ($44,999): Here’s the type of thing the Prius is up against. The Konda EV might be more expensive in terms of price tag, but big federal and provincial rebates shrink that gap to even-stevens.

Want something practical with a higher hip-point for ease of entry and better sightlines? The Kona EV is it.

Yes, owning an EV isn’t as much of a no-brainer as a hybrid that you can refuel anywhere. However, the Kona’s 415-km range is easily up to 90 per cent of commutes out there, and charging infrastructure is becoming more common. If anything, it’s the lack of supply that’s going to be the issue, not a lack of demand.

The Envision does offer an edge because of its affordable pricing – and it’s actually a fine vehicle in many ways – but it’s difficult to convince finicky buyers to buy a Buick over cars like the Acura RDX, Lexus NX or Lincoln MKC.

article continues below

As well, the Buick Envision has seen some controversy over the fact that it is an American-branded vehicle that is produced in China. So it’s actually a reverse import in some ways, but in any case not much has changed since the 2019 refresh that saw a new grille, a new stop/start engine, and a nine-speed automatic transmission.

Design

The exterior design is refined, elegant and sporty. Standard LED-accented headlights and taillights give a distinctive look, and no one would have guessed that this is a Buick.

The Buick Envision has seating for up to five, and for larger passengers, the second row can be pushed back to provide an additional seven inches, or 178 millimetres, of legroom. Still, the narrow body frame of the Envision may make it difficult for broad-shouldered adult passengers to sit comfortably in the back seats.

As far as the interior goes, a major advantage is the quiet cabin. This is thanks to its QuietTuning technology that offers active noise cancellation through acoustic laminated glass and triple door seals. Soft-touch materials are used throughout the cabin to give an upscale feel, though it’s no match for some of the newer offerings from Acura and Lexus. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are both offered and the interior is clean and simply styled.

For safety, the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety gave the Buick Envision a good rating for each test conducted. Some notable safety features include the Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates the driver’s seat on one side to alert the driver for important safety notifications (supposedly more noticeable than audible alerts). As well, a Rear Seat Reminder lets the driver know to check for children and valuables in the rear seat before leaving the car. There are many more safety features that are standard or optional in the car.

Performance

A standard 2.5-litre engine gives 197 horsepower and 192 foot-pounds of torque. Paired with this engine is a six-speed automatic transmission. If you wish for more power, opt for the Premium or Premium II trim where the engine is upgraded to a 252 horsepower 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder spark ignition direct injection (SIDI) with 295 foot-pounds of torque. Paired with the Turbo engine is an optional nine-speed automatic transmission that is smooth and refined.

The car is actually quite peppy and feels engaging for a luxury SUV. Once again, the level of refinement falls short of Asian competitors but the Buick does offer more luxury and sportier feel than some domestic rivals.

The fuel economy for the 2.5-litre engine is 11.1 litres/100 kilometres in the city and 8.6 l/100 km on the highway. The fuel economy with the 2.0-litre turbo engine is 11.7 l/100 km in the city and 9.4 l/100 km on the highway, not as impressive as with other competitors. Unfortunately, the car also requires premium fuel.

Summary

Buick offers four trim levels: Preferred, Essence, Premium and Premium II. Essence brings additional features such as heated rear seats, blind-spot monitors, roof rack, heated steering wheel, rear-seat climate control as well as perforated leather seats. Premium adds on a more powerful engine as well as safety assist features. Finally, Premium II offers heads-up display, heated/cooled front row seats, all-wheel drive, and better GPS navigation. All-wheel drive is standard.

The Envision's exterior design is refined, elegant and sporty. photo supplied, Buick

Pricing for the Envision is very affordable for the market: $38,548 MSRP for the base level Preferred trim, increasing up to $46,098 for the Premium II trim.

With lots of features and options, the Buick Envision provides a great value. Overall, the vehicle delivers a very comfortable and quiet ride with many good driving characteristics.

Moving forward, Buick will introduce another SUV in the form of Encore GX, joining the existing Envision, Encore and Enclave models. They show off similar design elements, which are sharp looking and futuristic at the same time. You can expect more changes in the future, though, as all car companies begin to electrify their lineups and Buick is no exception to that trend.

I would say, however, that if you are looking for bargains and you have some fond memories of the Buick brand from the past, this could be your ticket. Buick dealers are likely incentivized to offer lots of discounts on this car because of its low popularity.

U.K. man overdoes the air freshener, explodes car

article continues below

Ever got into a friend’s car that was absolutely reeking of air freshener? You know the kind, with an old growth forest of those smelly trees hanging off the rearview mirror, and a persistent fug of Febreeze doing essentially nothing to disguise that the seat cushions are thoroughly impregnated with dog flatulence.

One such fellow, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, decided that his Seat Leon was so smelly that nothing but a concentrated blast of air freshener would to the trick. Apparently, the man was a smoker, which may have been the issue.

Having successfully filled the cabin of his hatchback with what must have been a barely-breathable atmosphere, our intrepid freshener-fan reclined and lit a cigarette. Well, he shouldn't have.

The car promptly exploded, blowing out windows and doors, and even damaging nearby businesses. It's safe to laugh, by the way, because the driver was miraculously unharmed.

Land Rover buys Bowler

No, not a hat. It'd be a pretty slow news week for that to make headlines.

Instead, we're talking about Bowler the aftermarket tuning company that makes some of the fiercest Land Rover products out there. Examples include the Wildcar, which is essentially the original Defender turned into a near-indestructible rally car.

Bowler's been around for more than three decades, but like many aftermarket companies, finances have been shaky. Particularly in the current economic uncertainty in Britain, it was beginning to look like Land Rover fans were going to need to doff their hats as Bowler was hung up on the peg for a last time.

Instead, Jaguar Land Rover has given every company member a job, and is currently figuring out how to slot Bowler-tuned vehicles into their lineup. Both Range Rover and Land Rover have been pushing into tarmac performance hard with their SVO creations, so there's certainly room for a tougher, more off-roady Land Rover that's still got performance chops.

Think of a well-bred Ford Raptor or Jeep Rubicon, and there you have it. Simply pop on a Bowler, and head off into the wild unknown, like Poirot on methamphetamines.

BMW says its customers want enormous grilles

In a previous column on pedestrian safety, I pointed out how ridiculous most cars look these days, with huge, aggressive grilles that supply far more air than is actually need for cooling. Most of them are just for show, and the show is horrendous.

However, at least according to BMW, the trend is unlikely to change. Speaking to Autocar magazine in the U.K., BMW VP Peter Heinrich said that the brand's customers are “not afraid of vehicles with strong characters. They are looking for it. So, we have decided to focus even more on strong characters and bold designs.”

By that, Heinrich meant that BMW's most recent concept, which looks like a cross between a mole-rat and a hair-dryer, was probably going to signal the look of the next BMW 4 Series and possibly 3 Series.

If you grew up liking BMW, this obsession with grilles is a shame. The brand's styling was arguably at its best when the cars were a little more subtle, like the E39 M5 of the early 2000s. BMWs were friendly, and likable, and you could walk down to the garage in the morning and not scream involuntarily when you saw them. Sadly, not any more.

Honda shows off customized S2000

At the Tokyo Auto Salon, scheduled for February, Honda will be showing off a S2000 prototype. Wait. Didn't they stop making that thing years ago?

They did! But that doesn't mean Honda fans don't still love the S2000. In many ways, Honda's little two-seat roadster was the best thing they ever made, with a sky-high redline for its four-cylinder engine, and sharp handling. Later models got a bit more torque for ease of driving, but both editions are great.

Honda doesn't currently have anything like the S2000, either on sale or in the works. However, by way of paying tribute to the 20th anniversary of the car, they're bringing an accessorized version to the Tokyo Auto Salon. Painted grand prix white and fitted with red seats, this S2000 looks great, and is a far cry from the occasionally overwrought tuner stuff you can get from some Japanese marques. It even has reasonably-sized 17-inch wheels.

A sports car is never going to be a hot-seller, and in this market, Honda's probably better off focusing their R&D budget on crossovers and EVs. However, I wouldn't say no to a new S2000 if they kept it small, snappy, and light.

Car2Go is Car 2 Gone

Share Now, the company that formerly operated as Car2Go, has announced that they're shutting down North American operations as of Feb. 29 of next year. The move will no doubt frustrate many Vancouverites who've grown to depend on the service.

The company cites rising costs and a lack of infrastructure for EV sharing as major stumbling blocks to the viability of car sharing. They plan to still operate in 18 European cities.

In our market, this does leave a gap for others such as EVO or Modo to expand into. Further, with the arrival of ride-hailing/sharing services like Lyft, getting around the Lower Mainland shouldn't get too much harder.

Still, Car2Go will be missed. It was pretty much the only application where the Smart car actually started to make sense.

183,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-hyundai-venue-offers-genuine-youthful-fun-1.24060771,REVIEW: Hyundai Venue offers genuine youthful fun,['Brendan Mcaleer'],,"Where would you rather see your favourite band: as tiny figures far away on stage in some giant stadium, or at an intimate space where the lead singer’s sweat gets all over your T-shirt? Hmm.

I’m thinking the latter, but perhaps with one of those plastic barriers you get at a salad bar.

article continues below

Anyway, Hyundai is betting younger buyers want the latter, or are at least looking to get into a crossover that’s smaller than anything they’ve made before. Meet the new Venue, a wee little crossover that’s about the same size as the Kia Soul.

Previously, Hyundai’s crossover offerings have been named after cities (Santa Fe, and so on). The Venue, on the other hand, is meant to be the kind of space you’d want to be in anywhere. It’s smaller than even the Kona compact SUV, and aimed squarely at entry-level buyers who have spent most of their disposable income to go see Billie Eilish, whoever he is.

Thing is, with the Ford Ecosport and the Nissan Kicks already arrived at this end of the market, can this littlest Hyundai make space for itself? Is it the kind of place customers are going to buy tickets to?

Design

First off, compared to the somewhat funky styling of the larger Kona, the Venue is a pretty conservative little tyke. Unique touches like an egg-crate grille and a split-level headlight layout are relatively reserved. In profile, it’s a bit like one of Audi’s smaller offerings.

If you’d like to dress up your Venue a bit, however, doing so won’t break the bank. The $550 Urban package adds LED accents and cornering lights, and the available paint offerings are excellent. Even if you’re a bit too shy to go for the full Acid Yellow, which looks like a trendy sneaker, even the more standard colours can be ordered with bright accents.

For a car that starts at $17,099, the Venue appeals by not trying too hard, but at the same time embracing the whole cheap-but-cheerful ethos. It’s quite good fun.

Environment

If the little Venue looks a bit like a small Audi from the outside, there’s no mistaking the interior’s humble origins. At the same time, even if this car is built to a price point, it’s well-executed.

Despite the compact exterior dimensions, the Venue is relatively roomy inside. Rear passengers don’t have a great deal of legroom, but if you’re ferrying your four friends downtown to a concert, there shouldn’t be too many complaints. The trunk is also entirely usable at 355 litres.

Also impressive is how chunky and durable the knobs and switches are. There’s little flash in here, but the important bits you’ll touch every day seem well-made. Heated seats are standard across the range.

Further, every single model of Venue comes with tech you’ll actually use, like an eight-inch touchscreen and Android Auto/Apple Car Play. You can pay more for GPS navigation at the top of the range, but the base and mid-level Venues have everything you need.

Having said that, active folks will probably want to step up to a mid-level Trend trim (with the upgrade) for the better fabrics. You might as well, since basic models are lacking an armrest.

Performance

Late for the show? Well, you can only drive as fast as traffic and the law will allow anyway. For getting around in an urban environment, the Venue is just fine. On the highway, it’s not meant to be a long-distance commuter.

Yes, there’s the option of a manual transmission, but most people will opt for the CVT, which is perfectly fine in operation. The 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine produces 121 horsepower at 6,300 r.p.m. and 113 foot-pounds of torque at 4,500 r.p.m.

In stop and go, the CVT makes the most of these modest figures. Attempt to make a pass uphill on the Upper Levels, and the Venue feels very much like the economy car it is.

Further, the combination of high roof and short wheelbase makes the Venue a little busy on straight, fast-moving highways. As the Venue is front-wheel-drive only, perhaps a similarly-priced Accent sedan would be better for longer commutes.

However, that high seating position and nimble handling rules the city streets. The ride is pretty comfortable, and the visibility of sitting up high makes driving a bit more relaxing.

Around town, the Venue is pretty much all the car you need, while still returning good fuel economy. It’s proof that bigger isn’t always better.

Features

At the top of the range, the $24,899 Venue is extremely well-equipped, but probably over-featured for what most buyers need. The best balance of features and price is likely the $22,599 Trend model with the $550 Urban package.

Fuel economy results are very acceptable. Official figures for the CVT model are 8.0 litres/100 kilometres in the city and 7.0 l/100 km on the highway. Mixed results in cold weather were steadily a little under 8.0 l/100 km.

Green light

Roomy interior; practical layout; useful tech on base models; fun exterior.

Stop sign

Modestly powered; busy on the highway.

The checkered flag

A small crossover that feels genuinely youthful to drive, yet practical.

Competition

Nissan Kicks ($19,298): If you opt for the Kicks with the in-headrest Bose speakers, you’ll end up with one of the punchiest stereos on the market, at any price range. It’s just one of the simple tricks that Nissan’s youth-oriented crossover has up its sleeve.

Fun to drive, and quicker than its lowly power would suggest, the Kicks is a fresh little crossover that even has a fun name. The two-tone roof options are a nice touch, and if the interior is a little cheap-feeling, it’s still roomy.

The Hyundai has a little advantage here because it’s newer. However, the little Nissan is still a great way to get your Kicks.

184,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/auto/review-rugged-pathfinder-still-charts-a-reliable-course-1.24055229,REVIEW: Rugged Pathfinder still charts a reliable course,['David Chao'],,"The first-generation Nissan Pathfinder dates back to 1986, more than 30 years ago.

While the Pathfinder remains one of the most iconic Nissan vehicles, it has undergone many changes since that time to reflect a changing market. While the last major overhaul for this generation of Pathfinder was in 2013, this rugged SUV received a number of updates throughout the last several years.

article continues below

There is no change, in any case, for the 2020 model year. While Nissan may not want to mess with a good thing, will the Pathfinder continue to be relevant and cutting-edge enough to stay competitive in an oversaturated market? The answer lies on personal taste and what you are looking for in today’s modern SUV.

Design

The exterior of the Pathfinder is nothing to boast about, and not much has changed in terms of the styling in recent years. While the vehicle is still a handsome and attractive midsize crossover, it is not as funky, edgy or sleek as other competitors. But even though many of the modern SUVs have moved toward the “edgy” design lately – noteworthy is the two-tone “floating roof” designs – the Pathfinder remains traditional in design both inside and out. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since there are still plenty of buyers that prefer that rugged, tough look found in such vehicles as the 4Runner and the Jeep models.

The Pathfinder remains a reliable and family-focused vehicle through and through. The interior is dated no doubt, but it’s roomy and practical even in the very back of the vehicle.

With seven passenger seats and four doors, the Nissan Pathfinder is a vehicle for the whole family. Nissan offers an EZ Flex Seating System that features Latch and Glide technology. It is the second row “tilt and glide” seat that allows easy third row access even with a child safety seat still attached. This feature makes it a little easier to get into the otherwise tight third row of seats. One other added feature is the ability to recline the third row seats for additional comfort.

The infotainment system is easy enough to use but appears dated and still lacks either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto capabilities, a glaring omission for a modern vehicle.

Every Pathfinder comes standard with automatic emergency braking, a feature that was rigorously tested and applauded by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. If the LED headlights are purchased as well, the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder is an IIHS Top Safety Pick. Other safety features require opting for higher trim levels and include technology such as blind-spot monitors, adaptive cruise control, and rear cross-traffic alerts.

Performance

Under the hood is the same powertrain as last year: A 3.5-litre direct injection gasoline V-6 engine with 284 horsepower and 259 foot-pounds of torque.

The Pathfinder's infotainment system is easy enough to use but appears dated and still lacks either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto capabilities, a glaring omission for a modern vehicle. photo supplied Nissan

Every Pathfinder comes with an intelligent 4x4 system with 2WD for normal driving, Auto for variable conditions and 4WD Lock Mode for challenging driving situations. The Pathfinder drives very similarly to the Toyota 4Runner even though the 4Runner is a full body-on-frame design (versus unitized body for the Pathfinder). Whether it’s intentional or not, the 4Runner is still one of the most popular “old design” SUVs around and so Nissan may have copied its rugged feel. Both the Pathfinder and the 4Runner have that solid feel that is often lacking in today’s lighter body SUVs such as the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander.

Fuel economy for all trims except Platinum is at 12.1/8.9 litres/100 kilometres for city and highway driving, respectively. For the Platinum trim, fuel economy is 12.4/9.2 l/100 km for city and highway driving.

There are four trim levels available for the Pathfinder: S, SV Tech, SL Premium, and Platinum. In addition to this, there is a Rock Creek edition available for the SV and SL trims. With S being the base trim, the SV Tech trim adds NissanConnect navigation and GPS, remote engine start and intelligent key, as well as heated front seats and leather steering wheel.

The SL trim adds a giant moonroof spanning all three rows, motion-activated tailgate, a Bose sound system, leather seats, a trailer hitch and heated second-row seats.

Finally, the Platinum trim adds all the previous features as well as the 20-inch wheels, a power steering column with memory, and a DVD entertainment system in the headrests. While novel, the actual utility of an in-vehicle DVD player these days is questionable – I can’t imagine who would still watch movies in a DVD player.

The Rock Creek is a styling and trailer hitch package that offers an available dark pine green exterior colour, better looking wheels, blacked out wheel arches, special badging and leatherette seats to give a more rugged and off-road appeal. However, this edition is mainly stylistic and does not provide any off-roading performance changes. Pathfinder does offer best-in-class towing capacity at a total of 6,000 pounds.

Summary

As changes are next to nothing for the 2020 model year, it might be a good choice to buy the outgoing 2019 model on sale. If you would prefer the newest model, you can purchase the Pathfinder S starting from $36,498. The SV starts from $40,298, the SL will set you back $45,898, and the top-tier Platinum trim starts from $49,498.

With many competitors like the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer, and Mazda CX-9 all offering more modern touches, the unchanged Nissan Pathfinder may not please everyone – especially if they yearn for Apple Carplay or a high-tech infotainment system.

But the 2020 Nissan Pathfinder is a vehicle with a long history of reliability, practicality, ruggedness, and Japanese craftsmanship. We will have to wait and see if this is enough to support the Pathfinder into 2021 and beyond.

It's a fresh new year, the mountains sparkling with snow, and everything seems ready for a clean sheet take on what's ahead.

article continues below

However, where automakers are concerned, it's not all about the latest and greatest. In fact, several manufacturers are still selling cars that are anything but new technology.

The reason these machines are still sitting in showrooms, even though they're looking a little dated in the design department? Simply put: people like 'em. If you're a little wary of the reliability of complex powertrains, or just plain don't like touchscreens everywhere, here are a few of the oldest new cars you can buy today.

Now in its fifth generation, the Toyota 4Runner hasn't received a significant update in more than a decade. Designers, it seems, are following the old maxim: ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" photo Brendan McAleer

Toyota 4Runner

A perennial favourite on the North Shore, the 4Runner literally has a name that phonetically works out to “ancestor.” Now in its fifth generation, the 4Runner hasn't received a significant update in more than a decade.

This year, the burly Toyota turns 11, and is into outdoor pursuits, taking the kids to soccer, and playing videogames like Fortnite. It is blocky, simplistic, and has all the refinement of a Rubbermaid garbage bin.

It is also immensely lovable. If you grew up pinching your fingers with metal Tonka toys, then this is the machine for you. It's still a body-on-frame SUV with excellent off-road chops, it's still near-indestructible inside and out, and it's still impervious to depreciation. Pity Toyota's engineers trying to figure out how to improve the 4Runner without messing with success.

Mercedes-Benz G-Class

All-new for the 2019 model year, the current Mercedes-Benz Gelandewagen is a brand new car that features many new design tweaks like, um. I think the headlights are new?

Actually the new G-Class is a much different machine to drive than its predecessor. Yes, it still looks like the utilitarian box it always did, but there's much more of a crossover-like feel to the machine.

The new G is a little larger and wider than the older version (and who among us is not, in the post-holiday period?), but the major changes are mostly hidden under sheet metal that looks exactly the same. The interior gets the most significant upgrade, with the same digital outlay as the S-Class.

The G-wagen is, of course, an extremely profitable vehicle for Mercedes. They've long since stopped worrying about why their customers seem to favour a boxy off-road machine for city use, and have simply engineered it to be a bit more comfortable, and then hidden that engineering under the same old slab-sided looks. Which is exactly what people wanted.

Nissan 370Z and Frontier

At this point, the Nissan 370Z is a grumpy old samurai warrior. If you're familiar with the golden age of Japanese film, then think of a character Toshiro Mifune might play – a little rust on the blade, a little slowness in its step.

However, don't be fooled into thinking the Z's not still a great car. In an age of fake engine noise and clever traction control systems, the Z is still an old-school sports car. You need to be on your toes to extract the most from it, but with its potent V-6 and short wheelbase, it's still got the chops as a backroads delight or an on-track lapping machine. Underestimate it at your peril.

The Frontier, Nissan's compact pickup, provides a sort of a new take on the whole self-driving car future. As it's been in production, essentially unchanged, for 16 model years, it's old enough to apply for a driving license.

Even so, the Frontier remains surprisingly popular as an alternate choice to the Toyota Tacoma. The Nissan isn't fancy, and doesn't come with any of the high-tech features you might get in even the family-friendly Rogue sitting next to it in the showroom, but it is an honest pickup truck.

People like their trucks simple. It's how Datsun got a foothold in the North American market, so it makes sense that the Frontier still sells well.

Lexus LFA

Let’s round out our list with one of the oldest supercars you can still buy new. The LFA is a jewel of a machine, built around a warbling V-10 that was acoustically tuned by Yamaha's musical instrument department. It's a really interesting car, and it went out of production nearly a decade ago.

But you can still get one, brand-new. Of the 500 cars produced, five still remain sitting in showrooms, brand-new and ready to go.

Last year, when there were about eight or so remaining, three new LFAs found homes, registering on Toyota's end-of-year charts as new car sales.

Turns out, some car manufacturers still make 'em like they used to. And people still buy 'em.

That’s not the case anymore for North Vancouver resident Ron Slinger, as well as for his daughter Molly Thompson.

article continues below

Like many who can sense when something’s up with a loved one even when the family member themselves may be content to downplay it, Ron and Molly could tell something was going on with Bobbi.

“We knew something was not right,” says Ron. “We asked questions.”

Throughout much of 2018, Rosemary Slinger, who has gone by the nickname Bobbi for most of her life, started to exhibit some changes.

Her voice was sounding different, almost like she constantly had a cold, and her personality, at least to her discerning husband and daughter, seemed to change a bit too. Her cognitive abilities had also appeared to enter a downturn.

“Sometimes I would feel like she was a little bit out of it, which was not like her,” says Molly.

The family set out to find answers. They went to doctors and specialists, got Bobbi an MRI exam and a host of other assessments, and waited as patiently as they could.

Eventually a doctor, who examined Bobbi and was the first to notice a slight twitch radiating through her arm, suggested she might have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

“At that point, it was the first time that anybody had mentioned ALS,” says Molly.

Bobbi was officially diagnosed with the disease in January 2019.

Since then, Bobbi’s ALS – a rapidly progressive neuromuscular disease – has advanced.

She now has trouble breathing because her lung muscles have been weakened, and she’s fed every day through a tube because she has so much trouble swallowing. She’s lost the ability to speak and currently requires 24-hour care.

While she’s still able to move around a bit, with the help of a caretaker, things have changed a lot, offers Ron, who started the Black Bear Neighbourhood Pub in Lynn Valley in 1997 and recalls countless nights spent sharing dinner and a glass of wine with his wife as they discussed their present and future plans.

“We’re just newlyweds – 49 years this July,” he quips. “Our life was turned upside down.”

June is ALS Awareness Month in B.C. Local landmarks are lit up in purple to show support for people living with the disease. A series of events, such as the Virtual Walk to End ALS, are being hosted across the province.

For Ron and Molly, the awareness month brings an opportunity to talk more about the disease which has currently robbed Ron of his longtime partner and, for Molly, a loving mother and grandmother.

There are more than 400 British Columbians and more than 3,000 Canadians living with the disease at any given time, according to the ALS Society of British Columbia.

But while ALS is often referred to as a rare disease, Molly drives home the point that it seems like almost everyone has a personal connection of some kind to it, whether it’s a friend, a neighbour, a family member, or a friend of a friend, who’s living through the illness.

“It impacts a lot of people, probably more than many realize,” she says, noting that since her mom’s diagnosis she’s met many families just on the North Shore alone who are learning to cope with the disease.

Currently, there are only two drugs approved in Canada to treat ALS, though neither is known to significantly slow the progression of the disease or extend a patient’s life. After being diagnosed with ALS, the majority of patients are given a life expectancy of just a few years, according to Health Canada.

Compared to the U.S., or even other parts of Canada, B.C. isn’t offering clinical trials for experimental therapies or drugs either, many of which may offer the only source of hope for some people living with the disease, adds Molly.

And while the ALS Society of British Columbia is focused on supporting patients, families and caregivers managing the disease, as well as supporting research, Molly and Ron would like to see more investment from higher levels of government in order to eradicate the disease entirely.

“We need to focus our money and funding on finding a cure,” she says. “During this time, people that are hoping to get into these trials can’t even go anywhere because of COVID.”

It’s unacceptable that there hasn’t been the capacity in B.C. in the past to offer more clinical trials, according to Wendy Toyer, executive director of the ALS Society of British Columbia.

That’s something the non-profit organization hopes to help change, she adds.

“The ALS Society of B.C. recognizes that, aside from providing the best quality of life for people living with ALS through our programs, there is a need to establish a secure venue for clinical trials to take place in British Columbia. And that’s what we’re going to do.”

While a formal announcement is still forthcoming, the organization is raising funds to help establish B.C. as a destination location for doctors looking to perform clinical ALS trials and research, she says.

The Virtual Walk to End ALS, which supports people living with the disease in B.C. and Yukon, as well as the Canadian ALS Research Program, is being held on Saturday, June 20. For more details, visit walktoendals.ca.

Both Ron and Molly are hoping that with more money invested in meaningful research other people won’t have to experience the same challenges and occasional feelings of hopelessness they’ve experienced during their family’s own recent journey with the disease.

“That’s something that I’ve realized during this time – hope is something that as humans we need,” says Molly.",[]

Cecille Soriano is coming up on the one-year anniversary of having received a double lung transplant.

article continues below

“Health-wise things are going really great,” Soriano, 29, tells the North Shore News. “I still have quite a few appointments and check-ins, but the year mark is quite a big milestone and once you hit the year mark you can start to get ready to go back to work and the restrictions are a little looser.”

Soriano received a lung transplant due to complications caused by the disease scleroderma, a rare autoimmune condition which affects roughly four out of every 10,000 people, according to the North Vancouver-based Scleroderma Association of B.C.

The disease affects people differently, but is generally recognized by a hardening of one’s connective tissue starting with the skin and blood vessels, and eventually can affect vital organs such as the lungs.

Soriano first noticed symptoms of the disease emerge while on a backpacking trip through Europe when she was 19.

“I had noticed my skin … had patches that were dry, almost like snakeskin,” Soriano told the North Shore News last year.

After receiving a diagnosis of scleroderma, Soriano lived with the condition for years until it progressed to the point where it started to affect her lungs.

Soriano says she was lucky to not have to wait long for her transplant and has been amazed at how quickly she’s been able to get back to some of the things she loved doing prior to her lungs starting to fail.

“I find everyday there’s new things I’m able to do again,” she says. “It’s just basic things: I can take the dogs for a walk and not have to take any breaks. I can actually run again, which is something I haven’t been able to do in years.”

While she continues onwards in her own journey with the autoimmune condition, she’s also intent to keep supporting the organization that has helped her immensely with the physical and mental struggles she’s faced throughout the past decade.

The Scleroderma Association of B.C. aims to support those living with the disease as well as raise money for research.

“If there’s somebody else out there that is going to be helped by finding this cure and if they can live their life a little bit better and not have to go through this kind of surgery, then I’m going to do whatever I can,” says Soriano, who first connected with the organization years ago shortly after her own diagnosis.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the organization’s annual Ride for Research – which in past years has involved a 30-kilometre bicycle ride up to UBC and has raised to date more than $165,000 for scleroderma research – has had to go virtual for the month of June.

From June 1-29, the virtual fundraiser encourages people living or affected by scleroderma – if they are able – to go for a walk, bike ride, run, hold a virtual family activity or do some relaxed stretching at home.

Participants are also encouraged to donate online as well as take photos of their activity which can then be shared with the organization or tagged on Facebook.

The goal is to raise approximately $30,000 for scleroderma research.

“We’re still encouraging people to do something active, whether that be going for a walk, or going for a ride, and of course following social distancing guidelines,” she says. “Throughout June we’re going to be sharing photos of everybody’s rides and walks.”

Since receiving her lung transplant, Soriano is no longer required to use an oxygen tank. Although people living with an autoimmune condition are compelled to be extra careful in the era of COVID-19, Soriano has adopted her usual upbeat attitude when it comes to living with a rare disease while a global health crisis continues in tandem.

“In one sense, I was lucky because I’ve basically been quarantining for a year already. I’m used to staying home,” she says. “I was lucky that the staying at home didn’t affect me as much.”",[]

“We see this all the time,” said Lawrie, addressing a packed room in the atrium of Lions Gate Hospital Thursday morning.

Lawrie told the crowd about low-income seniors or older adults with empty cupboards, inadequate nutrition, and mattresses that were so old they were warped completely. He talked about the home of one senior that was overrun with mice, but they couldn’t afford the exterminator that would have put an end to all the nasty scurrying.

Referring to a sizeable donation from a seniors’ residence organization with three locations on the North Shore, Lawrie said he was hopeful it might become a little easier to make life better for low-income seniors in the community.

“I love this fund because it’s like Spackle – it covers many of the cracks in the social safety net,” he said.

On Feb. 27, the Amica Helping Hands Charity – the charitable arm of Amica Senior Lifestyles –donated $250,000 to the Lions Gate Hospital Foundation which, in partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health, will use the funds over a five-year period to support North Shore seniors who are living in poverty.

The funds will mainly help medically distressed and vulnerable seniors in need, many of whom already live in government housing, have multiple medical conditions and live in poverty or are alone, according to Sandra Edelman, Vancouver Coastal Health’s home and community program manager.

“Typically, these needs are not being funded by health services which leaves the case managers, the social workers, [and] the home support workers scrambling to find other sources of funding, which is at best hit-and-miss,” said Edelman.

More than 35,000 seniors reside on the North Shore, said Edelman, adding that it’s estimated that 10 per cent are living in poverty.

The quarter-million-dollar fund, which will be spent with oversight from joint LGHF and VCH committees that will determine how to allocate the money, will be used to help with everything from providing basic necessities like food and laundry services, to ensuring that low-income seniors have easy access to transportation.

“It’s dealing with those real true social determinants of health, where if you can actually meet some of the basic necessities in terms of food, shelter, medication, some transportation, laundry and so on – if you can actually meet those necessities that a senior has, you can keep them in their homes much longer,” said Edelman.

Amica CEO and Helping Hands chair Doug MacLatchy praised residents at various Amica properties for their fundraising efforts in helping other seniors who may be living in potentially more isolated and limited situations.

“We have residents from Amica Lions Gate, Amica Edgemont Village, and Amica West Vancouver here today, all of whom have deep personal connections to this hospital and this community. Without them, this donation would not have been possible,” said MacLatchy.

Judy Savage, LGHF president and CEO, talked about how unique the sizeable donation was because it focused on the foundation’s work outside of the traditional hospital setting.

“So many of our donations come to acute care, which is the hospital. This one is strictly benefiting people in the community,” said Savage. “We’re trying to keep people out of the hospital, we’re trying to keep them safe and well at home.”",[]

The department issued the recall on Feb. 10, noting that the products are promoted for sexual enhancement, weight loss, as a workout aid, or as “poppers”. Consumers are advised to immediately stop using the products and consult a healthcare professional if they have any health concerns.

Unauthorized health products have not been approved by Health Canada, which means that they have not been assessed for safety, effectiveness and quality. As such, they may contain ingredients that are not listed on the label, such as prescription drugs, and possibly at doses exceeding maximum recommended amounts. However, the label may also indicate a dangerous ingredient or combination of ingredients.

In order to verify that products have been authorized for sale by Health Canada, consumers should carefully read product labels. Authorized health products have an eight-digit Drug Identification Number (DIN), Natural Product Number (NPN) or Homeopathic Drug Number (DIN-HM). You can also check if products have been authorized for sale by searching Health Canada’s Drug Product Database and Licensed Natural Health Product Database.

See a full list of the recalled products HERE.

The following prescription drugs were found in the unauthorized health products:

Sildenafil is a prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and should be used only under the supervision of a health care professional. It should not be used by individuals taking any kind of nitrate drug (e.g., nitroglycerine) as it can cause potentially life-threatening low blood pressure. Individuals with heart problems are at increased risk of cardiovascular side effects such as heart attack, stroke, chest pain, high blood pressure and abnormal heartbeat. Other possible side effects include headache, facial flushing, indigestion, dizziness, abnormal vision, and hearing loss. Hydroxythiohomosildenafil and thiodimethylsildenafil are unauthorized substances that are similar to sildenafil and may pose similar health risks.

Tadalafil is a prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and should be used only under the supervision of a health care professional. It should not be used by individuals taking any kind of nitrate drug (e.g., nitroglycerine) since it can cause potentially life-threatening low blood pressure. Individuals with heart problems are at increased risk of cardiovascular side effects such as heart attack, stroke, chest pain, high blood pressure and abnormal heartbeat. Other possible side effects include headache, facial flushing, indigestion, dizziness, abnormal vision, and hearing loss. Aminotadalafil is an unauthorized substance that is similar to tadalafil and may pose similar health risks.

Yohimbine is a prescription drug and should be used only under the supervision of a health care professional. Yohimbine is derived from yohimbe, a bark extract. The use of yohimbine or yohimbe may result in serious adverse reactions particularly in people with high blood pressure, or heart, kidney or liver disease. Side effects include increased blood pressure and heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, tremors, headache, nausea and sleep disorders. It should not be used by children, or pregnant or nursing women.

Health Canada has a full list of the products on its website, as well as the stores where the products were seized from. While they are all located in Toronto, it is possible that the products could show up in other provinces. As a result, Canadians are encouraged to check back regularly for updates.

The media release accompanying this picture book indicates that the story is based on one of the many adventures Wimperly and her husband – former longtime North Shore residents -- have had with their three-year-old grandson.

article continues below

A number of enjoyable activities are crammed into the outing with Fitz and his grandparents – pre-pool snacking, splashing and goofing around at the pool with either Grandfa or Gramma, and a picnic to replenish all the expended energy.

Gramma and Grandfa, as they are styled, appear far from traditional comfortably rounded old fogies.

Instead, they look (as many of today’s grandparents do) young enough to be the parents, and they are certainly as energetic.

They are more than willing to indulge in imaginative play, share silly jokes and even endure (in Gramma’s case) being drenched by a well-placed bucket of water.

The loving relationship between the generations is clear and the dialogue is funny and believable. Fitz is clearly a cherished little boy.

At the end of the day he is brought home to his parents with lots of stories to share with his Daddy and his Papa.

Jaunty watercolour illustrations are just right for the story and highlight the exuberance of childhood.

The fact that Fitz has same-sex parents is quietly stated and no special significance is placed on this family arrangement.

Two more Fitz stories are planned for release in 2020.

Typically, she takes charge of cooking one night a week and tonight would have been the night. But not this week.

Her 15-year-old brother Brad has been freed from his regular chores as well.

article continues below

What’s going on? Simple. They are studying for their exams.

One way parents can help kids prepare for their final exams is to free them from their regular household responsibilities so they can focus on studying.

Giving them this break also gives the kids the message that you believe their schoolwork is important and you are available to help.

When I was in Grade 12, I had the perfect situation for studying for my final exams. I went to stay with my grandparents.

I am the oldest of six siblings and you can imagine that trying to bear down and study in a house with five other kids and two parents could be a bit of a challenge. So, I left for a few weeks.

To make things even better, my grandparents instinctively knew what I needed to make this a good experience. My grandmother had taught in a one-room schoolhouse and she must have harkened back to her memories of exams and the stress her students felt.

Or maybe, she was simply a wonderful, wise elder. Either way, I was the beneficiary.

Let’s face it, June is the final month of the school year and it’s also the most stressful. The higher the grade the student is in, the higher the stress levels. Final marks count, particularly if the student is planning on post- secondary studies.

Studying and writing exams is the job of the student. In fact, once kids are getting homework it’s theirs, not yours. Your job is to support them but not do their work.

Nagging and pushing will not work and won’t teach them how to take responsibility for their own education. But there are ways you can support them.

As we already mentioned it’s helpful to relieve them of their regular chores. Cook nutritious meals for them and have them sit at the table and eat properly. If they don’t eat well, they won’t be able to think properly and the time they spend studying just won’t be efficient.

Besides meals, bring them snacks while they work. Just slip in, put a drink or some fruit on the desk and leave quietly.

My wonderful Grandma would call me out of studying for lovely dinners and except for helping clear the table she expected me to continue to study after dinner, not do dishes.

While putting the emphasis on study, understand the need and value of some leisure to reduce the stress. It’s not a bad thing to take the occasional break. Watching a favourite TV show, going for a run, or chatting with a friend on the phone are positive, and not wasting time.

If you’re worried that she is going to watch TV all night a simple comment such as, “Taking a short break, eh?” is helpful.

When parents are bugging their children to study every second, they can easily go into their rooms and goof off. Many actually study far fewer hours than if they are allowed some breaks.

Studying is hard work. When they are tired encourage them to get enough sleep. All-night study sessions are not very healthy. Mind you, with the older kids it may happen and if it does just be supportive and caring.

Finally, remember you are there to support them but only they can decide to study. It’s their education and their exams so if they choose to goof off despite your support, they will have to deal with the outcome.

With your support they will do their best and can then enjoy the summer and look forward to the fall with energy and excitement.

Parents need to sit down and chat with their kids on a regular basis.

article continues below

Once the kids become teens this can become a challenge. They either give you one-word answers or just roll their eyes as if your opening comment is just a waste of his time. Or, more likely, he has his head down and is busy on his smartphone.

So, how do we open the line of communication?

In this day and age start where your kids are. Reach out and text. Let’s say you’re concerned about whether he is getting his homework done.

Instead of cornering him at the breakfast table and starting to address your concerns, start with a text.

Send him a note telling him that you want to have a conversation and asking him to suggest a good time for a chat.

If you get no response, text again but this time mention some possible times and ask him to choose.

An excellent time for having a meaningful conversation is when driving teens to the mall or soccer practice. You have a captive audience; you are not having to make eye contact and both you and your teen know that this will end as soon as you arrive at your destination.

The supper table can be a good place for conversation.

These should not be personal concerns but discussions about neighbourhood activities such as the new folks who moved in down the block, or a store opening up at the local mall. Or maybe the latest movies or music videos that interest the kids.

Not all our conversations will be serious. Be open to conversations about your kids’ latest music interests, their popular culture or fun facts about their daily life.

The more we listen, the more they will talk. If your kids can easily talk about relatively trivial things, when the time comes, they will be able to discuss major events such as bullying, school problems and even sexual matters.

One sure-fire way of ending a conversation is to interrupt. Your teen starts talking and you know where she is going so you jump in with advice.

It may be valid and useful advice, but it stops the flow and lets her know that you are not going to listen.

Even worse is to make a point not related to the topic. In the middle of a talk is not the time to correct her grammar or point out something you see out the window. Focus on listening to her.

There are simple things we can do to open the doors of communication.

Listening is the most important. They don’t need to hear that you know it all because you remember from when you were a teen. That may be true, but things are different today and your teen is not you.

Listen to the end of the conversation. Don’t make snap judgements. You may think you have figured out the situation but let her tell you the whole story from her perspective.

You may or may not have come to the correct conclusion, but you owe her the respect of hearing her out to the end of the story.

Finally, it you’re told something in confidence keep it to yourself.

If you’re going to share it with the other parent first inform your teen. Then keep it to yourselves.

The more you can open the lines of communication with your teens the stronger the relationship you will develop.

So simply listen and then talk once you know for sure what your teen is looking for from you.

In the children’s department of a local library a boy about six years old came up to the desk to check out some books.

article continues below

The librarian noticed he had a book about the Montreal Canadians. She said: “Oh, they are my favourite team.”

He grinned and he replied, “Me too!”

She told him that many years ago she had seen them play at the Forum in Montreal. His eyes got so big and he just stammered “You did?” He told her his favourite player was Patrick Roy because he was so good.

During this conversation his Mom stood back. The boy had come to the desk with the card on his own, he had a conversation on his own and mom didn’t interfere.

On the face of it, this interaction should not really be worthy of note. But it is, because in too many cases, children are not being allowed to be independent. This includes speaking for themselves.

As parents, it’s our job to expect our children to do as much as they can for themselves as soon as they are capable.

On the typical day kids need to get up in the morning to get ready for the day. In many homes, this requires a lot of activity from parents.

But in fact, kids can wake up to an alarm clock, get themselves out of bed, toileted, washed, teeth brushed and dressed and head into the kitchen for breakfast.

By the time they are 10, they can be actively involved in preparing their lunch.

Mornings can be pleasant if everyone does their share. It simply requires some thinking and planning. It might be helpful for kids to choose their clothing for the next day at bedtime.

Now, if your child is a morning person this won’t work but if he’s groggy first thing having his outfit ready is helpful.

The idea of having kids take charge of their daily routine as soon as they can makes life easier for everyone.

Whether it involves walking, biking or for the older kids, transit, kids benefit from making the trip to school on their own.

Of course, this takes serious training but once they know the route and the rules of the road, they will profit from taking control of this part of their lives.

Thinking back to our opening story, letting kids speak for themselves is another way we allow them to grow and take charge of their lives.

How often have you been in a situation in which you need to fill out a form for your child? And the clerk with the paper looks right at the adult and says: “What’s her name?”

She’s nine years old and is perfectly capable of answering all the questions. So, turn to your daughter and say, you can give her the answers she needs.

In most family friendly restaurants the staff is happy to speak directly to the kids.

Teaching our kids how to negotiate the minefield that is life is our job. And it is a process.

When they are babies it’s easy. We allow them to work through the method of learning how to walk. We have to let them fall down, get up and try again. And over time they become kids who are nimble and running through the house.

We need to use this model throughout their lives so that they learn how to learn, how to move forward, how to slowly become independent adults.

It’s not only a case of letting them go places as they become ready. It’s also a case of letting them do for themselves what they can do even when it takes longer and is frustrating for them and us.

So, standing back while our preschooler dresses herself, having her take her dishes to the kitchen, or expecting her to pick up after herself are all parts of this journey to adulthood.

It’s simply a case of letting and expecting your children to do as much for themselves as soon as they are capable.

Your parent role includes that of teacher, trainer, supporter and coach.

Many events were held to mark this day (June 15) including a statement from B.C.’s Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie, the wearing of purple ribbons, a purple flag flown in Victoria, as well as numerous community activities.

article continues below

World Elder Abuse Awareness Day and the wearing of purple – which symbolizes the growing issue of elder abuse – are emblems of support for the United Nations International Plan of Action, which acknowledges the significance of elder abuse as a public health and human rights issue.

In her speech, Mackenzie stated her desire for people to “educate yourself about elder abuse and to know how to report it. Elder abuse is preventable, and everyone has a role to play.”

One of the major players in the fight against elder abuse is the British Columbia Association of Community Response Networks (BC CRN). On its website the association states that it grew out of the need to create an ongoing, permanent provincial funding and support structure for the benefit of vulnerable adults who are experiencing abuse, neglect, and self-neglect.

Our nearest chapter is the North Shore Community Response Network, which are dedicated to working on local issues of abuse.

According to the association, elder abuse commonly refers to adult abuse where the target is a senior or older adult. Simply put, elder abuse is violence, mistreatment or neglect towards older adults and there is often a power differential.

An abuser is someone, who is likely to be someone known to the abused elder person such as a friend, family member or caregiver. Elder abuse takes many forms: financial, psychological, physical, and sexual.

The association states: “Instances of abuse often coincide with neglect. Neglect is when lack of care, assistance, or attention leads to physical, mental, or emotional harm, or loss of financial assets. Self-neglect is the failure to care for one’s self that causes serious physical or mental harm, or damage to or loss of assets.”

The association also states that due to the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis new challenges are apparent as the pandemic proceeds.

Elder abuse is an issue that affects millions of older adults and has detrimental effects on their health and well-being. It is estimated that 16 per cent of older adults over the age of 60 have been affected by some form of abuse, which amounts to about 1.5 million Canadians in that demographic.

That number has likely increased during the global pandemic due to an increase of older adults who are isolated and lonely, rely on other people for their daily needs, are feeling pressured to support their relatives, and may not have access to appropriate and responsible people who can support them or help them through this crisis.

It is important to know how to recognize potential signs of abuse, but unfortunately, we often fail to recognize early warning signs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more challenging to identify signs of abuse and neglect because of isolation, lessened face to face communication and less contact with outside activities such as seniors centres or seniors programs where staff are on the alert for signs.

Some signs of elder abuse could include injuries such as bruises, cuts, or broken bones, malnourishment or weight loss, poor hygiene, symptoms of anxiety, depression, or confusion, unexplained transactions or loss of money and withdrawal from family members or friends.

To report elder abuse, you can find resources specific to your province or territory by clicking here.

On the North Shore if you know of an abuse issue or you are experiencing abuse try the ReAct Adult Protection program at 1-877-732-2899. This program receives reports, provides consultation and co-ordinates responses to adults who are abused, neglected or self-neglected. People can also try the Seniors Abuse and Information Line at 604-437-1940.

This organization provides a safe place for older adults and those who care about them to talk to someone about issues of abuse or mistreatment. You could also try the North Shore Community Response Network which provides education on prevention of the abuse and neglect of vulnerable adults.

On other fronts, B.C’s Seniors Advocate has been working with the B.C. Securities Commission which has produced an educational video about the signs of financial elder abuse. This includes the mishandling of an older person’s money or property and acts of fraud.

The Seniors Advocate’s office has also been working with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner to launch an awareness campaign to help seniors understand how to protect their privacy online and off, with tips about protecting your personal information.

As a civil society it is very troubling to hear about the abuse of older adults, so it is up to us to change that reality. Though World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is over, let us work year-round to make the changes to this world crisis.

If you are like me and many other seniors, you may have some trepidation about adopting to the “new normal.”

article continues below

As Dr. Michael Hochman states in the June newsletter of On Health: “We know immune systems change with age making it harder to fight off diseases and infections even if you’re otherwise healthy.”

He goes on to state that “older adults are also more likely to have health conditions such as high blood pressure and type-2 diabetes, that seem to worsen outcomes from COVID-19.”

But as some of us have experienced, coping while physical distancing is a continuing challenge. Suggested strategies for coping mentally, cognitively, and physically include eating right, maintaining strength, and staying socially connected.

Maintaining strength involves a good exercise plan and walking is one of the best ways to maximize your exercise regime. Our public health officer in British Columbia has noted how walking outdoors is important to citizens as they cope with self isolation and physical distancing. Of course, she advises us that we need to stay at least six feet apart from others who are not in our household bubble.

At this time of year and during the COVID-19 pandemic, getting out for a walk can have incredible benefits. As well as the health benefits such as improving vascular heath, fighting diseases, strengthening bones, muscles, and joints, and promoting heathy weight, exercise can give us a mood boost.

According to McMaster Optimal Age Portal, “one study from California State University Long Beach found that there was a direct connection between mood and walking. In short, the more steps a person took per day, the more positive their attitude and outlook. One major reason behind the connection could be that walking helps naturally release endorphins and promotes circular breathing, leading to emotional benefits.”

We are lucky in North Vancouver to have some great walks such as the Spirit Trail, the West Vancouver Seawall, the Kings Mill Walk and the Maplewood Conservation Area. But walks in your neighbourhood are just as good and as I have experienced in some cases, they are somewhat safer as they do not always include the forgetful (or possibly uncaring) walkers who do not distance the required six feet. On a walk along a quiet street, I can get out of the way of these careless pedestrians more easily.

It has been suggested that along with walking, one could try some strengthening exercises for 30 minutes at least twice a week and a balance exercise such as standing on one leg and then the other daily. Walking, strengthening and balance exercise also have the bonus of helping to prevent falls and hip fractures.

If walking is not enough for or even too strenuous, try some online activities. For instance, Parkgate Community Services Society has created a video of a Keep Well instructor demonstrating some favourite exercises so you can stay active at home.

And Silver Harbour’s Tai Chi instructor suggested the following YouTube video for anyone who wants to continue to practise Tai Chi from home.

In the June special edition of the West Vancouver Scene magazine, the Health and Fitness Team state, “Although there may be some temporary limitations on the types of activities we can do, and where we can do them – there are plenty of creative ways left to stay active, well and happy during this challenging time.”

They suggest several times a day you could take a five- to 10-minute break to move around your home. Perhaps you could do some light or heavy gardening and often tidying and cleaning your house, car, or garage. Their advice is to find exercises that work for your level of comfort and repeat daily – some excellent exercises can be found in the magazine.

Or you can simply look for suitable exercise classes on TV. Check your cable TV for a fitness channel.

It is clear from our health authorities that the greatest risk of COVID-19 infection is exposure – and physical distancing is the most effective tool we have for prevention.

One of the best strategies for coping as we physical distance is exercise. It will not prevent us from getting the virus if, unfortunately, we are exposed to it. But physical activity prevents us from becoming sedentary which contributes to our overall health and well being.

It’s the right thing to do, especially since I’m in a vulnerable age group.

As we all know, seniors are not able to access their usual haunts (seniors’ centres, coffee shops, recreation centres and the libraries) and they cannot see their family and friends as much.

I asked colleagues, friends and family for coping strategies especially for people who do not have access to electronic devices and the internet. Bonus: This meant I was in touch with lots of people which helped me deal with my own need to socialize and stay connected.

Many people said keeping busy was crucial. Sitting around a lot might bring on anxiety, stress and social isolation. Try organizing your day by setting an agenda which includes exercise, changing or upping your usual cleaning schedule, eating a regular, healthy diet, staying socially connected, trying something different or finishing those projects that you started and never finished.

While it might seem like fun sitting around in your pajamas all day, keep up your routine by showering and dressing for the day in the morning.

Of course, keep up the old solitary activities like reading, watching your favourite shows on television and gardening. You could clean a closet, sort and organize photos, shred old papers and listen to the recording that you received for your birthday and never listened to all the way through. Consider these activities as stay at home fun activities and don’t feel guilty about binge watching a Netflix series.

Try though, not to obsessively watch television or listen to the radio about the current situation – too much information can be stressful and not always very helpful.

While we cannot go to the gym or attend our regular exercise classes we can get outside for a walk, in fact everyone is encouraged to so if possible and you are able. I have been walking but keeping my distance (two metres is suggested).

But I have also been trying to be social, smiling and nodding to people and maybe having a short distance conversation. We are so fortunate on the North Shore to have so many walking trails.

For instance, try the Spirit Trail, the West Vancouver Seawall, the Kings Mill Walk, the Maplewood Conservation Area or just walk in your neighbourhood. If you can’t get out, perhaps create an exercise program in your house, dust off that old exercise bike and check out exercise programs on TV.

One of the best ways to stay connected is the good old-fashioned telephone. Try phoning a friends and family regularly. Maybe get in touch with an old out of touch friend. Find out if they need anything or just have a good chin wag.

Many seniors’ centres and groups are setting up phone trees or other programs to keep in touch with their members and participants. Check out the centres you went to before the virus hit if you want a regular call or you want to volunteer to phone people. To find out how to reach these groups and organizations look for the new 2020 Seniors Directory created by the North Shore Community Resources Society and published by the North Shore News.

The directory can be found on-line at nscr.ca. Also, because the Red Cross Equipment Loan program is open for business at 600 West Queens Rd., you can get a guide there.

Another way to stay socially connected is to write some letters to people by hand and let them know you will write back quickly. Drop your letters off at the good old mail- box down the street

If you use an electronic device such as a tablet or smartphone perhaps set up a photo exchange, weekly book club reading group, play Scrabble or other online games with friends and Skype or Facetime regularly. Use email and texting, but perhaps write longer emails and ask for responses.

The goal of social distancing is to eventually stop the spread of the virus. The goal for us as seniors when we are practicing social distancing is to stay hopeful, busy and still, somehow, socially connected.

I don’t usually quote celebrities, but Ryan Reynolds, our homegrown Canadian star, aptly stated recently: “Take care of your bodies and hearts. Leave room for joy. Call someone who’s isolated and might need connection.”

“Guiding is so valuable for girls. Along with self-reliance and leadership, girls learn to work together, they learn skills and explore the natural world. They learn that friendship and harmony have no borders or boundaries,” says Daphne.

Because Guiding in West Vancouver goes back 99 years, and its progress is so closely connected to that of the community, we must begin with a little history.

Founder Lord Baden-Powell, his sister and his wife, considered Guiding and Scouting to be movements rather than organizations, because they would move with the times. After the devastation caused by the First World War, there was an emphasis on international friendship and learning to live in peace.

Women got the vote in British Columbia in 1917 though they would not be recognized as persons by the government of Canada until 1929.

The power of the vote for women meshed with Guiding’s mandate to instill self-reliance and leadership in young girls, to be accomplished through training in indoor and outdoor skills.

When Girl Guiding reached West Vancouver in 1921, the community was an ideal incubator for the raising of Brownies and Girl Guides. The population was predominantly British, with politics and the economy run by men, and socially organized by their wives, strong-minded women, by and large.

Gwladys Davies, one of the first Guide Leaders, was also West Vancouver’s first female councillor. Gertrude Lawson, the daughter of John Lawson, one of the community’s founders, was a teacher and supporter of Guiding.

North Vancouver’s Phyl Munday, outdoorswoman, explorer, mountaineer and conservationist, became a Guide Leader at the age of 17.

She was involved with Guiding for 60 years and her influence, as an individual and as a Guider, is remembered to this day. As the North Shore Nature Advisor, Munday trained Guide Leaders in outdoor skills and in the conservation of plants and animals, which they would pass on to their charges.

Daphne and May talked about contributions by these women to Guiding in West Vancouver.

As they prepare for the centenary of West Vancouver Guiding in 2021, sifting through papers, discovering caches of photographs, retelling stories and discovering new ones, the connection between guiding and the community emerges.

Here is one example. While serving as Nature Advisor for West Vancouver, May had the idea to set up a Nature House at Lighthouse Park, to carry on Phyl Munday’s commitment to Guiding and to the conservation of our natural world.

The people of West Vancouver pitched in. Pat Boname, a Guide Leader before she became West Vancouver’s first female Mayor, helped negotiate the lease with the municipality. Frank Kuruscz provided support from the parks and recreation department.

The building, one of those erected at Lighthouse Park by the Canadian army during the Second World War, was renovated. Service groups painted it, all except for the Nature Room. Here, West Vancouver artist Val Brouwer sketched images from the natural world on the walls, and supervised the volunteer painters to complete the work.

Ever since the Phyl Munday Nature House opened in Lighthouse Park in 1985, Guiders have come to learn about living with, and conserving, the natural world. And here, in a building constructed by the Canadian army during the Second World War, the vision of the Baden-Powells for the Guiding and Scouting movement – that we live together in peace – is alive and well.

“You wouldn’t believe the people that visit the Nature Room on Sunday afternoons,” says Daphne. “Visitors come from all over the world. They come from Vancouver and from here in West Vancouver. Some were born and raised here, others are immigrants like me and May. These days, we welcome recent immigrants, exploring and learning about their new community. We are all volunteers, of course, so Nature House cannot always be open. Visitors to the Park and to Point Atkinson on Sundays can look for our sign: Open from 2 to 4 p.m.”

Thanks to Daphne Hales and May Loudon and their fellow Guiders, more stories will be told in 2021, during the centenary.

They are worth waiting for, I promise.

The premise behind the saying is that in order to have a well mannered, calm dog that an owner can easily live with, the dog must be exhausted on a daily basis from at least a two hour walk.

article continues below

It is true that a dog that is tired typically no longer has the physical energy to engage in inappropriate behaviours that would make it a bad dog. But it does not mean that as a result of being physically tired that the dog becomes inherently good. What is does mean is that a tired dog is just a tired dog. When it is no longer tired, it is no longer good!

What you do have however, is a dog well on its way to becoming an extreme athlete, not a well behaved dog.

Most people understand the concept of physical fitness and that the more you work out on a regular basis, the better shape you get into. The same thing happens to a dog. The more exercise they get, the more they increase their strength and stamina.

The result of consistently exhausting a dog through extensive physical exercise is an ultra-athlete who now needs greater levels of exercise in order to feel tired. Continuing to follow the premise of “a tired dog is a good dog” will eventually mean that this dog could potentially require eight hours of continual exercise in order to be a “good dog”

Nobody’s got time for that!

Now, I am not suggesting in the slightest that we don’t exercise our dogs. Exercise is incredibly important to our dogs’ health and well-being, but it is equally important that it be reasonable and balanced. Reasonable in the sense that it happens on a daily basis and your dog can rely on it and balanced not only in the level of activity but also the level

of inactivity.

That’s right, it is equally important that your dog learns to expect to be inactive and to look forward to it.

But how do you train your dog to be inactive and to look forward to it, you ask?

By teaching your dog to go to its place.

The place command is meant to teach a dog to chill and do nothing but hang out and well… meditate. Dogs are naturally very peaceful animals, their minds are not filled with the constant chatter that fills our minds and given the opportunity and environment they can and will happily just . . . be.

While a dog is in its place command it is learning how to be confident, it is learning how to relax and control its impulses as well as learning how to reduce its anxiety levels. The place command is how you teach your dog to be a good dog, not through hours of exercise but rather through time doing nothing.

To be clear, the place command is not meant to replace exercise, but rather to help a dog learn how to manage its energy levels without having to create the next ultra marathoner in the process.

Teaching a dog to go to its place helps to manage a dog’s state of mine through self control, not exhaustion. It calms a dog who is always getting into trouble roaming the house looking for stuff to do to entertain itself. Place teaches a dog that being separate from its owner is OK, it can also help with separation anxiety by teaching a dog that being alone does not mean being lonely. Place teaches a dog that it does not have to be entertained by its person whenever they happen to be in the same room together. The place command creates homeostasis, not only within the dog, but the dog owner and the home as everyone’s anxiety levels decrease.

The place command is one of the foundation commands that every dog should learn and learn well as it is a command that not only assists in managing a dog’s behaviour but it shapes and balances a dog’s personality. And a dog that is healthy and balanced both physically and mentally by learning how to calm its mind and manage its anxiety levels is a good dog.

The goal of socialization is to systematically expose a young dog to a variety of people, dogs, noises, smells and situations in a positive manner.

article continues below

By positively acclimating your pup to all types of stimuli it can help prevent an adult dog from being reactive and fearful toward children, people wearing hats or the act of riding in a vehicle, for example.

As the dog matures, these positive experiences help to permanently shape the pup’s temperament and personality resulting in how the pup reacts to his environment as an adult dog.

If a dog is properly socialized, it is not only a social dog that is comfortable, confident and capable of self-control by being nonreactive in whatever situation it finds itself in, but it is also a dog that does not feel the need to interact with its surroundings and considers its person as the priority over its surroundings.

But wait, isn’t the goal of socializing a dog to create a dog that is sociable and wanting to interact with its surroundings?

Not exactly.

Socialization is meant to create confidence so that a dog does not need to react to, or interact with, everything it sees. A socialized dog remains calm and focused on its person. Yet when allowed to interact, the dog does so in a calm and collected manner.

In fact, a dog that over-reacts every time it sees a dog or a person is not a social dog at all. It can actually be considered an antisocial dog because it is easily triggered by the sight of another dog or person resulting in the dog becoming overly stimulated and losing self-control.

But how does that happen if a new puppy owner has made a concerted effort to positively allow the puppy to greet every dog and person it sees?

It happens when a new puppy owner neglects to provide leadership and allows the pup to have unstructured and uncontrolled interactions with every new person or dog that they see. This lack of proper guidance is what creates an antisocial, reactive dog with little self-control that gets over-stimulated in new environments.

We all know how important it is to expose a new puppy to as many positive experiences as possible but it is equally important that any greetings, be it with other dogs or people, are not allowed when the pup is overly excited but instead is calm in both body and mind.

To achieve that you have to patiently wait for and then reward the calm behaviour, not the overly excited behaviour.

By patiently waiting for your pup to physically calm down and give their attention to you instead of to the approaching distraction, you are shaping the dog’s behaviour and teaching it self-control. A dog that sees you as their priority, not the approaching distraction, is a dog that is social within its environment without having to interact with it.

Sure, it’s cute to see a young dog get excited as it sees someone or another dog approaching but that excitement will eventually result in an adult dog pulling its person down the street or barking at the dog as it approaches. The young dog’s behaviour will continue to unravel as it has temper tantrums when it is not allowed to do as it pleases and greet whomever it wants. It will also become a dog that views everything other than its person as the priority. If allowed to continue this disconnected attitude inevitably leads to an increase in excitement to the point where the dog is now hyper-reactive to each and every passerby on the street and the goal of socializing the pup has instead turned into a lesson in antisocial behaviour.

Seeking a calm state of mind and controlled behaviour should be the foundation of your pup’s socialization efforts. A dog that looks for guidance, asks permission and prefers its person over its environment is a well-socialized dog, confident and friendly dog.

Typically I see this woman on a daily basis as I return from my walk with my dogs. She walks 40 to 50 feet along the trail from the entrance with her dog, stops, then turns around and leaves. When I first witnessed her do this, I initially thought it was because the trail was too dark on cloudy mornings and she changed her mind about walking along the dimly lit trail.

article continues below

But today timing allowed me to be closer to her as she stepped into the trail entrance and, just as before, she stopped after a few metres, then turned around. But because I was closer to her on this day, I could see what was going on. The reason she entered the trail and stopped at the same spot was to let her dog take a poop along the trail.

She then turned and left once the dog was done. She did not pick it up but knowingly used the trail entrance as her dogs personal outhouse.

I was a bit shocked at this discovery as she was old enough to know better but clearly not willing to care.

As I made my way to where her dog had done its business I took a closer look at the area and it was obvious that this was a regular routine for the dog and owner and maybe many other owners as well.

Looking around at the poop buffet before me I got to thinking: what would possess a person to wilfully disrespect not only nature but their civil responsibility to abide by the stoop and scoop bylaw?

You have to be living under a rock to not know that you are required to clean up after your dog when it does its business in public areas.

But as I looked around at the multimillion-dollar homes that surrounded me, I thought, “Nope people are definitely not living under rocks around here.”

So maybe the problem is that they are unsure of how to clean up after their dogs? Maybe the reason for the coils of canine crap is due to a confusion between common sense and a sense of entitlement.

If that’s the case then I can offer some tips on how to safely bend, scoop and lift that bag of dog doo.

First off, remember to check with your physician that you are healthy enough to engage in the highly strenuous activity of picking up and carrying your dog’s poop.

Once cleared by your physician, walk out the door with a number of biodegradable dog poop bags in your pocket. Don’t be alarmed at the extra weight, 5 of them weighs less than the cell phone attached to your hand.

Next, when you see Fido sniffing a particular area, this is a cue that the poop squat is imminent so place said cell phone in your pocket to free up your hands. Yes, it will be an odd sensation but life is full of difficult things.

Now, place said poop bag on your hand and pull it up to cover your wrist.

Walk towards the pile of dung with confidence. Let it know that you are the boss, grrrr!

Then, remembering to bend at the knees, squat over the offending feces. Place your bag-covered open hand around the pile. Don’t be afraid, it is normal for it to be warm. Now scoop your hand under the pile of poop and lift. If you find this too strenuous, may I suggest you spend some time lifting cans of soup off the floor at home to build your strength to pick up the one-pound pile of poo.

Once the poop is in your bag-covered hand, carefully use your opposite hand to pull the ends of the bag together to allow them to be tied together. If tying knots confuses you, then just twist the top of the bag a few times. Now comes the really hard part, carrying it to the closest garbage.

This will likely feel like the longest walk in the world. The Camino de Santiago has nothing on The Poop de Trash Journey but remain calm and walk with pride.

Know you are doing the right thing by abiding by the bylaw and your moral duty as a dog owner, even if it feels like forever to get there.

I feel like a politician, dangling a big reward in front of my dogs to entice them to trust me only to trick them into agreeing to something they actually object to. Then I manipulatively convince them the meagre treat they were given at the end of the session is actually more valuable than the original big reward we started with.

article continues below

Let’s face it, neither dog nor owner really enjoys the task of nail trims. But trimming your dog’s toenails is a necessary evil and it is important to do them regularly to keep your dog healthy.

Long toenails can cause health problems. They can break and chip when walking on hard surfaces. This can lead to infection as bacteria can potentially enter into the nail bed through a split nail. Toenails that are too long can spread your pup’s feet wider than they are naturally designed to spread, causing tension on the tendons and ligaments of the feet and toes. This can result in painful toe deformity or an injured or torn flexor tendon in the toe which leads to a flattened toe that is unable to do its job of stabilization upon walking. In worse case scenarios a toenail that is overgrown can grow into a dogs footpads!

A dog’s toenails should be trimmed at least every two weeks to maintain a healthy length. Your ears can determine if your dog’s toenails are too long or just right. A healthy length is a nail that cannot be heard clicking against a hard floor when a dog walks across it. No clicking equals a healthy length.

Special nail trimming tools are required to trim your dog’s nails properly. Do not use nail clippers designed for humans as a dogs toenails are considerably harder than human nails and will splinter if trimmed with human clippers. Your choices are either a scissor or guillotine style nail clippers designed for dogs or a Dremel tool. My personal choice is a Dremel because the risk of cutting the dog’s quick which contains both a nerve and blood supply to the nail bed is nil. When you cut the quick it causes pain and it bleeds, like a lot!

But the Dremel is not risk free. The friction caused by grinding down the dog’s toenail causes the toenail to heat up and this can cause discomfort to your dog. So you do have to learn how to use the Dremel appropriately.

If you have never trimmed your dog’s toenails, I would suggest going to your veterinarian or a professional groomer to learn how to do it properly.

Some boutique pet stores offer nail trims for a nominal fee and they can also show you how to do it. There are some YouTube videos but because of the danger of cutting the dog’s quick, it is better to have someone show you directly instead of watching a video.

If you are determined to try it on your own, it is best to start by spending a few days touching your dog’s feet and gently pressing their toes while giving your pup a high value treat. Once your pup is used to having its paws handled, take the nail trimmers or Dremel tool and touch it against your dog’s toenail, but don’t attempt to trim it yet. Give your pup a treat for allowing you to do this.

Once your pup has become comfortable with the trimming tools around their feet you can attempt to trim the nail.

Start by gently pushing your thumb on the base of the toenail which will push the nail out a bit farther. Trim or file off just the curved tip of the nail, a couple of millimetres is all you should remove for your first trim as this will make the quick recede into the nailbed, allowing for more toenail to be removed on the next attempt.

It is better to err on the side of caution and leave the nail too long until you become more proficient at trimming. Don’t forget your dog’s dew claw (if they have one) which is located farther up the inside of their leg.

Whether you trim your dog’s nails on your own or take them to a professional to do it, make a habit of giving your pup a pedicure at least twice a month.

Unrelenting pain had engulfed her.

article continues below

Previously a very active and healthy person, Johnson steadily over the course of six months had become so ill that she had to use a wheelchair.

“My husband would help me off the bed,” she said. “To brush my teeth and comb my hair even hurt.”

“Everything you take for granted when you wake up in the morning, the simple things, I couldn’t do or was very painful.”

Doctors were, at first, stumped. But then came a diagnosis. She had rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.

The puzzle then became Johnson’s.

“The only reference I had about arthritis was when I heard older people say their rheumatism was acting up,” she said. “I didn’t know anything. Up until then, it wasn’t part of my world.”

But now it was, and part of her care came from the Arthritis Society, which will hold its 10th annual Walk for Arthritis on June 1 in Vancouver to support disease research and education.

The society enrolled Johnson in an outpatient day program at the Mary Pack Arthritis Centre in Vancouver where she credits a team, consisting of a rheumatologist, nurse, occupational and physiotherapists, and a social worker, for guiding her journey through the disease to a place where she is now in remission.

“That was the turning point,” she said, adding knowledge and education about the disease were vital during her way back to better health.

“With their combined help, I was able to overcome things and adjust to my new normal. That made me feel so grateful that I wanted to help others because that’s who I am,” Johnson said. “I wanted to pay it forward.”

That’s when the Arthritis Society enlisted her help to be part of their team of assistants.

Johnson has also been an ardent supporter of the fundraising walk since the very first one in 2009.

“I think it’s crucial they have the walk. It provides support for something that affects so many people,” she said, adding 6 million people in Canada suffer from some form of arthritis.

“If people come out and support us, it does a lot of good.”

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Asked on a media conference call Monday whether Vancouver might get back in the picture, Colin Smith said FIFA was focused on the original three Canadian candidate cities.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

Players were scheduled to participate in private workouts after arriving in the city a day earlier via team charter. The stadium was closed to media and the club did not schedule availabilities with players or management.

The Blue Jays would not confirm the latest positive COVID-19 case, first reported by ESPN's Jeff Passan, who said those in contact with the player did not board the flight to Toronto. Multiple media outlets also reported the news, with USA Today's Bob Nightengale saying 12 players remained in Dunedin, Fla., home of the club's spring training facility.

The latest developments came two weeks after multiple Blue Jays players and staff members tested positive for COVID-19. The team had to shut down its Dunedin complex and personnel at the facility underwent testing per protocols established by Toronto's medical team and Major League Baseball.

Players need to be cleared with two negative COVID-19 tests to join training camp. A team spokesman would not confirm how many players were in town, but said a second charter flight was expected to arrive later this week.

Canada's lone MLB team received special permission from federal government and health authorities last week to train at Rogers Centre. Players and team staff will isolate from the general public in a closed environment at the stadium and hotel attached to the venue.

Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro recently said that he would ""expect a large number of positive tests"" as more COVID-19 testing was completed as players and staffers reported to camp.

""That's going to be part of the transition process into creating the closed environment as much as possible around our players,"" he said on a June 26 conference call.

There has been a significant uptick in novel coronavirus cases throughout parts of the United States in recent weeks, including eyebrow-raising numbers coming out of Florida.

The state reported 6,336 new confirmed cases Monday. Ontario, meanwhile, reported just 154.

The Blue Jays' 60-game regular-season schedule will begin July 24 in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Tampa Bay Rays, MLB announced Monday night.

After a three-game series with the Rays and a two-game series in Washington, the Nationals also will provide the opposition for the Blue Jays in Toronto's home opener on July 29.

The Blue Jays finish the season with seven in a row at home, capped by a Sept. 27 date against the Baltimore Orioles.

Most clubs are expected to play in their home stadiums this season, but Toronto faces an additional hurdle because of border and quarantine rules during the pandemic. The team has said it hopes to play home games at Rogers Centre, but that has not been finalized.

It wasn't immediately clear how many Blue Jays trained at the stadium on Monday. Pitcher Nate Pearson posted a photo on Instagram of the empty ballpark — with retractable roof open — complete with the tagline ""We made it!""

The team is expected to hold a conference call with manager Charlie Montoyo on Tuesday afternoon. Media access to the stadium will likely begin Wednesday.

Toronto was 12-6 in pre-season play this year before spring training was stopped in mid-March amid the widening coronavirus outbreak. The Blue Jays finished the 2019 season with a 67-95 record.

Forward Connor Bedard and defenceman Mats Lindgren were two of the 113 players invited to the virtual training camp that will see players connect with national team coaches and training staff July 19-25 for a series of online sessions focused on player development.

article continues below

Bedard was the youngest player invited to the session, a position he is well accustomed to following years of playing against older competition. He is the only 2005-born player invited to the development camp, with all other players born in 2004. This spring the West Van Warriors academy player became the first ever player granted early entry into the Western Hockey League and was subsequently picked No. 1 overall in the WHL bantam draft by the Regina Pats.

Lindgren, who played for the Burnaby Winter Club academy team in 2019-20, was picked in the first round, seventh overall, by the Kamloops Blazers in the 2019 WHL draft. His name will sound familiar to many hockey fans as his father, also named Mats, played seven seasons in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders and Vancouver Canucks.

The under-17 development camp is the first introduction for most players to Hockey Canada’s Program of Excellence.

“It is a great opportunity for them to develop as players and learn what it takes to wear the Maple Leaf,” said Scott Salmond, senior vice-president of national teams with Hockey Canada. “We know our coaching and support staffs will embrace the opportunity to guide the development of the top young players in Canada.”",[]

The University of Victoria faculty of engineering is working on a way to get them there. Not on Elk Lake, but in the classroom.

The need comes because of an aging rowing machine that is no longer manufactured, but which Rowing Canada still finds useful for identifying raw power in potential recruits.

article continues below

The funding came through a grant from the RBC Training Ground program, which looks to uncover potential young Canadian sporting talent for future Olympics.

“We use the machines as an important part of our ID process, but they are getting old and breaking down,” said Samantha Heron, assistant coach with Rowing Canada and UVic, with an emphasis on Next Generation rower development with the former.

Although Concept 2 stopped manufacturing the C2 Dyno machine 13 years ago, Rowing Canada still swears by it. But the organization’s old machines are now breaking down and are difficult to fix.

“Next Gen coaching involves a lot of talent identification work, so we are always carting around these C2 Dyno machines because that is what we’ve always used,” said Heron.

“We started thinking maybe we should build our own machines. But I’m a rowing coach and not an engineer. So I reached out across the country for anyone interested in designing a replacement prototype. We are looking for a design that can be manufactured.”

Heron got a bite almost immediately.

“[UVic faculty of engineering development co-ordinator] Anna Kobb got back to me quickly,” Heron said.

It has become the summer term project for the UVic fourth-year mechanical engineering class.

“It all came together naturally,” said Kobb.

“This course is literally about design. This provided our students with an actual client we can talk to and dig into the process with. It is a perfect fit. The class is about 30 students and we have four teams working on it. We believe we can take this to the next level.”

Kobb described it as a “complex challenge” that gets the students “involved in mechanics, biomechanics, kinesology, portable design and technology for a real client, right on campus.”

Heron said she envisions applications in all sports that require an early and measurable identification of physical power.

“I can see lots of uses for this machine across various sports. Rugby would be one example,” she said.

Complicating matters is that schooling at UVic is currently being done online because of the pandemic, with only some lab work allowed in-person.

“There’s a lot of online work, via Zoom, but it’s going well,” said Kobb.

That is OK for the design phase. It is hoped more hands-on will be allowed in the fall and winter terms when nuts and bolts have to be put together to build a prototype that functions, not only theoretically on a computer screen, but the real world of metal and steel in which mechanical engineering functions.

“This is an exciting project for us in bringing together sport and engineering,” said Kobb.

Rowing Canada was among nine national sport organizations to receive grants of between $10,000 and $30,000 this year from the RBC Training Ground program. National sports organizations were asked to submit proposals. The Rowing Canada/UVic proposal was among the nine accepted.

A dramatically altered season with games full of new rules was the final result of failed financial negotiations. But for fans eager to see any baseball this year, at least now they can look forward to opening day.

article continues below

The announcement by MLB came while more players continue to test positive for the virus — at least seven on the Philadelphia Phillies alone and Colorado star Charlie Blackmon. And a stark realization remained, that if health situations deteriorate, all games could still be wiped out.

""What happens when we all get it?"" Milwaukee pitcher Brett Anderson tweeted Monday.

One day after the players' association rejected an economic agreement and left open the possibility of a grievance seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, the bickering sides agreed on an operations manual. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred then unilaterally imposed the schedule, his right under a March agreement with the union.

In a twist, the sides expanded the designated hitter to games between National League teams for the first time and instituted the radical innovation of starting extra innings with a runner on second base.

Playoff teams remain at 10 for now — there is still talk of a possible expansion. The rejected deal had called for 16 teams.

Players will start reporting for the resumption of training on July 1. It remains to be seen which players will report back to work — high-risk individuals are allowed to opt out and still receive salary and service time, but others who sit out get neither money nor the service credit needed for eligibility for free agency and salary arbitration.

Each team will play 10 games against each of its four division rivals and 20 total games against the five clubs in the corresponding regional division in the other league, according to details obtained by The Associated Press.

This will be MLB's shortest season since 1878, a schedule of such brevity that some fans may question the legitimacy of stats and records.

No decision has been made on whether fans can start attending games at some point.

""I think we need to get on the ground running and get comfortable that we can play games in empty stadiums safely before we move forward fans,"" Manfred said in an interview with the AP. ""My patience in that regard is in part based on the fact that there are so many different situations. Some places there looks like there’s no prospect. Other places they’re more aggressive. I think we need to be patient and even where we have the option, we need to make sure that we know exactly what we’re doing before we jump into it.""

No matter what, the season will be among the most unusual ever for a sport that takes pride in the race for titles being a marathon and not a sprint: Washington started 19-31 and 27-33 last year but finished 93-69 to earn a wild card and won a seven-game World Series for its first title.

""There’s a lot more pressure because in a 60-game schedule, I think that you have 25% more teams that can compete, that had no idea they were going to compete for 162 games,"" said Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz, now a broadcaster.

The trade deadline will be Aug. 31 and the deadline to be in an organization for post-season eligibility is Sept. 15. Teams can resume making trades at noon EDT on Friday, when rosters will no longer be frozen.

Active rosters will be 30 players during the first two weeks of the season, 28 during the second two weeks and 26 after that. They will not expand to 28 on Sept. 1, as originally intended this year.

With no minor leagues, teams will be allowed to retain 60 players each, including a taxi squad of up to three players, one of which must be a catcher. Taxi squad players get paid at minor league salary rates but receive a $108.50 daily allowance.

MLB is keeping the planned innovation that pitchers must face three batters or finish a half inning — players refused to agree a year ago but also waived their right to block.

The injured list minimum for pitchers will remain 10 days rather than revert to 15, as initially intended. The 60-day injured list will be a 45-day list this year and there will be a new COVID-19 injured list for players who test positive, are exposed to the virus or exhibit symptoms.

Public opinion shredded both sides as they locked in a ferocious financial battle during a pandemic that has led to more than 120,000 deaths and 2.3 million infections in the U.S. and led to a 14.7% unemployment rate, the highest since the Great Depression.

MLB hoped to be the first U.S. major sports league to return, at first with an 82-game schedule starting around the Fourth of July, but sniping broke out between management and players who distrust teams’ claims of economic losses following years of franchise appreciation. MLB claimed that without gate-related revenue it would lose $640,000 for each additional regular-season game, a figure the union disputed.

MLB became exasperated with the union’s leadership team, headed by former All-Star first baseman Tony Clark and Bruce Meyer, a litigator hired in August 2018. Manfred and Deputy Commissioner Dan Halem were infuriated when Clark said he considered the result of a one-on-one meeting with Manfred last week a proposal rather than what MLB termed a framework for a deal.

Rather than play 162 games over 186 days, the season will be 60 games over 66 or 67 days, depending on whether there is a nationally televised Thursday night opener. It is scheduled to end Sept. 27, which leaves little margin to make up September rainouts. MLB insisted it needed to complete the World Series in October, avoiding any second wave of the virus.

Players are being given staggered reporting times over several days for intake screening. The time will be used for coronavirus testing ahead of the resumption of workouts, which were stopped March 12 due to the pandemic.

Because of an uptick in infections in Florida and Arizona, 29 teams currently are leaning toward training in their regular-season ballparks. Toronto was hoping to gain government permission to work out at Rogers Centre.

Under terms of the deal the sides reached on March 26, which was to have been opening day, players would receive prorated portions of their salaries if the 60-game schedule is not cut short by the virus. Salaries originally totalled $4 billion, and the prorated portion of about 37% reduces pay to $1.48 billion.

Salaries were to have ranged from $563,500 at the minimum to $36 million for Mike Trout and Gerrit Cole at the top, but the spread would now be from $208,704 to $13,333,333.

MLB had sought last month in its initial economic plan to reduce pay to about $1 billion, and players vowed not to give up full prorated pay and proposed a 114-game schedule that amounted to $2.8 billion.

The relationship deteriorated back to the level of the acrimonious labour disputes that led to eight work stoppages from 1972-95, and the union has threatened a grievance claiming MLB didn’t fulfil the provision in the March deal requiring the longest season economically feasible, conditioned by several other provisions. MLB would claim the union bargained in bad faith, and the case would be argued before arbitrator Mark Irvings.

That would be a prelude to the expiration of the current labour contract on Dec. 1, 2021, which likely will be followed by a lockout.

The group announced its formation in a statement released Monday.

San Jose Sharks forward Evander Kane and former NHL player Akim Aliu were named co-heads of the group, while Buffalo Sabres forward Wayne Simmonds, Minnesota Wild defenceman Matt Dumba, Detroit Red Wings defenceman Trevor Daley, Philadelphia Flyers forward Chris Stewart and recently retired forward Joel Ward make up the executive committee.

The group said in its release that its mission is ""to eradicate racism and intolerance in hockey."" It will be independent from the NHL but hopes to work with the league.

Racism in hockey was brought to the forefront last year with allegations made by Aliu against then-Calgary Flames head coach Bill Peters. Aliu said Peters directed racial slurs at him when both were with the same minor-league team a decade ago. Peters resigned as Flames head coach shortly after the allegations were made public.

Aliu followed that up by penning a Players' Tribune article last month where he said change in hockey is needed at a grassroots level.

Kane called for fellow NHL players to speak out on racial inequality after the death of George Floyd, a black man who was killed in Minneapolis when a white police officer put a knee on his throat for nearly nine minutes.

More than 100 players have since used their platform to speak on Floyd's death and the ensuing protests in the U.S. against police brutality and racial injustice.

223,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/sports/nba-owners-approve-22-team-season-restart-plan-1.24146776,NBA owners approve 22-team season restart plan,['Tim Reynolds'],,"The NBA’s Board of Governors has approved a 22-team format for restarting the league season in late July at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida, another major step toward getting teams back onto the court and playing games again.

The format calls for each team playing eight games to determine playoff seeding plus the possible utilization of a play-in tournament for the final spot in the Eastern Conference and Western Conference post-season fields. The National Basketball Players Association has a call on Friday to approve the plan as well.

article continues below

Thursday's vote was the most significant step yet in the process of trying to resume a season that was suspended nearly three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. There are numerous other details for the league to continue working through — including finalizing specifics of what the testing plan will be once teams arrive next month at the ESPN Wide World Of Sports complex and the calculating the financial ramifications of playing a shortened regular season.

""The Board’s approval of the restart format is a necessary step toward resuming the NBA season,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. ""While the COVID-19 pandemic presents formidable challenges, we are hopeful of finishing the season in a safe and responsible manner based on strict protocols now being finalized with public health officials and medical experts.""

Meanwhile, a person speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the details of the ongoing talks have not been publicly released, said the NBPA and the NBA are continuing to work on a ""lengthy"" medical protocols document. The details of that document will be shared with teams once those discussions are completed, said the person, who added that teams should receive them in plenty of time for them to prepare for their arrivals at the Disney-ESPN complex.

The NBA also said it is planning to have the draft lottery Aug. 25, the draft on Oct. 15 and start next season on Dec. 1.

If all 22 teams that are going to Disney next month play their allotted eight games before the post-season begins, the NBA would play 1,059 games in this regular season. That means 171 regular season games would be cancelled, which could cost players around $600 million in salary.

Those 22 clubs would play somewhere between 71 and 75 regular season games if the Disney portion of the schedule is completed, down from the customary 82-game slate. The teams who didn’t qualify for the restart will see their seasons end after having played somewhere between 64 and 67 games.

But one of the biggest hurdles is now cleared, and if things go according to plan an NBA champion for a season unlike any other will be crowned in October. The season could go into that month if the league goes ahead with its plan for the same playoff rules as usual, that being every round utilizing a best-of-seven format.

Teams will likely arrive at the Disney complex around July 7. Once there, camps will continue and teams will likely have the chance to have some scrimmages or ""preseason"" games against other clubs before the regular season resumes.

Thursday's move by the board of governors — one that came, coincidentally, on the same day this season’s NBA Finals would have started if these were normal times — was largely a formality. The NBA considered countless restart options after suspending the season on March 11, whittled that list down to four possibilities last week and from there the 22-team plan quickly began gaining momentum.

The 22-team plan includes all teams that were holding playoff spots when the season was stopped, plus all other clubs within six games of a post-season berth.

Milwaukee, the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston and reigning NBA champion Toronto had already clinched playoff berths. Now with only eight games remaining for each team, it means that eight other clubs — Miami, Indiana, Philadelphia, the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver, Utah, Oklahoma City and Houston — have post-season spots secured, and Dallas virtually has one as well.

That leaves nine teams vying for three remaining playoff berths. In the East, Brooklyn, Orlando and Washington are in the race for two spots. In the West, Memphis, Portland, New Orleans, Sacramento, San Antonio and Phoenix will jostle for one spot.

If the gap between eighth place and ninth place in either conference is four games or less when the shortened regular season ends, those teams will go head-to-head for the No. 8 seed. The team in ninth place would have to go 2-0 in a two-game series to win the berth; otherwise, the No. 8 seed would advance to the post-season.

Thursday’s decision also means that the seasons for Atlanta, Cleveland, New York, Golden State, Minnesota, Detroit, Chicago and Charlotte are over. The Knicks will miss the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, the third-longest current drought in the league behind Sacramento and Phoenix — who still have chances of getting into the playoffs this season.

And with the Hawks not moving on, it also means Vince Carter has almost certainly played the final game of his 22-year NBA career — the longest in league history.

Carter, the first player in NBA history to appear in four different decades, is retiring. He appeared in 1,541 NBA games, behind only Robert Parish (1,611) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) on the league’s all-time list.

The guidelines were produced by viaSport, in conjunction with WorkSafe BC, to help sport organizations develop their own plans for returning to action following the cessation of all activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to viaSport, a provincial agency that oversees more than 70 B.C. sport organizations, individual sport provincial governing bodies are now tasked with creating their own detailed plans for bringing their sports back while considering the safety of participants, staff and the community.

Maintaining physical distancing, minimal sharing of equipment, focusing on skill development and small group training, and remaining focused on local communities are some of the key considerations outlined by viaSport.

“For the foreseeable future, sport should be more geared towards community participation and training rather than games and provincial competition,” viaSport’s release stated.

Today BC Soccer released an update on their return to play plan, indicating that member clubs could be able to officially resume modified training programs on June 12 provided they have followed the steps set out by the provincial soccer governing body. On Monday, Baseball BC stated they will soon release their return to play guidelines, but cautioned that on-field activities will not resume right away.

“We caution baseball stakeholders that several things still need to happen before any on-field activity can begin,” the release stated. “This will take some time.”

Youth baseball seasons across B.C. were paused before they began this year, as the COVID-19 crisis came as many leagues were in the process of picking their spring teams and finalizing their schedules. They may not yet know exactly when it will happen or what it will look like, but the North Shore Baseball Association is working on plans to get back on the field soon.

“We are reviewing this information and looking forward to additional information from both Baseball BC and B.C. Minor Baseball shortly,” NSBA vice-president Jon Alpen told the North Shore News. “As an association, we want to resume play as soon as possible in a safe and responsible manner. Many of our players and their families can’t wait to get back to baseball this year and we are doing everything we can to make that happen.”

Winter soccer seasons around the Lower Mainland were winding down when the pandemic shut things down, but spring seasons and summer development programs were just gearing up. North Vancouver Football Club technical director Steve Kindel said his club has fully refunded any players who were signed up for spring teams or development programs and NVFC is now focused on preparing for summer development programs. The club is aiming to restart team play in some form in late August, said Kindel.

Many B.C. hockey leagues had just completed their winter seasons or were in the middle of their playoffs when COVID-19 put an end to play, and spring hockey seasons have also been scuttled. At the North Shore Winter Club, a private facility with its own minor hockey association, players have started getting back on the ice in recent weeks in very limited numbers and under strict safety protocols. Team play, however, is still a ways away.

“The hope of all of us is that hockey returns in the fall just as it normally does; with tryouts, and tiering games, contact and non-contact options for every boy and girl, and everything else that we are used to in September and October,” read a message to members sent by the club’s hockey department and minor hockey committee. The club, however, indicated they would be working on a Plan B in the event that hockey does not resume as normal in the fall.

“In the event that the traditional PCAHA season is cancelled, we are prepared to deliver numerous options, which may include operating our own league out of the NSWC to ensure all our members have access to a safe, competitive league as well as a recreational league which will follow all of the health authority guidelines.”

During her daily press briefings over the past several weeks, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said that getting people – young people in particular – back outside and taking part in physical activity was an important concern as the province begins loosening some COVID-19 restrictions. She has also noted the public is at little risk of contracting the coronavirus while outside, and that there appears to be very little risk of children contracting COVID-19, getting sick from the virus or transmitting it to others.

When sport governing bodies finalize their return to play plans they will be posted on the viaSport website. As of the afternoon of June 3, sport specific guidelines had been posted for only archery and rowing.",[]

“I wish we could be doing tournaments on the ice,” said NSWC hockey program and events co-ordinator Emily Allen. “But we figured this is kind of a good opportunity to still have the kids trying to get together but virtually, obviously, and come together through hockey, just a different way than they normally do.”

The Winter Club, shut down in March like most other large facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has reopened to some activities recently, including individual or small group on-ice sessions for members, but the return of full-on team hockey still appears to be a long way off. This online tournament provides a good opportunity for players to get some of that feeling of playing with their hockey friends again, said Allen.

“I think it'll be cool to bring kids together who haven't seen each other but were on the same team last year, or in spring hockey they would have been, and now they're obviously not doing that,” she said.

The online tournament – which is open to everyone, not just club members – will also act as a fundraiser for the club’s minor hockey program. Typically at this time of year the Winter Club would be prepping for golf and road hockey tournaments as fundraisers, but those are off the table this year.

It’s $30 to register for the e-sports hockey tournament, with half proceeds going to the club’s minor hockey association (the other half will go to the company that is running the tournament). If all goes well, there may be more online tournaments coming up in the future, said Allen.

“It should be fun, and there seems to be a lot of interest. So we're hoping it'll grow.”

The experiences taught the 19-year-old budding Bayern Munich star to make the best out of situations.

""I've always been like that, it's in my character,"" he told ""51,"" Bayern's official club magazine. ""Life is too short to be angry or sad for long.

""I think it runs in my family. We went through tough times when I was very young and I'm so infinitely grateful to my parents. Their journey began during the civil war in Liberia and we came to Canada via Ghana. I'm in the happy situation where I can say I can enjoy every single day of my life.""

Davies, who came to Canada with his family when he was five, knows not everyone can say that.

""Yes, I'm afraid that's true,"" he said. ""And that's why you just have to be grateful because there are lots of people in the world who aren't so well off.

""I know that there are other sides to life. All the more reason why I now try to convey to the people out there how important it is to feel a sense of joy. I try to do that on the soccer pitch and also off it, and that includes in a few video clips (on social media).""

Davies said he grew up quickly, having to look after the family when his parents worked in shifts in Edmonton.

""You'll move from big brother to the adult world faster by cooking food for your younger siblings while your peers are playing video games,"" he said. ""My dad had to go to work at 4 a.m. and got back around 2 p.m. My mum worked from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.

""Every day before I went to school, I'd already looked after my siblings. In the evenings, I often put them to bed. It was a hard time, but at the same time we were doing very well. We were happy. My family is everything for me.""

As a consequence, Davies says he wants to be ""an inspiration to lots and lots of children.""

""We came to Canada as refugees from Africa and worked hard for everything we have,"" he told the magazine. ""I think my life can show people that a lot is possible if you stay true to yourself and don't let yourself be led astray.

""When children all over the world see me playing and hear the story behind it, it's nice to imagine them drawing motivation from it and developing the courage to work on their own dreams as well.""

Davies says his father helped keeps his feet on the ground.

""When I told him on the phone about my first goal for Bayern, he said: 'Oh, really? You play for Bayern now? That's how he is, he's always like that,"" said Davies. ""Like I said, I think it's important not to take yourself too seriously.""

The 26-team league suspended play March 12 because of the global pandemic, two weeks into its 2020 season.

article continues below

The MLS Players Association said in a release Sunday evening that its membership had voted to accept ""salary reductions across the entire player pool, reduced team and individual bonuses, and additional concessions to existing and future terms of the CBA.""

""While a difficult vote in incredibly challenging times, it was taken collectively to ensure that players can return to competition as soon as they are safely able to do so,"" the MLSPA said. ""The package has been formally submitted to the league for a decision by the owners.""

In February, the league and MLSPA agreed to an agreement in principle on a new collective bargaining agreement that covers five seasons from 2020.

But, because of the global pandemic, the deal never got formal approval by the MLS board of governors and the MLSPA membership. Under the deal announced Sunday, the CBA will be extended by a year.

The league declined a request for comment.

With soccer on the sidelines, the two sides have been in discussions on wages with the league on hiatus.

A source with knowledge of the talks, not authorized to speak publicly because the negotiations have been private, said in April the league had proposed guaranteeing players 50 per cent of their annual salary if no more games are played this season.

The percentage of pay would rise if more games are played — how much more would depend on how many games and whether they were played before fans.

Players earning under US$100,000 would not be affected. The minimum salary for players on a team's senior roster is $81,375 this year. The minimum for those on the reserve roster, usually younger players, is $63,547.

The MLSPA did not say what it had agreed to in Sunday's statement.

Teams have been given the green light as of Monday to start training in small groups, presuming they meet the approval of local authorities and the league. Toronto FC is set to take advantage of that Monday.

Previously teams had been restricted to voluntary individual workouts.

Track meet day is always a favourite for many elementary students, but this year COVID-19 has ensured that the little speedsters across Canada won’t be able to step into the blocks side-by-side for a good-old fashioned foot race. But tomorrow young athletes will get the next best things as West Vancouver students from kindergarten through Grade 7 will pace out their own runs, jumps and throws for a virtual track meet against their friends from across the district.

article continues below

“Normally those track meets are very cherished days in our community, and so that was the impetus for trying to do our best to recreate as much of that as we can, even though people will be doing it individually,” said Liz Hill, the district’s director of instruction, who will help run the meet along with lead organizer and Cypress Park Primary vice principal Robyn Evans.

At 8:30 a.m. sharp tomorrow morning every elementary student in the West Vancouver school district will be emailed a link to a website which will set out the competition, complete with warmup and instructional videos, details on uploading results and other fun and functional event information. Students will be tasked with tabulating their own results, likely with the help of parents or others in their bubbles, while competing in five events: timed 100-metre and 300-m races, a one-kilometre run that will be judged on completion, a tennis ball toss and the standing long jump.

Students will submit their scores to receive a participation award, with organizers hoping that many will take the opportunity to show off their school spirit by wearing team jerseys or shirts and hitting up the designated hashtags on social media channels.

“We think we've created a pretty good website that's easy for people to navigate through,” said Hill. “We've done it as best we can, and now we get to let the students run with it, literally.”

Organizers are hoping to capture some of the excitement of the annual track meet that is a school-year highlight for so many teachers and students.

“It's one of our favourite days of the year,” said Hill. “It brings all of our elementary schools across West Vancouver together. We have a wonderful tradition of coming together at West Van Secondary and participating. Leading up to it lots of amazing things happen in our schools, and we didn’t want to lose that just because we weren't in-person, in-class in our schools.”",[]

NHL players have been inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame before, but usually for their body of work on the ice.

article continues below

What's unique about the induction of Kennedy and O'Ree is they enter the Hall as builders.

O'Ree, now 84, overcame racism to be the first black player in the NHL.

The Fredericton winger broke the NHL's colour barrier in 1958 playing for the Boston Bruins and went onto play 45 games for the organization.

Kennedy, from Elkhorn, Man., was sexually abused by his junior hockey coach. After a 10-year NHL career, he devoted his life to the prevention of abuse, bullying and harassment in sport.

""An induction, an acknowledgment such as Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, with the issues that Willie represents, I represent, I think brings an importance to them, allows us to keep doing the work and keep moving forward in this area,"" Kennedy told The Canadian Press.

""Championships are important. People love to watch championships, but I come from a place where I see sport as a platform and as a vehicle to really deliver and move difficult issues. That's what we're seeing this year.""

Basketball player Steve Nash, golfer Lorie Kane, track and field athlete Diane Jones-Konihowski, wheelchair curler Sonja Gaudet, the horse-and-rider team of Eric Lamaze and Hickstead, and power lifter powerlifter John (Jackie) Barrett were the athletes announced Wednesday for induction.

Mohawk lacrosse player and coach Ross Powless, wheelchair rugby founder and player Duncan Campbell and Commonwealth Games leader Judy Kent join O'Ree and Kennedy as builders.

The Sports Hall of Fame is inducting six athletes and five builders in recognition of its 65th anniversary in 2020.

The annual fall induction gala has been postponed to 2021 because of COVID-19.

""In these uncertain times, we are thrilled to be able to share a good news story and to have this remarkable group of people to induct into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame next year,"" Hall president and chief executive officer Cheryl Bernard said in a statement.

The Hall, located in Calgary, has now inducted 681 athletes and builders.

Nash, from Victoria, played 18 years in the NBA. The guard was twice named the league's most valuable player.

Charlottetown's Kane earned four career LPGA victories.

She became the second Canadian to earn multiple LPGA titles in one season in 2000, following Sandra Post and preceding Brooke Henderson.

""My first win stands out as something quite significant because it did take me a little while to get there,"" Kane said.

""I was taught by my parents to leave it better than I found it. I hope that I've done that with my sport of golf and sport in general because I frankly wouldn't be here without the introduction of sport in my life.""

Montreal's Lamaze and Hickstead won Olympic show-jumping gold and team silver at the 2008 Olympic Games.

Hickstead, who died in the competition ring in 2011, is the third horse to earn induction joining racehorse Northern Dancer (1965) and Ian Millar's show-jumping steed Big Ben (1996).

""I'm especially happy for Hickstead,"" Lamaze said in a statement. ""In our sport, it takes two athletes, one human and one equine, working together and in Hickstead I found a true partner.""

Vancouver's Jones-Konihowski claimed pentathlon gold at Commonwealth and Pan American Games.

The two-time Olympian was a medal contender for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but Canada boycotted those games.

Sonja Gaudet of Vernon, B.C., won three gold medals in Paralympic curling.

Barrett, from Halifax, earned a career 13 gold powerlifting medals in the Special Olympics World Games.

Powless, from the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, Ont., was a standout lacrosse player who went on to coach players to success and organize lacrosse leagues and tournaments.

He died in 2003 at the age 76. Powless's late son Gaylord was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2017.

""Dad came from a lacrosse history in terms of the culture,"" Powless's son Richard said. ""Lacrosse was referred to as the creator's game, historically and culturally used to settle disputes. It was a medicine game to help heal people.

""He excelled at it from a young age and he continued that throughout his career winning many individual awards in scoring and MVP player on several championship with Peterborough in the fifties.

""My dad would have been very proud knowing he was joining Gaylord. It means a lot to our family.""

Winnipeg's Campbell is known as ""The Quadfather"" because he was one of the inventors of the sport known today as wheelchair rugby. He played for and coached the national team.

Kent, from Picton, Ont., was the first woman to serve as president of Commonwealth Games Canada from 1994 to 1998.

Bettman said that the season – which will not resume until public health officials deem it appropriate and is likely to commence no earlier than mid-July – will continue with a 24-team play-in format concentrated in two hub cities.

The other cities named by Bettman as being under consideration are Chicago, Columbus (OH), Dallas, Edmonton, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, St. Paul (MN), Pittsburgh and Toronto. No date has been announced for a decision on which two cities will be chosen.

""We need to do a tremendous amount of testing without disrupting current health care needs,"" Bettman said. ""We don't know what the world will look like in three weeks... We want to make a decision in that time instead of making a decision that will look outdated by that time.

""There's a new world out there, and we have to be adaptable... which is what we have been in this process.""

B.C. premier John Horgan had previously said that he spoke with Bettman on the possibility of hosting the entire 24-team grouping with provincial borders, with the use of Western Hockey League arenas in cities like Kelowna, Kamloops and Victoria to host beyond Rogers Arena in Vancouver.

The NHL is reportedly looking for cities with a large quantity of NHL-level ice facilities (to accommodate practices and games), as well as supporting infrastructure like hotel rooms and services needed by players and league staff.

Bettman said the NHL's Phase 3 opening (the start of training camp) would not start until July at the earliest, and the season will likely extend into early fall. However, Bettman also noted that the priority is to make sure there is a full 2020-2021 season - although that may start later than normal.

When the current season resumes, the Vancouver Canucks will be placed in the same hub city as 12 Western Conference qualifies and face the Minnesota Wild in the play-in round.",[]

Here in North Vancouver and West Vancouver we are blessed to have a solution to this conundrum right outside our doors, according to the author of a new guide to family walks and hikes on the North Shore. Pick any front porch on the entire North Shore, and chances are you are just a few blocks away from a wild and wonderful walk.

article continues below

“That's actually one of the best things about living on the North Shore,” said Harry Crerar, author of Family Walks and Hikes on Greater Vancouver’s North Shore (Rocky Mountain Books, $20). “You're never too far from an awesome hiking trail. You're never too far from something to explore.”

Crerar would know. His dad is renowned North Shore outdoorsman David Crerar, creator of the Bagger Challenge, an annual contest to see which trail runner could climb, or “bag,” the most mountain peaks in the Vancouver area. You could imagine Harry’s first pair of baby booties coming with a set of crampons.

“I’ve been hiking since I could walk, really,” said Harry. “One of my earliest memories is actually climbing up Goat Mountain with my dad when I was about five or six.”

He’s only just 18 years old now, but this is already Harry’s second book, having teamed up with his father to co-write The Glorious Mountains of Vancouver’s North Shore: A Peakbagger’s Guide (released in 2016).

The new book begins with a short introduction, which includes the all-important description of the 10 essentials everyone should carry if they venture into the wild, followed by a list of 45 hikes and walks on the North Shore and five on Howe Sound islands. The book is geared towards families, and Crerar gives a rating for each one describing the difficulty of each as well as listing some specific challenges or dangers that might be encountered on the trail.

The project was completed before the COVID-19 crisis hit, but the book might be even more vital now that people are looking for ways to stay healthy and sane while avoiding large crowds.

“I definitely wasn’t expecting this,” Crerar said about the timing of it all. “Hiking, for my family at least, it’s been a good way to get out and destress in these stressful times.”

That family feel is present throughout the book, as there are several colour photos accompanying the descriptions, many of which feature Crerar and his three younger siblings, age 16, 12 and seven.

“Parts of it are a bit like a family photo album,” he said. ""That was that was one of the fun parts about researching this book. I'd do a lot of these hikes with my siblings. ... I could see what parts they liked, what they enjoyed. I added a lot of that into the book.”

And there are definitely some tricks you can use to spruce up a hike for a young child, said Crerar.

“There's a lot of stuff that maybe an adult wouldn't know,” he said. “Like, sometimes something like a big rock, to an adult it’s just a rock, but kids can play around it. They can pretend it's a castle. They can play hide and seek behind it. They're a lot closer to the ground than we are, so they see different things.”

The descriptions in the book include many references to landmarks that may catch a kid's eye or make for a nice carrot to dangle in front of a reluctant hiker.

“One thing I like to do is play games along the trail and stuff like that. We often do a scavenger hunt or play a game based on the book The Guffalo, where one person is the Gruffalo and they have to find everyone. There are ways to make hiking more fun in a way that appeals to kids. … It's a great way to get more family bonding time because you can explore a new trail together or discover something together. And it also gets kids outside, gets them active, which is always great. And I'd like to say hiking has definitely given me a better appreciation of the environment, of nature, of how lucky we are to be here.”

In speaking to the North Shore News Crerar noted a few things to keep in mind given the specific limitations currently in place for the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, the North Shore's two provincial parks are still closed, taking several popular hikes off the table. Even during normal times, there’s no reason to constantly hit the always-crowded favourites like the Quarry Rock Trail when so many other great hikes are wide open, said Crerar.

The Mosquito Creek Trail passes just a stone’s throw away from Capilano Mall in the heart of North Vancouver, but within a few steps you are in a beautiful forest following a winding creek on a perfect hike for the COVID era.

“It’s perfect for social distancing because it’s a really wide trail,” said Crerar. “It’s easy to avoid people.”

There are so many others just like it too, he said, listing off the Varley Trail, the Kings Mill Walk, the extensive trail network in Lighthouse Park, or the Coho Loop. The slightly more adventurous might try a hike to Norvan Falls, while the list goes on and on with the difficulty ramping up.

“There's so many other fun trails that aren't that popular,” he said, adding that he’s not worried about any criticism that may come his way for “spilling the secrets” about trails favoured by locals.

“If I do get that [criticism] it's worth it if I've brought some of these hikes to more people’s attention,” he said. “I feel lucky that I grew up exploring all these places and I hope everyone on the North Shore can discover them too.”",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

237,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/sports/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Hopefully your go-to.

We've hired Daniel Wagner as a full-time staffer to head up our new Pass it to Bulis section, which is actually old enough to be in grade five; Wagner launched PITB as a blog ten years ago in a basement with his friend Harrison Mooney (who is now at The Province).

article continues below

They started taking things seriously for the 2010-2011 season and, according to Wagner, ""couldn't have picked a better time"" as the team had the best season in franchise history and ""everyone was clamouring for more Canucks content; we were there to provide it.""

The blog grew in popularity and the Vancouver Sun picked it up, providing a part-time job to the prolific writer. In 2015 he left the Sun and our sister publication the Vancouver Courier became the new home of PITB, running daily stories on their website as well as weekly features in their printed newspaper.

As of today we're moving Daniel over to Vancouver Is Awesome to expand on PITB, featuring articles from a new stable of regular freelance contributors he'll be editing, while also continuing his own signature coverage.

Here's the roster for our inagural season so far, with Wagner as Captain:

- Jackson McDonald, the managing editor of CanucksArmy, will be bringing his acerbic wit and trenchant analysis to PITB.

- Lachlan Irvine has covered both the Canucks for The Daily Hive and the San Jose Sharks for Fear the Fin. He brings some much-needed knowledge of goaltending to the site.

- Will Graham, long-time contributor to PITB in the past, will make his return to the site with his heart, humour, and hopefully photoshops of toast intact.

- David Quadrelli and Natalie Hoy were two of the up-and-coming writers featured in The Botchford Project, which gives young writers an opportunity to cover a game and publish an article on the Canucks website. Full of passion and talent, they're our top draft picks.

- And speaking of draft picks, Cody Severtson does unparalleled coverage of the Canucks' farm team the Utica Comets on his blog, Comets Harvest. He'll be giving fans a closer look at exciting prospects on the farm, like Kole Lind and Brogan Rafferty.

And that's just a start. We're in conversation with other writers to bring more unique voices to PITB on V.I.A., and we're also open to submissions; writers can pitch ideas to submissions@passittobulis.com, along with some writing samples.

The thing that sets Daniel and PITB apart from the others is that they've always provided Canucks coverage that's a little bit off-kilter, taking the silliest aspects of hockey way too seriously and poking holes in the facade of the most serious aspects. You can expect both serious analysis of the Canucks on-ice play and plenty of humour that sometimes still makes a serious point.

Look for multiple Canucks stories from us every day from here on out, located in the Pass It To Bulis section HERE. And be sure to pick up the Vancouver Courier newspaper every week as the PITB weekly feature will continue to live on in print.",[]
239,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/sports/zack-kassian-opens-up-about-his-journey-to-sobriety-on-ryan-kesler-and-kevin-bieksa-s-podcast-1.24056719,Zack Kassian opens up about his journey to sobriety on Ryan Kesler and Kevin Bieksa’s podcast,['Daniel Wagner'],,"It seems like everyone has a podcast these days. Not every podcast, however, also has a combined 1,996 games of NHL experience between the two hosts.

That’s what two former Canucks, Ryan Kesler and Kevin Bieksa, have: both 1,996 NHL games and a podcast. The Kes & Juice Podcast is a fun listen, as the two long-time friends share stories from their days in the NHL and perspective on current NHL news, along with a surprising amount of The Bachelor updates.

article continues below

In their most recent episode, Kesler and Bieksa weighed in on the incident between Zack Kassian and Matthew Tkachuk, an incident the NHL’s Department of Player Safety handled poorly. In an incredible coincidence, they lined up an interview with Kassian before the incident happened.

Or, perhaps it wasn’t a coincidence at all.

“I’m not taking credit for anything, but I say to him, ‘Hey do something interesting this week, like maybe a Gordie Howe Hat Trick,’” said Bieksa, “and then two days later, this thing happens.”

Kassian, or as Kesler and Bieksa call him, “The Big Cat,” touched on the revival of the Alberta rivalry, partly thanks to Kassian’s actions.

“This is a fun time,” said Kassian, “The way the game has evolved, there’s not too many incidents like this anymore.”

“Good TV ratings,” Kassian added in reference to the rematch after the All-Star break. “Bettman should give me a call, I’d love to see the TV ratings, this is good for hockey. At the end of the day, they’re a good team, we’re a good team, we’re fighting to get into the playoffs — who doesn’t like this?”

They also got into an infamous incident when Kassian was with the Canucks, when Bieksa and Kassian started fighting in the elevator, with poor Frank Corrado trying to break it up.

“I was probably being an idiot,” laughed Kassian.



The real meat of the episode, however, came when they asked Kassian about his sobriety. Kassian has had a well-publicised battle with substance abuse, specifically alcoholism, but has come out the other side with the tools and knowledge to stay sober, and has turned his career around with the Edmonton Oilers.

“You guys were the main source of helping me out in the beginning,” said Kassian. “I went to Vancouver and it was an older team and I think there were some warning signs that I could’ve ruined my career. You guys tried to step in and intervene multiple times.”

That’s good to hear from a Canucks perspective. The team was criticized when Kassian was traded to Montreal for not doing enough to help Kassian through his substance abuse problems, but knowing that the veteran leadership in the room were trying means a lot.

“One thing I’ve learned through this whole process of getting clean is the only way you’re going to do it is if you want to do it yourself,” said Kassian. “You’ve got to be willing to help yourself. Sadly, you guys tried to help multiple times, but it took, ultimately, a car accident to hit my rock bottom and to really think about what I was doing and how it was affecting the people around me, not only my career, but my family, my friends, and my teammates.

“You guys tried to put a stop to it, you guys tried to help the best way you could, and you planted the seed. There were days where I was thinking about what you guys said. You guys were two NHLers, played a long time, two leaders of our team, clearly you’re not just going to intervene for no reason.”

Kassian wasn’t behind the wheel for the car accident, which resulted in a broken nose and foot, but it was still his truck and he certainly bore responsibility. He admitted in his testimony in court that he had been drinking and using cocaine prior to the accident.

“Obviously the incident in Montreal was pretty humbling,” he said. “After that accident, my world came crumbling down. There’s no easy way to put it: I broke down, I cried a couple times, I didn’t think I was going to get back to the NHL, to be honest.

“I struck out with Buffalo, Vancouver didn’t want me, my last chance was in Montreal and I screwed that one up before the season even started. That was really a turning point and right then and there I knew something was wrong and I had to get better and I surrendered. That day changed my life.”

Kassian then joked, “When I go back to Montreal, I want to go dig up that tree that got hit, that the girl hit driving, and plant it in my backyard because, essentially, that’s what changed my life.”

Perhaps the most heartwarming aspect of the episode is Kesler and Bieksa talking about how proud they are of Kassian. You can tell how much they care about their former teammate.

Kassian also talked about the life-changing experience of having a daughter and the support system of his family as he’s battled to get clean.

“I wish I would’ve figured it out at a younger age,” said Kassian, “but sometimes you’ve got to take a different path.”

The biggest bombshell of the interview, however, is that Matt Kassian now helps Bieksa manage his money.

Okay, that’s not actually a bombshell, but it is pretty random. Canucks fans might remember Matt Kassian from the Kassassin controversy: started to call Zack Kassian “The Kassassin,” which angered Matt Kassian, who had the nickname legally trademarked.

Apparently, Matt Kassian took trademarking his nickname seriously because he saw the importance of taking care of your assets. He’s now a financial advisor, who often works with professional athletes because of his own experience in the NHL. I wonder if he still goes by “Kassassin” when he’s helping his clients navigate their investments.

“That guy always had a bone with me,” said Kassian. “Remember, he played in Minnesota when I played in Vancouver. He lined up with me and just right away, he slashed me and said, ‘Let’s see who the tougher Kassian is.’ I’m like, holy s***, man, I’m 22 and this guy’s heavy and I’m, like, whoa relax a little bit here. Thank god he left me alone after that.”

Prior to the Kassian interview, Kesler and Bieksa delved into a number of topics, from grotesque mouth injuries and the perils of using a different dentist when on the road, to The Bachelor and who Kesler’s ideal Bachelorette would be.

The most interesting segment for Canucks fans was when they were talking about the Kassian/Tkachuk incident and brought up how similar Tkachuk’s hits were to those of their former teammate, Raffi Torres.

“It’s the Raffi Torres hit,” said Kesler. “That’s what it was exactly. And the fact that the league’s defending that and basically ran Raffi out of the f***ing league because of those hits, and then Tkachuk does it twice in one game? To be honest, we all know what Tkachuk’s doing: he’s trying to hurt him.”

“Maybe he’s not meaning to hurt him, but he’s certainly meaning to blow him up,” said Bieksa.

“The league’s not being f***ing consistent at all,” said Kesler. “I think that’s where the confusion comes in. But if Tkachuk’s going to play like that, he has to fight. Period.”

“We used to feed off of Raffi’s hits,” said Bieksa. “Remember when he hit Seabrook behind the net? Looking at it today, it was like the Scott Stevens hit on [Paul] Kariya and [Eric] Lindros: big time late, interference. It was like a swing hit that swung all the momentum in the series.”

“How about when he used to come down from the point once a game and just take a run at the guy, whether he got him or not,” added Bieksa. “The guys down low, the forwards down low trying to make their plays, were like, ‘Heads up!’ when he was on the ice.”

Finally, there was this golden exchange when Kesler and Bieksa were talking about injuries.

“You make fun of my nose every other f***ing day,” said Kesler.

“I say your nose is really big and sticks out, but mine’s big and flat,” Bieksa replied. “So we both have nose issues, but we’re still models.”

“Obviously,” said Kesler. “Nose models.”

Give these two nose models a listen. The entire episode is great and it will likely leave you wanting more. Fortunately, there are six other episodes to listen to so far.

240,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/sports/iwtg-canucks-claim-first-place-in-pacific-division-by-throttling-the-sharks-1.24056069,IWTG: Canucks claim first place in Pacific Division by throttling the Sharks,['Daniel Wagner'],,"Heading into the All-Star break, the Vancouver Canucks are first in the Pacific Division

Sure, if they had lost this game, they would be fifth in the Pacific Division and 19th in the NHL, because the Pacific is a hot mess and the NHL has taken parity to a dangerous extreme that threatens us all, but let’s focus on the positive.

article continues below

Since mid-December, the Canucks have been on a tear, interrupted only briefly by the fiasco in Florida. They’ve now won 11 of their last 14 games and sit atop the Pacific with games in hand on three of the four Pacific teams that are a point behind them. Yes, four Pacific Division teams are one point behind the Canucks. Like I said, it’s a hot mess.

The Canucks are now on-pace for 97 points, which is well beyond even the most optimistic preseason projections. Tanner Pearson is a point-per-game in his last 31 games, Jake Virtanen looks like a legitimate first-line forward, and Loui Eriksson, of all people, is suddenly a fan favourite.

It’s a wonderful and enjoyable hot streak and the great thing about hot streaks is that they keep going forever and they never end and everyone stays happy and there are rainbows and puppies all the time. It’s pretty great.

There’s definitely a little part of me that is saying something like the following: “Yes, everything is going well right now, but that’s because everything is going well, and the Canucks are still just inches away from being out of the playoffs. What happens when things stop going so well? What happens when the regression kicks in? What happens when someone important gets injured? Do you really believe the Canucks can keep this rolling through the second half of the season?”

I’m trying to ignore that little part of me, because winning is fun and life’s too short to always be worried about regression. You should only worry about regression 33% of the time. I got out all my regression-sweats in the afternoon, so I didn’t even think about regression one time while I watched this game.

Team Chaos would have appreciated an overtime loss, actually, as that would have led to a five-way tie for first place in the Pacific.

I joked around in the intro, because that’s what I do, but this run has honestly been great and there are a lot of really positive signs for the future. It’s way more fun to write about a team that’s playing well and it’s also a lot more fun to be in the room talking to the players when they’re on a roll. When hockey players are in a bad mood, they tend to be less-inclined to answer some of the sillier questions I like to ask.

Speaking of bad moods, everyone on the Sharks seemed to be in one in this game, probably because the Sharks are third-last in the Western Conference. They’re more sour than Sarah Michelle-Gellar when she had to hang out with a shirtless Scott Weiland for a day.

Alex Edler didn’t help Kevin Labanc’s mood when he rocked him with a big bodycheck in the first period. Labanc went nuts, chasing Edler down the ice and crosschecking him in the back for an obvious penalty. Then, on his way to the bench, Brandon Sutter chirped Labanc, so Labanc sucker-punched him in the face. As the French say, that’s la bad.

That should have been a four-minute power play for the Canucks, but Sutter chased down Labanc in the scrum that ensued and put him in a headlock, so the refs nabbed him for the coincidental minor. Personally, I think Labanc should have been tossed for the blatant sucker punch, but what do I know?

The Loui Revolution — The RevoLoution, if you will — has begun in earnest. There’s a lot of Loui love in the Canucks fanbase right now, as he’s stepped up ably on Bo Horvat’s wing, even if most of his points seem to be on empty net goals. It’s quite the face turn for Eriksson, as it wasn’t that long ago that fans booed when his name was announced in the opening lineup; now they’re unironically Lou-ing.

Seriously, the Rogers Arena crowd seemed fit to explode when Eriksson got a shorthanded chance midway through the second period. And when he did actually score a few minutes later, the crowd went wild. Tanner Pearson fanned on his shot and Eriksson smartly lifted Erik Karlsson’s stick at just the right time to allow the puck to slide through. With his stick in the air, Eriksson had to stop the puck with his skate — an impressive feet/feat of coordination — then backhanded the puck into the open net.

The goal from number 21 came on the Canucks’ 21st shot of the game, so it seemed like destiny. The Sharks challenged the goal for offside, but you can’t fight destiny, man. And also, Bo Horvat totally dragged his back skate to stay onside, because he’s the captain, and that’s what captains do.

The Canucks were dummying the Sharks through the first two periods, even if they only managed the one goal. They out-shot the Sharks 27-to-7 through 40 minutes. The Sharks didn’t start the third any better: on one of their most dangerous-looking rushes of the game, Timo Meier negated it by skating straight into Thatcher Demko for the most hilariously obvious goaltender interference call of all time.

The Canucks made Meier pay, as the second power play unit delivered a goal with a simple, but well-executed play. Adam Gaudette gained the line, dropped the puck to Jake Virtanen, and he delivered a great pass to Tanner Pearson, who had made a beeline for the front of the net. Pearson made like Harlan Thrombey losing at Go and tipped it upstairs.

Demko didn’t have much action in the Canucks crease, but stopped all but one shot he faced. That shot came on a scrum in front of the net that was a complete mess. Virtanen somehow ended up boxing out Chris Tanev from the rebound with his stick pointing straight up in the air, so he was no help. Quinn Hughes tried to play the puck when he should have played the man and vice versa. And Demko just couldn’t find the puck to cover it up.

Hughes quickly made up for the 2-1 goal by restoring the two-goal lead 37 seconds later. Antoine Roussel raced to a puck on the end boards and swatted it around to Hughes at the point. His shot navigated its way through traffic like a motorcycle in Hanoi and beat Dell past a Roussel screen.

The Canucks made it 4-1 on another fantastic pass by Virtanen. He made a great play in the neutral zone to chip the puck past Mario Ferraro and broke in 2-on-1 with J.T. Miller. With Brent Burns sliding to prevent the pass, Virtanen calmly saucered the puck over Burns right onto the tape of Miller, who sent the puck back against the grain on Dell.

That gives Virtanen three points in his last two games and he’s already set a career high with 28 points. My one concern about Virtanen is that there comes a point every season where we ask, “Has Virtanen finally figured it out?” and as soon as someone writes that article, Virtanen immediately regresses and starts playing worse. So, as long as no one writes a “Has Virtanen finally figured it out?” article, we should be fine. Which means I need to ignore that article burning a hole in my Drafts folder.

In the third period, Joe Thornton got downright ornery, as old men often do. He hit Jay Beagle with a late, blindside check at one point, but the truly egregious hit came on Brandon Sutter, as Thornton bodied him to the ice when he never even touched the puck. That sparked a melee, a brouhaha, a donnybrook, a fracas, and a yard sale.

Sutter went after Thornton, who dropped the gloves anticipating a fight, but Burns tackled Sutter to the ice, perhaps out of beard solidarity or because he’s worried that Thornton’s old-man knuckles would crumble to dust if he tried to punch someone.

Here’s how you can tell this game got out of hand: Chris Tanev got kicked out of the game. The refs handed out 10-minute misconducts to five different players to try to calm things down — though somehow they all evened out despite the egregious interference by Thornton that kicked things off. One of the players kicked out was Tanev, because if anyone was going to run around and cause problems, it’s the mild-mannered defensive defenceman.

If you expand beyond just the team, however, Vancouver is tied with St. Louis for the most representatives. That’s because Pettersson, Markstrom, and Hughes will be joined by the Vancouver Police Department’s own Meghan Agosta.

The 32-year-old Agosta has represented Canada at four Olympic Games and eight World Championships and is second all-time in goals and fifth all-time in points at the Olympics, with 17 goals and 28 points in 20 games. Her signature performance came at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, when her 9 goals and 15 points in 5 games led the tournament in scoring and led Canada to the gold medal.

Now Agosta will represent Canada once again, albeit on a slightly different stage. And, in a way, she’ll be representing all of women’s hockey.



Agosta, along with 19 other female hockey players, will face off at the All-Star Skills Competition, showing off their skills in a Canada vs USA 3-on-3 game. It’s an opportunity to showcase the women’s game in a different venue, at a time when women’s hockey is at a crossroads, with over 200 players boycotting professional hockey this season until their demands for appropriate resources and sustainable financing are met.

It’s not just a showcase for the women, of course; the 3-on-3 game will also attract more attention to the NHL All-Star Game, which is in a constant battle to stay relevant, as stars like Alex Ovechkin have refrained from attending and some hockey fans complain about the low intensity of the hockey itself.

Four women participated in last year’s All-Star Skills Competition and established that their skills are right up there with the best in the NHL. Kendall Coyne-Schofield became the first woman to officially participate in the Skills Competition, taking the place of Nathan Mackinnon in the Fastest Skater competition. Her time of 14.346 seconds landed her 7th out of 8 participants, ahead of Clayton Keller.

Meanwhile, Rebecca Johnston, Renata Fast, and Brianna Decker participated in the Skills Competition by demonstrating the events before the NHL players. Decker made headlines when her run through the passing event was timed as three seconds faster than Leon Draisaitl, who won the event.

The NHL didn’t recognize Decker’s time — and refused to pay her the $25,000 that the winner of each event receives — but CCM stepped up to #PayDecker in the wake of a social media campaign. By bringing women into the Skills Competition in their own separate event, the NHL likely hopes to avoid a similar controversy this year, though some raised concerns on social media that the players won’t be paid for their participation.

The one event at the Skills Competition where women will compete alongside the men is a new event introduced this year: the Shooting Stars event. One player each from the Canadian and American teams, selected by social media vote, will participate in the event, along with eight NHL All-Stars.

In the Shooting Stars event, players will be positioned in the stands, 30 feet above the iice surface, where they will shoot pucks at a variety of targets on the ice, with different point values for each target. It seems like an event inspired by trick shot YouTubers like Dude Perfect, and it seems like it has more potential for entertainment than some of the other oddball skills competition events the NHL has tried in the past.

Will Agosta get picked to participate in the Shooting Stars event? Since it’s a social media vote, perhaps the Vancouver contingent that showed up in force a couple years ago to vote Brock Boeser as All-Star MVP will show up again. At the very least, it will be a nice opportunity for her to focus on hockey for a weekend; while she’s taken time off from hockey to pursue her career with the Vancouver PD, she still has eyes on playing in the Beijing Olympics in 2022.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

If it receives more than six hours of sun every day, consider sowing wild flowers like poppies, alyssum or annual candytuft.

Roughen up the surface. All like poor soil, even near sand. Sprinkle the seed sparingly on top of the bare patch of earth and water in well. Do not cover and ensure that tall weeds do not encroach on the area. Leave it all alone. Do not mow it and avoid walking on it if possible. Remember to water in dry spells and in an amazingly short period of time (four to six weeks) a substantial stand of seedlings will appear and eventually flowers.

Depending on when you sow the seeds, they may flower in summer, fall or next spring.

In any event, the bare spot will no longer be bare and you will have a cheerful display.

Many will self-seed for years to maintain your colourful patch.

The provincial government has extended its temporary authorization, which allows businesses with food-primary and liquor-primary licences to sell and deliver packaged liquor products, alongside meal purchases, for off-site consumption.

article continues below

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

So North Shore residents were left hungry for more when it closed last year.

Thankfully the restaurant is back in the neighbourhood, just across the street at the CentreView building, with a fresh new design. The highlight is still flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken, which is marinated for 24 hours, then basted with your choice of their signature PERi-PERi sauce (there are plain, mild and spicy options). Nando’s then flame-grills the chicken, and serves it to order. “We will always be grateful to the community of North Vancouver for loving our flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken, helping us to increase awareness of our brand and sharing this best-kept secret with Canada,” says Mark Thomson, the Patrao, Nando’s term for restaurant manager.

While the delicious flame-grilled PERi-PERi chicken has remained the same, the service style and menu have slightly changed. All the food is now served in a fast-casual style, where you order and pay at the counter before eating, so you can leave as soon as you please or order more when your Nandoca (server) comes to check on you.

Another change is the all-new, beautiful designs. “A key design inspiration for our new Nando’s comes from the undulating natural landscapes of South Africa and British Columbia and the bright blue and orange hues,” says Emily Schorn of Design Agency. “Our suspended wood ceiling has traditional motifs in a circular shape that echoes the service counter, providing pops of colour and texture from above. Another feature is the handcrafted lighting, which is designed and made in South Africa.”The interior design acknowledges both the brand’s African roots, and the North Shore location.

In addition to a visa, there are also recommended vaccinations for visitors to Egypt, including the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccines.

Egypt reopened its borders to tourists on July 1st, welcoming visitors from outside the country back to its archaeological sites, museums and hotels, with increased precautions in place.

The eight tourism sites reopening in July are the Pyramids of Giza and their surrounding areas, the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir, the Citadel of Salah El-Din, the temples in Karnak and Luxor, Hurghada Museum, Abu Simbel temples and the Temple of Philae in Aswan.Other archaeological sites will reopen on a gradual basis until September.

Hotels that have reopened are allowed to operate with up to 50 percent capacity, and are required to provide face masks and hand sanitizers to all guests. Common areas must be regularly disinfected and distancing measures throughout the hotels have been put in place.

Tour groups have been limited to 25 people maximum, and tourism companies must provide protective face masks to tourists.

Attractions have also limited the number of people granted entry in at a time. The world famous tomb of Tutankhamun, for example, will only allow up to a maximum of 10 people at once. The total number of people allowed in large museums, such as the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir, will be limited to 200.

Active Baby, a unique baby store on the North Shore that caters to active, outdoor-loving babies and their parents, offers a unique Baby Registry both in store and online for all new parents.

“It’s great to get ideas and make choices for baby showers or baby milestones,” says July Lu, founder and co-owner of Active Baby along with her husband, Chen.

article continues below

July offers these 4 tips to parents looking to start a Baby Registry at Active Baby:

1. Bring a ‘newish’ mom along

A mom with a new baby or toddler of her own could be indispensable in advising on what pieces of equipment or clothing you’ll need.

“The mom friend should be someone who has similar tastes and lifestyle to you,” July suggests, “and someone whose judgment you trust.”

If there isn’t a new mom in your circle of friends, chat to an Active Baby Registry Consultant.

“They are experts in the products we carry,” July explains, “and they will work closely with each customer to guide them through the process to find the best items to fit their lifestyle.”

2. Start with Research

“We have so many choices that you will want to stop by the store or check our website to research whether an item will fit your lifestyle.” July says. “Car seats, for example, are very important. The hospital will not let mom and baby leave without one, so you want to start your research early.”

3. Shop online and in-store

Shopping from the comfort of your own home at Active Baby is quick and easy, and the registry is available both online and in-store. But July recommends stopping by the store to check out some items even if you prefer to order online.

“In particular,” she says, “you will want to see and feel some of the more expensive items. Strollers and carriers, for example, should be taken for a little test drive around the store to make sure they are comfortable for you.”

4. Look to the future

It’s easy to get carried away with all those cute baby products, but July suggests remembering that babies grow very quickly. What fits at birth, won’t fit after a few weeks or possibly even days. Make sure your registry items include things needed at six months and even one year, for example, a highchair, an activity gym mat, or a 2nd stage car seat, etc, so you’re ready when your baby is.

“People are getting a better handle on how to manage bringing work home or working from home,” says Nadi Meri, a Vancouver-based architect. “It’s becoming very important to have a dedicated, professional environment in your home that is also comfortable.

“Our designs are the bridge between living and working to help us find that balance. We want to create a mood that helps people be inspired. Our workspaces are designed to be a place where people want to spend time, be focused and get their jobs done. Having the right choice of colours is a good way to create that ambience.”

Nadi works with her sister Ellie Miri, who earned her interior design Masters degree from Boston Architectural College.

“We are always inspired by nature, especially in Vancouver where it would be unfortunate if we didn’t incorporate the beauty of our surrounding,” Nadi says. “We need to bring nature into our spaces, whether that’s by having wide windows and lots of natural light or by the colours we choose.”

“We’re really excited that the new colour trends work with our style,” says Ellie. “They complement our design philosophy to create a restorative balance and bring nature inside.”

The designers are especially inspired by the trend towards a naturalist palette inspired by earth tones. “There are some deep, saturated colours such as haze navy and a new one called global inspired green. They can be used as accents to make the space more vibrant and add a punch of colour,” says Ellie.

Nadi adds, “Because we are using lots of natural light, it’s okay to use some of those deep, saturated colours. They will be softened by the light being introduced to the space.”

Another on-trend colour that they both love working with is graphite charcoal. “Grey is a very nice, standard colour that gives us the sense of being grounded,” Ellie says. “It’s an approachable and very comfortable colour. We can easily add to it any accent colour that we like to make the space come together.”

“I work a lot with my clients to determine what motivates them,” says Michelle, a Realtor® with Royal Le Page Sussex in West Vancouver. “Then we develop a dynamic marketing plan.”

On the seller’s side, Michelle conducts an intensive analysis of the market to determine the best pricing and selling strategy. Each market, and each home, warrants its own unique study.

Once the listing is live on MLS, Michelle makes sure it receives good exposure to potential buyers by utilizing the marketing strategy designed for the property. She then works with her client through the process, negotiating on the client’s behalf to ensure the best outcome for her Sellers.

“I have a lot of past clients who stay connected with me because they are interested in current municipal changes or the state of the market,” says Michelle. “They know they can ask me anything at anytime. That’s the kind of relationship we have.”

For buyers, this means accompanying them on property viewings to really get a sense of what they like and what doesn’t work for them.

“I pay a lot of attention to the details that my Buyers give me when we look at homes. That way, when I see a house that is right for them, I know it when I see it. I couldn’t do that if I didn’t take the time to understand them first.” Michelle says. Once a buyer’s dream home has been chosen, Michelle negotiates the best price, and explains the completion process and next steps. She also keeps in touch once her clients have moved in to make sure they’re enjoying their new home.

“It’s amazing how often a buyer’s needs and wants change throughout the course of buying a home,” she says. “But it’s all part of the process. Knowing my community inside and out helps me provide a lot of information. Knowing my clients really well helps me find the perfect fit for their lifestyle.”

Five ways your child could benefit from a visual art education include:

article continues below

1. Honing their judgement

Many areas of education require right or wrong answers. The visual arts give a child the opportunity to make choices and to understand the impact of those choices. Students learn that there may be more than one answer to any question as they learn to explore the nuanced aspects of life.

2. Developing problem-solving skills

Creating art allows children and young people to see, interpret, and reflect on the world in a way that’s distinct. It provides perspectives to consider, rather than a pre-determined outcome, thereby helping them to learn how to consider and weigh alternatives.

3. Learning that small choices can have large impacts

Art provides an opportunity for students to see how a big picture image can be affected by small adjustments to the work.

4. Expressing feelings and emotions

Young people, especially teenagers, often have difficulties in expressing their true feelings or emotions. Art allows them to say what they may not be able to communicate directly.

5. Triggering a sense of discovery

The arts can prompt a sense of discovery about learning and demonstrate that the limits of our learning extend beyond numbers and words.

""You're getting a cardio workout, developing muscles when you use your entire body to climb up, and you're also solving a puzzle, which keeps you mentally active as well.""

Henry and his team at The Edge Climbing Centre offer a number of climbing programs and sets for both the novice and experienced climber.

A three-hour introductory course teaches newcomers to the sport how to climb and belay in a safe environment. This popular course covers all aspects of climbing safety and includes one week of free climbing time after the class is finished to practice what you've learned.

""Our Beyond the Basics course is the next step,"" Henry says. ""Participants take a weekly class for five weeks and learn movement techniques along with climbing on different terrains.""

While taking these beginner courses, Henry finds that many people develop the social bonds that are common between climbers.

""People often set up times to climb together after a course,"" Henry notes.

A popular climbing course that's guaranteed to give a good physical workout is the Coffee, Climbing, and Conditioning (CCC) class run by experienced climber and coach, Ean Kramer. Starting at 6 a.m., CCC offers a way to grab a cup of freshly brewed coffee from Bean Around the World and get a physical and mental workout before heading off to the office.

""Ean has a following of loyal climbers who really enjoy and thrive on his workout programs,"" Henry explains. ""He has a holistic approach that combines climbing skill with a bit of life coaching.""

If you're a more experienced climber, you'll enjoy the new World Class bouldering routes set by The Edge Climbing Centre’s Simon Parton.

""Simon is British Columbia's only World Cup certified route setter,"" Henry says. ""Bouldering is climbing lower walls without ropes and the World Cup routes are quite different from the day-to-day settings. The moves are more intricate, more difficult and they also challenge Simon because he has to be more creative and careful of route placement.""

The Edge Climbing Centre recently went through renovations to add a wall dedicated to world-class bouldering climbs.

""It's definitely not for beginners,"" says Henry, ""but you don't have to be an advanced level climber either. Once you're comfortable with climbing technique and safety, there's a route to fit your level.""

Opening their own daycare was an idea that has been percolating since the beginning of their friendship, and recently blossomed into the official opening of Treehaus Teahaus.

The business is a café boasting an interactive play area and learning space for young children and their caregivers. While the opening was a monumental moment, it was certainly a long journey to get there.

Anita, a neonatal nurse by profession, spent most of her career supporting families at BC Women’s Hospital. Working in intensive, family-focused care shaped Anita’s life perspective. While pregnant with her son, she realized how important it was for her to spend as much time with him as possible. She couldn’t bear the thought of sacrificing family time for work.

“Something about motherhood and entrepreneurship seems to go hand in hand,” says Anita.

When she reconnected with Audrey, whose passion for teaching led her to pursue a Montessori certification in Hong Kong and inspired the concept of a learning centre, Anita knew starting something together for young children was the perfect next step.

“Audrey and I initially came up with the idea of a daycare 10 years ago. We started our research for the business four years ago, but after looking into the logistics and details of starting a daycare in Vancouver, it was more challenging than we expected,” says Anita.

“From zoning to space requirements to personnel qualifications, it did not match our budget and time expectations,” she continues.

The pair also faced challenges with city approval and permit requirements, but these hurdles did little to dampen their passion.

Driven by their vision and the need for child-friendly spaces in the Lower Mainland, Audrey and Anita explored all options and solutions to turn their idea into reality. Seeking support with their business planning, Audrey and Anita connected with Futurpreneur Canada, the only non-profit organization providing financing, mentoring and resources for young entrepreneurs.

“As a start-up, we didn’t have a template to work from and really did do everything from scratch,” says Anita. “We can’t thank the Futurpreneur team enough for helping us from the beginning. We don’t think we could have gotten here without their guidance,” she says.

Although the road to open Treehaus Teahaus began 10 years ago, Anita and Audrey are excited for the journey ahead. “It’s rewarding to know that Audrey and I played a part in everything about it,” says Anita. “Whatever happens in the future, we’ve given it our best.”

Treehaus Teahaus is located at 1705 Marine Dr. & Tatlow Avenue in North Vancouver and is open Tuesday to Sunday. For more information about Futurpreneur Canada visit www.futurpreneur.ca.",[]

And those qualities are inherent in every aspect of West Vancouver’s McKenzie Funeral Services, a family-run business that has been treating everyone like family since the McKenzie’s first foray into the profession in 1946. “A family business means that (families) will receive a quality service and the utmost attention at all times. They can rest assured that they can reach us by phone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we mean that,” says Mark McKenzie, the organization’s Community Relations Director who has been working in the business since 2012. “If someone we love passes away at 2 a.m. or for anytime in that matter, families can rest assured that one of the McKenzie Family members (George, Mildred, Mark, Geoff, Dave or Jim) will be available to answer the call.”

With 70 years of experience to its name, McKenzie Funeral Services can expertly and efficiently arrange any type of service for a family, including celebrations of life, graveside services, visitation services, memorial gatherings, church funerals and simple cremation services. Additionally, the home’s owner and funeral director, George McKenzie, is a celebrant and can lead and officiate celebrations of life’s, burials, or other services for families who wish for a non-denomination funeral.

What also sets McKenzie Funeral Services apart from other funeral providers is the fact that the McKenzie’s will personally walk a family through every step of the arrangement; from personally bringing the deceased to their funeral home, organizing memorable celebrations of life throughout the North Shore, to them personally handling the cremation at their own and operated crematorium.

“Whenever we have to put trust in someone we typically want to know who that person is, that’s why we encourage families to give us a call, go onto our website, or schedule a meeting with us, so that way they can get to know who we are and can feel reassured their loved one and family will be taken care of”.

McKenzie Funeral Services is also very active in the community and organizes a number of outreach events throughout the year. On March 6, 2018 at 6 p.m. they will be holding a Living Well & Learning Well Estate Planning Workshop at the West Vancouver Seniors’ Activity Centre. Here, attendees will learn about probate and how it will affect their estate, as well as the differences between power of attorney, representation agreements and joint ownership. They will also learn how to pre-plan their cremation or burial arrangements, and ensure their family is protected from the anxiety of forced medical decisions.

Choose an award-winning service department,[],,"Paul Leech has worked for the owners of Capilano VW for over 26 years. One of the many long-time employees at Capilano VW, Paul takes pride in his work as Manager of the Service Department.

""We have upwards of five Master Guild technicians at Capilano VW,” says Paul. “That's the highest level of VW technician there is. In 2015, Vital Insights, a customer experience management company, awarded us with their highest customer service rating among all VW dealerships in Western Canada. And I'm confident we'll do just as well in 2016.""

article continues below

When it comes to looking after your vehicle, Paul has a few basic tips:

· General maintenance: Follow the manufacturer's maintenance book- at least. ""The maintenance guide is really the minimum,"" says Paul. ""VW suggests an oil change every year or 15,000 kms. Most people drive around 20,000 kms a year, so we actually suggest an oil change every 7,500 kms or so. About 90% of our customers are onside with that, and they’ve seen the benefits of this kind of proactive approach to maintenance for their vehicle.""

· Tire pressure: Paul and his team advise checking your tire pressure every month. ""It's not enough to wait until you come in for a service. Checking and correcting the tire pressure every month will give you optimum fuel economy.""

· Oil level: Check your oil level at least once a month and top up when necessary.

· Fluid levels: Don't forget to check brake and transmission fluids regularly. ""Brake fluid has to be changed after three years and every two years after that. It's important, because brake fluid absorbs water and with all the electrical systems and ABS components in the brake system, it's key that the fluid gets changed on a regular schedule. If the ABS system fails due to a lack of maintenance, it can mean thousands of dollars in repairs."" And don't overlook the coolant and transmission oils. ""People think those fluids are good for the life of the vehicle,"" Paul adds, ""but they're not. They need changing on a schedule, too.""

· Watch the paperwork: Wherever you have your car serviced, Paul recommends keeping an eye on the paperwork. ""Paperwork is vital for the warranty of your vehicle. For example, it has to have the serial number and the exact kilometer count when the work was performed. Also, original parts must be used to replace the oil filter and so on.""

To keep up with new developments in the car industry every one of Paul's technicians is required to complete a certification process every year.

""There is so much more technology in our cars today that ongoing training is vital,” he says. “Each of the technicians is required to complete a minimum of one instructor-led training course every year in addition to the self-study and virtual courses here at the car dealership.""

The summer exhibition at the Gordon Smith Gallery is titled Art School High running from May 13 to August 26, 2017. “It’s a unique opportunity to explore visual responses by important artists to the depths and quirks of the grade 9 to grade 12 years,” Yolande says. Curated by Dr. Patrik Andersson, participating artists include Karin Bubas, John Collins, Rodney Graham, Scott Livingstone, Ken Lum, Kyla Mallet, Jean MacRae, Shannon Oksanen, Kathy Slade, Ron Terada, Neil Wedman and David Wisdom — all artists who have made significant work that reflect on the high school experience. “The works in the exhibition will probe the very nature of learning in diverse environments,” she says.

In conjunction with the exhibition, the Gordon Smith Gallery is hosting a Film Festival that will celebrate some great high school-inspired movies:

· Ferris Bueller’s Day Off

· Clueless

· The Breakfast Club

· Dazed and Confused

· To Sir with Love

· Fast Times at Ridgemount High

The Film Festival will take place on Wednesday evenings at 7:30 p.m. in the Gordon Smith Gallery, surrounded by art that reflects the high school experience.

262,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/standout/does-your-personality-make-you-a-dangerous-driver-1.2284170,Does your personality make you a dangerous driver?,[],,"According to new research conducted by the EU Coaching Project, HERMES, your personality plays a significant role in determining the likelihood of your being involved in a crash while driving.

“Who you are is how you drive,” says John Jacobsen of Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy when we asked him about this new development in driver education. “Personality and lifestyle have such a big effect on safety because of how you perceive things. Your perception heavily influences how you drive.”

article continues below

Some drivers are comparable to a defenseman in the game of hockey, Jacobsen explains. The defenseman is expected first and foremost to defend his goalie, but depending on his nature, perception of the game, and level of confidence, he may be inclined to push the play or become more offensively-minded at any given moment. The same is true of drivers.

“New teen-age drivers are often surprised by their personality profile after their personal risk assessment is done,” Jacobsen says. “Students may score high in overconfidence without ever sensing it. Or they may see driving as a source of excitement without identifying themselves as thrill-seeking.”

Psychologists at the University of Cranfield in the UK designed the self-assessment test used by Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy and tailored the test to Vancouver-area drivers. It is the first of its kind to be used anywhere in Canada.

The aim of the test is to raise awareness and spark conversation between the student, parent, and driving coaches.

Of course, even experienced drivers fall into the personality trap. How many of us have over-estimated our skills or conveniently altered our perception of the circumstances in bad weather or on a new, challenging road? In those moments, says Jacobsen, we’re closer to an avoidable crash than we think.

“Risk tolerance is also a significant personality factor,” says Jacobsen. “Wing-suit flyers who jump off the face of a mountain have a higher risk tolerance, whereas personally, I’d be cowering on the mountainside, figuring out how to get down safely. That same tolerance for high risk allows some drivers to drive aggressively in dangerous situations.”

At the end of each course, students participating in classroom sessions are asked to provide their comments. “Students often tell us that they learned a lot about driving but they learned a lot about themselves, too” said Jacobsen. “That tells me our message is getting through.”

But for people with hearing loss, the pandemic poses unexpected challenges.

For those who have trouble following a conversation, it’s often impossible to move closer to the other person who’s speaking. When you are outside your “bubble”, physical-distancing protocols result in even more strain to hear what other people are saying. As a result, it’s easier for a person with hearing loss to feel even more isolated.

article continues below

And then, there are the masks. Not only do they muffle what store clerks and restaurant wait staff are saying, but they make it difficult to “read” faces. We get a lot of clues about a person’s intentions from their facial expressions. How do we interpret those clues if all we see are their eyes?

For those with hearing aids, taking a mask on and off can also pose some challenges.

But the “new normal” doesn’t have to mean accepting hardship as a way of life. For people with hearing loss, there are ways to mitigate its social and physical impacts.

“Hearing is more important than ever,” says Raphael Tayou of HearingLife Canada. “If hearing loss was an issue and you were relying on workarounds to overcome it, you can’t ignore it anymore. You need to address it.”

HearingLife has significantly improved its online resources. People can take a free online hearing test that takes only five minutes. They will be asked four simple questions about their hearing in everyday situations. Then they will listen to sounds played at different volumes, as well as several short conversations with a bit of background noise.

If the test reveals that the person is experiencing hearing loss, they can make an appointment with one of HearingLife’s hearing care providers. This initial consultation is free and will provide guidance on how best to move forward.

Safety protocols at each clinic include:

• limiting the number of clients at any given time

• sanitizing medical equipment and common areas between each appointment

• ensuring all staff are wearing protective gear and providing hand sanitizers at all stages of the visit

• conducting a COVID-19 pre-screening by phone before all appointments

HearingLife offers many tips on how to stay safe — and comfortable — while wearing your hearing aid and a mask:

• Consider a mask that ties behind the head rather than behind the ears

• Use a special mask extender which will hold the mask with buttons or other fasteners at the back of the head

• Attach your over-the-ear hearing aid to your glasses with a small elastic band to keep them in place

• Put on and remove masks carefully, and check your hearing devices each time

It also recommends exploring Bluetooth options, which allow you to hear music, take phone calls and listen to TV audio.

If you want your “new normal” to include better hearing, visit HearingLife Canada for your free online test or to book an appointment. You can also call 1-888-514-9515.",[]

Gentlemanly Toronto Maple Leafs defenceman Morgan Rielly, a West Vancouver native, recently popped up, literally, next to none other than Canada's Olympic ice dance queen Tessa Virtue.

article continues below

On Tuesday Virtue joined Max Kerman, lead singer of the band Arkells, for an Instagram Live video. A few minutes into their chat, Rielly rolls into view to concur with Kerman’s taste in Netflix binging.

“Tiger King is a fantastic show,” says Rielly, giving Virtue a playful nudge, confirming that they are riding out the COVID-19 crisis together in North Vancouver. Rumours have been swirling about a relationship between Rielly and Virtue recently, and it’s clear from the video that they fall well within each other’s social distancing bubbles.

The pair joke about doing killer core workouts together, escaping into the North Shore mountains for social distancing hikes, and books that they are reading (or, in Rielly’s case, not reading).

Virtue ended the chat by showing Kerman some dance steps, with Rielly off screen adjusting the camera to get the best angle for Virtue’s moves.

The 30-year-old Virtue, of course, captured Canada’s hearts with her ice dance partner Scott Moir, their performances so hot that they always left us in puddles. Many judge them to be the best ice dance partnership of all time, and fans across the nation and around the world have long wanted to know if the on-ice romance continued off the ice. But that speculation was officially put to bed when Moir announced his engagement to former skating partner Jaclyn Mascarin last year.

This week’s Instagram appearance seemingly confirms a close relationship between Virtue and the 26-year-old Rielly, whose West Coast good-guy charm has stayed unblemished even while spending seven years under the intense scrutiny of playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs.

United game rescheduled to Monday morning after COVID-19 test concerns",['Neil Davidson'],,"A morning that had promised to start and end early Sunday turned into a stressful all-day marathon for Toronto FC and D.C. United.

The teams were slated to kick off their MLS is Back Tournament at 9 a.m. ET at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex in the Orlando area. Minutes before the scheduled start, Major League Soccer called off the game — citing two problematic COVID-19 tests.

A round of pre-game testing Saturday had returned a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player. The positive test was considered unconfirmed until backed up by a second test.

While D.C. United made it to the playing field, Toronto never left the league hotel.

""Both teams participated in another round of testing (Sunday) and all players from the two clubs tested negative,"" the league said in a statement issued Sunday evening. ""Based on those results, the game will be played (Monday) morning at 9 a.m. ET.

""The player who received an initial positive test and the player whose test was inconclusive will undergo additional testing and will not play in (Monday's) match.""

The league did not identify the players in question. Neither did Toronto FC, although GM Ali Curtis did say his player was asymptomatic.

The tournament, which marks the league's first action since it shut down March 12 due to the global pandemic, has already lost FC Dallas and Nashville SC due to a rash of positive COVID-19 tests.

Sunday was another day of drama and doubt in the pandemic sports world.

""These days nothing's really normal. If anything the normal is kind of uncertainty,"" Curtis told a virtual conference call Sunday evening.

""There's a different situation each different day, for each different week,"" he added. ""And you just have to adapt.""

It marked the second delay for both Toronto and D.C. United. They were supposed to meet Friday night but the game was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto's late arrival at the tournament because of the need for additional COVID-19 testing in the wake of a player reporting symptoms.

Players and staff were tested Saturday in advance of the game. Curtis said the team learned of the inconclusive test around midnight, prompting another test in the player's room that proved to be negative. The Toronto player has been isolated pending the result of another test.

The rest of the Toronto team produced negative results in the latest batch of testing.

Curtis, meanwhile, started his Sunday with a 6 a.m. Zoom call, the first of many.

With the game expected to start at 9 a.m. Monday, both teams faced another early morning wake-up call. Toronto's pre-game meal Sunday was scheduled for 5:30 a.m.

Toronto's second game against the Montreal Impact, originally scheduled for Wednesday, has now been pushed back to Thursday. And D.C. United's game against the New England Revolution will now be played on Friday instead of Thursday.

Wednesday's game between the Vancouver Whitecaps and San Jose Earthquakes will now start at 9 p.m. instead of 10:30 p.m.

After the threat of lightning delayed Atlanta's game against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday night, there were more delays and drama Sunday.

""We believe the tournament can still be conducted safely,"" MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott told a virtual conference call Sunday morning. ""And if at the point we determine it can't, obviously we would make a decision then.

""In the case of Dallas and Nashville, the decision was made that based on the extent of the positive tests in those teams (and) their ability to train, that the more prudent course was to withdraw them.

""But we had established a set of protocols that are working as they were designed, which is to identify players that have had positive tests for COVID-19, to remove and separate them from the team and isolate them. And to continue the process of testing the other players ... We view this (case) as the process working.""

Under league protocols, players who test positive are isolated while those who test negative ""move forward.""

Abbott said because Toronto only arrived last Monday, the decision was made to await the results of tests conducted Sunday morning before playing the game.

Curtis said his team is still on task at the tournament.

""It's an important competition. A lot of people have put a lot of work and effort into (it) ... It's important that we represent the club and we represent our city as best as we can.""

It all added to an already stressful morning for the teams given the unusually early kickoff time — made to avoid the Florida heat. Both Toronto captain Michael Bradley and striker Jozy Altidore had criticized the 9 a.m. start, saying it was not conducive to good football.

D.C. goalkeeper Bill Hamid suggested it was an inconvenience to fans, too.

""To every DC United supporter, our families & friends, I'm sorry you woke up so early to see us play, to then have the match postponed AGAIN,"" he tweeted. ""Especially after so many people planned originally to watch the game which was meant to play on Friday! Have a beautiful Sunday regardless.""

Curtis said while Toronto had always planned to show up late for the game, to avoid the heat for as long as possible, the team was on a group Zoom call abut what was going on with the COVID-19 test when he received the call from the league that the game was off.

While all 24 remaining teams are staying in the same hotel, they are isolated from each other in the MLS tournament bubble. Players and other personnel are tested every other day.

Curtis said his confidence level in the MLS protocols remains ""very high.""

""When you look at the data, if you strip out the outliers of Dallas and Nashville, I think the numbers are fairly favourable"" he said. ""And then when you're in the bubble you see some of the measures that are taken and that gives you confidence.""

But outside, the number of positive cases continues to climb.

On Sunday, Florida reported 15,300 new cases over the last 24 hours — a single-day record in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic.

There were some surprises in Toronto's planned starting 11 Sunday.

While it fielded the same back five as it had in its last league game March 7, there were four changes further forward. Bradley and Argentine newcomer Pablo Piatti, who both missed the opening two games of the season, were to return from injury.

Tsubasa Endoh and Ayo Akinola were also in the starting 11.

Altidore did not make the matchday 23. He was late joining the team after spending the lockdown at his Florida home and had to train on his own while fulfilling quarantine.

Canadian midfielder Jonathan Osorio was a surprise omission from the matchday 23.

Sunday evening's Sporting Kansas City against Minnesota United game went ahead despite confirmation Friday by Kansas City that one of its players had tested positive.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 12, 2020.

Until that time, the teenager already being touted as one of hockey’s biggest future superstars had skated smoothly through intense scrutiny. He appeared unflappable as he lit up leagues, always playing against older players, on his way to becoming the first-ever player to earn exceptional status and early entry into the Western Hockey League.

article continues below

He’d done interviews before, seen his name thrown around by strangers on social media, skated in front of throngs of fans and scouts, and gone through a rigorous screening process to earn the exceptional status label, joining an exclusive group of only seven players in Canadian Hockey League history – including dignitaries Connor McDavid and John Tavares – in earning the right to play in the world’s premier junior leagues a year early. No problem.

But then, a live hit on Sportscentre, face-to-face (virtually of course, in the COVID-19 era) with Gino.

“It’s TSN,” Bedard says, recalling the interview. “It’s serious.”

Hockey? Easy. But Gino?

Throughout this whole process, Bedard has shown time and again that, even at such a young age, he is more than equipped to handle the pressure of being in the Canadian hockey spotlight.

That’s a good thing, because that spotlight is only going to get brighter and brighter.

Get the kid a stick

The legend of Connor Bedard begins in rather a strange way for hockey’s next potential “chosen one.” There’s Connor, maybe three years old, trying out skating for the first time. He hated it.

“After the first and the second [skating lessons], we were like, ‘Yeah, I don’t think he’s going to be enjoying hockey too much,” says his mom, Melanie Bedard. There was one big problem with those first few lessons though – he didn’t have a hockey stick.

After one of the lessons, young Connor spied some kids on the other side of the rink starting up a standard “stick and puck” session. He let it be known that he wanted to do that.

“My husband just got a stick from one of the people working at the rec centre,” recalls Melanie. “That was it. He had the stick.”

He’s barely put his hockey stick down since then.

“He’d play games in the kitchen against himself with mini sticks for hours,” says Melanie. “He’s just always loved the game.”

The Bedards live in a quiet Lynn Valley crescent with several kids around Connor’s age nearby, so a continually running street hockey game soon took over the road. Even when the other kids wanted to be inside, Connor would keep the game going on his own.

“I was mostly just on rollerblades out by myself on the street,” he says.

“Everyone has been really patient with him, with all his shooting and our broken windows,” adds Melanie. They now have a sweet setup in their backyard, and Connor still spends hours every day firing pucks on net.

Ahead of the curve

When it came time for Connor to play on an actual team, the family signed him up at the North Shore Winter Club and it was immediately apparent that he needed to be moved up to play against older kids. He’s been skipping ahead of the curve ever since.

And Bedard hasn’t just survived playing with older players throughout his young career, he’s thrived. There were six seasons at the Winter Club, one with North Van Minor, and the past two years with the West Van Warriors hockey academy.

The 2018-19 season with the West Van Warriors bantam prep team was the first time he suited up in his own age group, a 13-year-old playing against many of the top 13- and 14-year-old players in the country in the Canadian Sport School Hockey League. Bedard put up 64 goals and 88 points in 30 games, earning league MVP status. This past season he jumped up to West Van’s midget prep team, a 14-year-old playing against players up to 18 years of age. Bedard led the league in goals with 43 and points with 84, in 36 games.

Along the way, the hockey world started to notice. In 2015 a hockey personality known for promoting “sick dangles” on his social media channels posted a video of Bedard, then just 10 years old, going on an end-to-end rush and finishing top shelf. “Remember the name!” the caption read.

In 2018, The Hockey News ran a story under the headline Meet the Future of Hockey, 13-Year-Old Connor Bedard.

Exceptional expectations

The spotlight has grown even more intense in the past six weeks, starting with the March 24 announcement that Bedard would be the first-ever player in WHL history granted exceptional status, meaning he could play major junior hockey as a 15-year-old.

That’s when media outlets across the country – starved for content during the COVID-19 sports shutdown – swarmed the Bedards' virtual doorstep to talk to the young phenom about joining the likes of McDavid and Tavares.

“I always think, ‘Oh my gosh. I hope they remember he’s 14,’” says Melanie, adding with a laugh that she has to resist the urge to critique Connor’s on-camera performances. “I’m listening to these interviews and I’m thinking, could you say the word ‘obviously’ more times. You’re critiquing everything. But I know that I couldn’t have done it at 14.”

Aside from a few too many repetitions of ‘obviously,’ Connor has been the picture of calm and cool in all his interviews, including his spot with Gino Reda. He may have been nervous, but it doesn’t show as Bedard graciously and humbly answers questions, wary of taking credit for himself while freely praising others.

That calm and cool demeanour is one of the reasons Bedard was given exceptional status. BC Hockey and Hockey Canada combined on the ruling for Bedard, saying the status ""is only granted to a player whose ongoing development is more likely to be significantly enhanced by playing in the CHL as a 15-year-old than by participating in his designated age division next season.""

The evaluation process involved not just observation of his on-ice performance, but Connor also had to submit a letter and essay responses and go through in-person interviews with hockey officials. His coaches and teachers were also asked for input on his readiness for the big jump to junior. He passed every test.

“He was just really calm through the whole thing,” says Melanie. “I think he just loves the game and focuses on that. I don’t think I could do it at this age. It is a lot of pressure. With social media now, even as a parent you feel a little powerless sometimes because there’s all this stuff out there. But you just can’t pay any attention to that.”

Playing with older kids his whole life has helped him get to this point, Connor says.

“It’s been challenging sometimes, but I’ve always felt like I belonged,” he says. “I’ve always felt like I kind of fit in.”

Success starts at home

As you get to know Connor and his family a little bit, you realize he is building off a very stable base provided by Melanie, Connor’s father Tom, and older sister Madison, herself a dedicated athlete and student who competed as a gymnast in North Vancouver for several years and is about to graduate Grade 12 and head off to the University of Calgary in the fall to study kinesiology.

“We’ve tried to make our family life not really about hockey within the home,” says Melanie. “He is just a kid. We always say, you know, you’re going to make mistakes. Don’t worry about the pressure, you can only control what you do.”

Last week Connor was picked first overall in the WHL draft by the Regina Pats, a storied junior franchise that had Bedard signed up to play this upcoming season for them even before they announced the draft pick.

The COVID-19 crisis may change the timeline a bit, but if the situation allows, Connor will be moving away from home this fall and preparing to play his first season of junior hockey. Connor has repeatedly said how excited he is to play for the Pats – he gets the question a lot – but admits that it will be a bit strange moving more than 1,500 kilometres away from home.

“At first it’ll definitely be weird, I’m not going to lie,” he says. “But I think I’ll be pretty comfortable with that, I think. I’m pretty mature and I think I can handle that pretty well. But it’ll definitely be different.”

For Connor, it’s always been about the game.

“A lot of my friends are actually a lot like me, they just kind of put the real focus on hockey,” he says. “I try to surround myself with people that have the same goals as me.”

Judging by everything we’ve seen so far, Connor will handle it all with his patented poise. It’s the parents, losing not just one of their kids but both in the fall, who will be hit the hardest, says Melanie.

“I’m already feeling quite emotional about it,” she says. “I wasn’t expecting Connor to be leaving at this point too. It would have been hard enough to have one of them go, but to have them both, it’s definitely going to be a real adjustment for my husband and I.”

The whole thing – the media attention, the exceptional status, the WHL draft, Gino … it’s all been a wild ride for a North Van family that never expected any of it.

“It's really hard to put into words,” says Melanie. “We’re just a low-key family, so this is definitely a big change. To see Connor in those situations, on Sportscenter, TSN, obviously we're really proud of him because he has worked so hard and just has such a love and passion for the game.""

This, it would seem, is the new normal for the Bedards.

“It's hard as a mom especially because he is my little boy and making this big transition, like a lot of things are going to change,” she says. “If his journey continues with hockey, then our lives as we know it now, with him being at home, it's going to be really different from this point forward. … You want to support their dreams, and so you have to let them go.”",[]

Roughen up the surface. All like poor soil, even near sand. Sprinkle the seed sparingly on top of the bare patch of earth and water in well. Do not cover and ensure that tall weeds do not encroach on the area. Leave it all alone. Do not mow it and avoid walking on it if possible. Remember to water in dry spells and in an amazingly short period of time (four to six weeks) a substantial stand of seedlings will appear and eventually flowers.

Depending on when you sow the seeds, they may flower in summer, fall or next spring.

In any event, the bare spot will no longer be bare and you will have a cheerful display.

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

This Belcarra author has the guide for you,['Mario Bartel'],,"Just in time for a vacation season in which British Columbians are being encouraged to explore their own province, a Belcarra author has published her second guide to cycling routes, this time in the Okanagan.

Colleen MacDonald’s Let’s Go Biking: Okanagan and Beyond covers more than 140 routes in the southern part of British Columbia from Hope in the west to Cranbrook in the east, and from Osoyoos to Shuswap Lake. Some of the routes are as short as five kilometres, but there’s also longer distances greater than 75 km for enthusiasts who really want to stretch their legs.

article continues below

MacDonald said the book not only provides detailed maps and navigation tips for stalwart favourites in the region like the Kettle Valley Railway, Okanagan Rail Trail, Myra Canyon and the Great Trail, but also dozens of lesser gems known mostly to local cyclists and hikers. She said it was input from those locals, eager to share their knowledge with potential visitors, that comprised the bulk of her research.

“It was such a crowdsourced book,” said MacDonald, who verified all the routes by riding them herself, or driving when the weather didn’t cooperate. “People were sending photos, GPS routes. They’ve done so much work into building them into safe greenways, they rallied and fundraised to help create these routes.”

And what better time to show them off than in the third stage of British Columbia’s return to a semblance of normalcy from the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic last spring in which residents are being asked to confine their summer travel within the province to limit the chances of exposure to the viral infection.

MacDonald said even with no borders to cross, the southern part of the province beyond the Lower Mainland provides a world of variety for two-wheeled explorers, from stepped vineyards that might evoke Italy or France, to arid deserts as well as mountainous climbs and valley descents. She said the undulating terrain and often longer distances made her pay particular attention to the potential enjoyment to be had by cyclists on e-bikes.

MacDonald said with more people getting on bikes as a way to stay fit and healthy during the lockdowns brought on by the public health emergency, they’re also rediscovering the simple pleasure of exploration at a slower pace.

“You’re just out there and you can hear the sheep in the field, you can smell the smells,” she said. “You don’t have to go far to have so many different experiences.”

283,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/lifestyle/work/fabled-victoria-hotel-sold-to-north-vancouver-developer-1.24164023,Fabled Victoria hotel sold to North Vancouver developer,"[""Frank O'Brien""]",,"The vagaries of the hotel industry and the political pressure of a pandemic played out in Victoria’s hard-hit hotel market last month as the fabled Sooke Harbour House sold for $5.6 million just weeks after the B.C. government paid $14 million for an aging three-star motel on Douglas Street.

Sooke Harbour House, nestled on 2.5 acres of waterfront in Sooke Harbour just outside of Victoria, was sold to North Vancouver developer IAG Enterprises Ltd.in late June under a court-ordered sale.

“The hotel needs some love,” Alex Watson, chief operating officer with IAG Enterprises Ltd., told the Victoria Times Colonist.

article continues below

A B.C. Supreme Court order approved the sale after foreclosure actions had been launched. The hotel is currently closed.

Sooke Harbour House made a name for itself internationally after Frederique and Sinclair Philip purchased the property in 1979. Their focus on locally grown food and seafood and a top-notch wine cellar earned them honours inside

Canada and beyond. It has hosted movie stars and served as a movie-set location.

But the 28-suite hotel faced money problems and in 2015, the Business Development Bank of Canada began a foreclosure action, saying it was owed $2.9 million. The Philips mounted a financial revival that ultimately failed.

Watson is aiming to make the Sooke hotel a foodie destination once more.

“We have already made some overtures to some high-end food groups to come in and manage the restaurant side of it,” he said.

IAG plans to operate the hotel as a boutique destination resort after improvements are completed, Watson said.

Paul’s Motor Inn

Near downtown Victoria, the purchase of Paul’s Motor Inn by the B.C. government showed another twist of the pandemic pain.

The government bought the motel June 4 for $14 million after the province had leased 35 of its 75 rooms to house homeless people. Many of these were encamped in local parks without sanitary facilities or the possibility of social

distancing deemed essential during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The motel’s current BC Assessment value is $8.7 million, but the agency assessed the motel building itself at just $90,000. The most recent Trip Advisor rating for Paul’s Motor Inn was three stars, but this appears generous based on

comments from clients who posted on the popular travel site.

The high purchase price of the 49-year-old motel is considered an aberration in the current market, which saw about 60 per cent of hotels close down across the province during the pandemic. Most hotels did not restart operations until June 26 when the province entered the third phase of pandemic regulations

“The traditional market [for hotel investments] has dried up,” said Carrie Russell, senior managing partner of hotel consultancy HVS International, of North Vancouver. “There are virtually no transactions in B.C.”

The motel’s new residents will have access to meals, health care, addictions treatment and harm reduction, plus storage for personal items, according to the government. A local restaurant is being contracted to provide takeout food, said Heidi Hartman, B.C. Housing regional director of operations for Vancouver Island.

The remaining 20 employees working in the motel have been offered temporary employment until a new operator comes in, Hartman said.

Retaining staff may be a challenge.

Rev. Canon Ian Powell, former managing director of Paul’s Motor Inn and Restaurant, told CFAX 1070 that the motel had “considerable strife” after BC Housing leased about half the hotel back in April.

Powell said some staff members refused to work while people were being sheltered at the motel, due to safety concerns. A key supplier also refused to enter the hotel, he added.

“We were dealing with drug dealing, we were dealing with needles where one wouldn’t expect, we were dealing with stolen things – and I don’t just mean soap, I mean TVs, air conditioners,” he said. “Regrettably, most of all I think, was abuse to the staff, and threats.”

BC Housing said staff will be on site around the clock to provide security for residents and the neighbourhood, the province said. A community advisory committee is also being set up to deal with concerns raised by neighbours. An experienced non-profit operator for Paul’s is expected to be chosen in coming weeks, the government said.

Why it matters: Vancouver tech firm long at the centre of rumours of an IPO or sale

article continues below

Hootsuite has landed a new CEO following a nearly eight-month search to replace co-founder Ryan Holmes.

The Vancouver-based social media management company announced Monday (June 29) that Tom Keiser is set to take the helm July 6.

Holmes, who publicly revealed his intentions to step down as CEO in November 2019 to spend time with family, will remain as Hootsuite’s board chairman.

Keiser is the former chief operating officer of American software firm Zendesk Inc.

He presently lists his location on LinkedIn as San Francisco.

“Prior to joining Zendesk I held CIO [chief information officer] positions with two of the largest apparel specialty retailers in North America, Gap Inc. and L Brands. Prior to retail, I spent 12 years in management consulting with Ernst & Young and Capgemini,” Keiser states on his LinkedIn profile.

“I’m a father, husband, traveller, avid reader, long serving board member of Big Brothers Big Sisters, sports enthusiast, fisherman, art collector and I have a decent jump shot.”

In a news release from Hootsuite, Keiser is described as having helped boost Zendesk’s annual revenue from $200 million to nearly $1 billion.

While Hootsuite had been at the centre of speculation for a possible initial public offering for years, Reuters reported in 2018 the company had engaged Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to inquire about a potential sale.

But the process was abandoned just before Christmas 2018 when Hootsuite determined offers were less than the US$750 million it was aiming for, according to a January 2019 report from the Globe and Mail.

Holmes said in a November 2019 statement to Business in Vancouver Hootsuite undertook a benchmarking exercise at the beginning of 2019 and determined that the company “sit[s] very well amongst a number of criteria” for other companies at have gone public in the past year.

The team found that within the companies examined, the average age was 14 years old, the average valuation is $3.6 billion and the average annual recurring revenue is about $200 million.

Hootsuite was founded in 2008 has about 1,000 employees worldwide.

Now with some destinations starting to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

Five questions with Tourism Australia

Visitors to ustralia can take in a Jarramali Rock Art Tour. Photo Jarramali Rock Art Tours

How do you measure tourism numbers and how does Canada fit into that?

If we look at the most recent statistics from the government’s International and National Visitor Survey, which are for the year to December 2019 — just prior to the crises — it shows that our industry was in a very strong position and a major economic driver — highlighting the important role that tourism will play in Australia’s economic recovery when the coronavirus crisis passes.

The most recent figures for the 2019 year-end show that the Australian tourism industry contributes $126 billion ($80 billion domestic overnight visitor spend & $45.5 billion in international overnight visitor spend) to the Australian economy each year to one that has virtually been put on hold since restrictions were introduced due to COVID-19.

In terms of international travel, Australia welcomed 9.5 million visitors in 2019, including 190k visitors from Canada who spent $892 million on trips to Australia.

What does the future hold for your destination and are there any travel trends we can look forward to?

After spending more time at home and indoors, we’ll no doubt see a lot of the pent-up desire for travel with people wanting to get out and about more and reconnect by exploring nature through travel.

Domestically, we're already seeing a new appreciation for our natural beauty and wide-open spaces with which we expect to see a surge in Australians embracing road trips, and planning their own epic routes to discover their backyards, as some state borders have begun to reopen.

When the time is right for international travel to return to Australia, visitors will be able to indulge in the great food and wine, spectacular nature and wildlife experiences, and uniquely Australian arts and culture moments that Australia is well known for.

Australia is home to so many incredible and diverse landscapes, offering plenty of open-air experiences — from the Outback to the Great Barrier Reef as well as the many Great Walks of Australia and more — visitors are literally spoilt for choice.

Finally, wellness travel (i.e. spa holidays, yoga retreats) was growing in popularity as we closed out 2019 and the last six months have amplified the desire for this type of holiday.

When do you think your destination will be welcoming visitors once again?

International travel has effectively been at a standstill since Australia announced the closure of its borders on 20 March 2020, and it is not certain when international borders will re-open.

At this stage we are just starting to see borders reopen between some, but not all, states and territories in Australia.

From Tourism Australia’s perspective attracting international travellers will form a critical part of the tourism restart and recovery in Australia, but will likely be further down the track.

We just don’t know when international restrictions will start to be lifted, nor how the

process of restoring international travel will play out. But we will be ready to go back and go back at scale when the time is right.

Is Australia considering any ""travel bubbles"" with any other countries?

While we all want to see the return of international visitors, that’s still some way off and given domestic travel restrictions are being lifted before international ones, recovery will undoubtedly be domestic led.

However, Tourism Australia remains active in 15 international markets including Canada. For the moment we are also active in domestic marketing as we look to support our industry through these challenging times.

The process of rebuilding tourism is likely to be gradual, beginning first with visits to local cafes and restaurants, day trips, intrastate road trips and weekend breaks.

Then, as the state borders gradually re-open, interstate travel, when people have the opportunity to explore further afield. And eventually international travel, potentially starting with our near neighbours, New Zealand.

What are you doing now to keep travellers interested in Australia?

Tourism Australia has been committed to bringing Australia's unique and iconic experiences into the living rooms of grounded travellers around the world through Live from Aus, a jam-packed program of live entertainment delivered by Aussie experts in everything from koalas and kangaroos, to mountain biking, music, food and wine and much more.

The wide range of programming virtually transports viewers across the country, into every state and even underwater.

What started as a weekend of live events has continued with several recent videos, all available on-demand on Australia's YouTube channel.

We can't wait to welcome our mates from around the world Down Under when it is once again safe to travel, and in the meantime, we encourage travellers to take this time to daydream of their next trip and make it the most memorable holiday they've ever had.

We're constantly adding to the growing library of content and resources on Australia.com, including virtual tours of Australia's top sites and wildlife experiences, Australian entertainment to tune in from home and tips for planning your next Aussie trip from your living room.

We hope it inspires people to keep the wanderlust alive and to come visit us soon, because there's still nothing like Australia.

Some patients due for general cleanings and checkups might have to wait longer as dentists attend to those in extreme pain or who had partial treatments and temporary work done before COVID-19 closed offices in mid-March.

article continues below

“After two or three months, a small problem in February is now a greater one — a filling might be a root canal — or temporary crowns that didn’t last,” said Dr. Maico Melo, a dental surgeon who runs practices in Victoria and Duncan. “The huge number of partial treatments creates a real nightmare for patients and dental professionals.”

Melo, past president of the Canadian Association of Dental Surgeons and board member of the College of Dental Surgeons of B.C., continued practising through the pandemic as an essential-service provider. He handled about 50 cases of patients needing emergency attention over six weeks, regardless of whether they had insurance to cover costs.

He said COVID-19 has “magnified” problems with oral health, and governments need to do more to fund dental care.

Melo said dentistry gets less than 0.2 per cent of the entire health budget in B.C., noting of about $2 billion earmarked for physicians, less than $4 million is channelled to dentistry.

Dr. Ross Crapo, who closed his Broadmead office on March 16 and reopened May 19, said dental diseases are some of the most “ubiquitous diseases on the planet,” including gum disease, decay and loss of teeth.

“The mouth is such a dynamic environment,” said Crapo. “And 50 per cent of the population don’t see a dentist unless there’s an emergency.”

Dental offices were part of B.C.’s second phase of openings and have to adhere to strict guidelines from the province and professional colleges. Although hygiene procedures have always been a high priority in dental settings, Crapo said changes had to be made.

“During that time we were closed, we were watching locally and globally and we knew we had to open with different routines,” Crapo said. “Dental offices that offer a wide range of services like surgeries are miniature hospitals themselves, so everybody has to come to that level. In retrospect, with what has been done, we feel our protocols would allow us to practice through a potential second wave [of the coronavirus].”

Reopened dental offices might feel and look different, and care methods will change, Alastair Nicoll, head of the B.C. Dental Association’s COVID-19 task force, said last month.

Patients are being asked about their health by phone before an appointment. Bookings are spread out to avoid patients crossing paths. Waiting rooms will not have magazines or toys, and patients will likely go straight to the dentist’s chair upon arrival, after speaking to front-desk staff behind a plexiglass barrier.

Other new measures include gowns and face shields or specialized coverings that allow dentists to continue to use magnifying eyewear.

Nicoll said dentists have been dealing with the risk of cross-infection for years, citing previous outbreaks of H1N1, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis C and influenza. “So we are well used to rigorous sterilization protocols.”

Crapo said he has installed high-efficiency scrubbing systems, allowing the dental office to filter the air for organisms 10 times smaller than the coronavirus. He said the system turns the air over in the office every 10 to 15 minutes.

Dentists are also required to use higher-volume suction to clear aerosols created when using high-speed hand tools for drilling and grinding. Guidelines also say aerosol-generating tools “must be kept to a minimum” to avoid the spread of excess droplets.

Crapo said every patient and staff member receives a temperature check and pulse oximeter, which attaches to a fingertip and shows the percentage of oxygen in your blood coming from your heart, as well as your pulse rate. Anyone with an oximeter rate of 90 or under won’t be permitted in the office and would be asked to book an appointment in 14 days. Crapo said.

This majestic Canadian territory — renowned for its awe-inspiring natural beauty, Indigenous culture and history, and unforgettable attractions — has attracted millions of guests from around the globe.

article continues below

Of course, ongoing travel restrictions due to COVID-19 mean the Yukon is currently closed to visitors. (British Columbia residents will be admitted into the territory beginning July 1.)

But, Tourism Yukon can’t wait that long and wants everyone in the world to experience the charm of this Canadian gem right now.

And now you can — without leaving home — with two new ways to escape to the Yukon from anywhere on the planet.

Each of these initiatives offer opportunities to learn more about the territory, have fun and gain inspiration for when visitors are welcome once more.

YUKON BOOK CLUB

The Yukon has been the setting of countless classic novels throughout literary history.

If you can’t visit the Yukon this summer (or to help get you in the mood for your upcoming journey), you’re invited to visit the Yukon Book Club virtually.

Tourism Yukon has selected some of the best classic and contemporary fiction set in the Yukon and is making these books available for download from TravelYukon.com.

Readers will gain a deeper understanding of the locations described in the books, thanks to interactive story maps, which offer photos, expert historical information and more.

The first two titles in the Yukon Book Club include:

The Call of the Wild

By Jack London

Published in 1903, this world-famous short novel about a sled dog’s adventures during the Klondike Gold Rush has never been out of print, and is considered one of the most famous stories of all time.



Strange Things Done

By Elle Wild

Winner of the prestigious Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel, this 2017 thriller tells the tale of Jo Silver, an investigative journalist who becomes a prime suspect in the death of a Dawson City politician.



SWEATIN’ TO THE YUKON

Something about the Yukon has always inspired people to be active. From the engaging energy of the people who call it home, to the breathtaking beauty of its wide-open spaces, the Yukon gets locals and visitors alike moving — and loving it.

Check out this interactive map,['Diane Strandberg'],,"With the U.S. border closed to travellers because of widespread coronavirus, Tri-City residents will be looking for safer places they can visit over the coming months.

B.C. is now an option with Phase 3 of the province’s COVID-19 restart plan, although social distancing must be maintained.

But the rest of Canada is an option, too, with some restrictions.

Some province are shutting their doors to visitors, and others staying open but with precautions.

With this confusing scenario, many people must be wondering who will still welcome them with open arms.

To help clarify travel restrictions, the Canadian Travel and Tourism Roundtable has created an interactive map that shows Canadians where they can go and what restrictions might be in place.

British Columbians have lots of options.

We can still travel to most provinces except for the Northwest Territories, Nunavut and the Maritimes where an Atlantic bubble has been created to permit inter-provincial travel between Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.

Closer to home, those wishing to visit Alberta are welcome and the website indicates that accommodations, restaurants, museums and art galleries are open.

However, travellers should take precautions as numbers of COVID-19 cases vary by province.

Compared to B.C., for example, Alberta has twice as many COVID-19 cases and double the number of daily cases.

However, Albertans also have more testing options than B.C.

According to the Alberta government, people can get COVID-19 testing at pharmacies even if they don’t have symptoms.

So with those long, hot days of summer to come, maybe it’s time for a road trip.

Just be sure to follow these tips:

They are as follows:

• pre-trip planning and research on available resources at arriving destination;

• respect any local travel advisories to isolated and remote communities;

• no travelling for anyone who is sick, and if symptoms develop while travelling, self isolate immediately and contact 811 for guidance and testing;

• practise safe physical distancing of two metres at all times;

• spend time in small groups and open spaces; and

• practise good hygiene, including frequent handwashing and cleaning.

Five questions with Visit Las Vegas

Las Vegas is open for business. Photo Las Vegas News Bureau

Where does Canada fit in with your yearly visitors?

Canada is a vital market for Las Vegas, it is our number one source of international visitation to the destination. Vegas is now open and we can’t wait to welcome our Canadian visitors back.

With Las Vegas gradually opening, about what percentage of casinos and resorts/hotels are open?

By this weekend, there will be almost 230 hotels open in Las Vegas, and of the ones open, they represent approximately 108k hotel rooms.

However, not all those rooms are bookable/available. Resorts and hotels are operating at an optimal capacity ideal for each individual property.

As Vegas opens, what can visitors expect? For example, how does social distancing work in a casino?

Our guest experience has been reimagined, but they can still enjoy many of the amenities — dining, gaming and relaxation and the “only-in-Vegas” offerings.

The health and wellbeing of our visitors continues to be our number one priority. We recognize the importance of emphasizing that health and wellbeing is a shared responsibility of the destination as well as our individual visitors and in turn launched our Vegas Smart campaign.

The #VegasSmart campaign is a reminder to visitors and locals that the destination is doing everything it can to be smart and help them stay healthy.

Our hospitality partners — which include our hotels and casinos, independent dining establishments and entertainment groups — are all following directives from the governor and Nevada gaming regulators.

Las Vegas entertainment, including live shows, will be phased in over time. These drums are from a previous backstage tour of the Beatles LOVE by Cirque du Soleil. Photo Sandra Thomas

Will there be live shows? Las Vegas’ entertainment will re-emerge in phases as our resort partners look to safely and responsibly bring shows back.

Visitors can still a enjoy a variety of different experiences — from our world-class resorts, to fine dining to outdoor adventure and nature tourism surrounding the city.

Do you predict there might be some food/hotels deals to be had in the next couple of months for future travel?

Yes, our guests can look forward to great value in Las Vegas. We have aggregated a collection of deals from various partners on our website to make planning your next trip to Vegas quick, easy and convenient.

But with COVID-19 factoring in, Whistler's summer experience is going to look much different than in past years.

article continues below

""It's a complete behavioural change, and I think the thing that people should take home is that we want to get open in a safe and responsible way—it's not going to be the same experience that they're used to, but we're very eager to get back at it,"" said Marc Riddell, Vail Resorts' West Coast director of communications.

""The team has been working hard. Frankly they've been working their butts off trying to figure this thing out, and we're happy that we can deliver what we're going to deliver on June 29.""

The Whistler Village Gondola, Peak 2 Peak Gondola and Blackcomb Gondola will bring hikers and sightseeing guests up the mountains, while the Whistler Mountain Bike Park will open with the Fitz and Garbanzo zones. Grab-and-go food options will also be available at the Rendezvous, Garbanzo Bike and Bean, and the Roundhouse Lodge.

All on-mountain transactions will be cashless.

The Blackcomb Ascent Trails will not be open right away, but could be phased in as summer progresses.

Physical distancing rules will be in place and masks will have to be worn in several areas of the mountain including during line-ups and loading.

While most guests will likely be accustomed to being asked to physically distance, and maintain two metres from others, ""the thing that is perhaps different for the guests is that we are asking them to wear face coverings, and that's including people that are going to be using the bike park,"" Riddell said.

""And you know, face coverings can be a buff, or it can be a gator, it can be a mask ... it's all down to individual preference. But you're going to have to wear a face mask when you're loading and unloading chairlifts, [and] when you're riding in gondolas, so that's going to be a new thing.""

Those without a mask will be asked to leave, Riddell said.

Gondolas and other high-touch surfaces will be frequently cleaned and disinfected, while hand-sanitizing stations will be provided.

""If you come with a party you're going to be required to ride the gondola with that party,"" Riddell said.

""We're not going to mix and match folks, with the exception of the Peak 2 Peak gondola where you'll have Plexiglas barriers in place and a limited capacity per gondola on that.""

Pass pricing will be posted online in the coming days, but Riddell said guests can expect similar prices to past summers.

While rentals will still be available (with proper cleaning and disinfecting protocols in place), bike school, lessons and camps will not be offered to start.

""We're going to evaluate that and we're hoping to introduce bike school as we go along, but certainly camps like the DFX camps won't be running this year,"" Riddell said.

Park riders are also asked not to camp out the night before opening day.

Capacity will be monitored consistently throughout the day, and managed as necessary, Riddell said.

""It's all in order to make sure that we can maintain physical distance for everybody in a safe manner, but it's not what we're going to lead with,"" he said.

""We're just inviting folks to come, and if we do have capacity issues then we'll address it on the day, but we're not going to say, 'This is the number per day, this is what you have to do.'""

As far as staffing goes, Riddell said it's an all-hands-on-deck approach, with some staff members taking on jobs they may not be accustomed to doing to help fill in any gaps.

""We're going to throw ourselves at the operations and make sure that we're staffed going forward with this, but we're pretty confident we have the staff available to deliver what we're offering here,"" Riddell said.

All WB employees will be required to wear a face cover, wash their hands regularly, stay home if sick, undergo daily health screenings, and participate in special COVID-19 training.

Five questions with Celina Sinclair, Global Markets Specialist, Utah Office of Tourism.

How do you measure tourism numbers for your destination?

The Utah Office of Tourism measures tourism numbers to Utah in several ways, including visitation to our Mighty 5® national parks and 44 state parks, visitor spending, visitor profile reports for domestic travel and Tourism Economics for international travel.

How has COVID-19 impacted tourism in your region?

Like the rest of the world, tourism came to a halt in Utah. The Utah Leads Together Plan helped to mitigate the unavoidable economic impact of COVID-19 through a phased reactivation of Utah’s economy guided by vigilance, data-informed decisions, respect for geographic differences, care for the vulnerable and new protocols for safety.

The Utah Office of Tourism has been supporting our tourism businesses and local communities so they will still be there when it comes time to welcome Canadians and other visitors back to our destination.

The stories of support have ranged from Utah resident and bar owner Ty Burrell (who played Phil Dunphy on Modern Family) donating to support local hospitality workers to Ski Utah contributing to ‘Goggles for Docs’ to provide health care workers with ski goggles as a form of eye protection while fighting COVID-19.

Do you believe the virus has changed the way people are looking at travel?

The pandemic has changed the way we view travel, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

We are optimistic that when the time is right to travel again, visitors to Utah will approach travel with a new level of planning, a mindful and localized approach, and a desire to travel responsibly.

Travelling responsibly means planning ahead. Reading ahead. Slowing down when possible and stopping to fully appreciate all that is around you, whether you’re travelling alone or with friends and family.

For some, it can mean giving back. Becoming ambassadors of place. And coming back to Utah year after year.

What does the future hold for your destination and when do you think it will be welcoming visitors once again?

It’s too soon to say when we will be welcoming International visitors to Utah again, especially at the pre-pandemic levels that sustained and grew our thriving tourism economy.

We want to be mindful of the fact that everyone is in a different stage and experiencing this pandemic in a different way.

We hope that as people emerge from indoors they will seek the openness and soul-awakening adventure that Utah’s vast landscapes have to offer. Utahns have innovated and shown creativity within constraints throughout the crisis and we fully expect our tourism industry to step up to the challenge of welcoming back our visitors when the time is right.

The Greatest Snow on Earth® will still fall on Utah’s mountains at our 15 ski resorts and together with the red rock landscapes of our Mighty 5® national parks as well as 44 state parks, Utah’s diverse landscapes will beckon visitors, including British Columbians, to visit Utah once again be it for ski season next winter or for that epic family road trip.

What travel trends do you predict for later this year and 2021?

If we could summarize what we predict for travel once it resumes it’s, “pent-up demand meets aspiration.”

As Utah slowly re-opens, we are starting to see local Utahns take full advantage of the “embarrassment of riches” in our own backyard.

We then expect the regional drive markets will look to Utah for that change of scenery they are craving because few destinations match the diversity of landscapes that Utah offers.

We also anticipate Canadians — British Columbians and Albertans in particular, especially those who travel by RV — will be the first international visitors to return to Utah when the Canada-U.S. border re-opens.

With a new openness and appreciation for details, our visitors might be more inclined to hire a guide, engage with Utah’s natural and human history, and take the time to better understand the communities at the core of the state’s unique offerings. And these travellers will seek experiences that shape lasting memories.

We expect people to seek out wellness experiences that bridge healing and adventure, whether that’s camping at Northern Utah’s Bear Lake (nicknamed “the Caribbean of the Rockies”), stargazing at one of nearly 20 internationally accredited dark sky parks and communities (more than any destination in the world!) or just walking toward the liminal horizon of the Great Salt Lake.

We often hear visitors share experiences of the healing power of Utah, and it’s that special, quiet power that we expect will call to people even more in the future, and that lends itself perfectly to long-awaited travel experiences rooted in wellness.

But the manager at a Toronto accounting firm says getting dressed has become a whole lot simpler since the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered offices to turn homes into makeshift workspaces.

article continues below

After weeks of toiling away in T-shirts and leggings, 26-year-old Baron dreads the day she has to dust off her dress shirts and blouses for her commute — but lately, it's hard to imagine how she and her colleagues will get back to business as usual.

""I feel like people were starting to see it was unnecessary to always have to dress business casual. It's more about being comfortable,"" she said.

""This may be the thing that pushes it over the edge.""

Baron is one of many erstwhile desk-dwellers who are trading in their slacks for sweatpants as the work-from-home era has loosened up corporate dress codes.

As employers in some regions gradually reopen offices, designers and trend-watchers say the clamour for professional clothing people can feel at home in could lead to a surge in ""work-leisure"" wear.

""People are just as — if not more — productive when they're working at home and they're comfortable,"" said Vancouver designer Jess Sternberg.

""There's no reason not to adapt some of those lifestyle changes to the new world that we're going to be entering in the office.""

The owner of Free Label said e-commerce sales have doubled as the sustainable clothing brand's upscale basics have proven a perfect fit for professionals revamping their work wardrobes with pieces they can wear while lolling about in their living rooms or meeting with clients over video-chat.

Sammi Smith, founder and designer of Toronto-based Soft Focus, said online demand for her sleepwear-inspired silhouettes has soared during lockdown. The success is perhaps unsurprising given that the line began with Smith's own transition from a corporate fashion job to starting her own venture from home.

Searching for styles suited to running a business from her couch, Smith set out to design clothing for women who want to ""power dress in pyjamas."" Depending on how you style an outfit, Smith said a collared sleep shirt can become a breezy blouse, or a terry cloth sweatsuit can double as a cozy twist on the classic pantsuit.

""I sometimes joke that fancy pajamas are the uniform of the gig economy,"" said Smith. ""Perhaps they'll also become the uniform of the new work-from-home protocol.""

Big-name apparel brands also seem to have noticed that comfort never goes out of style.

Uniqlo Canada has seen a more than 200-per-cent surge in comfortable clothing sales, according marketing manager Sehee Kim. Top-sellers include work-home crossover fashions such as draped drawstring pants.

Lululemon Athletica has also expanded its selection of sweat-wicking work apparel as the Vancouver-based company's stock price reached all-time highs on the NASDAQ this month.

Retail analyst Bruce Winder said the rise of ""work-leisure"" is a rare bright spot in an otherwise bleak industry landscape.

Statistics Canada reported that clothing and accessory sales were slashed by more than half in March — the largest one-month drop on record — and Winder said the forecast for April looks even grimmer.

Even as stores in some areas slowly start to welcome back customers, Winder said COVID-19 closures may be the death knell for ""yesterday's brands,"" particularly those associated with buttoned-up office fashions.

For example, Reitmans is filing for creditor protection after an unsuccessful attempt to appeal to young career women saw its Smart Set banner shut down in 2014.

Carolyn Levy, president of technology for human resources consultancy Randstad Canada, said suit-and-tie attire fell out of fashion in most workplaces long ago. But as people settle into working in sweats, she predicts to see the push to relieve workers from the restrictions of gut-pinching waistbands will accelerate.

Even in the weeks since the pandemic upended professional life, Levy said early efforts to maintain decorum during Zoom conferences have given way to hoodies and baseball caps, and even people who seem put together on camera could be dressing down outside the frame.

While she doesn't anticipate seeing bathrobes in the boardroom anytime soon, Levy suspects that the days of busting out of an itchy, ill-fitting suit when you walk through the door may very well be behind us.

""It will be about what are other fabrics you can wear that are comfortable and that still look presentable,"" said Levy. ""They have a casual flair to them, they let your personality show through, but you feel good.""

Ben Barry, chair of the Ryerson School of Fashion, said traditional workwear is tailored to fit a white, western and masculine ideal of who looks ""professional"" that excludes many types of bodies.

Now that COVID-19 has challenged deap-seated corporate conventions, Barry urged companies to take the opportunity to remove sartorial barriers so people of all sizes, abilities and genders can let their talent shine through their work and their wardrobe.

""Finding that hybrid between workwear and leisurewear is going to open up access to so many more people to feel at home in their bodies,"" said Barry.

""I think that ultimately leads to feeling more connected to where we work, a heightened sense of creativity and more people being able to bring their whole selves to work.""

SOLE performance medium footbeds

Sole was founded in North Vancouver in 2001 with a mission to help people live active lives in comfort. Their footwear are made with recycled products that have the least possible impact on the planet. Their award-winning eco-friendly footbeds ($65 at yoursole.com) are made from recycled wine corks and easily slide into favourite footwear. They’re a savvy consumer’s choice for supportive insoles, reducing pain and fatigue when walking or running.

Who couldn’t use that – especially as we aim to increase our activity after the indulgent holiday feasts? Sole has a full line of sustainable leisure footwear, made with 100 per cent recycled wine corks and algae bloom foam. Select models are available at the Run Centre on Lonsdale, North Vancouver, and at Kintec on Marine Drive.

Maska long faux leather dress

Nothing is more comforting than walking in to a room wearing the perfect dress. This beauty not only fits comfortably, boosting confidence, it has the allure of leather with no animal by-products. Maska at Park Royal carries a fashion- forward, classy clothing and accessories collection to suit discerning tastes. Italian labels such as Imperial Fashion, Simona Corsellini, Tenax and Babylon count among the brand’s exclusive collection. I love the easy fit and timeless, stylish swing of this faux leather dress (priced from $230, at Maska, Park Royal). With a fitted bodice and full skirt, the matching shoe possibilities are endless.

Wildwood Eyewear Biosunnies

When its not raining, the winter sun shines bright – especially on the ski hills.Some of the most eco-friendly sunglasses on the planet are available right here on the North Shore. Wildwood Eyewear’s Biosunnies are plant based, biodegradable classic- styled sunglasses made from wheat straw.

As a member of 1% For The Planet, Wildwood donates one per cent of gross sales to environmental non-profits. Sunglasses are hand finished from bamboo, maple, walnut and zebra wood. While regular tinted lenses reduce brightness, they do not reduce harmful glare. Polarized sunglasses lenses like these contain a chemical filter that absorbs horizontal light waves, while allowing the vertical waves to pass through, reducing eye strain. The polarized chemical filter eliminates glare but preserves colour, and depth.

Priced from $30. Available in the giftware department at Pharmasave Caulfeild Village.

Wishing you successful shopping ventures, the happiest of holidays, and hoping you celebrate in style!

During the season, I find it helps narrow the search to be mindful of the tastes of those we shop for, and also the degree of care and sustainability the brands we buy from strive for.



Jewelry in support of single moms

Over the years I’ve accumulated a few dramatic statement pieces from Blue Ruby Jewellery – they always seem to have a plethora of interesting creations by talented, and often local artisans on display. This season, a dynamic new collection, in collaboration with the Cause We Care Foundation, can add deeper meaning to your seasonal shopping. All of the proceeds from these handcrafted bracelets go towards programs and initiatives to help single-mother led families and their children in need across Metro Vancouver.

Gold-filled beads, crystals, cubic zirconia and hematite mark a departure from the brand’s traditional semi-precious stone styles. These beautiful bracelets ($40 to $95, and available at Blue Ruby’s Park Royal location) are a meaningful gift idea that create positive change in the lives of those in our community.

Cause We Care recently launched the Single Mothers Support Fund, to benefit single mothers enrolled in education or back-to-work job training programs, leading them to a life of financial independence.

Animal friendly fashion

The British Columbia Achievement Foundation recently announced the recipients of the 2019 Carter Wosk Award for Applied Art and Design. Among them is fashion designer Morgan Mallett, whose fusion of industrial and organic esthetic, Design + Conquer is best described as a breakaway design faction. Specializing in bespoke accessory and garment design for an array of contexts, Mallett explores new design territory through the use and creation of innovative materials and techniques.

An advocate for animal welfare and a participant in mountain trail maintenance on Vancouver’s North Shore, Design + Conquer supports the BCSPCA and Vancouver’s North Shore Mountain Bike Association. Design + Conquer does not use animal products in its designs.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Design + Conquer’s accessories and garment designs have been featured in museums around the world. Pricing is on request. Select pieces are available at Simons stores online, and at the Polygon Gallery gift shop.

Evalina Beauty

Canada’s newest indie beauty line just launched in Vancouver, kicking off with an unveiling event at Vancouver Club last week. President and founder Samantha Legge, Pemberton Heights resident, mother of two and president of Canada Wide Media, created Evalina Beauty with the mission of celebrating women for who they are, as they are. Legge said Evalina means “life” in Hebrew and related that she created her cosmetics line, 14 months in the making, not to transform women’s appearances, but to enhance them.

Evalina products are paraben-free, cruelty-free, and designed to feel lightweight — so it’s not about covering up — it’s about enhancing natural beauty. The Dew Beauty Benefit Cream is a multi-tasking powerhouse that provides sheer coverage. Having tested the product, I can say it makes my face feel naturally hydrated, and gives me the “no makeup” look I prefer. It’s available in a range of shades to match most complexions.

Shop for a cause: when you make a purchase from Evalina Beauty, a portion of all proceeds are donated to charities supporting women and children in need, and a portion of proceeds from the launch event were given to Crabtree Corner at the YWCA.

Kolton Babych Jewelry

I am drawn to the modern, versatile jewelry handmade by Kolton Babych in North Vancouver. With nods to nature, Babych uses a century-old technique called wax casting in his jewelry. Babych launched his own Vancouver-based atelier, creating ready-to-wear as well as bespoke jewelry designs in silver, gold and fine gemstones.

These sterling silver Honeybee Studs are a symbol of wisdom and community. These chic studs transcend trends and will complement any outfit.

I strongly believe an active approach to investing has many more advantages than the buy and hold method. The latter became very popular in the 1990s with large mutual fund company AIC even having the slogan, “Buy, Hold and Prosper.” My interpretation of this was “buy, hold and hope for the best.”



One of the issues with a buy and hold approach is that extreme market volatility can result in severe declines that take years to recover from. Compound that with the fact that many investors don’t hold through extreme market volatility and instead, fear typically causes them to make the wrong decision at the wrong time, selling out many times at the bottom and then miss the recovery, permanently impacting their portfolio. I believe it is much better to have a strategy in place that actively raises cash in stages and then puts it back to work on the rebound.



While there are never any guarantees when investing, it’s important to stick to your investment strategy throughout the market swings to continue on the path of achieving your financial goals. This doesn’t mean “buy and hold,” or “buy and hope,” but instead your strategy needs to be flexible and allow for your asset allocation to change with conditions, such as holding more cash during periods of increased risk in the markets.

It’s been a debate time and time again, does active management work?



It depends on the portfolio manager but it also depends on your risk tolerance. If you have no emotion about your portfolio volatility, have a long enough time horizon and can sleep at night with a 30 to 40 per cent decline then a buy and hold strategy can make sense for long-term returns. Simply buy a passive, low cost index fund and hold onto it through good and bad markets.

article continues below

In reality, few can stomach the swings. With the volatility we have seen over the past eight weeks, many self-directed investors have come to us with their portfolios in a battered state. An extreme example would be investors with energy exposure which is down 50 to 60 per cent this year and are asking for advice, wishing that they had the appropriate risk management in place before everything changed. Most investors we come across don’t want to see this type of drop in their portfolio nor can they afford it if they are retired. It can drastically change your retirement if the recovery takes years to make back significant losses.



In comparison, active managers believe that making necessary changes is paramount to protecting your portfolio. This can include moving out of sectors that are underperforming, selling stocks that have seen a fundamental change in the business, or increasing cash positions in periods of heightened risk. This type of active management can produce better risk adjusted returns. Active managers remain flexible and can adjust client portfolios to reduce the risk of sectors that may be effected due to the coronavirus or the crash of oil. ETFs or passive investments don't make these strategic changes.



Raising cash is one of the most valuable risk management strategies. This “dry powder on the sidelines” not only protects the downside but allows you to get back into the market at more favourable prices.

Picking the exact bottom is an impossible task that no one can time perfectly but buying opportunities will present themselves to those that are watching for good value.



Active management takes time, skill, knowledge and experience. The best strategies will remove emotion from the decision making process and result in sound, logical moves that ultimately result in achieving the targeted return with less risk and volatility. This is why it’s key for investors to ensure that they have the right plan for today’s market and a strong investment team to help them navigate the markets.

It took less than a week for markets to enter correction territory (defined as a 10 per cent drop). While this correction came faster than anyone expected, the size of the downturn is actually still quite within normal levels and in line with ones we’ve experienced many times over the last decade.



Markets have risen eight out of the last 11 years despite annual corrections so we believe that we will be able to weather this storm with active management, especially when there are no signs of an upcoming recession.



There has been swift action taken by governments around the world which I feel will help to reduce the coronavirus from being a real long-term problem. The Fed has moved pro-actively to lower rates by half a percent to support the U.S. economy in response to the growing threat of the virus and its uncertain effects. Usually investors respond positively to lower rates as it lowers borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. However, markets pulled back on the Fed news, as this may have signaled that there might be worry about the virus and its potential effects on the economy. The Bank of Canada followed suit and also lowered interest rates by the same 0.50 per cent. This should benefit Canadians who have a floating-rate mortgage or any other debt that has a variable interest payment.



It’s likely that this extreme fear is overblown, as the fundamentals of the U.S. economy are still in a good position with a strong housing market, consumer, and employment all doing very well. While it is still too early to assess the economic impact of the virus, we believe that the U.S. should be able to remain solid through any short-term effects. It is fair to expect weaker growth in the first and second quarter of 2020 and investors should be prepared for that. In China, for example, quarantine measures have led to lower activity that will likely trickle through to lower economic growth. Disruption of global supply chains and travel have led to a decrease in forecasted earnings growth. Markets could remain choppy until we get more clarity on the rate of spread outside of China and if we see the virus contained.



At this point in time, while the risks have increased, we are not of the belief that the current environment will evolve into a recession. The coronavirus is mainly expected to impact short-term growth, implying little expected change in the long-term fair value of risk assets.



It is important when stock markets start getting volatile that you have a defensive strategy in place for your portfolio. Some sectors or geographic areas will be impacted more than others and you’ll want to ensure you limit your exposure. This can be done through raising cash, getting defensive early, shifting into sectors that aren’t affected as much and avoiding sectors that are affected such as hospitality, airlines, energy, and materials. This can help you lower the volatility in your portfolio and have better downside protection. Eventually this shall pass and markets will settle. Once they do, it’s important to invest in strong, well-known companies that have pulled back with market fears but in reality aren’t significantly impacted by the coronavirus. Corrections are a natural part of the investment cycle and staying all in cash out of fear is the wrong move. Over the long term, investors who actively managed their investments and used volatility as an opportunity to buy have most often reaped the benefits.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

""We have a really good team,” says Shaun Openshaw, Assistant Sales Manager. “I've been working here for seven years and I’ve seen the benefits of this kind of family-type environment firsthand. We all work together, not just in our separate areas of sales, service, and parts.”

“And we all have a strong desire to ensure that there are no communication gaps in the customer experience.”

Garry Speranza, Sales Manager for Capilano VW, agrees.

“I started out as a lot boy about 30 years ago,"" he says, ""and I worked my way up through sales to Assistant Sales Manager and then to my present position. It’s a common theme here at Capilano: many of our staff have been with the company for more than five years. And some, like me, have been here a lot longer than that.”

When asked why Capilano has been so successful, Garry has a simple answer: ""Capilano VW treats its employees well,"" he says, ""and that translates into employees treating customers well.”

According to Garry, that family feeling extends out past their customers to the community itself.

""We're a proud sponsor of the North Shore Alliance Church Soccer Team, who were the 2016 Charity Shield Champions,"" Garry points out. ""We also sponsor the North Shore Rangers ice hockey team, as well as a local soccer team that both Shaun and I play for.""

Part of the North Shore community for more than 30 years, Capilano VW is the number one sponsor for Kids Summer Camps on the North Shore and is active in many other areas of the community, as well.

Hanson & Co also includes two senior level Associate Lawyers (Lawrence O’Neill and John Green), four paralegal/legal assistants, a receptionist and a bookkeeper.

“We represent anyone who has been injured, suffered pain, loss of income or loss of opportunities as a result of someone else’s negligence. Our clients range from people injured in car accidents, boating, cycling or motorcycle accidents. We only represent the plaintiff (the injured person) – not Government, ICBC or Insurance Companies

“We are the largest personal injury law firm on the North Shore,” adds Jim. “We are highly experienced and have both the background and the resources to ensure that injury cases are handled properly and that our clients are treated right.”

Hanson & Co is involved in and supports numerous community organizations. This community involvement has shaped the core values of the company.

“We deal with people at very traumatic times in their life,” Jim explains. “They are suffering physical injuries and resulting emotional issues that affect their finances and even their family. We place ourselves into that situation in a supportive way. We focus on being approachable, listening with compassion, empathy and connecting with our clients, and connecting them to the professionals who can best assist them in their recovery, in addition to dealing with ICBC and/or the party responsible for the harm on our client’s behalf.”

Making the law accessible to all is also a priority. “We take cases with merit on a contingency basis,” says Jim. “We get paid when the client gets paid, so there is no expensive up-front retainer to pay.”

Hanson & Co now has a free app for smartphones and tablets available in the app store under ‘Hanson & Co.’

“We know that when people have been in an accident it is upsetting and sometimes hard to think clearly,” says Jim. “We suggest that people download the app—we hope they don’t need it but if they do it provides a place to capture the details of the incident such of the photos, location, witness names and phone numbers, nearest hospital, taxi’s, towing services and more.”

Chris is referring to the 12 new models that Volvo has planned for the Canadian market.

“Right now, our biggest selling model is the XC90,” Christopher says. “It’s an award-winning SUV with a turbo- and super-charged T8 engine producing 400 Horsepower. It’s also a plug-in hybrid car, offering a combined fuel economy of 4.3 Liters per 100 Km. However, over the next three years we’ll be seeing cars from Volvo like we’ve never seen before.”

All new models will offer plug-in hybrid capabilities and will come in a variety of styles, while retaining the Volvo reputation for luxury, comfort and safety.

“We’ll be offering three types of engines,” Chris explains. “There’ll be the T5 turbo-charged four-cylinder gas engine (240 HP), the T6 turbo- and super-charged model (318 HP), and the T8 hybrid engine (400 HP).”

The latter will feature an engine with an electric component that can either be operated as a fully electric car or as a hybrid vehicle, in addition to offering gas power only.

To accommodate all the new high technology and the electrification of vehicles, Chris and his team at Jim Pattison Volvo of North Vancouver will be moving to new premises at the beginning of October 2016.

“We open on October 10th 2016,” Chris says. “It will be a boutique dealership—big box dealerships are becoming a thing of the past. We’ll be catering to our clientele in different ways. In the future, guests won’t necessarily have to come to the dealership to look at a car; we’ll take the car to their doorstep.”

The new premises, at 1765 Marine Drive, North Vancouver, will be state-of-the-art according to Chris. New routers have been installed to offer high-speed Wi-Fi both on the lot and in the building, for example.

“Everything will be wireless,” says Chris. “Software in the car will communicate with the dealership and we’ll know that the car is arriving. The vehicle will communicate directly with our database automatically and check for any required software update. While the car is parked on the lot, we will be able to update the software.”

The new dealership promises to have the latest technology and diagnostic systems in the newest Volvo facility in Canada.

“We’re going to be the first,” says Chris. “Other brands will follow, but we’ll be a leader in the industry.”

You can get physical symptoms like headaches, chest pain or skin disorders too, your appetite can change, and your relationships with other people are affected too. More than that, the way you and your body respond to mental-health issues or trauma will be unique, so the treatment that worked for your mum or best friend might do nothing for you.

That’s where integrative and holistic counselling practices come in. “These approaches deal with the whole self, rather than typical counselling, which might focus on just the mind, or a specific event,” explains North Shore native and counsellor Brooke Evans of BE Integrative Counselling. “I’m really passionate about holistic practices that are individual-based and client centred. I might use cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), mindfulness and expressive therapy (for example, using art, or if it’s a child, play). Painful memories or trauma can manifest as physical pain.”

article continues below

Evans has supported individuals and families on the north shore for many years in government and non-profit agencies. Some of her greatest education has been from working with local indigenous elders and communities. As well as depression, anxiety and PTSD, she can help with parenting, life coaching, addiction, self-esteem, and overcoming abuse.

As with many people, her interest in counselling comes from personal experience. “I’ve had to seek guidance/support navigating some of life’s challenges. I would see counsellors but often not have success, whether it was because it was the wrong person or the wrong approach –some even ate and texted during sessions!” she says. “I think it can be hard to find the right counsellor. You need a connection – someone who you can trust, who makes you feel safe, and who uses techniques and methodology that will help you move forward. And you need to be willing to do the work yourself too. The right counsellor will empower you to create the changes you want to make in your own life.”

Evans sees clients at Compliments Healthcare, West Vancouver Community Centre, and 302 – 566 Artisan Lane Bowen Island. Find out more at Becounselling.ca, call 604-781-3987 or email brooke@becounselling.ca.",[]

Since then, EVs have not only become more efficient, but also more sleek and affordable.

It’s generally accepted knowledge that electric and hybrid vehicles are better for the environment, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving urban air quality, but there are actually several additional reasons to consider making the switch.

article continues below

Owners of EVs and hybrid cars can enjoy lower running costs for their vehicle – some up to almost one-third the cost of a gas-powered vehicle. And while that may be common knowledge (especially with the price of gas in the Lower Mainland), did you know that full electric vehicles are also less expensive to maintain? Not only do they need less frequent maintenance, but EVs don’t require any of the upkeep associated with combustion engines. Plus, B.C. has incentives for those purchasing new electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.

If environmental factors and costs are not enough, it might help you to know that in addition to offering high performance on the road, hybrids and EVs are usually quieter than other vehicles and may even help speed up your commute. That’s right – drivers of electric and hybrid cars can apply for access to HOV lanes in B.C., regardless of passenger number.

With so many benefits to making the change from gas-powered to hybrid or electric, you may be ready to go car shopping – but how to find the vehicle that will fit your lifestyle?

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

The co-owner, bubbly and energetic Carrie Ho, who on a Saturday night can be found bouncing from table to table chatting up customers, says she and her husband opened the restaurant at the request of North Vancouver-based customers who would frequent the downtown Vancouver Szechuan restaurant where she used to work.

And while she does cater to the Western palate with Chinese favourites including Beef Chop Suey, Lettuce Wraps and Dim Sum, Ho does encourage guests to try the traditional Szechuan dishes, such as the fried Spicy Chicken with Szechuan Peppercorn whose rich, spicy flavours (it’s loaded with hot red peppers) are quelled by the freshness of green peppers and cilantro.

With its yellow painted walls and eclectic artwork, the atmosphere of the restaurant is lively and happy, and many of the dishes, made using produce hand-selected daily by Ho, are meant to be placed in the middle of the table, family-style. Noon hour is even made a celebration with a lunch plate available for $9.50 and a great-for-sharing tapas-style “Starter Pack”, a mix of squid, spicy beans and spare ribs.

It’s all scrumptious, but Ho does have her favourite dishes. Among them, a very traditional Szechuan dish, Boiled Beef in Szechuan Sauce, which is best enjoyed (either eat in or take-out) with a bowl of white rice, and of course—a bottle of TsingTao Chinese beer.

“We’re almost there.” says Christopher. “Volvo models have collision-avoidance technology to make sure that you can’t accidentally hit another vehicle, pedestrian or cyclist, and we are the first to introduce a large animal collision avoidance system that works day and night.”

The technology uses radar, cameras or other sensing devices that can detect obstacles and alert the driver. If the driver cannot, or does not, react, the vehicle can automatically apply the brakes and either avoid a crash completely or significantly reduce the impact.

An obvious benefit is the case of someone who loses control due to a medical emergency, such as a heart attack. A Volvo model will automatically take control of the vehicle and slowly stop the car.

Christopher mentions: “Our cars have a reinforced Boron steel safety cage that is five times stronger than high-tensile steel. The result is that we’ve improved the strength of the body and therefore the safety capacity of our vehicles by around 40 percent.”

While safety is of paramount importance to both Volvo and drivers, a car’s appearance and comfort are also essential components of any buying decision.

“Volvo is sophistication in luxury where intelligent and beauty works in harmony with cutting-edge innovation. This is luxury redefined. This is the next generation of Volvo Cars,” Christopher explains.

“Volvo models display a simple elegance,” Christopher continues. “Our cars are for people who want class without being ostentatious and who are concerned with the environmental impact and with reducing emissions. The wood comes from Sweden and it’s designed with curves so that it contours the vehicle and merges with the steel on the dash. And the seats are amazingly comfortable—best-in-class, in my opinion.”

While Volvo has been known and respected for being a luxury brand contender, Christopher notes that the company is in the process of introducing smaller, less expensive cars with the same top quality and safety features.

“There’s a new generation of Volvo cars coming in the next 2 years,” Christopher says. “They are smaller cars, wagons and SUVs starting at lower prices, but they all still offer the great fuel efficiency and safety features that we’re known for.”

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The Sentinel project has been working through the planning process since 2015, noted Cameron McNeill, a partner in MLA Canada, and is the first condo tower approved in central West Vancouver in years.

“A lot of people were aware of the Sentinel for a long time,” McNeill said, and signage had been posted along Marine Drive for months.

A presentation centre was built, but only a few serious buyers ever visited it due to the COVID-19 restrictions on distancing, McNeill explained. Virtually all of the sales were done through online marketing, 3D presentations and virtual meetings, he said, in cooperation with a network of North Shore real estate agents.

“The sales are pretty fantastic considering what has been happening over the past 30 days,” McNeill said, adding that all the buyers were locals.

Even before the pandemic, monthly sales of existing condos in West Vancouver rarely rose above nine units, according to data from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV)

At 26 storeys, the Sentinel will be the tallest building in West Vancouver. It is located in the Lions Gate Village area, just east of Park Royal shopping centre. The May marketing plan released 66 condos on alternate floors after a 200-person focus group of potential buyers confirmed interest in the project, McNeil said,

The average price of the 54 condos sold is $980,000 and the average per-square-foot price is $1,380, not counting the penthouses and sub-penthouses that start north of $1.5 million. Aside from spectacular views, the tower has air conditioning, high speed elevators and upscale spa and lounge facilities among its luxury features.

With the performance of the first phase, MLA is now releasing the remaining units and Denna Homes will begin construction this summer. Completion is expected late in 2022, seven years after the project was first presented to West Vancouver council.

McNeill said other new projects his team is marketing are also seeing stronger pre-sales than expected, especially Surrey and Langley townhouse developments, where he said buyers, mostly young families, are “very active.”

Metro Vancouver housing sales reached 1,485 homes in May 2020, a 33.9% increase from April, reports the REBGV. Sales were down 43.7% from May of 2019, but the composite benchmark price is 2.9% higher than a year ago at $1.02 million.

McNeill urged caution for developers. He said the return to a pre-COVID-19 sales activity may take six to 12 months and many buyers remain reticent about the housing market.

“The people who believe in the long term for Canada and [Metro]Vancouver are the ones who are buying real estate now,” he said.",[]

Created by award-winning Chard Development, The Royals comprises a renovated 16-storey tower that has been taken down to its shell and rebuilt with modern renters in mind, along with a brand-new 23-storey tower offering incredible amenities.

Byron Chard, president and CEO of Chard Development, says the addition of a new tower on the same site maximizes the supply of rental units while minimizing the environmental and neighbourhood impact.

“Tower 1, our 16-storey renovated building, presents a great opportunity for tenants as the suites are larger than you’d typically find in a new building,” says Chard. “With Tower 2, we saw an opportunity to do an infill development on the same site, creating an additional 152 units as well as our amenity spaces on the penthouse floor.”

The Royals is 100 per cent pet-friendly and is designed to offer flexible choice for all renter groups, from singles to families. Between the two towers, it has a total of 256 rental units ranging from 480-square-foot studios through to three bedrooms plus den at 1,318 square feet, all of which include in-suite laundry facilities. What’s more, all homes have private outdoor spaces ranging from 33-square-foot balconies all the way to a 571-square-foot terrace.

Chard says the current market is in desperate need of new purpose-built rentals, of which there are very few across Metro Vancouver. “There’s a security to purpose-built rental housing that you don’t get with secondary condo rentals,” he explains. “This security aspect, as well as the professional management of the building, makes for a much better experience as a renter. In today’s environment with the pandemic, security and flexible housing choice are even more important.”

Residents of both towers will be greeted by beautifully designed foyers and elevator lobbies with wood-slat feature walls and signature light fixtures. Inside the units, the interior design is soft and neutral, keeping the focus on the amazing views. The kitchens have elegant white cabinetry, chrome faucets, GE and Haier stainless-steel appliances and quartz-composite counters, which are echoed in the bathrooms. Warm-toned vinyl plank flooring throughout will complement anybody’s furniture, says Alissa Foss, interior designer at Proscenium Architecture + Interiors who designed the project. “We chose a design aesthetic with neutral tones that will suit all renters and allow them to bring their own style,” adds Foss.

The beautiful interiors of these rental homes are thoughtfully designed to provide a neutral palette, against which residents can add their own unique style. | Chard Developments

Luxury condo-style amenities

Renters at The Royals will have no need for a gym or private club membership. The project’s crowning jewel is the near-8,000 square feet of amenity space atop Tower 2. The 23rd floor will house a penthouse-like living room with fireplace, dining room and gourmet chef’s kitchen. There will also be a high-spec gym that will include Peloton bikes, a media/games room and a study, and two studio apartments will be available for short-term guest stays.

On the 24th-floor rooftop, 5,000 square feet of space will offer residents expansive outdoor living. This includes lounging areas with a firepit, outdoor kitchen with gas BBQs and extensive dining spaces, children’s play area and, of course, epic 360-degree views. “We are so excited about our amenities,” says Chard. “It really brings the community together. This is not just condo-level amenities, but better, which is incredibly rare in a rental building.”

The 24th-floor penthouse amenity space for Royals residents includes a state-of-the-art media and games room. | Chard Development

The two towers also offer slightly different lifestyles with varying renters in mind. Tower 1 benefits from larger interior floorplans and outdoor spaces, while Tower 2, which is under construction, will offer residents direct access to the amenities and rooftop deck.

Lifestyle is also what the neighbourhood is all about. The Royals is on a leafy street close to the restaurants, coffee shops and stores of Central Lonsdale, with great access to outdoor activities and nature. It’s also a 10-minute bus hop to Lonsdale Quay and the SeaBus to downtown Vancouver, making it an easy commute without the downtown pricetag.

Prices are competitive for North Vancouver, particularly considering the amazing amenities and finishes. Monthly rents for studios start at $1,700, with starting rents of $2,100 for one-bed homes and $2,675 for two bedrooms.

Tours of The Royals open this week and Tower 1 units are now available, with first move-in expected in August. Renters may also register interest in Tower 2, which is due to complete early 2021.

323,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/real-estate/home-sales-continue-to-rebound-in-june-after-pandemic-freeze-earlier-in-year-1.24170491,Home sales continue to rebound in June after pandemic freeze earlier in year,[],,"OTTAWA — Real estate agents across the country saw home sales in June nearing or even beating pre-pandemic levels.

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) said June 16.

“The current state of the strata insurance market is unhealthy,” said authority vice-president and deputy superintendent for regulation Frank Chong.

article continues below

Minister of Finance Carole James said rising condo and apartment building costs are serious issues for thousands of British Columbians.

“This is especially true with many people facing additional financial pressure related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We knew this was a complex issue, and now we have a clearer picture of the different local, national and global factors affecting cost and availability within the insurance market.”

Among key report findings, based on a survey of 6,000 strata and townhouse properties, are:

• an average increase of 40% year-over-year to strata insurance premiums province-wide;

• a 50% increase in Metro Vancouver;

• 54% of strata properties experienced a premium increase of less than 30% compared to premiums the previous year;

• 31% of strata properties saw increases in the 30-50 % range;

• 9% faced year-over-year increases of 50 -100%; and

• 6% saw increases in excess of 100% compared to the previous year.

“Price pressures will continue,” the authority said in the report to James. “Buildings considered to be higher risk are expected to face the most significant increases as well as the possibility of not being able to obtain full, or in rare cases any, insurance coverage.""

The data is in an interim report done at the direction of the provincial government. Further findings will be released in the fall after continued stakeholder consultations, Chong said.

The authority regulates the province’s insurance industry, among other things.

CEO Blair Morrison said the market is failing to meet goals of sustainability, affordability and availability.

“Despite large increases already being felt, the situation has not yet stabilized, meaning many stratas, particularly those in buildings considered to be higher risk by insurers, can expect to face further pricing pressures as well as the risk of not being able to obtain full strata property insurance coverage,” Morrison said.

The industry generates about $300 million in premiums, covering more than $100 billion of insured property value. Coverage is mandatory under B.C.’s Strata Property Act, the authority told James.

Insurance under the act, which must provide full replacement value of the common strata property and assets, does not cover individual unit insurance, which owners need to ensure under individual policies.

The authority said earthquake coverage is not required under the act, but it is often included in strata property coverage.

“Strata corporations that choose not to purchase earthquake coverage are still covered for fire damage following an earthquake,” the authority told James. “An estimated 1.5 million residents live in strata properties in BC and properties can range from under $1 million to over $200 million in insured value.”

The investigation found evidence showing the industry has been incurring losses over the past three years from mostly minor claims, particularly from water damage, due to poor building maintenance.

“The data suggests that strata insurance has also been used to fill in the gaps left by other forms of protection such as home warranties for new buildings and maintenance programs for older buildings,” the authority said.

Further complicating things is the exposure to risk insurers have to earthquake damages in B.C. which has prompted many to reduce the amount of insurance they offer, the study found.

“With this reduction in capacity comes upward price pressures,” the authority said.

“It’s clear there is no quick fix for this problem,” James said. “It’s important to recognize that the dynamics driving these increases are playing out in the private insurance industry – government does not set insurance rates or regulate pricing.”

She said the government is reviewing the report and will be bringing in legislation this summer as a first step to help tackle this problem, while the authority continues its engagement with the sector.

While legislation details won’t be released before being introduced in the Legislature, Liberal Party Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson has called on James to take action.

“Skyrocketing strata insurance costs represent one more unexpected hit to the wallets of British Columbians, with a growing number truly at risk of losing their homes. Action by your government is needed now,” Wilkinson said in a June 16 letter to James.

Wilkinson suggested the following actions be taken:

• implementation of a temporary tax holiday on the 4.4% Insurance Premium Tax applicable on strata property to leave money in the pockets of strata owners;

• Extension on a temporary basis the Property Tax Deferment Program to enable strata owners facing extraordinary additional expenses to defer a portion of their property taxes;

• changes to Strata Property Act and regulations that ensure annual contributions are made to a strata corporation’s consolidated revenue fund at levels acceptable considering a building’s age, claims history and other unique circumstances;

• require strata corporations to have a depreciation report detailing necessary maintenance every year;

• require a strata corporation to inform owners and tenants of any material change in insurance coverage, including an increase in any deductible, as soon as feasible;

• develop a mandatory education and training program for strata council members, with particular emphasis on risk mitigation;

• review the B.C. Building Code and implement new requirements focused on the prevention and severity of water damage events, and;

• require the B.C. Financial Services Authority to make public the data and information it is gathering from insurance companies to better understand the current climate of rapidly rising strata insurance.

Condominium Home Owners' Association of B.C. CEO Tony Gioventu in March warned that uninsured condo owners could find themselves bankrupt and homeless if they didn’t maintain suites and personal insurance as strata insurance costs skyrocket.

Birds Nest Properties handles condo and townhouse rentals in Vancouver, Burnaby and Richmond. Director Alvin Cheung said the situation is putting pressures on both strata corporations and individual owners.

Cheung said some buildings have seen deductibles rise from $250,000 to $750,000, situations that have led to special levies for unit owners.

“What if all the owners can’t pay the special levy? What happens then?” he asked.

That could lead to cases of buildings not triggering their insurance leaving owners to pay for repairs or upkeep just not being done.

“It would be a neglected building,” he said.

And that could cause future insurance coverage problems, he agreed.

As well, Cheung said, landlords have seen their landlord insurance premiums leap, in some cases from $500 to $4,000 a year.

April figures released May 4 by the Real Estate Board of Vancouver show North Shore home sales down 37 per cent from a year ago and 53 per cent compared with March 2020. New home listings have also dropped considerably, as many sellers choose to wait it out.

article continues below

However, home values on the North Shore have remained steady, perhaps bolstered by the B.C. government’s promises to gradually reopen the economy later this month.

For North Vancouver real estate professionals, the day-to-day work is about quality, not quantity.

“We’re still busy,” said North Vancouver agent Jeff Donohoe. “People still need to buy and sell homes. We’re working much more closely with clients, making the most of staging and photography, and we create a virtual walk-through of every listing. We direct every buyer to the online listing first, to ensure they’re serious, before we’ll schedule a showing. There are no more open houses. Buyers must also bring their Realtor to any listing.”

He added, “If we can get rid of someone who isn’t serious or the house won’t work for them, that means we don’t have to show the home, and the seller and their family don’t have to leave the house.”

When it comes down to in-person showings, strict cleanliness and distancing protocols are in place.

Donohoe said, “Everybody signs a waiver to confirm they don’t have symptoms, they haven’t travelled recently —the full checklist. Inside the home, the buyer can’t touch anything. We have masks and fresh gloves, we will open drawers and doors. We wipe down surfaces between showings.”

North Shore agent Clara Hartree is working under similar cleanliness and distancing protocols for showings. In addition to directing interested parties to online listings first, Hartree recommends buyers drive past the home, to ensure they are still interested. She added, “There are no looky-loos now—they don’t even try.”

Under this new system, homes are still selling, albeit in lower volumes. The professionals involved throughout the conveyancing process, from appraisers to mortgage brokers to lawyers, all have new protocols in place to allow for physical distancing.

Donohoe advised, “If you’re buying a home, make sure you’re secure in your job. Lenders are being a lot more critical of current income to ensure buyers qualify during this time. We are all doing our due diligence to ensure any deals made will complete.”

Hartree said it’s tough to predict which way the market will go over the next few months. “There are no references for what’s happening. But there is zero drop in values so far. There’s a gap in price expectations. Buyers think they can take advantage of the situation and give a lowball offer, but sellers are saying ‘don’t even try.’”

Donohoe’s son and business partner, Jonny Donohoe, added, “There are people who think there’s a lot of hurt out there, but it’s not really the case. With banks offering mortgage deferrals for six months, they’ve given people a buffer. We’re not expecting to see a lot of foreclosure sales, at least not for many months.”

Hartree remains confident in the market, as she’s still closing deals. “I feel bad when I see so many industries affected by the virus. Aside from new protocols, it hasn’t changed much for me.”",[]

They were also 63% lower than the 10-year sales average for the month - a direct result, said the board, of social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Predictably, the number of home sales and listings declined in April given the physical distancing measures in place,” Colette Gerber, REBGV’s president-elect said. “People are, however, adapting.”

According to Gerber, this adaptation is coming in the form of “using different technology to showcase homes virtually, assess neighbourhood amenities with their clients and handle paperwork electronically.”

Across the region, 1,109 homes changed hands last month. This is a 39.4% drop year-over-year and a 56.1% decline compared with March 2020.

The number of new listings for all residential property types was 2,313 in April, which is a 59.7% drop compared with April 2019 and a 47.9% decline compared with March 2020, when 4.436 homes were listed.

The benchmark price for all homes across the region is $1,036,000, which is 2.5% higher than it was one year prior.

“Home prices have held relatively steady in our region since the COVID-19 situation worsened in March,” Gerber said.

A total of 388 detached homes sold in April, which is 33.8% lower than the 586 homes of this type sold in April 2019. The benchmark price for detached homes is $1,462,100 - up 2.3% year-over-year.

In April 2020, 503 apartments were sold, which is 43.2% lower than the 885 homes sold in the same month last year. The benchmark price for apartments is $685,500, up 2.7% from April 2019.

For attached homes, sales reached 218 - a 39.1% decline year-over-year. The benchmark price was $796,800 - up 2.8% compared with the same month last year.

REBGV data includes sales and prices for Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Richmond, Port Moody, the Sunshine Coast, Whistler, Squamish, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and South Delta. It does not include Langley or Surrey.

Varley, a member of the famous Canadian painters’ group, lived in the Lynn Valley house at 4395 Rice Lake Rd. in the early 1930s, during a decade spent on the West Coast.

Nearby landscapes of Rice Lake, Lynn Creek and Lynn Canyon inspired some of Varley’s famous paintings done at that time.

After Varley returned to Ontario, the property was eventually bought by his estranged wife Maud and remained in the Varley family until 1974.

It then remained the property of another family until the recent listing.

The two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot home was listed for $799,900 and sold after just six days on the market.

Real estate agent Matt Council of Re/Max Rossetti Realty said there were over 20,000 views of the property online, over 100 inquiries and showings and 13 sale offers.

“It was certainly really well received,” he said. “It was quite competitive.”

While some people were interested in the historic connection with Varley, more were lured by the fact “a single-family home (listed) under $1 million in North Vancouver is very rare and unique,” he said. “That was the main reason for a lot of the interest we had.”

The number of houses for sale right now is low compared to 10-year averages for this time, he added. “When something good comes along people are quite keen to see it.”

Council said the new owners intend to live in the home.

“This property – both the home and the lot - is really quite unique.”

The home, assessed for $646,300, sold for $1,001,000.

Varley considered the time when he lived in Lynn Valley in the early 1930s “the most creative period of his career,” said B.C. historian Daniel Francis.

At the time Varley lived in the house, “it really would have been the middle of nowhere,” said author and local historian Eve Lazarus.

“You can just sort of imagine him in that old house on the top floor,” she said. “It would have had an amazing view.”

Lazarus later spoke to Chris Varley, one of Fred Varley’s grandchildren, who recalled going to stay at the house with his grandmother.

At the time, he remembered one of Varley’s other famous paintings, Church at Yale – now in the B.C. archives - hung in a stairwell, said Lazarus, and bureau drawers were still stuffed with scraps of art.

The house, at 4395 Rice Lake Rd., sits near the lower reaches of Seymour Provincial Park, near to Rice Lake, Lynn Creek and Lynn Canyon Park. It was these same areas of the North Shore that inspired some of Varley’s paintings in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

“He painted some significant paintings there,” said B.C. historian Daniel Francis.

“He found new inspiration and artistic focus in the local scenery, painting scores of landscapes of the Lynn Valley area, as well as of Mount Seymour and Grouse Mountain,” according to a description of Varley’s time in North Vancouver provided by the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Re/Max Rossetti Realty recently listed the two-bedroom, 1,300-square-foot home that Varley once lived in for $799,000.

Varley had come to the West Coast in 1926 to teach at the art school that would eventually become the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, said Francis, later also creating his own B.C. College of Art before packing it in and moving back east as the Depression took its toll.

But Varley considered his time in North Vancouver in the early 1930s “the most creative period of his career,” said Francis.

“He sort of took the arts community in the city by storm,” said Francis.

Though producing breathtaking art, Varley was not living the life of a model citizen. He had ditched his wife and four children and lived in the Rice Lake Road home with his girlfriend and former student Vera Weatherby. “He was probably what they called at the time a drunken libertine,” said Francis.

Varley frequently hiked in the Lynn Canyon area and in the early 1930s came across the house, which he rented, complete with a piano, for $8 a month.

“Back then it really would have been the middle of nowhere,” said author and local historian Eve Lazarus, who first took an interest in the house after walking her dog past it on neighbourhood strolls.

“You can just sort of imagine him in that old house on the top floor,” she said. “It would have had an amazing view.”

Varley would have taken the streetcar down to the foot of Lonsdale, then caught a ferry over to Vancouver to his teaching job at the art school, said Lazarus, who included the story of Varley’s North Vancouver years in her book Sensational Vancouver.

“We didn’t have the Lions Gate Bridge back then.”

By 1937, Varley had moved back to Ottawa alone, but not before leaving his mark on North Vancouver. Weatherby would go on to marry one of Varley’s former patrons, Harold Mortimer Lamb. Varley’s wife Maud later came into a small inheritance, which allowed her to buy the home, which remained in the Varley family until 1974.

Lazarus later spoke to Chris Varley, one of Fred Varley’s grandchildren, who recalled going to stay at the house with his grandmother.

At the time, he rememberd one of Varley’s other famous paintings, Church at Yale – now in the B.C. archives - hung in a stairwell, said Lazarus, and bureau drawers were still stuffed with scraps of art.

There is even a rumour of a Tom Thomson sketch being used to patch a hole in the roof, she said.

The house remained in the Varley family until 1974, when new owners bought it. It has remained in that family until now, said Matt Council, the listing real estate agent.

The general character of the house remains the same as it was when Varley lived there in the 1930s, said Council, although there have been interior renovations over the years, as well as a roof and cast iron natural gas fireplace added.

Council said news that the Varley house is up for sale has piqued interest.

“It’s definitely been well received,” he said.

BC Assessment lists the value of the property at $646,300.

The home is not listed on any District of North Vancouver heritage registries.

However, the vast majority of those transactions were in the first half of the month, and many of those deals reflect pre-pandemic buying activity, due to the reporting lag.

“The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common,” said Ashley Smith, REBGV president. “Like other aspects of our lives, this changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew.”

REBGV said April 2 that residential sales on the region’s MLS averaged 138 per day during the first ten business days of March, and 93 during the final ten business days of the month.

“Many of the sales recorded in March were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency. We’ll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact that the pandemic is having on the housing market,” Smith added.

Kevin Skipworth, a realtor with Dexter Realty, said, “This month’s numbers for Greater Vancouver are a tale of what could have been, not so much what will be… There is a time lag between when the contract is written and when it is reported. A degree of [March’s] activity came from transactions that were initiated prior to the increased attention to COVID-19.”

Cameron McNeill, partner and executive director at real estate marketing firm MLA, predicted that the market would see a hiatus until the pandemic is over, but then would rebound later. “While it is too soon to determine the real effects COVID-19 will have on the Greater Vancouver real estate market, we certainly expect significantly slower sales volumes in historically active spring months ahead. The speed and timing of recovery is uncertain, but long-term housing demand for the region will likely be heightened by Canada’s COVID-19 response, and supply constraints.”

Sellers still listing

Despite the pandemic, sellers continued to list their homes in March. There were 4,436 homes listed for sale in Metro Vancouver in March, which is 10.4 per cent lower than March 2019 but a 10.8 per cent increase compared with February 2020 this year, reported the board.

“I was surprised at the number of new listings,” said Skipworth. “It dropped off in the last week of the month but people are still coming to market. Perhaps some people who had been planning on selling decided to do so before the situation gets any worse. We’re also seeing some listing cancellations and re-lists of those properties, so that accounts for some of the new listings.”

With overall sales increasing more than new listings, the sales-to-active listings ratio for March 2020 increased to 26.3 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 21.1 per cent for detached homes, 33 per cent for townhomes, and 28.9 per cent for apartments. These figures indicate a seller’s market, which is defined as more than 20 per cent for a sustained period.

Prices and property types

Home prices in the region also increased again last month. The composite benchmark price for all property types combined in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,033,700. This is a 2.1 per cent increase over March 2019, and a 1.3 per cent rise over February 2020.

Sales of detached homes in March 2020 reached 852, a leap of 61.1 per cent over the 529 detached sales recorded in March 2019. The benchmark price for single-family properties is $1,450,700, which is 0.7 per cent higher than March 2019, and a 1.2 per cent increase compared with February 2020.

March saw 493 attached homes trade hands, which is a 51.7 per cent jump compared with the 325 sales in March 2019. The attached-home benchmark price is now pegged at $791,800, a 2.5 per cent rise from March 2019, and a 0.9 per cent uptick compared with February.

Condo transactions hit 1,179 in March 2020, a 35.1 per cent increase over the 873 sales in March 2019. The benchmark price of an apartment property now stands at $687,000, which is 2.9 per cent higher than in March 2019, and a 1.4 per cent month-over-month rise.

One question mark is whether the no-eviction rule applies retroactively to tenants in recently purchased homes, where the new owner intends to occupy the property, or whether existing eviction notices served before the announcement have been grandfathered in.

article continues below

Now, a leading real estate lawyer in Vancouver has offered clarification on this issue, following advice he received directly from the B.C. government.

Richard Bell of Bell Alliance told Glacier Media Real Estate on Monday, “Up until today [March 30], if an eviction notice has already been given to the tenants to vacate because the buyers are to take possession, that eviction still stands. However, any new home purchase contract, from today onwards, you will not be able to evict the tenant, under any section of the legislation.”

He added, “That was a big concern for us, as we [at Bell Alliance] are working on lots of purchase contracts where the notice of eviction for tenants had already been given. Those purchases can now go ahead.”

However, the eviction ban may significantly affect sales of currently tenanted homes, now that any new buyers wouldn’t be permitted to evict sitting tenants from March 30 onwards, until the ban is lifted.",[]

Home buyers who have paid their deposit and signed a purchase contract, who may now want to get out of the purchase since the pandemic hit, do not have a standard “Force majeure” or “Act of God” clause that will let them walk away, said Richard Bell of Bell Alliance in Vancouver. Such a clause would need to have been specifically written into the purchase contract to be applicable, which is unlikely, he said.

What’s more, if the buyer walks away from a purchase contract, even if they have lost their job and can no longer afford the home, they could be liable for much more than simply losing their deposit.

“If a buyer loses their job – well, that could happen any time,” Bell told Glacier Media Real Estate March 30. “If they can’t complete the deal, they become liable for at least the deposit. But there could be a further, knock-on liability, if the seller then resells for less than the original amount. The buyer who caused the original deal to collapse could also be liable for the difference.”

Bell added, “Then the question becomes, if the collapse of the original deal causes a series of deals in a chain to collapse, how remote is the original buyer’s liability? How many links in that chain is the buyer liable for? That’s when you get into a legal battle.”

A purchase contract can, however, be rendered void under the doctrine of “frustration” whereby the deal can’t go ahead and collapses under extraordinary circumstances, through no fault of either party. However, this requires the explicit agreement of both parties to the contract, explained Bell.

For example, a buyer may not want to go ahead with a home purchase due to lost income, and the vendor may equally not want to sell anymore because they can no longer afford to upsize, also due to lost income. Under such circumstances, the buyer and seller can come to an agreement whereby the contract is cancelled and the buyer’s deposit returned.

Cold feet a symptom of COVID-19

Vancouver realtor Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Realty is seeing a lot of nervousness among buyers who have signed purchase contracts. He told Glacier Media Real Estate March 31 that he had one buyer with cold feet because of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated concerns about the economy, but after discussion with their conveyancing lawyers, the deal finally went ahead.

“There’s really nothing in the contract that allows for a buyer to walk away from a transaction because of the virus pandemic, but that doesn’t stop anybody from trying. For us as realtors, it’s not our place to try to negotiate out of a contract, that’s where legal advice is the first place to go.

He agrees with Bell that there can be much pricier ramifications than merely a lost deposit. “Everybody seems to think you can walk away and just lose your deposit and that will be fine, but that’s not the case. Sellers can go after you for damages, and more.”

Bell said he is seeing some collapsed home purchases at his law firm, but this is not currently his key concern in terms of real estate conveyancing. He pointed to rules of social distancing and quarantining making it virtually impossible to comply with legal requirements that home buyers and mortgage consumers be present in person to sign contracts, along with their government ID.

“It’s a major roadblock to closing home purchases right now,” said Bell. “Different lenders require different things. But some are literally requiring that we go round to quarantined clients’ homes and have them show their ID to us through the window. It’s ridiculous. Hopefully it will change before long, so we can do it by video. We’re trying to get this up the chain of command.”

‘Force majeure’ in construction

One sector that may have some luck in claiming “force majeure” when failing to complete a contract due to COVID-19 is the construction industry, where sites have had to close due to the outbreak – depending on such a clause being in the contract.

Whether or not a judge under Canadian common law would grant “force majeure” varies greatly from case to case, said Sahil Shoor, a Waterloo, Ontario-based civil litigator for Gowling WLG, in a legal bulletin to the construction sector on March 20.

That is because while some contracts include “force majeure” clauses that clearly states diseases, plagues, epidemics or quarantine restrictions as applicable conditions (beyond the typical “acts of God” events such as natural disasters, fires, floods and wars), other make no such distinctions. Some other contracts yet, Shoor said, may not have a “force majeure” clause at all, further complicating the issue in court.

“In order to successfully rely on a force majeure clause, the relying party [contractor] has the burden of establishing Force Majeure Event and proving that the Force Majeure Event has effectively prevented the party from fulfilling its obligations under the construction contract,” Shoor said in the bulletin, adding the court will assess the merits of the case based on whether the COVIC-19 outbreak qualifies as a force majeure, whether the risk of not being able to complete the contract was “foreseeable and able to be mitigated,” as well was whether it was really impossible to complete the contract.

In cases where there is no clear description of an epidemic or disease as force majeure, a judge will often hinge decisions on the availability of an “alternative method of performance” – even if the alternative is significantly more expensive for the contractor applying for relief.

“As an example, are the party’s employees ill due to the virus and unable to work, or simply afraid to work and choosing not to attend?” Shoor said, adding that cases without a force majeure clause will follow similar lines of legal logic under the doctrine of frustration.

This is the third 50-basis-point cut this month as the bank does what it can to ease the cost of borrowing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The unscheduled rate decision brings the bank’s policy interest rate down to 0.25 per cent. At 0.75 per cent, it was the highest such rate among the central banks of G7 countries.

On Friday, Canada’s central bank also announced two new programs to bring greater liquidity to Canadian markets: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP), and a quantitative easing program.

Under the latter, the bank will purchase a minimum of $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week, starting April 1. The program will continue until Canada’s economic recovery is “well underway.”

Over the next 12 months, the CPPP will see the bank undertake primary and secondary market purchases of commercial paper issued by Canadian firms, municipalities and provincial agencies that have an outstanding commercial paper program. Poloz said the program will “help to restore a key source of short-term funding for businesses.”

“The intent of our decision today is two-fold: to immediately support the financial system so it keeps on providing credit, and, over the longer term, to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy,” Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz said in an opening statement to media.

Although existing variable-rate mortgage holders will enjoy additional discounts from the BoC's new rate, whether or not the cuts will be passed on to new mortgage consumers remains to be seen. Thus far, despite two previous recent rate reductions of 50 basis points each, mortgage rates for new customers have been rising, not falling.

“This is a very uncertain time for banks and lenders, just as it is for consumers,” said Alex Conconi, CEO of Lendesk. “While the normal consequence of a Bank of Canada prime rate cut is to pass that on to borrowers, at the end of the day, banks control their own prime rate and it cannot be taken for granted amid COVID-19. Moreover, until recently, it wasn’t unusual to see variable rates that were prime minus something: now that has all but evaporated, and we’re seeing prime plus a spread. The consequence is that the banks are able to shore up some margin, which may be necessary if they are to take losses in other parts of their business. Meanwhile, consumers aren’t necessarily paying any less than they would have been paying a few months ago.”

Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent.

article continues below

In a response to the COVID-19 crisis, the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions – including those currently in process – freeze rental increases, and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months.

""This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening,"" said Premier John Horgan. “Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.”

Despite the good intentions, many say the unprecedented program is wide open to abuse. This is apparently recognized by the provincial government whose models concede that 100 per cent of B.C.’s 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance.

The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis.

Mark Goodman, a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc. Vancouver, estimates B.C.'s rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months, but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most. The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze, Goodman said.

This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver, he said, where the average rent is now $2,351, according to Rentals.ca.

While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome, David Hutniak, CEO of LandlordBC, said that, with no potential for evictions, landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing.

“This is wide open to potential abuse,” Hutniak said. He added he hoped common decency would keep abuses in check.

“Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations,” Hutniak said, which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country. These owners are also struggling during the current crisis, Hutniak said.

According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver.

Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral. Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this, but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral.“We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can 'pass those savings onto renters.' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord. It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount. In other words, interest upon interest,""Hutniak explained. Any deferred amount is added to the mortgage principal, whereas a landlord doesn’t have any security for deferred rent from a tenant, he noted, or from the loss of legal rent increases.

Angela Calla, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time,” she said on March 25. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

""It is the government’s expectation that all renters, including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent,” Hutniak added.

But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually be paid by April 1, when the next rent is due.

“Every person should think towards the future, see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent,” said Mazdak Gharibnavaz, a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union, in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101.9 FM’s station at the University of British Columbia.",[]

But with phone lines jammed, and websites unable to process applications that are assessed on a case-by-case basis, many homeowners looking for a deferral or seeking answers have had little success.

Confusion reigns over what makes a homeowner eligible for an emergency deferral, how the program works, whether interest is payable and whether deferring payments will affect credit scores. Unfortunately, with the situation changing on a daily basis, and lenders forced to make up rules as they go, it has been impossible for most people to get any information.

To clear up some of these issues, Glacier Media Real Estate spoke with five mortgage experts who offered their insights and advice on some frequently asked questions.

Would deferring my mortgage payments damage my credit score?

As long as the proper arrangements are made in advance, your credit score should not be affected. Atrina Kouroshnia, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres, says, “I don't think deferring payments will have the same impact as [it did] before, as it's a global [pandemic] and, especially if your job is affected, you are making a proactive choice.”

Peter Kinch, best-selling author and award-winning mortgage broker, agrees, “I do not see a situation wherein this will have any impact on your credit score.”

The number-one most important thing? Never assume that you’ll be able to get the deferral and simply not pay your mortgage when it’s due, as this will damage your credit score. “The worst thing would be to just skip your payments,” warns Kouroshnia.

Angela Calla, also with Dominion Lending Centres, cautions, “If you miss the payment without an agreement or your lender does not approve you, it can impact your credit score and could significantly increase your cost of borrowing at renewal. Each borrower should confirm with the lender before they agree to the deferral.”

How can I get through to my lender?

For those trying to make such arrangements but having trouble getting through, Calla says it’s important to give the banks time. “Unless you have a payment due in the next five days [that you can’t pay], they ask that you delay calling at this time [due to overwhelming call volumes]. Email is preferred, or some lenders have portals they have created to assist with this. Look at your lender’s website for updates.”

Alisa Aragon, also with Dominion Lending Centres, recommends speaking first to your mortgage broker, if you have one. “Lenders are experiencing an overwhelming amount of calls and it is very hard to get through. If people have questions, it is best that they talk to their mortgage expert, as we are getting information from most lenders and we might be able to answer their questions faster.”

Should I apply, and would I be approved, for a deferral?

Once you’ve managed to get through to your lender, you’ll likely only be approved for a payment deferral if you’ve lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, say the brokers.

If you’re still working and can afford your mortgage, don’t attempt to get a deferral. Not only will you likely be wasting your time and that of the overstretched lenders, the program should only be used as an emergency last resort. That’s because deferring payments will cost you more money in the long term (see “How would a mortgage payment deferral work?” below).

Only those truly unable to pay their mortgage right now, due to lost income from the pandemic, should apply. “The deferral program is really for homeowners that are experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 virus,” says Aragon. “If you are still employed and earning an income, then lenders will not be assisting those borrowers at this time. This program is for people that really need it.”

For those who feel they meet the requirements, it’s worth applying, and each application will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. “It also depends on the lender,” adds Aragon. “Each lender has its own requirements on what has to be provided.”

Landlords may not get approved for a deferral with some banks, even if their tenants can’t pay rent due to lost income, according to Calla. “Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time [March 25],” she says. “If/when they are, it will come with additional costs for the landlord, once determined.” However, Calla has an update of this information as of March 26, with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy, and other banks may follow suit.

One relief for landlords is that tenants unable to pay rent due to lost income can now apply for the new $500-a-month rent supplement, to be paid directly to their landlord via BC Housing, which was announced March 25. However, the accompanying temporary ban on evictions may mean leave landlords without options if tenants don't pay their rent at all.

If I were approved, how would a mortgage payment deferral work?

Make no mistake, a mortgage payment deferral is an emergency, temporary measure that will cost you more in the long term, caution the brokers. What’s more, the longer you defer payments, the more it will cost you, as interest will be payable at your contract rate during the deferral period, and will add up.

Kinch explains, “Your principal and interest payments do not have to be made for a period of [up to] six months. However, the banks will accrue your monthly interest payments and add that amount onto your current mortgage balance. As such, after the six-month deferral period, you will have a larger mortgage balance and your monthly payment will be adjusted accordingly to compensate. So you end up with a cash-flow break today, but you’ll have to make up for it in six months. To be clear – this is a ‘deferral’ not a ‘loan holiday’.”

Kinch’s colleague Jonathan Barlow adds, “Every lender will be different in how they manage it. Ones with deep pockets may allow for the deferral to continue until renewal, when they simply renew with the higher balance. Others may structure a repayment plan. Again, this is untrodden ground for the lenders, so they will all approach it differently.”

Calla says, “You are responsible to pay the deferral [interest] taken on the remaining payments on the term with most lenders. This is why it’s approved only for those who can’t make a payment due to not having the financial means. Everyone’s amounts per month and total interest cost will be different based on mortgage amount, rate and term remaining.”

What if my mortgage is with a monoline lender?

The Big Six Canadian banks, plus some credit unions such as Vancity, have been vocal about offering their mortgage payment deferral programs to those in need. But many Canadian homeowners have their mortgages with alternative specialist mortgage lenders, also known as monoline lenders. So are they offering the same payment deferral program?

Barlow says, “Monolines are supporting the deferral program as well, but because they are single service providers (mortgages only), their monetary base is much smaller. So they will be much more strategic about who they offer it to. They’ll certainly ask more questions, but you’ll likely get a much better plan and collaboration from them.”

As with all mortgage types, for more information about deferring payments, go to your lender’s website and talk to your mortgage broker before braving the long hold times on the customer service lines.",[]

Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday that B.C. will also freeze rent increases and evictions until the current crisis has passed, with some exceptions to the latter.

“This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent of that happening,” he said. Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1. Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied.

Horgan said the province is assuming its rental supplement will see 100 per cent pick-up, and that the province is then “working back from there” on the understanding that not everyone will need it. He added that there are around 500,000 tenant households in the province.

“[Uptake] will depend on the depth of the pandemic and the time it will take us to recover,” Horgan said.

The additional rental assistance program will be delivered through BC Housing. Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson confirmed that the funds are intended to help pay the rent of low- and middle-income renters who have seen a “significant reduction” in income directly related to the spread of COVID-19, such as reduced hours or layoffs.

The supplement will be paid directly to landlords.

Robinson added that the province is granting landlords the power to regulate the use of multi-purpose and amenity spaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Existing eviction orders with B.C.’s Residential Tenancy Branch have been halted.

With few exceptions, landlords will also be prevented from entering tenants’ homes without tenants’ consent.

Vancouver-West End MLA Spencer Chandra Herbert, former chair of B.C.’s Rental Housing Task Force, confirmed that the Residential Tenancy Branch will continue to operate to address questions and concerns.

“The stress is off the charts right now. We need to give people security and safety in their rental housing,” he said.

The announcement comes a week before April 1 rental payments are due.

The measures are part of the province’s $5 billion COVID-19 response plan – which was announced on Monday – and follow tax and payment deferral options from governments, Crown corporations and banks intended to ease the financial burdens Canadians’ may be facing.

Earlier today, the federal government announced a new $2,000 monthly benefit for Canadians, which replaces and expands two previously announced emergency benefits.

“It is the inevitable next step,” said Jon Stovell, president and CEO of Reliance Properties and past chair of the Urban Development Institute.

article continues below

Quebec announced the extended shutdown of the majority of construction sites as it ramped up efforts to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Quebec's construction unions had called for a work stoppage, saying many sites lack proper hygiene control and require working close to others.

B.C. is second only to Quebec in the number of residents infected by COVID-19.

On March 22, six days after B.C. banned large gatherings, its COVID-19 Joint Information Centre released guidelines that allow for construction to continue, provided no more than 50 workers are working in any one space at a time.

Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has issued a set of guidelines regarding hygiene on construction sites.

Stovell’s company has two big building projects underway, an office tower and a condominium project, and he said his contractors are “going beyond” the provincial measures to assure worker and public safety.

But he believes that all B.C. construction work, aside from infrastructure projects deemed essential, will soon be ordered to close.

A request for comment from the provincial health officer was not received by the Western Investor deadline.

Ron Rapp, CEO of the Homebuilders Association of Vancouver, sent a memo to members this week.

“I told them we have the privilege to continue to work and to make darn sure they all meet the criteria of the provincial health guidelines,” he said.

But Rapp warned that much of the private sector construction in Metro Vancouver – estimated to be worth $10 billion to the B.C. economy and employing up to 130,000 people – could be forced to close regardless of legislation.

A lack of key building supplies due to a broken trade chain, especially from Asia, and the number of people who can’t or won’t report to work is among the problems, he said. He noted that one local supplier, a fabricator, had 25 per cent of its staff test positive for COVID-19.",[]

Reports include inadequate access to washroom facilities, a disregard for social-distancing and workers showing up to job sites sick. On more than one site, workers have no access to hand sanitizer or hand-washing facilities. Multiple workers shared that they risk losing their jobs if they leave, even though colleagues are showing up to work with flu-like symptoms.

Last week, the BC Building Trades Council asked construction workers to report working conditions on job sites during the COVID-19 outbreak. BC Building Trades (BCBT) is now urging WorkSafeBC to enforce mandatory and provincially recommended health and safety practices after reports of unsafe and unsanitary worker conditions.

“Workers are pleading for help – this is urgent,” said BCBT executive director Andrew Mercier in a news release.

“I have been in direct contact with the top brass at WorkSafeBC about this. We need more hand-washing stations. We need better social distancing. Regulations on paper mean nothing if they are not being enforced on the ground.”

One worker who emailed BIV said there are at least 50 people using four washrooms on his Port Moody job site every day, and he has yet to see them cleaned on a daily basis.

Another individual told BIV that a Vancouver site superintendent told workers that he doesn’t care about social distancing: “Either to go to work, or go home.“

A number of the workers who reached out to BCBT – and whose responses have been anonymized – expressed concerns about both continuing to work and about losing their jobs if they chose to stay home or self-isolate. Some have called for non-essential work sites to be shut down.

“The fact no one is shutting these sites down right now is unreal... Well over 200 people sharing this one water hose... No hot water. No hand sanitizer, and five to six bathrooms for the whole site,” wrote one respondent.

Last week, the Urban Development Institute (UDI) said government confirmed that B.C.’s limit on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites. Sites must still follow WorkSafeBC standards and COVID-19 prevention protocols. The latter include additional hand-washing stations and social distancing of one to two metres between workers.

Not so, according to mortgage experts. In fact, advertised interest rates for new mortgage applications have been climbing significantly over the past few days.

article continues below

In its March 19 update, mortgage comparison website RateSpy.com wrote as an example that TD Bank had just increased its advertised rates:

• three-year fixed: from 2.69 per cent to 2.89 per cent

• five-year fixed (high ratio): from 2.69 per cent to 2.79 per cent

• five-year variable: from 2.85 per cent to 2.95 per cent (no discount on the bank’s prime lending rate)

Alisa Aragon, mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres Mountain View, told Glacier Media in an interview March 20, “Lenders started increasing rates last Friday [March 13, the same day that the Bank of Canada made its emergency cut to the overnight interest rate]. That includes major lenders such as Scotiabank, TD, RBC. They’ve also been reducing variable-rate mortgage discounts on the prime rate, which is currently 2.95 per cent, so the discount on most variable rates is barely anything. In the future, we could see no discounts at all.”

She added, “The fixed rates are usually connected to the bond market, but because banks need liquidity right now, they’re increasing the rates.” The bond market had previously dropped in line with the central bank’s interest rate, but has also rebounded over the past couple of days.

Liquidity for the banks is a key issue for the federal government right now, which announced March 20 that it is introducing “changes will help provide stable funding and liquidity to financial institutions and mortgage lenders and support continued lending to Canadian businesses and consumers.”

This follows an announcement by the Ministry of Finance that it is launching “a $50 billion Insured Mortgage Purchase Program (IMPP)... The amendments allow mortgage lenders to pool previously uninsured mortgages into National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities for CMHC to purchase these securities through the IMPP. The impact of this measure will provide financial institutions with more liquidity. This, in turn, will allow financial institutions to continue lending to businesses as well as individuals, while assisting customers who face hardship and need flexibility, on a case by case basis.”

By insuring previously uninsured mortgages, the government is essentially taking on the risk associated with those loans, freeing up banks’ balance sheets to provide more liquidity. The moves are intended to support banks while they offer such programs as six-month deferrals of mortgage payments to customers facing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Aragon said that the program would not necessarily prevent banks from raising mortgage interest rates. “It depends on the bank’s balance sheets, every bank is different,” she said. “These are unprecedented times.”

Even though rates for new mortgages are currently rising, applicants are rushing to get a mortgage on the back of news that the Bank of Canada has slashed its overnight rate.

RateSpy’s March 20 update added, “Nearly every long-time mortgage broker we’ve talked to is swamped, with some saying they’re having their highest application volume ever for a March.”

Aragon is one such busy mortgage professional. She told Glacier Media she is also fielding countless calls from people who are asking about possible mortgage deferrals, even when they haven’t lost their jobs. She added that some are hoping to stop paying their mortgages so they can use the money to invest in the stock market while it is depressed. “That’s not how you do it,” she added. “These deferral programs are really for people who are struggling financially due to the pandemic, and those customers will be required to provide proof of hardship.”

RateSpy’s March 20 update confirmed this trend, saying, “We’re hearing of cases where people are using HELOCs [home equity line of credit] to buy stocks. These are presumably (hopefully) well-qualified, risk-tolerant clients with financial safety nets. It’s definitely not a strategy for the overwhelming majority.”",[]

The board said that it was making “this explicit recommendation today with the support of real estate brokerages, and after an assessment of the latest information and commentary from public health and other government authorities.”

REBGV said that, earlier in the week, it had also “removed the rule requiring that properties listed on MLS be made available for showings.”

Ashley Smith, REBGV president said, “Realtors want to do their part to help prevent the spread of illness in our communities and to meet the housing needs of residents in a responsible way. We’ve heard from some in the community who are unhappy that their Realtors are not holding Open Houses. To those people, we ask for your understanding given the public health crisis we all face today.”

The board said that “anyone looking to buy or sell a home in today’s environment is encouraged to discuss COVID-19 preparedness with their Realtor” and offered some key tips for buyers and sellers. These include:

• If you recently travelled abroad and/or are unwell, do not view a property, and stay home.

• If you’re a seller, talk with your Realtor about alternative approaches to open houses, such as virtual showings and other technology-based solutions.

• If you’re a buyer, only visit a property when others are not present, sanitize your hands before and after a showing, and avoid touching doorknobs and other surfaces in the property.

The REBGV is also offering other tips for buyer and sellers at www.rebgv.org.

Construction must go on

Announced the same day was approval to B.C. construction companies to continue site operations, as the ban on gatherings of more than 50 people does not apply to construction sites, according to the Urban Development Institute.

The UDI said in a March 19 statement that “a senior provincial government official has contacted UDI president and CEO Anne McMullin to assure our industry and membership the 50-person limit does NOT apply to construction sites. The provincial government official confirmed that all sites can and should remain operating… Sites must continue to conform to Worksafe BC practices and current COVID-19 prevention protocols. That means additional handwashing stations should be made available, that workers should maintain their social distance of 1-2 metres from one another and during any on-site meetings.”

The UDI statement added, “In addition, the Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said during the March 17 news conference… that ‘Construction work outside is not as much of a risk that we are concerned about... but anyone who’s sick should not be going to work.’”

The Homebuilders Association of Vancouver (HAVAN) also sent out a statement March 19 offering advice to construction employers on site safety during the pandemic.

Supreme Court ruled in a class action suit Oct. 25.

Justice Gregory Bowden said while the majority of property transferees after the tax was enacted in August 2016 through November 2017 have been citizens of Asian countries, particularly China, it doesn’t mean the tax adversely affected Asian buyers in particular.

article continues below

“It is not a numbers game,” he said. “Buyers from Asian countries, such as China, receive equal treatment that is proportionate to the demand from those countries.”

Bowden said purchasing property is not necessary for immigration to Canada.

“The tax does not prevent a foreign person or alien from immigrating to Canada nor does it alter the rights of a foreign person to immigrate to Canada,” Bowden said in his ruling.

The tax, contained in the Property Transfer Tax Act, imposed an additional 20 per cent levy on a transferee of residential property in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) if the transferee is a “foreign entity.”

Representative plaintiff Jing Li argued the tax is beyond the scope of British Columbia’s legislative capacities and violated constitutional equality rights.

The Burnaby resident is a citizen of the People’s Republic of China. She moved to Canada in 2013 to complete a master’s degree in public administration at the University of Saskatchewan later moving to B.C.

In July 13, 2016, Li bought a residential real property in Langley for $559,000 plus $27,995 GST. The tax kicked in that August with Li owing an additional $83,850 as she was neither a permanent resident of Canada nor a citizen.

Bowden said neither side disputed there has been a Vancouver region housing affordability problem a number of years, reaching a serious level in 2016.

“In the 12-month period leading up to July 2016, the price of a single-family home increased by almost 40 per cent. Over the same period the price of condominiums had increased by 30.9 per cent,” Bowden said. “Home ownership in Vancouver became less affordable than all other cities in Canada. Vancouver had become one of the most unaffordable real estate markets in the world. By July 2016 the average benchmark price of a single-family home in Vancouver was close to $1.2 million.”

Further, Bowden said, the growth in incomes in the region hasn’t matched the increase in housing prices.

The judge noted concerns that foreign capital was responsible for high levels of house price inflation and increased affordability, other jurisdictions around the world imposed taxes or purchase restrictions on foreign buyers of real property. “Hong Kong, Singapore, Israel and three Australian states each introduced higher rates of property transfer tax or stamp duties applicable to foreign buyers,” Bowden said.

“The view that foreign nationals significantly contributed to the escalation of prices of housing in the GVRD is neither a stereotype nor a continuation of racist policies from the past,” he said. “The experts have agreed that the inflow of foreign capital has significantly contributed to price increases in the GVRD.”

But, Bowden said, prior to June 2016 there was little on the extent of foreign property buyers and their influence on regional housing prices.

“The results of the first full month collection of data showed that 9.7 per cent of residential real estate transactions in the GVRD involved foreign nationals,” Bowden said. “This represented a transactional value of $885,393,373. In the City of Vancouver the percentage was 10.9 per cent, 17.7 per cent in the City of Burnaby and 18.2 per cent in the City of Richmond.”

The judge said the tax’s “dominant purpose was to discourage and deter foreign nationals from purchasing residential property in the region.

“The raising of revenue was secondary particularly because the less revenue the tax raised the more successful it would have been in deterring foreign nationals from buying property,” he said.

Li asserted the tax’s aim is to regulate the rights of aliens, the legislative reserve of Parliament.

Further, she claimed, Chinese nationals mainly feel the tax’s effect because they prioritize the acquisition of residential real estate early in their immigration process.

However, Bowden said, the tax does not prevent foreign nationals from buying real estate or deter people from immigrating.

On the equality issue, Bowden said there’s no distinction impacting purchasers of B.C. property who originate from or are citizens of specific countries such as countries in Asia.

“The tax applies equally to all foreign nationals regardless of citizenship or country of origin,” he said.

The North Shore Winter Club has plans to build a 292,025-square-foot centre at 2420 Dollarton Rd. with two arenas, 10 tennis courts and a pool. But to pay for it, the club asked council to rezone 1325 Keith Rd., which would facilitate a land sale/exchange with Darwin Properties and a subsequent 930-unit development.

article continues below

The private, non-profit athletic club is struggling to pay high taxes and retain employees, explained club president Jay Frezell.

“We’re trying to survive,” he told council.

Darwin’s proposal consisted of 32- and 29-storey towers as well as a pair of a six-storey buildings and a two-storey structure that would have provided a home for the North Shore Unitarian Church.

After a seven-year search stymied by “high land cost and lack of suitable sites,” time is running short to find a new location, according to North Shore Unitarian Church president Jim Stephenson. The church is currently located on Mathers Avenue in West Vancouver.

“Our now almost 50-year-old building is even more inadequate and deteriorated. It will not last much longer without major upgrades and repair that we can’t afford,” Stephenson wrote in a letter to council. “The [Keith Road] location is exactly what we have been looking for: on public transit, just off of a major road, and highly accessible to the whole North Shore community.”

The deal would help prolong the winter club’s 60-year tradition without touching the taxpayers’ purse, Frezell said.

“Instead of coming empty with our hands out, we think we’ve come up with a solution that doesn’t cost taxpayers anything,” he said.

By shielding taxpayers and club members from expenses, almost the entire cost of a new facility – potentially as much as $200 million – will be paid for by increasing the value of the Keith Road property, said Mayor Mike Little.

“It’s a massive facility and it’s a massive amount of money,” he said. “I just don’t see it as being feasible.”

There is a logic in putting density near a bridgehead, Little said, noting a reduction in both commuting distances and strain on municipal infrastructure. While he said he couldn’t support development on the same scale as Seylynn, Little said he would consider a proposal with a more “modest uplift.”

The community would “scoff” at the notion of 930 new units near one of the most congested areas in North Vancouver, Coun. Jim Hanson said.

“Even entertaining such a proposal is contrary to any goals for livability of the area let alone addressing climate and CO2 emissions,” Hanson said.

The segment of Keith Road in front of the winter club “flows quite freely,” countered Coun. Mathew Bond. Bond added that construction of the project would be several years away.

“In that time, the B-Line will be in, the bus service to the SkyTrain will be in, all the interchanges will be complete,” he said.

Given the options to defer, proceed, revise or reject the application, Coun. Lisa Muri moved to reject.

Council is in the “very early stages” of an official community plan review, Muri noted.

“I think it is way early to discuss something like this,” she said.

The project includes 1,133 parking spots, a figure that, “just blows my mind,” said Coun. Betty Forbes.

Forbes was also critical of the type of housing being proposed, including 655 market ownership units, 175 market rentals and possibly 100 assisted living units for seniors.

“That’s not the kind of housing we’re looking for and this is not the place for putting that kind of congestion,” she said.

Coun. Megan Curren concurred.

“I don’t think the community is going to support a private club so that we would allow market condos,” she said.

Council voted 5-2 to reject the project with Bond and Coun. Jordan Back opposed.

Following the meeting Frezell announced plans to take council’s feedback, meet with partners, and see if the project can be adjusted.

“We believe our property is currently underutilized and that it will be rezoned,” he stated. “The question is not if, but when, and we hope it is not at the expense of a 60-year non-profit family club.”",[]

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

article continues below

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 13 new cases on July 14; and now

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,023 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,659 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 216 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 51 people who reside outside Canada.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

B.C.’s food and beverage processing industry alone (not including primary production) is the second largest manufacturing sector in the province, after forestry. With so much to choose from, incorporating local food into our daily diet is easy.According to Canada’s new food guide, a healthy and balanced meal consists of 50 per cent fruits and vegetables, 25 per cent protein, and 25 per cent whole grains. If we look to local food to fill our plate, here are some of the options.

B.C. is a leader in Canada when it comes to farm sales of fruit and vegetables. In 2018 our province was number one in the nation in sales of blueberries, sweet cherries, rhubarb, raspberries, prunes and plums, blackberries, apricots and pears, and second in greenhouse vegetables, mushrooms, brussels sprouts, kale, lettuce, and beets.

While the majority is seasonally dependent, many farmers offer options for consumers to eat locally all year round. Sky Harvest is Canada’s first certified organic urban farm located in Richmond B.C., growing high-quality organic microgreens indoors all year round. Another way to eat local vegetables no longer in season is when they are preserved. Located in North Vancouver is Ms. Lee’s Natural Foods offering vegan Korean kimchi in three traditional flavours. Each small batch is handcrafted and full of beneficial live probiotics. A must try recipe is Kimchi Pancakes!

When it comes to protein, North Vancouver offers a great variety of local food brands specializing in this muscle builder. For those that prefer plant-based options there is Tempea Natural Foods and Modern Meat.

Tempea Natural Foods makes hand-crafted, organic, unpasteurized and non-GMO tempeh in a gluten-free facility. Tempeh is a popular food item in Indonesia that is made by fermenting cooked soybeans. Compared to tofu, tempeh has a meatier texture and the fermentation brings out a savoury and nutty flavour. It cooks quickly by frying, grilling, or baking and is a protein rich addition to any meal.

Modern Meat offers plant-based meat alternatives. The company’s products include burgers, meatballs, crumble, and their most recent innovation, crab cakes. All of their products are free of soy, gluten, nuts, GMOs, artificial preservatives or additives.

Also located in North Vancouver is family owned business Two Rivers Meats, offering farm to table meat from a handpicked group of small farms in B.C. Their promise is locally sourced and ethically raised meat without hormones, antibiotics or chemical feed additives.

A new North Shore food brand is Mitch’s Catch offering seafood sustainably caught off the coast of Haida Gwaii and Oregon. Their specialty is Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna – you don’t want to miss out on their pre-cut poke packages and marinade. The company was created by two West Vancouver families, one with roots in commercial fishing and the other with roots in storytelling.

North Vancouver based Tao Organics produces a sprouted quinoa that is the perfect whole grain option. Soaking and sprouting grains makes the food easier for our bodies to absorb the nutrients. Tao Organics cafe was a long-standing go-to spot in North Vancouver for those wanting to eat organic, raw, plant-based cuisines. Her products are now offered online since closing this March.

And what meal would be complete without a beverage.

Tality Kombucha brews flavourful kombucha in North Vancouver by infusing whole organic roots, fruits, flowers or herbs directly into the kombucha instead of adding juices and concentrate. The product is low in sugar and rich in probiotics. Not only does it taste good, you can feel good drinking it knowing the glass is 100 per cent recyclable, the labels are made of 100 per cent post-consumer recycled material, and one per cent of their sales is donated to a local environmental NGO.

Eating locally is not only easy and delicious, it also has positive benefits to our local economy and environment. According to LOCO BC, an organization dedicated to the buy local movement, local businesses recirculate up to 4.6 times more revenue in the local economy than multinationals by keeping 63 cents of every dollar a consumer spends within the B.C. economy, versus only 14 cents from a multinational. Purchasing locally grown and made products also minimizes your consumer ""FoodPrint,"" as less transportation distance is needed for the food to make it to you.

The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

Finding a divorce lawyer who will serve your best interests is not the same as finding a friend who will take your side on everything. The best family law practitioner is someone who will be a fierce advocate for your rights but who also acts as a knowledgeable and objective guide through a complicated legal system.

“The process can be so overwhelming,” says Janneke Lewis, a family lawyer, mediator and parenting co-ordinator with Pettit and Company Trial Lawyers. “It takes knowing the legal system to be able to function effectively within it.”

Lewis has been a family lawyer in British Columbia since 2001, when she first worked with the firm’s founder, Tim Pettit. “He is incredibly hard working, ethical and knowledgeable—all characteristics that are important to me,” she says about her recent decision to join the firm.“Pettit and Co. are strong litigators which is essential, especially when it comes to family law. If one party is reluctant to disclose all their assets or income, it’s important to go to a lawyer who knows how to obtain the relevant information. Once you have full disclosure, it’s easier to come to a settlement.”

Divorce transforms a relationship that was based on love into something that becomes, in essence, a business transaction. Assets get appraised and divided; monetary value is given to things that are freighted with emotional meaning.

When there are children involved, it becomes even more complex. “Adults make their own decisions but children are tied to their parents’ decisions,” Lewis says. Her advice to parents is that “divorce will disrupt your child’s life but it doesn’t have to destroy it as long as you both can be respectful towards them. Don’t pull them into this. This is their mom. This is their dad. This is half of them. You might have every right to be angry with your spouse but that’s different from how your children feel.

“My experience,” Lewis adds, “is that if we get caught up in angst and anger it will protract the litigation, perhaps when there doesn’t even need to be litigation in the first place. I am very direct right from the beginning. I say, ‘I hear you, I get it, but this is what we need to do.’”

“For me it’s about empathy and fairness,” agrees Caitlin MacDonnell, who has also recently joined Pettit and Company’s expanding family law practice on the North Shore and Squamish. “Someone in a divorce is going through one of the worst times in their lives so they’ll be emotional; then there are all these legal issues that they have to deal with. A lot of our work is about supporting them through that process.”

Divorce law assigns rights and responsibilities, which can have serious and long-term consequences.

“The court system is extremely complex, whether it’s always right or the best way to do things,” says MacDonnell, who notes that, in B.C., a couple is a legal entity if they’ve been together for two or more years, whether they’re married or not. “When I’m meeting with a client, I’m listening to everything that’s going on and pulling out the legal issues that we can speak to a judge or opposing counsel about.

“Without a lawyer, people can feel it didn’t end up fairly for them. My job is to have already seen all of these things and how a judge will view them. I protect the interests of my client. For them, divorce is often quite lonely and it’s nice to have someone on their side.”

Founded in 2011, Pettit and Company has built its reputation on an innovative handling of legal strategies. The firm is also pleased that Alexandra (Allie) Booth is bringing her 20 years of experience to the practice, and to be working again with Amanda Groves, who worked closely with Pettit when they were first at North Shore Law.",[]

363,nsnews,http://www.nsnews.com/jack-knox-self-appointed-behaviour-judges-need-to-see-the-real-picture-1.24171159,Jack Knox: Self-appointed behaviour judges need to see the real picture,['Jack Knox'],,"Shannon Underdown-Ngongo would like to apologize. She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

Around the province, communities are divided between those that want tourism, and those without medical facilities that plead for people to stay away. For folks on the North Shore, there is a third option. We can enjoy “staycations” right here at home in places we have never visited before. It’s easy if you just know where to go. To save you some time, I have spent the last 30 years exploring our wilderburb and it’s amazing what you can discover in just a few decades, especially using Google Maps.

article continues below

What the heck is a “wilderburb?” According to American historian Lincoln Bramwell, it’s those rare and special places where the wilderness and suburbia interconnect. No finer example in the world can be found than the North Shore, where the mountains meet the sea amidst a paradise of forests, beaches, coves, cliffs, ponds and lakes. The trouble is that many of the best known are busy and many others are hard to find. Let me share a few with you.

One day I was at Gleneagles Golf Course wondering whether I wished to embarrass myself by playing a round of golf, when I noticed a family emerging from the woods behind the 7th hole carrying what looked to be picnic supplies. There is a tall wire screen just to the right of the tee box, and a paved path starts after the screen to the right. Take the path and walk 100 yards to where a small sign says Larsen Creek. The trail descends steeply down beside the creek. There are rough steps down the trail nicely edged with wire mesh to stop any slips and falls. It’s only a five-minute walk. There is a small sandy beach and the view is terrific. Passage Island can be seen in the distance. You’d never know Larsen beach was there. It’s totally hidden.

At that time we were carrying a baby around, so many of the trails and hikes I’d heard about, like the Grouse Grind, were out of consideration. I don’t like climbing steep mountain trails at the best of times. Even back then, attractions like Cates Park and Ambleside were quite busy, so I pulled out a map from the car and started to study it carefully. These days you simply type in Google Maps on your phone or computer and zoom in as close as you want. Google Street View brings you up close enough to read street signs. Voila!

Seen from the sea on a kayak, there are literally dozens of beaches along the Shore, some private and many public. Whytecliff is well known, but try finding a parking place in summer. Quarry Rock, when I first went, was a secret and now it has security guards stopping the hordes, and Deep Cove suffers from “overtourism.” Then there is the challenge of finding a picnic table or place to eat, because what’s the point of a walk without a snack? Don’t forget to bring a sandwich and a water bottle.

We were sitting on a picnic blanket at Panorama Park (Deep Cove) one time, munching on peanut butter sandwiches, when we learned a very valuable lesson. A family arrived and proceeded to set up shop. Table cloth. Check. Wicker basket. Check. Wine glasses. Fine food. Knives and forks. Hey, if you are going to have a picnic, why not do it right?

As a travel writer I’ve enjoyed the luxury of visiting literally hundreds of destinations in many countries and writing about “off the beaten track” gems, and seen some change and grow, sometimes not for the better. Joffre Lakes, east of Pemberton, now gets over 100,000 people a year. Yikes! When I wrote about Pemberton for a major newspaper chain, half of the folks I met said “you’re going to ruin our village,” and those in tourism said they were thrilled to be put on the map. The secret lies in the writing, especially in the “where to stay, what to do” category.

Most of the secret beaches and picnic places I have found and shared have very little parking. No one is going to want to drive a long way and find no place to park. I usually advise friends to ride a bike, or park elsewhere and walk to the destination. Most have viewpoints and are accessible to children and the elderly. Mother Nature’s Stairmaster, a.k.a. The Grind, is overrun by grinder’s seeking to escape the pandemic through rugged exercise. Why not a place of peace and relaxation instead, with a nice wicker basket of fine food prepared at home or picked up at the local deli?

The late great artist Gordon Smith lived in a lovely little cottage on a laneway just next to Lighthouse Park, where the parking lot fills up before noon. My family visited him at the cottage once, and after dinner he pointed out a little path leading down to the ocean far below, accessible only by a set of stairs and a steep walk down the hill. It led to a spectacular series of cliffs where you could sit and watch the sun go down and see eagles flying by. There was a sign on the lane and space for two cars to park. He was too old to walk it, he said, but encouraged us to go. There are literally dozens of such gems hidden around the North Shore, and you don’t need to drive all the way to Whistler to enjoy them. Stay home this summer and explore your own back yard. Our own wilderburb is truly a piece of paradise.

And one of the surest sources of local small business is the community farmers market!

article continues below

Fortunately, the North Shore is blessed with two popular farmers markets: Lonsdale Artisan Farmers’ Market that operates every Saturday at Lonsdale Quay, and Ambleside Artisan Farmers’ Market that happens on Sundays at Ambleside Park. Both markets are directed by the Artisan Farmers’ Market Society who also run two markets in Burnaby.

Earlier in the pandemic, before health and safety guidelines were defined, the Society faced the uncertainty of being able to open their markets this season. However, within a short time, farmers markets were declared an essential service. This allowed Artisan to open with similar health and safety guidelines to grocery stores, except with a fresh air experience!

One of the beauties of these local markets is that you’ll often meet and speak directly with the people who are growing, baking and making your food and other products. You can ask them about their growing practices, the product ingredients, and the best way to prepare or use the products.

The markets feature small start-up and more established local businesses from all over B.C. Here are a few of the wonderful vendors with ties to the North Shore that you can meet at the market this summer

Little by Little Farms

Pablo and Karla Wilkinson are passionate about sustainable farming and operate Little by Little Farms, based in Aldergrove. Raised in North Vancouver, Pablo gained an appreciation early on for good food. He learned about how food is grown and to value the taste of fresh produce from his grandparents, Hazel and Jack. Having spent years learning organic and sustainable farming practices, Pablo and Karla decided to start Little by Little Farms in 2016. Believing in the importance of safe, healthy food, they do not use chemical pesticides or fertilizers. This season, Little by Little Farms is offering a delicious selection of produce including arugula, micro greens, carrots, tomatoes, baby kale and more!

Bad Dog Bread

Bad Dog Bread has become a favourite at all the Artisan Farmers’ Markets. Based out of their North Vancouver location at 1600 Mackay Road, owner Vadim Mugerman not only bakes a wide variety of tasty baked goods, but he even mills his own flour!

Market customers are advised to get to the market early because Bad Dog usually sells out of their locally handcrafted organic bread and pastries very quickly, especially their delicious cinnamon buns, brioche buns and mouth-watering cookies. Yum, Yum!

Coconama Chocolate

Coconama Chocolate is another local gem that can be found at the North Shore markets. Takanori Chiwata is the owner and chocolate engineer at Coconama and his mission is to connect people with chocolate. Chiwata has a fascinating background as a chocolate researcher in Japan but finds great joy in interacting with customers and providing a fantastic chocolate that people love to savour. You can enjoy Coconama’s delectable gluten- and nut-free creations like the melt-in-your-mouth ganache truffles at the weekly markets and also at their store located on First Avenue East in North Van.

Bob the Dog

Named after their own dog, Bob, Bob the Dog is another North Vancouver-based business that supplies all sorts of treats and accessories for dogs. Each one of their leashes, bandanas, and toys are handmade and sure to be a hit with your beloved four-legged friend. Business owner Carra Hodgson joined Artisan Markets in 2018 and quickly gained many repeat North Shore customers.

Whichever Artisan Farmers’ Market you choose to attend, you’ll be supporting small businesses based in B.C. and on the North Shore. May through October, you can shop at Lonsdale Farmers’ Market on Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. in the East Plaza next to Lonsdale Quay. Ambleside Farmers’ Market is open on Sundays, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and you’ll find it in at the west end of Ambleside Park in West Vancouver.

367,nsnews,http://www.nsnews.com/news/west-van-choreographer-left-legacy-of-modern-dance-in-canada-1.24170899,West Van choreographer left legacy of modern dance in Canada,[],,"West Vancouver choreographer, artistic director and dance teacher Anna Wyman, an influential figure in the development of modern dance in Canada, died Saturday at Lions Gate Hospital at the age of 92.

For much of the 1970s and 1980s the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre was regarded as one of Canada’s foremost modern-dance companies.

article continues below

In 1975 it became the first modern dance troupe to tour Canada and went on to become one of the most travelled companies in North America, taking its dance productions to India, Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe and Mexico.

The company also appeared in films and headlined at the National Arts Centre.

“She was a foundational matriarch of a mini-dynasty of dance in Canada,” said her ex-husband Max Wyman, a dance critic, biographer and historian.

Born in Austria, Wyman started dancing at age four and in her teens danced with the Graz Opera Ballet company and at the State Opera in Vienna.

In the late-1940s, Wyman moved to London to continue her study with dance artist and theorist Rudolf von Laban, whose Laban movement analysis, a method for describing and visualizing human movement, had an impact on the young dancer who would go on to employ the method when it came time to develop her own practice as a teacher and choreographer.

She emigrated to Canada in 1967 with her then-husband Wyman and children.

Her arrival coincided with a flowering of interest in the arts in Canada, and she launched The Anna Wyman Dancers in 1971 with a series of performances at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

In a 1985 article published by the New York Times looking at the company’s New York debut, the paper notes: “Any visitor to Canada interested in dance has often heard Miss Wyman’s name mentioned. There is no doubt that she has played a role in the burgeoning dance activity now evident in major Canadian cities.”

A lover of collaboration between dancers and artists of various trades, Wyman’s tenure running her dance company was marked by an emphasis on improvisation, which was novel when first introduced, as well as other remarkable flourishes – such as lights, props, film, and even lasers – which would have seemed more suitable for the theatre than the dance stage.

But this was modern dance and the rules were being broken.

Wyman commissioned costume and set designs with some of the era’s most prominent composers and artists, among them Jack Shadbolt, Toni Onley, Sylvia Tait and John Mills-Cockell.

“It was choreography dance theatre, it wasn’t just dance. It was dance theatre, which involved a lot of things and involved a lot of other artists working with me. We worked together as a team,” Wyman told the North Shore News in December.

With her 1972 piece, Here at the Eye of the Hurricane, Wyman was a winner at the International Young Choreographers Competition in Cologne, Germany.

Another one of her best-known pieces, Dance Is This and That, incorporated Wyman’s philosophy that all movement is a form of dance by showing how a football player crashing on the field, a tennis player in their flow, or even simply walking to get groceries, could be considered dance, if it were observed the right way.

“Dance is life. We are all dancing, but we formalize the dance. It’s living,” said Wyman.

After two decades, the Anna Wyman Dance Theatre completed its run in 1991, but not before the company had accomplished a number of amazing feats, including being the first modern dance company from the West to tour China in 1980.

Wyman continued to administer and teach at her dance school in West Vancouver, nestled between 14th and 15th streets on Marine Drive.

Wyman was there in December when the dance school celebrated 50 years.

Wyman died in hospital Saturday following a heart attack at her West Vancouver home.

Predeceased by her husband, Neil Christopher Wortley, she leaves a son, Trevor Wyman, and a daughter, Gabrielle Capewell.

368,nsnews,http://www.nsnews.com/opinion/columnists/older-and-wiser-seniors-should-enjoy-the-summer-sun-safely-1.24170871,OLDER AND WISER: Seniors should enjoy the summer sun safely,['Margaret Coates'],,"Finally, it seems summer has appeared. After a month or so of iffy weather, the sun is set to shine a bit more, encouraging people to get out and enjoy the good weather.

For seniors who have been more isolated and challenged because of COVID-19 curtailing their usual activities, such as going to the seniors and recreation centres, the library, shops and so on, the good weather promises a bit more freedom.

article continues below

The municipalities have opened some activities previously closed and some organizations have started a cautious reopening. Older people can now visit the park, attend or hold backyard physical distancing parties, walk along the beach or perhaps sit at the beach in anticipation of a swim or picnic lunch, and possibly take a class at a seniors centre.

However, older people need to continue to be careful as the COVID-19 virus is still prevalent in our communities. Seniors are still the major causality of the virus with most deaths occurring in the seniors population. Many older people have compromised immune systems and other age-related health issues which make them more susceptible to contracting the virus. In a recent update on COVID-19 in British Columbia, Dr. Bonnie Henry says let’s not let our guard down, things could worsen, so everyone should keep up with measures to prevent transmission.

So, continue to take the sound advice from Dr. Henry and others to practice beneficial safety techniques, including washing your hands, physical distancing, perhaps wearing a face mask, especially indoors in crowded public spaces, avoiding big groups of people and keeping your social bubble small and safe. I have to say I am perhaps one of those people that others laugh at because of my restrictive measures, but getting the virus or maybe transmitting it to others is not something I am willing to risk.

Throughout the last few months of the pandemic, older people have been isolated more than usual, and it seems appropriate to allow more in-person (but with physical distancing) social connectedness. It is worrisome that some seniors are so isolated that this might impact their mental health and well-being. As I have often quoted before, one study found evidence that shows that lacking social connections can increase one’s chances for early death to a similar degree to smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Balancing opening on-site activities in organizations and keeping seniors safe has been challenging for those that want to see seniors regain their social connections. Organizations on the North Shore have been cautiously reopening some of their on-site activities such as pre-registered classes and outdoor events. Libraries are starting to let people visit their site but with reduced hours and many safety measures. I have been hearing “so far so good” news. Phone your nearest organization and see what they have to offer.

Apart from the COVID-19 virus challenges, summer heat can pose a risk to older people. A May 2019 article in Health Companions for Seniors says “Older adults do not adjust as easily to sudden changes in temperatures. Chronic medical conditions can impact how seniors’ bodies react to heat. Prescription medicines can affect an older person’s ability to regulate or adjust to temperatures, control perspiration, and handle sun exposure.”

But with some simple and maybe some more complex strategies, older people can enjoy this time of year. Generally, the tips for staying safe in the summer heat are simple. One step is to stay hydrated. An article in an issue of On Health: Consumer Reports says “aging can dull your sense of thirst and temperature, increasing your risk of heatstroke, which can be dangerous or even deadly.”

According to Health Canada, symptoms of heat illness can include dizziness or fainting, nausea or vomiting, headache, rapid breathing and heartbeat, extreme thirst, and decreased urination with unusually dark yellow urine. Health Canada suggests: “If you have any of these symptoms during extreme heat, move to a cool place and drink liquids right away.”

Wear sunscreen and a hat – getting a burn is not fun and could cause other issues. Wear light clothing. While you do not have to get out the short shorts, you can get clothing in a protective, breathable, and light fabric to keep you cool. Exercising wisely is a good technique to enjoy the summer without getting overheated. You could spend time in your garden to improve endurance and reduce stress and if you do not have a garden, you might be able to set up some potted plants on your windowsill or balcony. Perhaps now you could also try some physical distancing walking with a friend or family member – the parks are open.

Getting older people back to some semblance of normal is a good thing, but let’s do it responsibly to reduce the risks for seniors.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Documents filed in B.C. Supreme Court say more than 100 children, most of them Indigenous, were left homeless and vulnerable to sexual exploitation and physical or psychological harm.

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 alleged social worker Robert Riley Saunders siphoned away rent and other funds from those under his guardianship while he worked for the Ministry of Children and Family Development in Kelowna.

The settlement, which still needs to be approved by the court, says all claimants would be eligible for a basic payment of $25,000, with a maximum award of up to $250,000 for those who were Indigenous, left homeless, were physically harmed or whose education was delayed.

The court documents say the province has identified 107 foster children who may have been involved, two are dead and four have settled in separation actions. Ninety are believed to be Indigenous.

Jason Gratl, the lawyer for the plaintiff, said the allegations date back to 2001 and there may be more children involved. But poor or false records were kept.

""The records created by Riley Sanders tended to be false and self-serving because Riley Saunders was known to be a con-artist and a self-serving fraudster,"" Gratl said in an interview Wednesday.

He said employment records show that Saunders was insensitive to Aboriginal cultural and history, yet he was assigned to work with high-risk Indigenous children by the ministry.

Saunders has never commented on the allegations or filed a statement of defence in court.

In Victoria on Wednesday, Attorney General David Eby said it has always been the government's goal to ensure appropriate compensation for those affected.

He said additional financial controls have been put in place and there's more training and oversight of the ministry's workers to ensure no child faces the same situation.

""That is of vital importance to the government that we protect these kids. It's an incredibly heart-breaking situation that this happened.""

In its reply to the lawsuit filed in court, the ministry admitted to ""vicarious liability"" for the acts and omissions of Saunders.

The reply said the ministry detected financial irregularities involving Saunders in December 2017 and he was suspended a month later.

""Steps were taken under the direction of the local (ministry) office to ensure the immediate safety and well-being of the children, youth and young adults on the case load of Mr. Saunders,"" the response to the civil claim said.

The prosecution service said it has received a report on Saunders from the RCMP and possible charges are being assessed.

Two lawsuits filed against the province and Saunders in 2018 alleged Saunders moved the children from their homes in order to make them eligible for financial benefits from the ministry, then opened joint bank accounts for each youth.

""Saunders stole the funds deposited by the ministry into joint bank accounts by moving them to his own individual account at Interior Savings and by paying his personal expenses by electronic transfer from the joint bank account,"" the statements said.

They also alleged Saunders was aware of the youths' vulnerability and aware that he exercised parental control over them.

A certification hearing for the class action is scheduled for July 28. If approved, it would allow an individual's case to stand in for all the class members.

A decision from the court on approval of the settlement is expected after the certification hearing.

That's causing angst for organizations such as Souls Harbour Rescue Mission in Halifax, which has already taken on seven students but now doesn't know whether the government will actually cover the payments the volunteers have been promised.

article continues below

""I wish they would just come out with a statement to say: 'It's taking us a while, but charities, we won't leave you hanging for it,'"" said Souls Harbour CEO Michelle Portman. ""They haven't said that. So that's why we're all twiddling our thumbs and biting our nails.""

Souls Harbour's board of directors has decided the charity will honour the commitment made to the seven students who are now volunteering in its thrift store, even if the government kills the program.

But Portman said that will have financial implications across the rest of the organization, which provides lunches and a safe space for hundreds of people every week.

""We have decided that if the government decides not to pay then we will uphold it in some way and pay the grant for them,"" she said. ""But we have no way of knowing. ... My HR lady is just completely stressed about it because she knows how much that will cost us if the program folds.""

The fate of the program is just one of many unanswered questions about the student-volunteer scheme, which has been left in turmoil after the government and WE ended their partnership on Juy 3.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced general plans for the grant program in April with details following June 25. The government promised students could receive up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours through the program.

Souls Harbour isn't the only one waiting for word from the government since the $20-million contract with Toronto-based WE was terminated amid questions about the Trudeau family's links to WE co-founder Craig and Marc Kielburger.

""We have had no communication,"" said Toronto Zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey ""One of the last communications from the WE folks was just that they were working on transitioning everything back over to the federal government, but there's been nothing further.""

Charities like the Toronto Zoo, which had planned to take on five students to conduct research on animal behaviour during COVID-19, weren't the only ones in the dark. Tracey said her daughter had also heard nothing after applying to work at a centre for Indigenous women.

YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale also said there has been no word on his organization's desire to take on 391 students at branches across the country, adding he was ""starting to wonder if this is going to happen.""

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office and the Employment and Social Development Canada, the federal department that has taken over the program, have said the government will help students dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet they have offered no update on the program, including whether it will even continue.

""The government of Canada remains committed to supporting students and the not-for-profit sector and is working diligently to develop a transition plan, including looking at options on how best to proceed,"" ESDC spokeswoman Isabelle Maheu said in an email Wednesday.

""This means there will be delays, but more information will be provided as soon as it is available.""

The department has also declined to say how many positions the $912-million program was supposed to create for students, how many positions had been approved, the number of applications received from students or how many positions have been filled.

Those questions are in addition to what other organizations were considered to run the program before cabinet decided to award a sole-sourced contract to WE. Trudeau has said WE was recommended by the public service and was the only organization capable of running the program.

Putting the lemons in harms way of people and pets has prompted Coquitlam RCMP to ask people to stop the activity and to encourage people to call police if they see one of these spiky, hanging lemons instead of disposing of the evidence.

So far there have been two instances of someone tying lemons stuck with sewing needles to tree branches — both in Port Coquitlam — police say.

The first lemon was found hung from a branch in Gates Park on June 22. A report was made in an email to the city of Port Coquitlam. The second lemon was found on Tuesday, July 14, tied near a trail by the Coquitlam River at Whyte Avenue. That discovery was reported with an email to a closed Community Police Station.

One of the lemons was reported on Facebook and subsequently commented on in the Tri-City News.

Are they a dangerous new trend?

Police want to know if sticking needles in lemons and tying them to trees in a public park is an attempt to harm people or for some other purpose.

This second lemon, wrapped in orange twine, stuck with needles and tied to a branch was found near a trail along the Coquitlam River in Port Coquitlam. - Coquitlam RCMP

Some have claimed that it’s connected to witchcraft or voodoo, and a report four years ago in the U.S. found a similar occurrence.

What ever the reason, police want to hear from those who are tying these potentially dangerous lemons to a tree.

“If you see something that could be a deliberate attempt at harm, you must call police on the phone rather than send an email,”, stated Corporal Michael McLaughlin in a press release.

“Both of these lemons were thrown into the garbage by the people who found them. By the time police received the emails, the evidence was gone and an investigation was virtually impossible”.

One theory is that the person who left the lemons had no intention to hurt anyone. Until police speak to that person, it’s hard to be sure.

“If you are leaving these lemons full of needles in public, we ask that you stop, and then talk to us to explain what you were doing”, McLaughlin further stated.

If anyone spots someone doing this, they are asked to call the Coquitlam RCMP non-emergency number at 604-945-1550, or call 911 “if it’s happening right in front of you”.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

Closer to home, stories of family members involved in the earliest days of the Lynn Valley Care Centre outbreak should cause us to rethink the idea that significant problems don’t exist in B.C.’s long-term care system as well.

Lynn Valley had the bad luck to be the first care home hit by COVID-19. There were lessons learned there.

But along the way, vulnerable elderly were subjected to conditions they should not have been. What family members saw was not the “situation normal” described by health officials.

Families add lack of adequate care in seniors’ homes in general isn’t an isolated experience.

It’s important to hear their stories.

Nobody dreams of moving into a care home. When it happens, we want to know our elderly loved ones will be comfortable and have their needs taken care of.

But that’s not what happens at least some of the time, thanks to chronic understaffing.

Unless you have a family member in care, you’re unlikely to be exposed to this. The frail elderly are a group who can’t advocate for themselves.

That there are large gaps in seniors care is not new information, however.

B.C.’s Seniors Advocate has been pointing out the problems for years.

But a functioning care system costs a lot of money – a priority that competes with others for dollars.

Incrementally the system is improving, but those in care now, at the end of their lives, don’t have time to wait.

The Vancouver Park Board passed a motion late Tuesday which includes provisions to ""more effectively manage temporary structures and tents for those seeking shelter in parks.""

article continues below

The board says the move reflects recent B.C. Supreme Court decisions recognizing the charter right to stay in public spaces when adequate shelter is not available.

The motion passed 4-3 after two nights of debate and submissions from dozens of speakers.

Chrissy Brett, an organizer of a tent city in Vancouver's Strathcona Park and a spokeswoman for other recent Vancouver encampments, said she's upset with the outcome.

""I would say that I'm disappointed in the lack of humanity in this decision,"" she said Wednesday.

Brett said she would have preferred the board defer the motion to allow for more discussion its impact on the homeless.

She compared the encampments in Vancouver with the plight of refugees in foreign countries.

""If we can send that refugee money overseas, we need to create Canadian refugee-style camps,"" Brett said. ""I'm tired of the government saying we need to work on housing first when there's nothing that comes second. There's no wraparound support services, there's no detox or treatment.""

By refugee-style, Brett said she means a camp which has formal access to toilets, running water and social services.

Shane Simpson, the minister of social development and poverty reduction, said the government is looking at an array of options to address the camp sites.

He said he questions whether a refugee-style camp would meet the approval of current campers.

""One of the things about a camp like that, if you chose to do that, is that it would be pretty heavily managed. It would need to be,"" he said. ""In terms of the campers, I'm not certain about how well it would be received by the people who are camping there.""

Simpson added that he expects the number of tents at Strathcona Park to grow and he doesn't know how the bylaw will be practically enforced.

""I'm not sure that anybody quite understands what the impact of this bylaw will be,"" he said.

The city had been dealing with a long-running tent city in the Downtown Eastside at Oppenheimer Park when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.

Officials were able to place the majority of those residents in housing, but two more tent cities popped up in the wake of its shutdown.

The first, on property owned by the Port of Vancouver near CRAB Park, was dismantled after the B.C. Supreme Court granted an injunction in early June over health and safety concerns.

The encampment at Strathcona Park has swelled to about 200 tents.

Dave Demers, a commissioner who voted for the motion, said the board was left in an untenable situation.

The current bylaw restricting sleeping in parks was unconstitutional and officials needed to come up with a solution, he said.

""It's a pretty dire situation that is not new,"" Demers said. ""I think people fail to understand or grasp the gravity of the situation.""

The provincial government needs to sit down with local officials to help plot a way forward and ensure there are more services offered for the homeless population, he added.

377,nsnews,http://www.nsnews.com/home-sales-continue-to-rebound-in-june-after-pandemic-freeze-earlier-in-year-1.24170491,Home sales continue to rebound in June after pandemic freeze earlier in year,[],,"OTTAWA — Real estate agents across the country saw home sales in June nearing or even beating pre-pandemic levels.

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

“This project is a good news story in my mind. It’s an opportunity for West Vancouver to not only meet its immediate needs but also to lead in the region,” said Mayor Mary-Ann Booth, casting her vote in favour at the July 14 meeting. “We actually are the most expensive city in North America. We actually have a higher price-to-income ratio than Manhattan. When we talk about affordability, this is ground zero.”

Using the money from the sale of the former West Vancouver police station on Marine Drive to Grosvenor, council purchased the Gordon Avenue land from Vancouver Coastal Health in 2014 for $16.4 million. After two and a half years of study and consultations, they narrowed down their options for the site to include a mix of 50 strata condos in an eight-storey tower at the southern portion of the land and 167 below-market rentals and seniors day facility in two six-storey buildings on the northern portion.

The below-market rentals will be offered at an average of 70 per cent of market rates, which should put them in reach of households earning $50,000 to $120,000 per year. Working age people 25 to 44 make up only 16 per cent of West Van’s population compared to the 28 per cent Metro Vancouver average, staff noted.

With the rezoning in place, the district may now start a procurement process looking for developers partnered with non-profits who will either buy or lease the land on a long-term basis and build the housing, which district staff estimate will provide a $26-million return to the municipal coffers.

The vote followed a lengthy public hearing in which supporters outnumbered opponents about 7:1, although significantly more people wrote to council urging them to vote down the project.

Those who opposed the project questioned the wisdom of providing below-market rentals for households that make more than $100,000 per year when the municipality could sell the land outright for the benefit of existing residents.

Resident Duncan Pearce argued the best way to get the lower rents council desires is to let the private sector increase supply to meet demand.

“The issue can be resolved by council at very little cost with widespread density bonuses applied to privately owned sites that are developed as rental,” he said. “With the Gordon Avenue project … council is engaging in a very substantial social experiment that, with respect, hasn’t been carefully thought through.”

Most, however, argued the project would be an important first step in making the municipality more hospitable for working families and less reliant on commuters.

Jonathan Lloyd, rector of St. Stephens Anglican Church, said he has been astonished by the number of health-care workers he’s met while serving as chaplain at Lions Gate Hospital who drive long distances because they can’t afford to live on the North Shore. He urged council to approve the rezoning or risk “becoming an island for seniors.”

“It is imaginative, transformational and it will build our community. If there are two things the COVID-19 pandemic has taught me, it's that dollars do not make our world go round but rather community does.”

Michael Markwick told council he raised his five children just a block away, but today, none of them could afford to live in the city they grew up in.

“If we do not have families in West Vancouver, then we cannot have a West Vancouver. It seems to me that is the measure of the highest and best use of this land,” he said.

The majority on council agreed. Couns. Bill Soprovich, Craig Cameron, Nora Gambioli and Marcus Wong joined Booth in voting in favour.

“It's a difficult decision. I have to weigh: do we sell the land for an immediate benefit? Or do we invest in it, as it were, for the next generation and generation after that?” Wong said. “Surely the soul of humanity is faithful service to the unwritten commandment that says: we shall give our children better than we ourselves received.”

While everyone on council agreed to changing the official community plan to allow development on the site, Couns. Peter Lambur and Sharon Thompson both voted against the rezoning because they felt it was too restrictive, either because the municipality would be leaving money on the table or because it targeted the wrong group for affordable housing.

“I get the sense that a lot of the people that are in support of affordable housing on this site, or whatever passes for affordable housing, don't appreciate what the opportunity cost is to achieve that,” Lambur said. “And I'm still concerned that the breadth of affordability that we're contemplating right now … is too narrow and leaves a lot of the more vulnerable people in our community that we think we would like to serve and help on the sidelines.”",[]

The supermodel, actor and businesswoman who co-created ""America’s Next Top Model"" will replace longtime host Tom Bergeron and take on the role of executive producer, ABC said late Tuesday.

In a statement, Banks said she’s a fan of the contest's approach of ""fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances ... it’s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk.""

Banks lauded Bergeron, host of the show since its 2005 debut, as having set ""a powerful stage"" and said she’s excited to continue the legacy.

Co-host Erin Andrews also is leaving the series, which is getting a ""creative refresh"" while honouring America’s affection for it, ABC said. Andrews was not expected to be replaced.

When the show will get to unveil its new approach in season No. 29 remains clouded by the pandemic-caused production halt affecting the return of most TV series.

The announcement that Banks is joining the show followed word Monday of Bergeron and Andrews’ exits. In a Twitter post, Bergeron called working on ""Dancing With the Stars"" an ""incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career.""

Last year, Bergeron drew attention when he expressed concern over the show’s decision to include former White House press secretary Sean Spicer among the contestants for last fall's season.

Bergeron tweeted then that he had suggested to producers the new season be a ""joyful respite from our exhausting political climate"" and urged them to avoid ""divisive bookings.""

ABC thanked the departing Bergeron for his ""trademark wit and charm"" that helped the show succeed and Andrews for her sense of humour.

It was the day after families had been summoned to a meeting and assured their loved ones would be isolated in their rooms and looked after.

Mikhail’s first concern had been whether there was enough staff to help feed residents in their rooms. Families were reassured that extra staff would be coming in.

Mikhail and her partner Althea Gibb-Carsley got Isabelle settled in her room that day and fed her dinner. Then they went home.

They returned to check on Mikhail’s mom about 24 hours later.

The scene that greeted them was shocking.

Isabelle was in the same position as when they’d left her. Her unchanged diaper was bulging. “She was cold, shivering and she was disoriented,” said Gibb-Carsley. Untouched breakfast and lunch trays were piled up.

Mikhail says her mom never truly recovered from that.

“She was frail. She had just turned 94,” said Mikhail. “And so we knew that she probably would not be able to recover from COVID. And people were dying every day.”

On March 18, Isabelle Mikhail became the eighth resident of Lynn Valley Care Centre – and in Canada – to die of COVID-19.

In early March, the Lynn Valley Care Centre was the first care home in the country to become an epicentre of the virus. Before the outbreak was declared over two months later, 53 elderly residents and 26 staff contracted the virus and 20 residents died.

Over 129 deaths – or 69 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths – since the beginning of the pandemic in B.C. have been among people over 80 years old, according to B.C.’s Centre for Disease Control. Deaths in care homes have made up 72 per cent of the total.

A group of daughters whose parents all contracted COVID-19 in the Lynn Valley Care Centre outbreak are now speaking up, describing their experiences in a care home system that was ill-prepared to handle the added stresses of the virus in an environment of chronic understaffing.

The women said in light of the deficiencies that COVID-19 revealed in the long-term care system, both provincial and federal governments need to take a serious look at the way long-term care is funded and supported. So does the public, they say.

On March 7, families had arrived to the meeting to find medical health officers from Vancouver Coastal Health along with the director of care for the Lynn Valley Care Centre present. A number of care centre staff were also there, lined up against a wall. They looked frightened, said the women.

Kelly Shellard, whose 82-year-old father Bill Shellard has dementia and lives in the care centre, went to the meeting. Afterwards she went back to her Lynn Valley home and stewed. She stayed home for a few hours, then decided she had to go back to the care home to check on her dad.

There were no extra staff, as promised. In fact, many of the staff who were scheduled to work that day hadn’t shown up for their shifts.

“That was the first day that we ended up having to hand out food to the residents because there were so few people that showed up to work,” said Shellard.

“We realized on Sunday that the help was not there,” said Gibb-Carsley. “And there was not much time to think about whether we would or would not participate, because we were thrust into this situation.”

Family members said rather than extra cleaning they might have expected, there was little evidence of even regular cleaning for the first week of the outbreak. “So instead of enhanced cleaning it was reduced cleaning. Because the [cleaning staff] didn’t come in,” said Gibb-Carsley.

Shellard said she went to one man’s room to help “and he had peed all over the floor. And it was there the next day because there was no cleaning. It wasn’t until a week later that they actually brought in a cleaning company to come every night and fully clean the place.”

Debra Drew, whose 96-year-old dad Graham Drew lives in the care centre, said some staff who turned up were clearly uncomfortable being in the care home at the time of the outbreak. “Others couldn’t leave after their shifts because there was nobody to replace them. … People were working 16-hour shifts.”

“All the while we’re hearing [Health Minister] Adrian Dix say everything’s been taken care of,” said Drew. “For us, what we were seeing did not jive with the official report.”

In response to issues raised by the families, both Vancouver Coastal Health and Lynn Valley Care Centre issued statements.

“Like other care facilities, the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged our facility, spreading at an alarming rate, which added to our challenges of getting ahead of the outbreak,” according to the statement from the care centre. “Professional replacement staff was brought in as soon as possible, following a short time when we had some staff shortages.”

According to Vancouver Coastal Health, in the early days of the outbreak, the Lynn Valley Care Centre “experienced staffing shortages because some staff were sick, and others, afraid of becoming infected, did not come to work.”

A rapid response team to deal with infection control was put in place and “extraordinary measures were put in place to restore and maintain staffing levels,” according to the statement.

Putting their parents in care had not been easy for any of the families.

Shellard and her son lived with her dad for almost four years until Bill’s health deteriorated and his dementia worsened. When her dad was found wandering down the street in the middle of the night, Shellard said it was clear she could no longer manage his care.

Mikhail’s mom had moved out from Alberta 15 years ago and bought a condo close to her. She had 10 good years before being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. “She wasn’t managing her medications very well. So I had to take that over,” said Mikhail. Medical staff eventually suggested Isabelle needed to move into care.

But at the care home, staff were often stretched, especially during the night shift.

“Dad would fall and nobody would find him,” said Deanna Harlow, Debra Drew’s sister. Often they didn’t know how long it took until somebody noticed.

“He couldn’t get up himself and he doesn’t know to push the call button or maybe the call button was too far away.”

Staff never had enough time – to help with brushing teeth or even simple tasks like turning on a TV.

Gibb-Carsley said she saw care aides wheel residents from one room to the next without even telling them what was happening.

“You don’t just move someone,” she said. “But you do if you’re in a hurry.”

Baths or showers for residents were infrequent and minimal, say the women. Shellard said her dad went three months without a shower.

There was little time for conversation.

“We are not saying that these are bad people. They are people who try really hard to do their best,” said Shellard. “It’s a really hard job.”

It’s an impossible job when there aren’t enough people to do it, she said.

When COVID-19 hit the care centre in March the same caregivers – already stretched to their limits – had to deal with residents who were now sick and dying in some cases. “There’s another skill set that needs to come into play but it just wasn’t there,” said Mikhail.

The women acknowledge not all families with parents at the care home had the same experience. Some only wanted information from official sources. Some seemed angry and uncomfortable at the questions they raised.

“My own thinking is that if you have a loved one in there ... you have to do certain things psychologically, to make peace with that,” said Gibb-Carsley. “And one of those things is minimizing the difficult information.”

“A lot of people don’t want to know the truth about elder care in this country,” she said. “It’s a very difficult truth. It’s very inconvenient. And that plays a role in what we have done for years in this country with regards to elder care.”

Gibb-Carsley said in her opinion, while the long-term care residents who died of COVID-19 were medically vulnerable, they were made more so “by the level of care that’s inadequate” in care homes.

“When my mom was dying, there was one [licensed practical nurse] on for 92 patients, running up and down the stairs because ... the elevator wasn’t operational,” said Mikhail.

Although Isabelle was supposed to have a minced diet, at the end of her life “often sandwiches would show up or things that she was not able to chew or swallow,” said Mikhail.

“They were getting lunches in a bag and muffins in plastic wrap that 90 per cent of the people there couldn’t open.”

Mikhail and Gibb-Carsley cared for Isabelle for 10 days until she died.

She didn’t have COVID-19 symptoms until the very end, they said, when they would frequently have to seek out nurses for pain medication.

“Had we not been there she would have died really struggling,” said Gibb-Carsley.

The parents of all the women who spoke to the North Shore News for this story contracted COVID-19 at the care centre. All except Isabelle survived.

At various points when their parents were not expected to survive, family members were allowed in to the care centre to see them.

Kathie Lloyd said in the case of her 82-year-old mom Donna, she’s convinced family help probably made the difference to her mom’s survival.

One of the concerns about the recent lockdown on family visits to care centres is that it has meant there have been no independent observers in the nursing homes, say the women.

“There are no neutral parties that are checking to make sure how things are going,” said Gibb-Carsley.

Several weeks after her mom died, Mikhail was told she could come and get Isabelle’s possessions. Staff came down with a trolley with some of her mother’s things, she said, but many items were missing, including family photos that had been on a bulletin board in her room and all her mother’s clothes.

A caregiver told her she had thrown Isabelle’s clothes in the trash.

Mikhail later received an apology letter. “It felt pretty flat,” she said.

The women say their experience with COVID-19 revealed fault lines in the care of the elderly that need to be addressed.

“It’s not going to go away,” said Drew, who adds she questions why for-profit care homes are allowed and is aghast that B.C. Premier John Horgan doesn’t see the need for a public inquiry.

Harlow said she wants to see elder care added to the Canada Health Act to ensure national standards. She’d also like to see an examination of care for the elderly in other parts of the world.

Not all nursing homes are the same, said Gibb-Carsley, “but the problem is the standards and the expectations across the board are very low.” The system tolerates that, she said, “because there aren’t enough resources to go around.”

Drew hopes what the pandemic revealed about elder care will be a catalyst for change. “It’s such a fragile system. And so how do we fix it?”

RCMP said in a release that around 6 a.m. on July 11 a dog alerted two teens to an object on the beach below the 800 block of Bayview Road.

The teens went to a nearby home for help, and the homeowner contacted RCMP.

According to police, the remains were in “an advanced state of decomposition.”

The BC Coroners Service said the remains were partial, which is likely the result of being in the water for some time, which leads to disarticulation – something the Coroners Service said they’ve seen with body parts found on shorelines in the past.

“This has happened in past investigations with feet we found on shorelines across the province in the past decade and a half,” Andy Watson of the Coroners Service told Coast Reporter.

RCMP said they will be looking into outstanding missing person files as they work with the Coroners Service to attempt to identity the remains and Watson said a forensic identification specialist is being brought in to perform DNA testing on the remains.

He said the investigation is still in the early stages so there’s little other information they can release.

RCMP also said on Monday that a social media post from author and artist Douglas Coupland on July 10, the day before the grisly discovery, showing what appeared to be part of a human leg on a beach and tagged “Roberts Creek,” was an unfortunate coincidence.

In a letter, the Canadian Mental Health Association’s North Shore executive director Julia Kaisla asks mayors Linda Buchanan, Mike Little and Mary-Ann Booth to be accountable.

article continues below

“The North Shore has been experiencing a growing housing crisis for 10 years. Despite task forces and committees to discuss actions, little has happened to provide the kind of housing we need,” she wrote. “The housing we lack more than any other: supported, low barrier, harm reduction-based housing.”

Kaisla said she was inspired to write the letter after seeing drastic measures taken by government in response to COVID-19, while non-profits and social service agencies have been left to deal with the pandemic and a worsening overdose crisis on their own.

“We got to a point where a lot of people are going to die,” Kaisla said.

While most North Shore residents have been able to stay comfortably home, people experiencing homelessness have been forced to stay in “overcrowded, decrepit, infested rooming houses, encampments, and in a temporary shelter filled to capacity.”

“Somehow, this combination of terrible has become the low-barrier housing solution in our community. It is not good enough,” Kaisla wrote. “What is most unsettling and harmful is our complacency with their death and poverty, and the privilege of the status quo that many are so desperate to maintain.”

The letter is co-signed by Paul Harmon, manager of the Lookout Housing and Health Society’s North Shore Housing Centre, and by Sandra Edelman, chair of the North Shore Homelessness Task Force.

There is provincial funding on the table right now, Kaisla said, but she hasn’t seen any of the North Shore’s local governments attempt to meet them halfway. The sticking points, she feels, are NIMBYism and unwillingness to put up municipally owned land.

“We have three municipalities that don’t want to be the only one giving up land or taking unpopular actions in some people’s eyes. It’s a lot of passing the buck,” she said.

Kaisla acknowledged the challenge of getting a neighbourhood to accept low-barrier housing but, she argued, the people in need of a home are already here.

“We’re asking for a compassionate response,” she said. “It is going to create safety for the whole community.”

City of North Vancouver Mayor Linda Buchanan said she understands Kaisla’s frustration because she feels it too.

“I feel extremely saddened that people are living in our communities who have no other options,” she said.

Kaisla’s letter was dated a week after the City of North Vancouver council adopted a motion from Buchanan calling for the creation of a new North Shore cross-jurisdictional working group to find short, medium- and long-term actions to prevent homelessness and offer people a way out of it.

“We are certainly motivated and dedicated and had taken action prior to receiving [the letter] and the three mayors including myself and my council are committed to doing that,” Buchanan said. “I don’t want a lot of time spent on researching this and that. This is very action oriented. We need to be moving forward. We need to be finding a site. We need to be co-ordinating that with health services,” Buchanan said.

Still, that will take some effort, so city council voted July 13 to reallocate $228,000 from other projects to temporarily hire someone to oversee the work. Buchanan said all levels of government need to be at the table and choosing which land “makes the most sense.” The province has been buying land and older hotels to provide housing elsewhere in the Lower Mainland, Buchanan said, and it’s time they did that on the North Shore too, she added.

West Vancouver council voted to join the working group on July 6.

“Really, this is going to force us to do some things that we should have done a long time ago,” said West Vancouver Mayor Mary-Ann Booth.

But, Booth added, solving homelessness is more complicated than finding available land in the short term, as the same people will also likely need wraparound health services that the province can’t download onto municipalities.

“We’ve got a big problem and it’s not just up to the municipalities to solve it. In fact, it’s not even our jurisdiction,” she said. “We don’t have that much land and we don’t have that much money, and so our position is that we’re willing to be part of the solution, but we don’t have the resources to be the solution.”

The Mounties say in a release that four people were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, including a Calgary man who was driving the westbound semi.

Police say there were heavy brake marks at the scene, and they believe the semi crossed into the oncoming lane after the driver failed to safely make a turn on the highway.

The truck flipped onto its side and skidded down the highway before striking the five other vehicles travelling eastbound.

Police say the driver has been charged with crossing a double line under the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.

The Mounties say speed may have been a factor in the crash but there's no evidence to suggest impaired driving was involved.

Only 16 per cent of businesses were confident in B.C.'s restart plan and 47 per cent were not.

Two-thirds of those surveyed were relying on some form of government support and owners were braced for a ""second wave"" of shutdowns or other problems if programs expire too quickly.

Some 28 per cent believed they'll return to normal once programs end, 32 per cent expected to cut workers' hours, 27 per cent anticipated layoffs, and one business in every 10 forecast either temporary or permanent closure.

Owners say payroll and wage supports must remain key components of B.C.'s recovery plan, along with fee and tax cuts.

The survey also identified expectations that the province must create better investment conditions.

The joint study by researchers at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, University of B.C., LifeLabs and public health scientists is posted on the health research website medRxiv and a news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday morning.

article continues below

The authors say the findings indicate successful suppression of community transmission in B.C., with an estimated overall infection rate of less than one per cent.

The study looked at anonymous blood samples collected for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 by LifeLabs in March and May, before and after public health measures were introduced.

The first samples in March found two of 869 specimens were positive, for a prevalence of 0.28 per cent, while the May sample found a prevalence of 0.55 per cent.

Health Minister Adrian Dix described the estimated infection rate as ""very low"" and says it shows the effectiveness of British Columbia's public health measures and co-operation of the public.

""It reinforces the fact that we're on the right track,"" Dix says.

""Of course, this is as the study suggests a dual-edged question, a low level of transmission but also very few people with antibodies to deal with potential future spikes of COVID-19.""

If the study's prevalence rate is applied to the whole provincial population, it could mean about 28,000 people have had the novel coronavirus, while 3,149 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed to date, however Dix noted the results are specific to the Vancouver area.

Health officials have repeatedly said that more people have been infected with the virus than have tested positive and Dix calls the estimated prevalence rate in B.C. ""encouraging.""

""Overall the level of infection in B.C. was low and that's due to the actions of people in B.C. That said, there are more people who were infected with COVID-19 than tested positive and that's something we've said clearly, especially in the period of March and April when we were focusing our testing program particularly on specific groups including health-care workers,"" Dix says.

The study is the first of its kind in Canada, he says.

The study is also important because it involved people who did not self-select for COVID-19 testing, so they likely didn't believe they had the virus, Dix says.

The study was authorized by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university. It has not yet been peer reviewed.

British Columbia recorded 21 new cases Wednesday and no new deaths. There are 207 active cases while 2,753 people who tested positive have recovered, the government said in a news release.

""The ruin of the First Nations and peoples of Canada is not just statistics. As seen here, it is real pain,"" Justice Chris Martin said in a written decision delivered July 10.

article continues below

Anthony McKay was sentenced to four years after pleading guilty to manslaughter in the death of his mother, Shirley McKay. He faces two years behind bars, after receiving credit for time already served, and will be subject to three years of supervised probation after that.

""As a human, Mrs. McKay deserved better. And, like anyone born in this bountiful country, her son, her killer, deserved a better start, a better chance, in life,"" Martin wrote.

The judge said the killing on the Berens River First Nation, about 300 kilometres north of Winnipeg, was a ""calamity of almost 150 years of government policy, actions and inactions affecting the Indigenous community.""

Anthony McKay, who was 21 at the time, went to his mother's home after a night of drinking on June 22, 2018.

Court was told there was blood everywhere when a cousin came over about 8 a.m. The cousin found Shirley McKay unconscious and badly beaten. Her son has said he doesn't know why he viciously beat her.

The woman was taken to a nursing station before being transported to a hospital in Winnipeg. Her son visited her in hospital daily and was overheard at her bedside sobbing and apologizing.

Court heard he was confronted by a stepbrother and admitted that he had hurt his mother.

Shirley McKay died that September. Her son was arrested the following month.

""She did not recover and died months later, another victim in a mass of slain Aboriginal women,"" Martin said. ""He pled guilty to manslaughter, joining an appalling line of young Aboriginals ending up in prison.""

Crown prosecutors were asking for a seven-year sentence in a federal penitentiary. The defence asked for two years behind bars plus the probation so that McKay could have access to programming available in provincial custody.

The judge pointed to impacts of colonization, the pass system which restricted Indigenous Peoples' movement, residential schools and the '60s Scoop in his sentencing.

""It is well accepted that the government's role, since the early days of dealing with First Nations peoples, has had the effect of isolating, infantilizing, marginalizing, and traumatizing Indigenous societies like the Ojibwa (or Anishinaabe) of Berens River,"" Martin wrote.

""Mr. McKay is a person shaped by a system historically designed to 'take the Indian out of the Indian.'""

Reports provided to the judge on McKay's background said he has partial fetal alcohol syndrome.

One of 13 siblings, he spent most of his time in foster homes on the First Nation or more often in Winnipeg. His parents struggled with alcohol and sniffing substances, and McKay followed a similar path starting when he was 13. His father died in 2010.

McKay was neglected and not cared for, files from child and family services said. He asked to become a permanent ward of child welfare in 2013 because he didn't feel safe with his family.

Martin said McKay's troubled upbringing doesn't excuse his behaviour, but does help explain why he is who he is.

Occasionally it is incumbent on a judge to underscore systemic issues, he said, adding Indigenous people are disproportionately affected by serious crime and disproportionately incarcerated.

""Like so many other cases, this case is troubling, not only for its specific facts, but because it reminds that core issues affecting many in the Indigenous population are not really being addressed sufficiently or urgently enough,"" Martin wrote.

""Many in this and the next generation of Indigenous people are at risk.""

The Montreal environmental activist says in a Facebook post shared Wednesday that he is apologetic for saying in a June 23 debate that police should be forced to pay $20 to every person of colour they stop, as compensation for the trauma and an incentive for police to think twice before stopping someone.

Montreal lawyer Meryam Haddad, who is also running for the leadership, told Perceval-Maxwell during the debate that the comment was ""super racist.""

Perceval-Maxwell said in his Facebook statement that putting the dollar figure out there was a mistake but also shared the Oxford dictionary definition of racism to defend himself.

""According to this definition, my idea was not 'racist' as was claimed during that debate,"" he said. The idea is not prejudiced or antagonistic against members of minority groups, he said.

He said he agrees that he should not have included a specific dollar figure on compensation, and said he has apologized many times for the comment. He also said that attacking people who are not ""actively"" engaged in oppression is how genocides happen.

Perceval-Maxwell added that his ""dear Jewish mother"" survived the Holocaust by hiding in a garbage can in Hungary and that he firmly believes ""standing up for the rights of all regardless of race and class is the thing we have to do.""

In its written statement, the Green party said it expects ""those who are called out for making discriminatory statements will reflect, learn and commit to doing better.""

""The party respects every individual’s right of free speech but we will not provide a platform to normalize racism and discrimination,"" the statement says. ""We are committed to creating a forum where contestants can debate the solutions that Canada needs to survive and thrive in the 21st century.""

Haddad told The Canadian Press she knows the party got many complaints about the comments and that she is happy to see the party take quick and decisive action.

""It shows that our organization will just not tolerate someone who makes racist comments,"" she said.

Haddad also said Perceval-Maxwell's attempts to apologize are not thorough enough.

""When people that live racism tell him that it's a racist comment, like he should apologize and he never apologized properly,"" she said. ""He apologized for me to feel that way.""

Perceval-Maxwell acknowledged many people do not think his apologies are full and sincere. He said he is relieved to not be in the race any more because he can now get more sleep and exercise.

There remain nine people in the contest to find a permanent successor for Elizabeth May. The race will be decided by online and mail-in ballots this fall. The winner is to be announced the first weekend of October.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf confirmed the news in a tweet earlier today.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that had been set to expire July 21.

The extension comes with COVID-19 resurgent across the U.S. — cases are on the rise in all 50 states, and southern states like Florida, Arizona and California are facing a fresh crisis with overcrowded hospital wards, refrigerated truck trailers serving as makeshift morgues and another shortage of personal protective medical gear.

The escalating emergency has also exposed a deep divide between Canadians dead-set against reopening the border and U.S. lawmakers in northern border states who continue to press both countries for a blueprint for doing exactly that.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the extent of the pandemic in the U.S. a ""constantly evolving"" situation, but won't say whether officials have considered extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

""Based on the success of the existing restrictions and close collaboration with Mexico and Canada, (the Department of Homeland Security) will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico until Aug. 20,"" Wolf tweeted.

The firm, now known as Norda Stelo Inc., gave the money to both the Liberals and Conservatives, including to candidates and riding associations, between 2004 and 2011.

The Commissioner of Canada Elections says the investigation didn't turn up any evidence the federal parties knew the money represented illegal indirect contributions from companies.

Most of the money has now been returned and the firm will pay upwards of $139,000 to the government and has also instituted a series of internal reforms to guard against further breaches.

The commissioner released the information today along with a series of findings about two other entities that didn't comply with election financing rules in the last federal election.

One, the United Conservative Party of Alberta, handed out free bumper stickers campaigning against the Liberal prime minister, and the second was labour union Unifor, which held a pancake breakfast to support a local NDP candidate.

Mohammed Shahed, a member of the governing party who regularly appeared on TV talk shows, was arrested Wednesday by the Rapid Action Battalion near the Indian border after a nine-day manhunt.

article continues below

Shahed is chairman of the Regent Group and owner of two Regent hospitals in the capital, Dhaka.

Abdul Baten, a commissioner of the Detective Branch in Dhaka, said Shahed admitted after his arrest that his hospitals did not have proper equipment to conduct coronavirus tests.

A court in Dhaka on Thursday allowed investigators to keep Shahed in custody for 10 days for questioning.

Officials said the hospitals had issued more than 10,000 coronavirus test results and about 60% were fake even though patients were charged for them. The hospitals allegedly arranged for the remaining tests to be conducted by another hospital.

The two hospitals had not renewed their medical licenses for years, but the Ministry of Health nevertheless signed a deal with Shahed to dedicate the hospitals to coronavirus testing and treatment as the number of cases rose in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh on Thursday was nearing 200,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 2,496 deaths. Public health experts say the actual number is much higher because only about 70 testing facilities are available in the country of 160 million people.

Shahed belongs to the governing Awami League party headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and is a member of its foreign affairs subcommittee. He has more than 50 illegal cases pending against him across the country on various charges including forgery and cheating.

Another doctor and her husband were also arrested recently on similar charges of falsifying test results.

Local media reports say the scams could hurt Bangladesh’s earnings from overseas workers. Last week, Italy suspended all flights from Bangladesh to Rome after some Bangladeshis reportedly presented fake negative test reports for the coronavirus.

Bangladesh earns about $19 billion a year from about 10 million overseas workers. Authorities said about 15,000 Bangladeshi workers with jobs in Italy remain stranded in Bangladesh and it is unclear whether they will be able to travel to the European country.

Bangladesh has reopened businesses including its main export-earning garment sector after a monthslong closure.",[]

The Anti-Defamation league and some Jewish leaders had condemned what they called anti-Semitic theories expressed by Cannon and demanded the apology.

article continues below

""First and foremost I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin,"" Cannon said on his Twitter account.

""They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people and I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from. The video of this interview has since been removed.""

ViacomCBS cut ties with the TV host and producer Tuesday in response to his comments on a podcast where he discussed racial bias.

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s associate dean, told The Associated Press that Cannon reached out to him Wednesday and during a 30-minute telephone conversation he apologized to the Jewish community and Cooper asked him to post it on social media.

""He started out the right way, he said the right things. Half an hour is a long time, and we'll probably meet tomorrow in the LA area,"" Cooper said.

""He understood that the words and references that he thought were based on fact, turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric.""

The TV host and producer wrote earlier a lengthy Facebook post defending himself and criticizing his firing for what the company deemed ""bigotry"" and ""anti-Semitism,"" prominent members of the U.S. Jewish community said the post fell well short and demanded an apology.

""It’s not enough to say, ‘I’m not a racist, I’m not a bigot,’"" Cooper had told the AP earlier. ""The statements he made are hurtful, and they’re false.""

Cooper said Cannon should read and heed the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who ""dedicated his life for civil rights for all and a colour-blind America."" Cooper also had advised him to seek out the guidance of basketball Hall of Famer-turned-writer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has condemned several sports and entertainment celebrities for anti-Semitic posts.

In the hour-plus episode of ""Cannon's Class"" released last month that prompted his firing, Cannon and Richard ""Professor Griff"" Griffin, formerly of the rap group Public Enemy, contended that Black people are the true Hebrews and Jews have usurped that identity.

Cannon then argued that lighter-skinned people — ""Jewish people, white people, Europeans"" — ""are a little less"" and have a ""deficiency"" that historically caused them to act out of fear and commit acts of violence to survive.

""They had to be savages,"" he said.

""When I first heard about the comments Mr. Cannon made, it was very, very disappointing,"" said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. ""We’re in a time where hatred of all kinds is very much apparent. It’s in the news every day.""

""Anti-Semitism in particular over the past several years has been something that we've seen in increase , as well as racism and other issues,"" Segal added. ""So when you hear an individual who has a public profile, who has influence over people, make statements that are highly offensive to the Jewish community, the first reaction is disappointment.""

Anti-Semitic violent attacks rose worldwide by 18% in 2019 compared with the previous year, according to a report published in April by Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary Jewry.

Segal said some members of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement see themselves as the true ""chosen people,"" and believe that Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans are the true descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel. He noted that not all spew hateful rhetoric, although many adhere to an extreme set of anti-Semitic beliefs.

Bruce D. Haynes, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Davis, who has been studying Black Jews for more than two decades, agreed that the remarks echo the ideas of extreme Black Hebrew Israelites and of Minister Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who last year referenced ""Satanic Jews"" in a speech denying allegations of anti-Semitism. But Haynes took a more nuanced view.

""The danger is that those groups get confused with other self-identified Israelites like (Rabbi) Capers Funnye, who has a congregation in Chicago, and who is very much involved with the Ashkenazim Jewish community. So I want to make clear that the term 'Israelites' is a tricky term,"" he said.

""Is it anti-Semitic to say Black people are the real Israelites or the real Jews? I’m not sure I’d call it anti-Semitism,"" Haynes said. ""It’s not a good reading of history, but I wouldn’t call it anti-Semitism. On the other hand, some of those groups that call Jews impostors certainly cross the line.""

Until his firing, Cannon produced ""Wild ’n Out,"" a comedy improv series for VH1, the ViacomCBS-owned cable channel.

In an earlier Facebook post, he had said that he welcomes being held accountable and takes responsibility for his words, while also accusing the company of trying to silence an ""outspoken black man"" and demanding full ownership of the ""Wild ’n Out"" brand.

""I do not condone hate speech nor the spread of hateful rhetoric. ... The Black and Jewish communities have both faced enormous hatred, oppression persecution and prejudice for thousands of years and in many ways have and will continue to work together to overcome these obstacles,"" he wrote.

Cooper had said that Cannon should reject Farrakhan’s hate speech and ""reduce the long statement to two sentences"" — a simple apology, which he did after their conversation.

""I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal. My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community"" Cannon tweeted.

""On my podcast I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community For this I am deeply sorry but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.""

""My hope is that this series can be a place to explore meaningful topics together and sort through so many of the questions we’re all trying to answer in our own lives,"" Obama said in a statement.

The new podcast is the first title in the ongoing collaboration between Spotify and Higher Ground, a production company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama. Last year, the former president and first lady partnered with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform.

Michelle Obama’s new podcast expects to hold candid and personal conversations with a focus on topics concerning relationships and health. She expects to have several guests on the series including talk-show host Conan O’Brien and Valerie Jarrett, business woman and former senior advisor to Barack Obama.

""Perhaps most of all, I hope this podcast will help listeners open up new conversations — and hard conversations —- with the people who matter most to them,"" she said. ""That’s how we can build more understanding and empathy for one another.""

Obama released her Netflix documentary ""Becoming"" in May. The project was an extension of her 2018 bestselling memoir of the same name and a kind of authorized filmic portrait of Obama.

The Census Bureau reported Thursday that retail sales are 1.1% higher than their levels from a year ago, after a brutal plunge in March and April was offset by a decent rebound in May and June. But any gains might be short-lived as infections began to rise toward the end of June.

""While today’s report gives the illusion of a fearless consumer spending lavishly, the reality is more sobering: consumers are increasingly fearful amid new spikes in COVID-19 cases and a looming fiscal cliff,"" said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

The report shows how shoppers and businesses are adjusting to life in a pandemic, changing their habits in hopes of halting an illness that can quickly flare-up and wreak financial havoc.

Bars in Texas shuttered again at the end of last month as infections surged in that state. Pennsylvania this week ordered that restaurants can only seat 25% of their potential customers. Gap, Kohl’s and other stores are withdrawing clothes worn in their changing rooms from sales floors for several days as a precautionary move. Adding to all this pressure are signs that the recovery in consumer spending began to stall at the end of last month, according to analysis of credit cards by the bank JPMorgan Chase.

""I suspect the modest pullback we have seen in our card spending data since late June is driven by concern about the resurgence of COVID-19,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist with the bank.

June's retail numbers showed the complicated nature of an uncertain recovery.

Non-store sales—which includes online shopping—slumped 2.4% over the past month but are 23.5% higher from a year ago. Spending at restaurants and bars jumped 20% last month, but it's still down 26.3% from last year. Sales at clothiers more than doubled between May and June, yet they've collapsed 23.2% from a year ago.

Shoppers have responded by shifting their spending, and not only to online retailers. Sales at building materials stores were up 17.3% annually. Stores in the sporting goods, musical instrument, books and hobbies categories have enjoyed yearly growth of 20.6%. Purchases at grocers have increased 11.7% over the past year.",[]

The agreement will be presented Friday to the Superior Court of Quebec for approval to become the new so-called stalking horse bid for any rival offers that may be presented next month.

A lawyer representing Quebecor suggested last week that the media conglomerate intended to make a bid.

The shareholders — the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec — presented a US$420-million bid June 29 when Cirque filed for creditor protection. They were counting on a US$200-million loan from the Quebec government.

The shareholders and Cirque agreed to terminate the agreement, said a Cirque statement Thursday.

""The shareholder's proposed agreement, which had set the bar for other bids, assured a path to survival following the forced closure of all of the shows resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by providing the company funding, support, and a clear road map to relaunch,"" said the statement.

The lenders, who hold about $1 billion of the Cirque's secured debt, would inject up to $375 million, create a fund to retain employees and pay ex-workers and artisans, and maintain the company's head office in Montreal, according to a source familiar with the matter, but who is not allowed to speak publicly.

""The co-operation of the group of creditors has been extraordinary in order to achieve our objective of recapitalizing the Cirque,"" Gabriel de Alba, the managing director and partner of Catalyst Capital Group, the main creditor, said in a statement.

Deprived of income since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cirque cancelled its 44 shows and cut nearly 3,500 people.

The bank's report says 1.5 million women lost their jobs in the first two months of the pandemic.

The report found that women tend to work in industries hardest hit by the crisis, their employment level has been slower to rebound as the economy reopens and they are more likely to fall out of the workforce in the long-term.

The study says one-third of women who lost jobs between February and June did not seek work, putting them at higher risk of long term job-separation and future wage penalties.

Employment among women with toddlers or school-aged children fell seven per cent between February and May, compared with a four-per cent decrease for fathers of children the same age.

Single mothers with a toddler or school-aged child saw their employment drop 12 per cent between February and June, compared with a seven per cent decrease for single fathers.

The study says women accounted for about 45 per cent of the decline in hours worked over the downturn, but will only make up 35 per cent of the recovery.

The Toronto-based miner says gold production in the three months ended June 30 fell by about eight per cent to 1.149 million ounces from 1.25 million in the previous quarter, mainly due to COVID-19 related disruptions at its Veladero mine in Argentina.

It warns that second quarter gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce are expected to be seven to nine per cent higher than in the first quarter, while copper costs are to rise by four to six per cent.

Barrick says the average market price for gold in the second quarter was US$1,711 per ounce, up from its realized price of US$1,589 per ounce in the first quarter.

Copper production, meanwhile, rose to 120 million pounds from 115 million in the first quarter, and the average market price was US$2.43 per pound, up from a realized price of US$2.23 in the first quarter.

CEO Mark Bristow says Barrick is positioned well to achieve its guidance for the year.

In May, 2020 gold guidance was adjusted lower by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and five million ounces to account for the suspension of its Porgera gold mine amid a dispute with the federal government in Papua New Guinea.

He picked himself up, fought his way out from the deck’s underbelly and around to the front of the house where he located his wife. He was covered in dirt and blood and branches and scratches.

“Nancy, I’ve had a bit of a tumble,” he announced. He was still carrying the planter.

“He was really a strong guy, and just had boundless energy,” says Nancy. How did he bounce right up, at that age, after a fall like that? There was a phrase that Mike, a well-known coach and teacher on the North Shore, used for such occasions: “tuck and roll.”

His daughter Megan Frederick laughs as she remembers the famous phrase.

“We’d have a fondue dinner and the fondue would catch fire and he’d just pick it up, flames coming up his arms, and he’d just say ‘tuck and roll!’”

Mike almost never got sick or injured, and when he did he would never take medication.

“He would just ‘hunker down,’” says Nancy. “And his response, if you were worried, was he’d say ‘I’m alright. I’m alright, I’m alright, I’m alright.’”

Walk it off. Tuck and roll. Hunker down. Those guiding principles powered Mike through 90 years of a remarkable life in which he followed passions ranging from rugby to musical theatre to lifeguarding to sign language, all the while providing a strong support system for thousands of students and athletes across the North Shore.

He stuck to his strengths, even when a global pandemic hit.

It seems a little odd to say that someone who died when they were 90 years old is “gone too soon,” but that’s exactly how Mike Smith’s family feels. So strong, so supportive, so resilient all his life, even into his 90s. And then came COVID-19, and the way his family tells it, he hit this challenge the way he tackled every other one in his life. This, however, was finally an affliction that wouldn't allow him to just walk it off.

A passion for coaching

It’s tough to find true Vancouverites – it seems almost everyone around here came from somewhere else – but you can’t get any more true blue Vancouver than Mike Smith. Born in Vancouver in 1930, he grew up swimming and playing football and rugby for Kitsilano High and then the University of British Columbia. At age 14 he worked in a logging camp on Vancouver Island, while other summer jobs included driving a taxi around Vancouver and working on a whaling ship off the coasts of Japan and Russia.

Safer summer employment came from his swimming expertise, as Mike worked as a lifeguard at Ambleside Pool and at beaches across Vancouver. It was while lifeguarding at Spanish Banks that he met Marlene Wright and it was “love at first sight.” They married and had three kids: sons David and Paddy and daughter Megan. Mike and Marlene were married 35 years, until Marlene’s death in 1991. In 1994 Mike married Nancy (Herman) Parker, and they lived together in West Vancouver for 25 years.

Mike’s teaching career began at Vancouver’s Jericho Hill School for the Deaf where he learned sign language as well as lip reading, a skill he claimed helped him as a coach later in life. He moved over to West Vancouver’s Ecole Pauline Johnson in 1956, the start of a North Shore teaching career that included a long stint at Hillside Secondary, where he became vice-principal, and later at West Van Secondary where he taught until retirement. A common thread through it all was his passion for coaching.

Mike kept mementos from old teams, books in his basement full of rosters and plays and practice plans. On a recent sunny summer afternoon Nancy and Megan sat flipping through the pages of an album filled with team photos. There’s the Jericho Hill basketball team, 1952. In that photo Mike looks like a strapping young student himself. There’s Pauline Johnson gymnastics, 1956. There’s the first ever Hillside rugby team, 1957-'58. There’s the year Hillside junior rugby won the prestigious Province Cup, 1961. The pics go on for decades. There’s Hillside senior basketball, 1981, with Mike sporting a natty cardigan.

At West Van Secondary he helped form the school’s first-ever girls rugby team. Long after retiring as a teacher he stuck around the field, helping coach wherever he was needed.

In 2001, Mike became the first ever coach recognized for 50 years of service by the North Shore Secondary Schools Athletics Association. He was there when the NSSSAA was formed in 1958, acting as the association’s first secretary-treasurer while his friend and Hillside co-coach Gary Sinclair served as the first president, a role Mike later filled as well.

He was head of grounds and equipment for the annual North Shore track and field meet, which used to be held on the cinder track at Empire Stadium where all the lanes had to be lined out with whiting. Mike was always there, always ready.

Bill McKitrick, who coached and taught alongside Mike for decades, was just 23 when he first met him. He was assigned to Hillside as a student teacher, and the first face he saw when he walked through the door was Mike Smith.

“Mike was in the foyer, so I introduced myself to him and he said ‘I think I’m going to be your sponsor teacher,” McKitrick recalls. “He sort of took me under his wing right away. That was quite reassuring.”

McKitrick remembers Mike as a man of incredible youthful energy. He was surprised one day to hear Mike grumbling about “getting too old” to take another swim test to renew his lifeguarding certification.

“I said ‘what do you mean? How old are you?’ He told me he was 43. Well, I thought he was 30.”

Mike never lost that vigorous enthusiasm for coaching, and hundreds of young athletes were enriched by that, says McKitrick.

“He was a real straight shooter, looking out for the best interest of the students and the school always,” he says. “The teams that he coached were always strong teams, and I don’t mean like they were super athletes or anything like that. They were well coached, the students respected their opposition. He was not one to pat himself on the back or build himself up or blow his own horn. … It was all about the team and representing the school well. I think the kids learned a lot from that.”

His standard attire, which he often wore even while acting as vice-principal, was pure sporty goodness: running shorts, whistle, clipboard in hand and pencil behind the ear.

“He was very good as a coach – I learned a lot from him,” says McKitrick. “He was very much a team member, and he expected that basically from everyone that was in the athletic department. And it was a great athletic department – everyone just got along really well. … I just watched how he dealt with the department, how he dealt with colleagues, how he dealt with students. It was not necessarily out of a textbook – just things you learn as a young teacher, a young coach, and you try to model that.”

Musicals and marathons

There was much more to Mike than just coaching though. He sang in all the school musicals and was a lifetime subscriber to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. A childhood stamp collection inspired him to become a geography teacher. He was the catcher on the school slo-pitch team and later took up marathon running, breaking off on epic training runs with his little terrier Sadie, who often tuckered out and would be scooped up and carried much of the way home.

He was 64 when he married Nancy.

“I knew him mainly as a history and geography teacher, a music lover and a constant reader,” she says. “He was a great travelling companion because he was interested in everything and he had so much energy.”

He and Nancy tended their fabulous backyard garden well into his 80s, and just last fall, though he was suffering from Lewy body dementia, which can affect a person's thinking, movement, behaviour and mood, he was still singing with the Londoners, a multi-generational choir that often would entertain seniors in care homes.

A fall put him into Lions Gate Hospital earlier this year while the pandemic was still a frightening mystery that was far from figured out. He caught COVID-19 there, on the hospital’s fourth floor.

“Mike, oh my God, he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,” says Nancy. There’s still anger, confusion, sadness in her voice as she describes what happened to her husband. After he was diagnosed, he was moved to a care home and then bounced right back to Lions Gate a few days later. Through it all, the family was banned from physically visiting him due to COVID-19 restrictions. Megan’s last contact with her dad was as he was being loaded into an ambulance for his final trip to the hospital.

“I called out to him, and he stopped and looked for [me]. I was keeping my distance, so I said ‘I'm over here, dad.’ And then I go, ‘can you hear me?’ And he nods.”

The family says he was not admitted into the intensive care unit when he was taken back to the hospital, instead quickly sent to palliative care. They fought for more urgent care for him, but to no avail. Mike was deemed to be unresponsive. Looking back now, Megan and Nancy say they know what Mike was trying to do as COVID-19 was shutting his body down.

Walk it off.

Tuck and roll.

Hunker down.

“All of his strength and determination really worked against him, kept him silent and not taking medication and just in survival mode,” says Nancy, adding that convalescing was never Mike’s style. “He never was in bed. Never. … He wasn’t going to survive in bed with an oxygen tube in his nose.”

The restrictions of COVID-19 made everything infinitely harder for the family.

“What was so tough was dealing with all these doctors and not being able to be there in person,” says Megan.

“Everyone was in a complete panic mode,” adds Nancy. “It’s just really unfortunate that that happened to him.”

Mike died April 2, 2020. Ninety years of extraordinary life, ended by COVID-19.

“It was very sad that it was the virus that took him,” says Megan. “It didn’t seem appropriate. In his life, nothing kept him down in bed.”

Mike Smith leaves behind eight grandchildren, a great-granddaughter, and countless other friends and family members. COVID-19 restrictions have also denied the family a chance to hold a proper memorial service for Mike.

The family has taken great comfort, however, from comments left on an online obituary page for Mike. The comments come from students and teaching colleagues, coaches and friends, neighbours, choir members, and even an old lifeguard from the 1950s.

“Mr. Smith was an important part of my formative years as a kid growing up in West Van,” writes a former student. “He taught me to swim at age five and instilled a sense of self-confidence that I could do what, at that time, I thought was impossible.”

There are dozens of comments [see below for more], all adding together to colour in a picture of a man who touched many lives.

The family has set up the Mike Smith Memorial Scholarship Fund through the West Vancouver Foundation. The post-secondary scholarship will go to a graduating student in the West Vancouver public school system who “demonstrates enthusiastic participation in school athletics, including good sportsmanship and service to school.”

It’s a fitting legacy for a fine man, says Nancy.

“Mike never hesitated to help other people,” she says.

“He had the time for anybody, no matter the skill,” adds Megan. “If you were willing to put the work in and be a good teammate, there was always room for you on the team.”

Mike Smith remembered

Here is a selection of comments, edited by the North Shore News, left on Mike Smith’s online obituary page:

“Not tall in stature but had a giant presence,” writes a student. “I can still see him hustling down the hall with clipboard in hand and a whistle around his neck!”

“Will miss his bright smile and twinkly blue eyes, he always cheered up a rainy day,” writes a choir mate. “He was much loved by everyone. He always threatened to sing rugby songs but was never allowed to.”

“I worked with Mike in the '50s as a lifeguard,” writes an old friend. “He had the Vancouver Sun delivered to old Locarno Bath House and heaven help ANYONE who touched it before him!”

“He was one of the nicest guys I ever met,” writes a fellow coach. “Always positive always smiling. He loved being out in the field which explains why he did it for over 50 years. Mike’s contribution to youth is enormous and he inspired us all.”

“He was my homeroom teacher in Grade 9 and I have two vivid memories of him,” another student writes. “First of all, he had such fine perfect handwriting, which didn’t seem to go with his big physique. The second was a class assignment to complete a job study, and mine became my lifelong occupation.”

“Mr. Smith was my VP in the early ‘80s,” writes another student. “He got me back on track and believed in me when I didn’t. He was a great leader and cared. Rest In Peace, sir.”",[]

Many Canadian kids grew up with some variation of bubble hockey in their basement or local arcade, a game in which plastic players attached to swivelling and sliding rods battled for the puck while gliding up and down the mini rink in fixed slots. The Hollyburn Huskies, a hockey association attached to the private Hollyburn Country Club, has taken that idea out of the arcade and onto the ice for a new version of hockey for the COVID-19 era.

article continues below

For the month of July, youth players from the club are taking part in the Hollyburn Summer 3 on 3 League – Bubble Hockey Edition, with rules that mimic bubble hockey in that players must stick in their own lanes, eliminating any chance of physical contact between players. Other rules encourage quick puck movement and lots of shots on goal, resulting in a fun and fast-paced game that the players are loving, said Hollyburn hockey director Adam Hayduk.

“Our little experiment has been a huge hit with the players and it will help develop skills that maybe weren’t priorities for some in ‘normal hockey,’” he said. “It has been very interesting to watch how players adapt to new rules and begin to figure things out on their own to gain an advantage.”

Hollyburn's modified 'bubble hockey' setup features six zones drawn onto the ice with buffer areas between each zone, eliminating contact. Each player must stay in their zone and must pass or shoot within five seconds of receiving the puck. photo Hollyburn Huskies

The basics of the game are that each team has three skaters and a goalie on the ice. The rink is divided into vertical zones, three on each half of the ice, with buffer areas between each zone so there is no chance of contact. Leaving your zone results in a penalty shot for the other team. Attacking players occupy the outside two zones while a central defender and goalie play defence down the middle, basically making all attacking situations a two-on-one. To force the action, a rule is in place that requires players to pass or shoot the puck in five seconds or less.

“There are many races for the puck,” said Hayduk. “Players have used deception and look-a-ways to try to fool the defender and goalie. Transitions happen very quickly up-ice – players are forced to look up-ice for stretch passes. … There is a lot of offence and the scores have been very close. Goalies get plenty of shots.”

The association's coaches have all relished seeing the players back on the ice and enjoying the new game.

“We all felt that this would provide our players the competition and social connections they have been missing while putting players in a position to work on skills that will benefit them once hockey as we all know it is permitted to return,” said Hayduk. “I have been pleasantly surprised how much the kids enjoy the Bubble Hockey Edition of our three-on-three concept and just how competitive they have been playing it.”

Asked on a media conference call Monday whether Vancouver might get back in the picture, Colin Smith said FIFA was focused on the original three Canadian candidate cities.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

Matthews finished third in the NHL with a career-high 47 goals, one behind Maurice (Rocket) Richard Trophy co-winners Alex Ovechkin and David Pastrnak, while also topping the Maple Leafs with a career-best 80 points in 70 games.

The 22-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz., native also established a career-low with eight penalty minutes, tied for the fewest among the NHL's top 100 scorers. He did so while sharing second place in the League in takeaways (78) and ranking eighth among NHL forwards in total time on ice (1,467 minutes 52 seconds).

MacKinnon ranked fifth in the NHL with 93 points (35 goals, 58 assists) in 69 games to lead the Avalanche into the playoffs for the third consecutive season. The 24-year-old from Cole Harbour, N.S., registered a career-low 12 penalty minutes, the second-fewest among the league's top 25 scorers. No other NHL forward averaged more time on ice (21:13) in 2019-20 while taking fewer penalties.

O'Reilly led the reigning Stanley Cup champion Blues with 61 points (12 goals, 49 assists) in 71 games to power the team to the highest points percentage in the Western Conference.

The 18-year veteran quarterback headlines the Canadian Football Hall of Fame's 2020 class that was unveiled Thursday. Burris, 45, got the nod in his first year of eligibility, becoming just the 21st player ever to do so but second in as many years after Calgary running back Jon Cornish in 2019.

article continues below

Joining Burris in the player category are offensive linemen Clyde Brock and Freddie Childress and quarterback Greg Vavra. John Hufnagel, the Calgary Stampeders president/GM, and Larry Uteck (posthumously), the former head coach/athletic director at Saint Mary’s University, were both named as builders.

Burris's family — wife Nicole and sons Armand and Barron — had known of his induction since February but managed to keep quiet about it until about two and a half weeks ago when the Hall of Fame informed Burris. Even then, the Burris clan was very nonchalant in asking the former quarterback to take in what he thought was a run-of-the-mill video.

Instead, Burris watched Hall of Famer Damon Allen (2012) outline his pro football journey to Canada, which drew a rather bewildered look from Burris. Then Allen detailed Burris's stellar CFL career before Mark DeNobile, the Hall of Fame's executive director, delivered the big news.

And the player, affectionately dubbed Smilin' Hank because of his outgoing personality, was lost for words as tears streamed down his face.

""Yeah, they got me good,"" Burris said with a chuckle. ""What's funny is whenever I've told the boys to keep anything quiet, they've always gone back to their mother and yet they didn't say a peep about this.

""I was lost for words just because to hear it shows you that people appreciated the things you did throughout your career. This is the way for the league and all the organizations and the fans saying, 'Thank you,' and for me I'm humbled by it . . . there's so many guys in there (Hall of Fame) who I looked up to and now to be able to join them is a dream come true.""

The six-foot-one, 190-pound Burris, a native of Spiro, Okla., played 20 pro seasons, 18 in the CFL with the Calgary Stampeders (1997-99, 2005-11), Saskatchewan Roughriders (2000, 2003-04), Hamilton Tiger-Cats (2012-13) and Ottawa Redblacks (2014-16). Burris also spent time with the NFL's Green Bay Packers (2001) and Chicago Bears (2002).

Burris appeared in five Grey Cups, winning three (1998, '08, '16) and being named the MVP twice (2008, '16). The CFL's outstanding player on two occasions (2010, 2015), Burris amassed 63,639 passing yards and 373 TD passes — both third all-time.

Burris retired shortly after leading Ottawa to a thrilling 39-33 overtime Grey Cup upset win over Calgary. He threw for 461 yards and three TDs despite suffering a knee injury during warmups.

Burris said his Hall of Fame induction is as much a testament to his family's resilience and perseverance as it is his on-field accomplishments.

""I had to take my wife all over Canada, drag my kids all over Canada and force them to make new friends just for dad to be able to play this game called football,"" said Burris, whose family still calls Ottawa home. ""And for them to understand and see just the emotions that ran through me . . . it just shows how big that moment is, just kind of when your whole life flashes before you.""

Burris and the other inductees will have to wait for their day in the sun due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 class will be honoured alongside the 2021 inductees next August.

When Burris is formally honoured, he'll be joined by former teammate Childress and Hufnagel, who served as Calgary's head coach (2008-2015) before moving into the front office full-time. Burris won Grey Cups with both ('98 with Childress, '08 with Hufnagel).

""Calgary is a machine right now and it all started in 2008 when Huf came in and we got that Grey Cup in his first year,"" Burris said. ""Calgary has always had double-digit wins and been in the playoffs each and every year Huf has been there, they've always been a strong contender for the Grey Cup and there's one reason why.""

Hufnagel, a 68-year-old native of Coraopolis, Pa., spent 12 seasons as a CFL quarterback with Calgary (1976-79), Saskatchewan (1980-83, 1987) and Winnipeg (1984-86) before getting into coaching. A five-time Grey Cup champion, Hufnagel also earned a Super Bowl ring as an assistant with the New England Patriots (2003).

Hufnagel amassed a 102-42-1 record as Calgary's head coach, his .712 win percentage being the highest among coaches with more than 100 games. He's been named the CFL's coach of the year twice (2008, 2014).

Childress, a 53-year-old native of Little Rock, Ark., played 13 CFL seasons with Shreveport (1994), Birmingham (1995), Calgary (1996-03) and Saskatchewan (2004-06). A former second-round pick of the NFL's New England Patriots, Childress won two Grey Cups with the Stampeders (1998, 2001) and in 1998 was named the CFL's top offensive lineman.

Brock, 79, of Los Angeles, played 12 seasons with Saskatchewan (1964-75), helping the club win its first Grey Cup in 1966. The former Dallas Cowboy-San Francisco 49er appeared in 169 regular-season CFL games and four times was named a league all-star before being inducted into Saskatchewan's Plaza of Honour in 1995.

Vavra, 59, of Red Deer, Alta., helped the Calgary Dinos win the Vanier Cup in 1983, his final season at the school. That year, he also became the first player in the program's history to capture the Hec Crighton Trophy as Canadian university football's top player and still holds the U Sports record for most passing yards in a game (627).

Vavra was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders in 1984 and also spent time with the B.C. Lions (1986-87) and Edmonton Eskimos (1988).

After playing seven CFL seasons as a defensive back with Toronto (1974-76), B.C. (1977), Montreal (1978-80) and Ottawa (1980), Uteck became an assistant coach at Saint Mary’s University in 1982. He was promoted to head coach the following year, a position he held until 1997.

Over that span, Uteck was named the Atlantic University Athletic Association coach of the year five times and twice Canadian university football's top coach.

Uteck served as athletic director from 1995 to 2002 and the Huskies captured two Vanier Cups (2001-02). The native of Thornhill, Ont., passed away Dec. 25, 2002 of Lou Gehrig's disease at the age of 50.

The Atlantic Bowl was renamed the Uteck Bowl in 2003.

""Jaime played a critical role in the front office, simultaneously managing and executing high-level projects during her time with Toronto FC as it became a perennial MLS Cup contender, and I know she will be a great asset to the Crew as we continue to grow our ambitions and elevate the club in this new era.""

McMillan will oversee Columbus' administration and management in non-technical areas, including soccer operations administration, facilities and budgeting.

The Crew said her role ""will also include a focus on player and staff administration, academy administration and other club support areas.""

Toronto enjoys a reputation as one of MLS' best teams at helping players settle off the field, with McMillan leading the way.

McMillan joined Toronto in 2010 as co-ordinator for business operations. She went on to become senior manager of team development (2013-15), director of team development (2015-16) and director of administrations and operations (2016-18) before taking on the role of senior director of administration and operations.

Toronto won one MLS Cup (2017), one Supporters' Shield (2017) and six Canadian Championships (2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2007, 2018) during McMillan's tenure.

""Absolutely one (of) the best in the business,"" tweeted Toronto striker Jozy Altidore.

""Columbus Crew SC has been making some great moves. Jaime will make the entire organization better. Congrats Jaime!!!""

In fact, given that she’s one of the preeminent scribes of British Columbia’s history of murder, mayhem and the macabre, it makes perfect sense.

And now, the true crime writer has become a true crime podcaster herself.

article continues below

On Friday, Lazarus, a longtime North Vancouver resident, released the first episode of her new podcast, Cold Case Canada.

The podcast, which is slated for a 12-episode run in its first season and is available wherever you get your podcasts, is based off of Lazarus’s acclaimed 2015 work of non-fiction, Cold Case Vancouver, about some of the region’s most baffling unsolved murders.

Episode one of the podcast takes another look at a story that anyone who’s read her cold case book will remember well: the unsolved murder of Jennie Eldon Conroy.

Jennie was a 24-year-old born and raised North Vancouver resident who worked at the Shipyards and grain terminal during the war effort. It was 1944. Jennie had just finished her shift and had rushed home to her place in Lower Lonsdale to change before catching the bus to West Vancouver to visit her brother and family for a late Christmas dinner.

“She realized she’d missed it by one minute,” explains Lazarus.

Jennie decided to walk the seven kilometres instead. Although her murder has never been solved, the best guess is that she was picked up along the way by someone in a car – and her body was discovered the next day at the West Vancouver cemetery which, as Lazarus describes it, “is just that exit above Taylor Way, which is still pretty bleak and deserted now.”

In Lazarus’s new podcast, she recounts how North Vancouver Museum and Archives research archivist Daien Ide first brought the case of Jennie Eldon Conroy to her attention while she was first working on her book, which led to her becoming completely immersed in the case.

Of particular note, Lazarus has also re-interviewed Jennie’s niece, as well as the daughter she gave up her for adoption who now resides in New Zealand, for the podcast’s inaugural episode.

“I found Cold Case was a really tough book to write because it was unsolved murders. I found it really difficult, it’s taken me a really long time to revisit,” she says. “It’s a real obligation to me to get it right and be sensitive about it, and to get the story out. In Jennie’s case she was brutalized in the press after her murder – her family was brutalized because she was an unwed mother. Seventy-six years later, that’s still resonating with her daughter and with her children.”

Lazarus’s first foray into podcasting came last year, when she released a 12-episode series called Blood, Sweat and Fear, a show based on her similarly titled book from 2017 about forensic investigator John F.C.B. Vance, who was known internationally as Canada’s Sherlock Holmes.

“It became such a challenge, in a sense, just to take my work and put it on something completely different,” she says. “I liked writing for the ear.”

Her new podcast will feature at least five more North Shore individuals with connections to some of Vancouver’s most bizarre unsolved murders.

Lazarus has a new book, called Vancouver Exposed, set to be released this fall which is a scrapbook-style piece of non-fiction inspired by her popular blog and will feature snapshots of the city’s eccentric past – from nudist colony tales and buried houses, to belly-flop contests and more.

With her current podcast, however, she hopes to keep the dialogue going when it comes to some of these cases.

“Maybe some more information will come forward and maybe we’ll solve some of these cases. I really believe that a lot of them are still solvable,” she says.",[]

Navigating our way through COVID-19, the worst public health crisis in recent memory, would be unthinkable without the throngs of nurses, doctors, care aides and other health-care professionals leading the charge. And with many of us having spent the better part of the year holed up at home, neglecting in-person social contact and staying far enough away from the office, we’ve turned to the arts – to entertainment, to culture – as a necessary salve to get us through the long days.

As a former longtime nurse turned accomplished painter, North Vancouver resident Donna Giraud has straddled both worlds.

She started her nursing career in 2005, spending the next 14 years at busy St. Paul’s Hospital in Vancouver. For the first five years she was a bedside nurse, tending to the needs of patients experiencing all manner of different health crises, before becoming a head nurse in the hospital’s acute medicine ward.

“It was a lot,” she says, offering her solidarity with the nurses and other health-care workers who’ve spent months managing the pandemic right there on the front lines. “As a nurse, you’re a giver.”

But even before she started her nursing career, there were other parts of herself that Giraud felt compelled to give.

In nursing school, she would play around with the paintbrush in order to burn off some creative energy and steam after a long day.

“It turned out people were interested in what I was doing and then I started doing shows, started selling,” she says.

She was drawn to the abstract – paintings that don’t exactly say what they are, but hint at meaning by conjuring a mood, a feeling, a memory through non-linear textures, shapes and colours.

“My favourite thing about it is when somebody does say the actual emotion or the feeling or the theme that I intended on – for me to tell a story through my art that people can then interpret – I absolutely love it,” she says.

Three years ago Giraud decided to take a leap of faith and give herself over to the arts completely.

“I’d given so much of myself with the nursing for so many years,” she says.

She now co-runs an arts studio in Yaletown and her work has been featured in art shows around the world.

As fate would have it, her plans for her first official solo show in Vancouver were disrupted when everything shut down back in March due to the spread of novel coronavirus. But like any creatively-inclined person, she find away around it.

Her solo show, Lost and Found, which touched on the prescient themes of isolation and loss coupled with trying to figure things out, couldn’t be experienced in person due to quarantine restrictions – but Giraud used video footage and her website’s chat function to put on an interactive, virtual show.

Describing her work as large-scale abstract textural work, which is particularly influenced by the West Coast’s surrounding nature, Giraud has taken inspiration from our collective time in lockdown for her upcoming show.

In Together Is Always Better Giraud has drawn on the notion that COVID-19 is one thing we now all have in common. From viral images of people in Italy singing to one another from their patios to the sounds of people cheering and banging pots and pans during the nightly celebration of front-line workers, she’s sought to pay homage to this moment in history through her paintings.

“We all experienced this really horrible thing, but out of that I saw so many beautiful moments,” she says. “I just thought it was so poignant.”

Due to British Columbia’s phased reopening, hopefully small groups of people will be able to attend the show in-person this time, says Giraud, though she notes that after the accidental success of her first virtual show she’ll likely offer some kind of online component going forward as well.

“Really all I want you to do is for you to feel something when you’re in front of my work. Usually it’s feelings of hope, kindness, positivity – there’s always a positive twist.”

The show is slated for this September. Giraud will be inviting two people at a time to enter The Space gallery for the appointment-only show. Visit Giraud’s website, donnagiraudart.com, any time after Aug. 12 to sign up for a showing.",[]

The by-donation museum is limiting visitors to eight at a time and encouraging people to wear a mask, though it’s not required, according to the museum’s website.

“If the gallery is at capacity, staff will ask you to wait outside until it is safe for you to enter. Once inside, please practise physical distancing and stay two metres (six feet) apart,” the website states.

Every year the BCLA invites the library community to nominate individuals and organizations across the province for awards highlighting outstanding work in libraries.

This year’s awards were announced at the association’s annual general meeting last month, according to a press release.

Referring to the program curation and community librarianship as “novel and inspirational” at North Vancouver District Public Library, which includes three branches, Taylor was given the award for fostering a welcoming environment for the community to learn new things, share ideas and discuss a multitude of topics, stated Christine Middlemass, BCLA president, in the release.

“During a time when many social issues and crises are gaining significance and, at times, becoming divisive, it is more important than ever that libraries create spaces for communities to engage with and exchange and ideas,” stated Middlemass.

The four-person team which makes up West Vancouver library’s youth department was recognized primarily for establishing a partnership with the West Vancouver school district to a create a “seamless learning environment where students can move from school to library and back again with support for their learning in either environment,” according to the release.

When ferry service between Lower Lonsdale and downtown Vancouver was cancelled in 1958, the neighbourhood started to decline. Many longtime businesses were closing, and the once elegant St. Alice and Olympic hotels (as the Palace Hotel was known after 1949), became not so elegant beer parlours.

Roughen up the surface. All like poor soil, even near sand. Sprinkle the seed sparingly on top of the bare patch of earth and water in well. Do not cover and ensure that tall weeds do not encroach on the area. Leave it all alone. Do not mow it and avoid walking on it if possible. Remember to water in dry spells and in an amazingly short period of time (four to six weeks) a substantial stand of seedlings will appear and eventually flowers.

Depending on when you sow the seeds, they may flower in summer, fall or next spring.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Everything about this album is intimidating, including the growling, nether-worldly voice of singer Udo Dirkschneider, and the fact that his backing band is the official concert band of the German military. This album is not for the faint of heart.

article continues below

The former Accept frontman's solo band U.D.O. teams with the Musikkorps der Bundeswehr to put some real metal in heavy metal on ""We Are One.""

The pairing has undeniable power and force on 15 tracks that deal with environmental threats to the planet (""Future Is the Reason Why"", ""Mother Earth""), the refugee crisis (""Children of the World""), and a reunited Germany (""Rebel Town""), among other topics. The band lends a sweeping grandeur to most of the tracks with horns and strings punching up already-rowdy guitar riffs.

And for those who still miss the diminutive singer's 1980s heyday with Accept, U.D.O. throws them a bone in ""We Strike Back,"" a close cousin of the classic Accept concert opener ""Fast as a Shark,"" with very similar speed, style and structure, right down to the harmonic twin guitar solos.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro's column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday's newspaper.

article continues below

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, ""has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.""

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check story by Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro's claims.

It wasn't clear how Navarro's column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he's letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last month that an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn't been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro's opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci ""a national treasure.""

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint ""shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.""

It wasn't clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he's publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro's column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro's views and ""he shouldn't be doing that.""

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that ""might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives."" USA Today said there isn't enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci's early statements of concern about the virus.",[]

He’s returned to the charts in 2020, working on songs for rising and established rap stars, including Lil Wayne, Juice WRLD, Saweetie and Doja Cat.

The songmaster, who has been entangled in a bitter lawsuit with former collaborator Kesha since 2014, has produced and co-written Saweetie’s new single ""Tap In,"" the follow-up to her double-platinum smash ""My Type."" Dr. Luke also co-wrote and co-produced Juice WRLD’s ""Wishing Well,"" taken from the rapper’s first posthumous album ""Legends Never Die,"" released last week.

article continues below

The recent successes mean all three major U.S. record label companies have worked with Dr. Luke this year, even if he hasn't always put his widely recognizable professional name to the new collaborations.

Dr. Luke marked a major comeback this year with the success of the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit ""Say So"" by rapper-singer Doja Cat, who is signed to Dr. Luke's Kemosabe Records. Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald, produced several songs on Cat’s sophomore album ""Hot Pink,"" including single ""Like That,"" which is No. 5 on Billboard’s Hot R&B songs chart. He is the only producer with two songs in the Top 10 on the latter chart (""Say So"" sits at No. 2).

For his work with Cat, he used the alias Tyson Traxe. He used the same pseudonym for his production credit on Toronto rapper-singer Benny Mayne’s ""Hokey Pokey,"" released this year. For Lil Wayne’s ""Shimmy,"" a track featuring Cat on the deluxe edition of his latest album ""Funeral,"" Dr. Luke used the name Loctor Duke.

Label representatives for Saweetie, Juice WRLD, Lil Wayne and Cat didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Neither did a representative for Dr. Luke.

Luke has sprinkled his comeback among the major labels. Cat is signed to Sony Music’s RCA Records, while Saweetie is part of the Warner Music family. Lil Wayne releases music through his Young Money imprint and Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group.

Before Dr. Luke topped the charts this year with ""Say So,"" he last had a No. 1 with Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" in 2014. Months later, Kesha accused him of sexual assault during their yearslong partnership (Dr. Luke has vigorously denied the allegations.)

A New York court dismissed Kesha’s sexual abuse-related claims in 2016 because of legal issues, without ruling on whether the allegations were true. Kesha lost another round in February, when a New York judge said she made a defamatory statement about Dr. Luke on a different occasion: a 2016 text message telling Gaga the producer had also raped Perry. Both he and Perry have denied it, and the judge said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to support the claim.

Kesha’s lawyers have said they plan to appeal the ruling, but it didn’t resolve other aspects of his defamation and breach-of-contract suit, including the crucial question of whether Kesha’s allegation that he raped her is true. The judge said that’s for a jury to decide at trial.

Outside of rap in 2020, Dr. Luke has produced music for pop singer Kim Petras, using the pseudonym MADE IN CHINA.",[]

That’s the forecast for three proposed housing developments in the District of North Vancouver following a committee meeting held Monday afternoon.

Although the projects, which are still in their preliminary stages, weren’t up for a formal vote, district council members were invited to give their early input on the proposals for Capilano University, Lynn Creek and Edgemont.

Council members were most amenable to CapU’s request to build its first student housing on what is today a parking lot on the north side of the campus. The 207-room, 362-bed dormitory project doesn’t require rezoning but it will require council to grant variances for a building permit.

The school’s leadership is hoping to have it fully built by August 2022 when their current lease on older dormitory buildings at a former international school off campus on Dollarton Highway expires.

Rental rates are projected to be $800 a month for a shared room or $1,000 for a private room, and students would be required purchase a meal plan and eat in the shared cafeteria.

The only concerns raised by council were a potential shortage of bicycle parking and whether the 191 lost vehicle parking spaces would send CapU students looking for street parking in the surrounding neighbourhood.

“Obviously that area is under stress now,” said Mayor Mike Little.

Others, however, saw the loss of parking as a positive.

“I’m really pleased to see a proposal that is on a parking lot. It’s a much better use of space,” said Coun. Megan Curren.

Council also appeared largely receptive to developer Norman Laube’s proposal to redevelop five single-family homes at 1547-1599 Crown St. into a six-storey purpose-built rental building.

The proposal includes 85 rental units, nine of which would be rented at below-market rates for people earning roughly $30,000 to $85,000 per year.

“New rental of this type is obviously needed. It’s obviously part of the solution to our crisis around housing affordability and we obviously need the below-market feature of this and others like it. I’m totally supportive of rental projects of this type coming forward,” said Coun. Jim Hanson.

Coun. Mathew Bond noted that only about three per cent of the district’s housing stock is purpose-built rental.

“And the overwhelming majority of those existing purpose-built rentals are old,” he said.

The only debate by council was whether the 0.75 parking stalls per unit was too much or not enough.

A proposed heritage revitalization project at 3700-3718 Edgemont Blvd., however, will face a much more difficult prospect of being passed by council if the comments at Monday’s committee meeting are any indication.

The proposal would see a 1951 fourplex designed by local architect and early West Coast Modern master Fred Hollingsworth restored and given heritage protection while the remainder of the property is built up with either 25 duplex units or 33 row houses.

The proposal has the backing of heritage advocates but most members of council expressed reservations about so many new units being added outside a town centre.

“This just seems, with a 25-unit increase, that it’s a larger increase in density than I was contemplating for the site,” said Little.

Hanson said he too had that same impression, but he added if council intends to follow through on its strategic plan to save heritage buildings from demolition, they would have to entertain projects like the one before them.

District staff and the proponents will use council’s input to further refine the proposals.

The boy was mountain biking on the Bobsled mountain bike trail, a run with some advanced features, when he lost control and crashed.

The boy was knocked unconscious for a short period of time, when a parent who was with the boy and other mountain bikers arrived on the scene.

David Dales, assistant chief of operations for District of North Vancouver Fire and Rescue, said firefighters got the call around 3:30 p.m. and raced to the scene with a vacuum splint that six firefighters used to immobilize the boy and carry him off the mountain.

“They basically ran up the trail,” he said.

Dales had no further information about the boy’s condition but firefighters treated it as a case of possible spinal injuries.

“We really try to treat these as a traumatic medical call.”

Dales cautioned the public to be careful, warning that local trails have been very busy lately.

The mountain bike rescue was the second trail rescue of the day for North Vancouver firefighters. Earlier Sunday, firefighters helped a woman in her 50s who had fallen and injured her shoulder on the Homestead Trail while hiking. She was able to walk out on her own with assistance, said Dales.",[]

A number of ICBC employees who were in close contact with the person testing positive have been notified by the health authority and have been sent home to self-isolate, said Wilkins.

Office areas at ICBC are undergoing a deep clean, said Wilkins, in addition to the regular cleaning, physical distancing, meeting and washroom occupancy limits already in place at head office.

Wilkins added there was no risk to customers as the employee only works at ICBC’s head office, which has been closed to the public since March 17.

According to the recent statistics from B.C.’s Centre for Disease Control, cases of COVID-19 remain low on the North Shore, with 261 cases reported in the North Shore Coast Garibaldi health region between Jan. 1 and July 9.

Recently health officials subtracted 51 cases of COVID-19 that had been detected in B.C. in people who normally live in other countries, including 42 in the Vancouver Coastal Health area, which includes the North Shore.

Provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix announced July 15 that there were 21 new cases in the past 24 hours, including two cases that they call ""epi-linked,"" or presumed cases that have not been proven through testing but are being treated as official cases.

The province has now recorded 3,149 cases since the novel coronavirus first appeared in B.C. in late January.

More than 87.4% of those infected, or 2,753 people, have recovered. Of those who haven't, 189 people have died and 207 people are actively fighting the virus. Only 14 people are hospitalized, with five of those in intensive care units. The rest are self-isolating at home. There were no new deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.

Recording at least 20 new COVID-19 cases in a 24-hour period has become common in B.C., and Henry said yesterday that she found that number ""distressing,"" even though, she added, the good news is that the province knows where the clusters of infection are, many of the infections are linked and the number is not really that large given the province's population of more than five million residents.

The numbers in the past week were:

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12;

• 21 new cases on July 13;

• 21 new cases on July 15.

In June, the number of daily new cases many times was in the single digits.

""There is one active community outbreak, in addition to several community exposure events,"" Henry and Dix said. ""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.""

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is expected to take Sidoo into custody on September 23 and release him from a Pacific Northwest area facility just before Christmas.

article continues below

Sidoo, 61, appeared online via Zoom in front of United States District Judge Nathaniel Gorton of the United States District Court for District of Massachusetts, as well as his lawyers and prosecutors. He wore a plaid suit while sitting in an office space inside his $31.7 million home in Vancouver’s Point Grey neighbourhood.

Sidoo, now a convicted felon, initially pled innocent to fraud and money laundering charges; he teared up before being sentenced and read a prepared statement:

“The last several months have been the hardest in my entire life and today I accept the court’s decision without reservation. No words can express how sorry I am for my decisions and actions that led to this day. I make no excuses, your honour. I broke the law and pled guilty and I now must pay for my actions.

“To my wife and boys, all I ever wanted was your love and respect and to be a good role model. And I know I have made a terrible mistake that has deeply affected our family. To my friends and colleagues and former teammates over the years, I am deeply ashamed today. To the young men and women who looked up to me as a role model, you deserve better. To the court and all of you, I wish to apologize for my actions.

“I will serve my sentence and am committed to returning to the community and doing everything possible to make a positive impact. I hope in time people will not judge me for the worst mistake in my life but for the work in the days, weeks and years ahead in which I am committed to being a better man.”

Gorton told Sidoo he was “impressed” by the businessman’s “obvious remorse.”

But Gorton pointed out two omissions in Sidoo’s statement.

“You expect to put this behind you and go forward and make up for what you called mistakes. I would call it a crime, not a mistake, but nevertheless, it is important that you acknowledge it and realize how many constituencies you have disappointed,” said the judge.

Sidoo also did not explicitly acknowledge that his crimes resulted in two students missing an opportunity to attend the universities his sons, Dylan Sidoo and Jordan Sidoo, were admitted to.

“What you accomplished, along with getting them into college, is to deprive two other deserving students of admittance into those universities — an act that is the very antithesis of one you want to be known for,” said Gorton.

Likewise, United States Attorney Andrew Lelling submitted to Gorton: “Sidoo engaged in serious criminal conduct involving fraud and deception that stretched over multiple years.

“His crimes warrant significant punishment. By engaging in the scheme, with [scheme mastermind Rick Singer] and others, Sidoo was able to steal two college admissions slots for his sons, including one from the University of California at Berkeley, one of the top public universities in the nation.”

Sidoo, said Gorton, “committed a crime that displayed an unbelievable lack of integrity, morality and common sense.

“You have let your selfish desire, your pride and your enormous wealth overcome all of what you apparently want to stand for with your works of charity,” Gorton told Sidoo.

Sidoo’s philanthropy, derived from his earnings in the capital markets, was central to his sentencing defense. According to Sidoo he has donated several million dollars to charitable causes, such as the University of B.C. football program.

In pleading guilty to fraud, Sidoo avoided a maximum prison term of 20 years and prosecutors subsequently agreed to 90 days behind bars, plus a $250,000 fine and one-year of supervised release, which will not be enforced in Canada by the U.S. Probation Department. Prosecutors also agreed to drop the money laundering charge.

The prison Sidoo goes to is expected to have harsher conditions since his options are limited due to his foreign citizenship. His attorney Martin Weinberg said he is expected to spend 14 days in isolation in a “maximum security setting,” due to COVID-19.

Sidoo will get four days credit for time already served. If he serves the full 90 days he will be released December 17 but will have to spend 14 days in isolation at home should B.C. public health rules for international travellers and COVID-19 continue into the fall.

Gorton said Sidoo’s crime would normally warrant more time in jail but there are mitigating circumstances, such as his remorse, lack of criminal record, philanthropy and “collateral consequences,” such as not being able to enter the U.S. as a felon and being stripped last month of his Order of B.C. medal for community service. Sidoo’s attorneys also previously noted he did not directly pay the universities but that his fraud was limited to cheating on the tests.

The former B.C. Lions football player worked as a stock broker in the 1990s and an investment banker between 2000 and 2010. Since 2010 he has made millions of dollars directing a handful of public companies that have failed to generate wealth for retail investors.

Sidoo was arrested March 8, 2019, in San Jose, California, on charges by the U.S. Department of Justice of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering related to the high-profile U.S. college admissions and bribery scandal, brought to light by a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe dubbed Operation Varsity Blues.

One of dozens of parents to be charged, Sidoo initially pled innocent to paying $200,000 total to scheme mastermind William ‘Rick’ Singer, who hired corrupt exam expert Mark Riddell to take Dylan and Jordan’s SAT exams, in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Sidoo also helped falsify one of his son Jordan’s university applications in October 2013 with an essay that originally included a fake claim of Jordan being held up at gunpoint by gangsters, while he was purported to be an intern for an anti-gang organization.

Co-conspirators Singer and Riddell pled guilty last year in exchange for cooperating with the government’s investigation.

The guilty parties in the case, who used Singer’s criminal services, were generally well-off individuals. Celebrities such as actress Lori Loughlin and her clothing designer husband Mossimo Gianulli and actress Felicity Huffman also pled guilty for related crimes and brought much media attention to the investigation.

Sidoo’s sons had no involvement in their father’s crime.

Jordan is now a 2018 history graduate from University of California Berkeley. Dylan graduated in cinematic arts in 2016 from the University of Southern California (USC). The two previously attended Vancouver’s prestigious St. George’s School.

Neither university has announced whether or not their degrees will remain valid. Dylan, according to the sentencing documents, had scored a 1,460/2,400 SAT score until Riddell, using a fake ID in December 2011, bumped up the score to 1,700, which was high enough for Dylan to enter Chapman University (and later transfer to USC). Riddell then scored 2,280/2,400 for Jordan in December 2012, paving the way to Berkley.

Riddell also took a high school test for Dylan. The B.C. Ministry of Education has issued no statement on how its testing process was so vulnerable to fraud.

Both sons have since entered into penny stock promotion with their father.

That characterization comes one day after Britain became the last of Canada's ""Five Eyes"" intelligence-sharing allies to ban the Chinese telecommunications firm from its 5G wireless internet.

article continues below

The next generation of wireless internet technology is to be dramatically faster than the current standard, with more bandwidth and faster response times. It's expected to be crucial to technologies such as autonomous vehicles and remote medicine.

Alykhan Velshi, Huawei Canada's vice president of corporate affairs, says the company hopes the Trudeau government's ongoing 5G review steers clear of political machinations by administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to undermine the company.

""We see ourselves as being caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Canada is also unfortunately caught in the middle of it,"" Velshi said in an interview on Wednesday.

""That is the context in which a lot of announcements and decisions are made, as the Trump administration is demanding that everyone pick a side whether it is actually in their interest to go all in on one side or that other.""

Britain's decision brought it firmly in line with Trump's campaign to have Huawei banned from allied countries, including Canada.

The United States views Huawei as a security threat and says its equipment and technology would serve as a back door for China's communist leaders and military to spy on other countries as they adopt 5G technology — a charge the company firmly denies.

The Trudeau government has delayed a long-awaited decision on whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada's new 5G network largely because of China's ongoing imprisonment of two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.

Kovrig and Spavor were arrested nine days after Canada detained Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on an American arrest warrant in December 2018. That move is widely seen as retaliation by China to force Canada to release Meng.

Velshi, a lawyer and former Conservative political staffer, called the case against Meng a ""politically driven"" prosecution by Trump, and pointed to a 2018 musing by the president that she could be used as a bargaining chip in his trade negotiation with China.

He said Meng will be vindicated by the Canadian courts when the extent of Trump's political motivation is properly presented.

(The Green party issued a statement along the same lines Wednesday, saying the United States is abusing its extradition treaty with Canada for political purposes and calling on the Canadian government to demand U.S. charges against Meng be dropped.)

But at the same time, Velshi also expressed sympathy for Kovrig and Spavor and reiterated the view of the Canadian arm of his company that diplomats can somehow win their freedom.

""Like all Canadians we're concerned about their detention, we're concerned about their treatment and we want to see them home as soon as possible.""

The tensions between Beijing and Washington intensified on Wednesday following Tuesday's announcement by Britain that Huawei would be excluded from work on the 5G network because U.S. sanctions made it impossible to ensure the safety of Chinese-supplied equipment.

The Trump administration decided in May to block non-U.S. companies from using American technology to produce processor chips and other components for Huawei without Washington's approval.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government accused Britain of colluding with the U.S. to hurt Huawei. The Trump administration fired back by announcing travel bans on employees of Huawei and other Chinese companies that the U.S. determines are assisting authoritarian governments in violating human rights, including against Uighurs in western China.

Velshi said Huawei has faith in the Canadian government's ongoing 5G review and the company has nothing to say about how long it has taken for a decision to be made.

In the meantime, Velshi said that despite the tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, Huawei's revenues in Canada grew in 2019, as did its workforce, which stands at about 1,200 employees. Velshi said the company has not yet made public its 2019 financials.

""We attribute that growth to the fact that our customers … have largely stood by us and continued to buy our products,"" said Velshi.

David Reed, Britain's deputy high commissioner to Canada, had no comment on what Canada should do next, but noted the two countries enjoy strong co-operation in the Five Eyes, which also includes Australia and New Zealand.

Reed said all countries must focus on allowing more companies to thrive in the 5G market.

""The reason we're in this position is there's a global market failure,"" Reed said in an interview. ""That's the conversation we started, particularly with Five Eyes partners, earlier in the year and we're trying to make progress on that.""

John Power, the spokesman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, gave no indication as to when the government would make its decision on which companies can sell 5G gear in Canada. He reiterated that the government would ""not compromise on matters of national security"" but declined to reference specific companies.

""Our government's review will consider technical and security factors, including advice from our security agencies and consider decisions from our allies and partners,"" he said in a statement, adding that it would take into account ""important domestic and international considerations.""

Documents filed in B.C. Supreme Court say more than 100 children, most of them Indigenous, were left homeless and vulnerable to sexual exploitation and physical or psychological harm.

article continues below

A proposed class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 alleged social worker Robert Riley Saunders siphoned away rent and other funds from those under his guardianship while he worked for the Ministry of Children and Family Development in Kelowna.

The settlement, which still needs to be approved by the court, says all claimants would be eligible for a basic payment of $25,000, with a maximum award of up to $250,000 for those who were Indigenous, left homeless, were physically harmed or whose education was delayed.

The court documents say the province has identified 107 foster children who may have been involved, two are dead and four have settled in separation actions. Ninety are believed to be Indigenous.

Jason Gratl, the lawyer for the plaintiff, said the allegations date back to 2001 and there may be more children involved. But poor or false records were kept.

""The records created by Riley Sanders tended to be false and self-serving because Riley Saunders was known to be a con-artist and a self-serving fraudster,"" Gratl said in an interview Wednesday.

He said employment records show that Saunders was insensitive to Aboriginal cultural and history, yet he was assigned to work with high-risk Indigenous children by the ministry.

Saunders has never commented on the allegations or filed a statement of defence in court.

In Victoria on Wednesday, Attorney General David Eby said it has always been the government's goal to ensure appropriate compensation for those affected.

He said additional financial controls have been put in place and there's more training and oversight of the ministry's workers to ensure no child faces the same situation.

""That is of vital importance to the government that we protect these kids. It's an incredibly heart-breaking situation that this happened.""

In its reply to the lawsuit filed in court, the ministry admitted to ""vicarious liability"" for the acts and omissions of Saunders.

The reply said the ministry detected financial irregularities involving Saunders in December 2017 and he was suspended a month later.

""Steps were taken under the direction of the local (ministry) office to ensure the immediate safety and well-being of the children, youth and young adults on the case load of Mr. Saunders,"" the response to the civil claim said.

The prosecution service said it has received a report on Saunders from the RCMP and possible charges are being assessed.

Two lawsuits filed against the province and Saunders in 2018 alleged Saunders moved the children from their homes in order to make them eligible for financial benefits from the ministry, then opened joint bank accounts for each youth.

""Saunders stole the funds deposited by the ministry into joint bank accounts by moving them to his own individual account at Interior Savings and by paying his personal expenses by electronic transfer from the joint bank account,"" the statements said.

They also alleged Saunders was aware of the youths' vulnerability and aware that he exercised parental control over them.

A certification hearing for the class action is scheduled for July 28. If approved, it would allow an individual's case to stand in for all the class members.

A decision from the court on approval of the settlement is expected after the certification hearing.

That's causing angst for organizations such as Souls Harbour Rescue Mission in Halifax, which has already taken on seven students but now doesn't know whether the government will actually cover the payments the volunteers have been promised.

""I wish they would just come out with a statement to say: 'It's taking us a while, but charities, we won't leave you hanging for it,'"" said Souls Harbour CEO Michelle Portman. ""They haven't said that. So that's why we're all twiddling our thumbs and biting our nails.""

Souls Harbour's board of directors has decided the charity will honour the commitment made to the seven students who are now volunteering in its thrift store, even if the government kills the program.

But Portman said that will have financial implications across the rest of the organization, which provides lunches and a safe space for hundreds of people every week.

""We have decided that if the government decides not to pay then we will uphold it in some way and pay the grant for them,"" she said. ""But we have no way of knowing. ... My HR lady is just completely stressed about it because she knows how much that will cost us if the program folds.""

The fate of the program is just one of many unanswered questions about the student-volunteer scheme, which has been left in turmoil after the government and WE ended their partnership on Juy 3.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced general plans for the grant program in April with details following June 25. The government promised students could receive up to $5,000 toward their education costs by volunteering the maximum 500 hours through the program.

Souls Harbour isn't the only one waiting for word from the government since the $20-million contract with Toronto-based WE was terminated amid questions about the Trudeau family's links to WE co-founder Craig and Marc Kielburger.

""We have had no communication,"" said Toronto Zoo spokeswoman Jennifer Tracey ""One of the last communications from the WE folks was just that they were working on transitioning everything back over to the federal government, but there's been nothing further.""

Charities like the Toronto Zoo, which had planned to take on five students to conduct research on animal behaviour during COVID-19, weren't the only ones in the dark. Tracey said her daughter had also heard nothing after applying to work at a centre for Indigenous women.

YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale also said there has been no word on his organization's desire to take on 391 students at branches across the country, adding he was ""starting to wonder if this is going to happen.""

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's office and the Employment and Social Development Canada, the federal department that has taken over the program, have said the government will help students dealing with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet they have offered no update on the program, including whether it will even continue.

""The government of Canada remains committed to supporting students and the not-for-profit sector and is working diligently to develop a transition plan, including looking at options on how best to proceed,"" ESDC spokeswoman Isabelle Maheu said in an email Wednesday.

""This means there will be delays, but more information will be provided as soon as it is available.""

The department has also declined to say how many positions the $912-million program was supposed to create for students, how many positions had been approved, the number of applications received from students or how many positions have been filled.

Those questions are in addition to what other organizations were considered to run the program before cabinet decided to award a sole-sourced contract to WE. Trudeau has said WE was recommended by the public service and was the only organization capable of running the program.

Putting the lemons in harms way of people and pets has prompted Coquitlam RCMP to ask people to stop the activity and to encourage people to call police if they see one of these spiky, hanging lemons instead of disposing of the evidence.

article continues below

So far there have been two instances of someone tying lemons stuck with sewing needles to tree branches — both in Port Coquitlam — police say.

The first lemon was found hung from a branch in Gates Park on June 22. A report was made in an email to the city of Port Coquitlam. The second lemon was found on Tuesday, July 14, tied near a trail by the Coquitlam River at Whyte Avenue. That discovery was reported with an email to a closed Community Police Station.

One of the lemons was reported on Facebook and subsequently commented on in the Tri-City News.

Are they a dangerous new trend?

Police want to know if sticking needles in lemons and tying them to trees in a public park is an attempt to harm people or for some other purpose.

This second lemon, wrapped in orange twine, stuck with needles and tied to a branch was found near a trail along the Coquitlam River in Port Coquitlam. - Coquitlam RCMP

Some have claimed that it’s connected to witchcraft or voodoo, and a report four years ago in the U.S. found a similar occurrence.

What ever the reason, police want to hear from those who are tying these potentially dangerous lemons to a tree.

“If you see something that could be a deliberate attempt at harm, you must call police on the phone rather than send an email,”, stated Corporal Michael McLaughlin in a press release.

“Both of these lemons were thrown into the garbage by the people who found them. By the time police received the emails, the evidence was gone and an investigation was virtually impossible”.

One theory is that the person who left the lemons had no intention to hurt anyone. Until police speak to that person, it’s hard to be sure.

“If you are leaving these lemons full of needles in public, we ask that you stop, and then talk to us to explain what you were doing”, McLaughlin further stated.

If anyone spots someone doing this, they are asked to call the Coquitlam RCMP non-emergency number at 604-945-1550, or call 911 “if it’s happening right in front of you”.",[]

The man and woman, who have asked not to be identified, were taken in by what appeared to be a call from their grandson in dire need of help.

article continues below

“The guy sounded so much like our grandson. If he had said ‘Grandma,’ we’d have known [it wasn’t him] right away, but he said ‘Nan’ and so does my grandson,” said the man.

The imposter grandson, who used their grandson’s name, called on Monday and told them he had been driving a friend’s car and struck a vehicle with Quebec licence plates that had turned sharply in front of him.

The fake grandson went on to say he had been taken to jail, but a judge would free him if he could pay for the damage, estimated to be $5,000. The grandparents were told to send money to the car’s owner in Montreal.

“I wasn’t cluing in at all [that this was a scam], he sounded so much like our grandson,” the man said.

The dutiful grandparents then took cash from their bank and went to the Bank of Montreal and using an account number the scammer had provided via an accomplice posing as a lawyer, they sent money to a BMO branch in downtown Montreal.

“The kid said, ‘Please don’t tell Dad,’ ” the man said. It wasn’t until he later talked to his grandson that it became clear they had been scammed.

The couple has since been in touch with police and the Bank of Montreal, which they say has been very helpful.

“They are doing their best to try and get the money back,” said the man, who thinks the scammers “took a shot in the dark and got lucky.”

But according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, it’s likely the scammers mined information like the grandson’s name from social media to make the pitch more convincing.

The centre calls these types of scams “the emergency scam.” It preys on the fear of a loved one being hurt or in trouble. The scammer claims to be someone you know and says they need money immediately. They tend to use scenarios like needing bail money because they’ve been arrested, or being in a car accident, or having trouble returning from a foreign country.

The targets are often seniors and the scammer pretends to be a grandchild, who begs them not to tell their parents that they’re in trouble, the Anti-Fraud Centre said. As a result, the grandparent doesn’t find out until after they’ve sent the money that their grandchild was not the person who asked for help.

Const. Cam MacIntyre said scammers will go to any lengths to defraud a victim.

“They will pose as a family member, a trusted member of the public, or even the police. We strongly recommend that people never deposit money into accounts of people or entities they do know personally,” he said.

“It’s so important to verify where your money is going. Call a family member, a friend, or the police if you are suspicious.”

The Anti-Fraud Centre says there were 18,803 reports of fraud, and 6,671 victims reporting losses of $22.6 million in Canada in the first four months of this year.

MacIntyre suggests if you are in the process of providing financial information or sending money to potential fraudsters, stop immediately.

“Contact your financial institutions and ensure all payments that you have not authorized are stopped. Inform them of the fraud and change both passwords and access information,” he said.

Suspected frauds can be reported to your local police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501.

The Vancouver Park Board passed a motion late Tuesday which includes provisions to ""more effectively manage temporary structures and tents for those seeking shelter in parks.""

article continues below

The board says the move reflects recent B.C. Supreme Court decisions recognizing the charter right to stay in public spaces when adequate shelter is not available.

The motion passed 4-3 after two nights of debate and submissions from dozens of speakers.

Chrissy Brett, an organizer of a tent city in Vancouver's Strathcona Park and a spokeswoman for other recent Vancouver encampments, said she's upset with the outcome.

""I would say that I'm disappointed in the lack of humanity in this decision,"" she said Wednesday.

Brett said she would have preferred the board defer the motion to allow for more discussion its impact on the homeless.

She compared the encampments in Vancouver with the plight of refugees in foreign countries.

""If we can send that refugee money overseas, we need to create Canadian refugee-style camps,"" Brett said. ""I'm tired of the government saying we need to work on housing first when there's nothing that comes second. There's no wraparound support services, there's no detox or treatment.""

By refugee-style, Brett said she means a camp which has formal access to toilets, running water and social services.

Shane Simpson, the minister of social development and poverty reduction, said the government is looking at an array of options to address the camp sites.

He said he questions whether a refugee-style camp would meet the approval of current campers.

""One of the things about a camp like that, if you chose to do that, is that it would be pretty heavily managed. It would need to be,"" he said. ""In terms of the campers, I'm not certain about how well it would be received by the people who are camping there.""

Simpson added that he expects the number of tents at Strathcona Park to grow and he doesn't know how the bylaw will be practically enforced.

""I'm not sure that anybody quite understands what the impact of this bylaw will be,"" he said.

The city had been dealing with a long-running tent city in the Downtown Eastside at Oppenheimer Park when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.

Officials were able to place the majority of those residents in housing, but two more tent cities popped up in the wake of its shutdown.

The first, on property owned by the Port of Vancouver near CRAB Park, was dismantled after the B.C. Supreme Court granted an injunction in early June over health and safety concerns.

The encampment at Strathcona Park has swelled to about 200 tents.

Dave Demers, a commissioner who voted for the motion, said the board was left in an untenable situation.

The current bylaw restricting sleeping in parks was unconstitutional and officials needed to come up with a solution, he said.

""It's a pretty dire situation that is not new,"" Demers said. ""I think people fail to understand or grasp the gravity of the situation.""

The provincial government needs to sit down with local officials to help plot a way forward and ensure there are more services offered for the homeless population, he added.

456,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/news/home-sales-continue-to-rebound-in-june-after-pandemic-freeze-earlier-in-year-1.24170491,Home sales continue to rebound in June after pandemic freeze earlier in year,[],,"OTTAWA — Real estate agents across the country saw home sales in June nearing or even beating pre-pandemic levels.

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

article continues below

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

RCMP said in a release that around 6 a.m. on July 11 a dog alerted two teens to an object on the beach below the 800 block of Bayview Road.

The teens went to a nearby home for help, and the homeowner contacted RCMP.

According to police, the remains were in “an advanced state of decomposition.”

The BC Coroners Service said the remains were partial, which is likely the result of being in the water for some time, which leads to disarticulation – something the Coroners Service said they’ve seen with body parts found on shorelines in the past.

“This has happened in past investigations with feet we found on shorelines across the province in the past decade and a half,” Andy Watson of the Coroners Service told Coast Reporter.

RCMP said they will be looking into outstanding missing person files as they work with the Coroners Service to attempt to identity the remains and Watson said a forensic identification specialist is being brought in to perform DNA testing on the remains.

He said the investigation is still in the early stages so there’s little other information they can release.

RCMP also said on Monday that a social media post from author and artist Douglas Coupland on July 10, the day before the grisly discovery, showing what appeared to be part of a human leg on a beach and tagged “Roberts Creek,” was an unfortunate coincidence.

Police contacted Coupland at his home in the Lower Mainland and confirmed that the photo was of a prop Coupland had used for an earlier project.",[]

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

Harry Bains said injured workers have complained for too long that the system lacks fairness and support in times of injury and recovery.

article continues below

Changes Bains proposes include raising the maximum annual salary on which compensation benefits are based; authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before claim acceptance; giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.

Victoria is also fast-tracking legislation to handle situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic so workers can access benefits more easily.

During the pandemic, the regulator is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. It is also waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy.

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act comes after three expert reviews were completed in 2018 and 2019.

The ministry said of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the Lower Mainland, while the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.

There are more than 100,000 workplace injury or fatality claims annually.

In 2019, there were 140 workplace fatalities in B.C. Of that number, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 to traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

Asked on a media conference call Monday whether Vancouver might get back in the picture, Colin Smith said FIFA was focused on the original three Canadian candidate cities.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

467,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/news/gun-violence-imported-from-u-s-is-a-key-concern-for-canadians-1.24169958,Gun violence imported from U.S. is a key concern for Canadians,['Mario Canseco'],,"National governments have a tendency to overreact immediately after they are forced to face an unexpected challenge. No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

Architect Nadi Miri and her sister Ellie Miri, an interior designer, are the creative forces behind m+ Architecture | Interior Design in Vancouver. They see the demand for developments such as townhouses as an opportunity to design spaces that can grow with a family and adapt to changing needs.

article continues below

However, townhouses are not simply bigger condos (or smaller houses). “The design of multi-family houses requires a different approach,” Nadi says.

Here are five trends they incorporate into their work.

1) Hello, sunshine

One day of sunshine in Vancouver is worth three weeks of rain. So when the clouds part, people spend as much time outside as possible. The Miris favour south-facing shared outdoor amenities such as communal garden spaces, outdoor seating and patios for barbecuing.

2) Flexible space planning

Designs have to accommodate not only a family as it grows, but a family as it grows older. Young children don’t mind sharing a bathroom but, when they’re teenagers, expect a few door poundings. Design elements can reduce potential conflict areas, Ellie says.

Likewise, people want to be able to easily adapt their home as they get older or downsize. Aging-in-place designs include additional backing for a grab bar so when it’s time for a little help getting out of the bathtub, a grab bar is easy to install.

“Our approach is to create a functional and flexible space,” Nadi says. “We’re always looking ahead to predict people’s needs.”

3) Smaller spaces, nicer amenities

“As spaces get more dense and smaller, trends are moving towards European kitchen designs,” says Ellie. “Developers go with sleek, modern designs and use smaller but higher end appliances.”

4) Let there be (good) light

Each room requires a different lighting approach. Bright kitchens are a joy to cook in but more subdued lighting in the bedroom is welcomed when you want to sleep in on a Sunday morning.

“As an interior designer, I design ceiling plans based on the function of each room,” Ellie says.

5) Make it sustainable

“We believe in protecting our natural resources through our designs,” says Nadi. “By using fewer natural resources, there are benefits for occupants today as well as future generations.”

One option is to collect rain in basins and then use that water for rooftop or communal gardens. Another is to have southern-exposure windows which turn sunshine into a source of warmth.

But he's very serious.

""Research shows that individual investors tend to be their own worst enemy,"" John continues. ""They make decisions based on the wrong information at the wrong time and consequently hurt their portfolio's performance.""

A case in point, John notes, is our tendency to want to sell stocks as the market settles into a decline and buy stocks back when the market is well into its recovery.

""The goal,"" says John, ""is to sell at the top of the market and buy at the bottom. People seem to be hard-wired to do otherwise.""

Individual investors tend to get caught up in a self-defeating cycle.

""Market bubbles occur when everyone starts to plough in,"" John explains. ""At Pacific Spirit, we manage our client’s behavior so that they can achieve their long term goals.""

When John and the Pacific Spirit team see market values dropping, they reach out to their clients and suggest that it is a good time to buy.

""We tell them that the market may not be at the absolute bottom,"" he explains, ""but after a major decline a lot of the risk has actually been rinsed out of the market. And we absolutely discourage clients from buying at the top of the market.""

When you're considering working with a portfolio manager, John recommends remembering that it's a different experience compared to investing on your own.

""Our ideal client is someone who can delegate the investment authority to Pacific Spirit,"" he says. ""We report back to them regularly about what we've done and that is the reason clients trust us fully and also trust us exclusively.""

Using a fee-only based approach, Pacific Spirit works to educate clients on the volatility of the market over the short-term.

""Yes, the market is unpredictable and there may be periods of negative returns,"" John explains. ""But in the long-term, the returns from investing in the stock market can be much higher than those earned in other investment arenas. Our job is to make our clients' financial dreams a reality.""

“Climbing is just so much fun for kids,” says Henry Wang, owner of The Edge Climbing Centre in North Vancouver. “You’re always climbing as kids—you can’t get kids to stop climbing!”

article continues below

The Edge Climbing Centre offers extensive youth programming to foster what Wang refers to as ‘a child’s natural climbing inclination’. Sessions are geared to both the nervous first-timer and the adventurous young climber.

Climbers aged 6 to 8 begin their climbing journey as Geckos before graduating to Spiders when they’re 9 to 12 years old. Those with a thirst for competition can then join the three-tier competitive climbing program, where young climbers are trained to compete in local climbing competitions.

As the only centre in B.C. to have a World Cup certified route setter, The Edge Climbing Centre has a unique advantage when it comes to teaching kids how to climb.

“Having a World-Cup certified route setter means our routes are better designed to accommodate climbers of all skills and sizes,” says Wang. “It makes a big difference, particularly with the younger climbers.”

The Climbing Club and The Climbing Club Junior are programs designed for teens looking to pursue the sport at a recreational level. The Edge Climbing Centre also offers camps during spring, summer, and Christmas breaks, and hosts kids’ birthday parties.

“Our youth programming is at the forefront of the industry,” says Wang. “And we’re able to accommodate a wide range of participants—from the child who maybe didn’t do so well in team sports to the child who recently dropped out of a highly competitive one.”

Climbing provides an opportunity for kids to feel part of the team, says Wang, without the expectation from teammates to perform in a certain way.

“Some kids felt too much pressure to perform with a team because of the expectations,” says Wang. “Others might have been in really high competitive sports like dance or gymnastics and just burned out.”

Since parents don’t always know a lot about rock climbing, the kids are spared the usual parent-coaching-from-the-sidelines phenomenon that tends to accompany organized sports these days.

“That’s definitely an added bonus,” says Wang, laughing. “It doesn’t take kids long before they become the climbing expert in the family!”

Here, she spills on the five things you need to know when picking your frames.

article continues below

1. Think about your personal style

Are you a trendsetter, or more conservative? Is your office smart, or casual? Your glasses are an extension of your day-to-day wardrobe and should reflect your personality and habits. So one of the most important things to consider is whether you’ll be comfortable going about your everyday life in your new specs.

2. Work out your skin tone

Just as with jewellery or makeup, your frames need to complement the undertones of your skin. “If you’re cool-toned (silver jewellery looks best on you), go for icy shades and jewel tones, and avoid anything with orange-y or amber hints. If you’re warm-toned (gold jewellery is your go-to), you’ll look great in olive, moss, or yellow-toned browns,” says Da Costa. Not sure? An eye test with Da Costa is also a personal styling session, so she’ll give you all the advice you need.

3. Consider your face shape

The wrong specs can make square jaws look heavier, and emphasize wide faces. And the reverse is true: A great pair of frames can make your face appear slimmer, or shorter.

4. See double

Mostly we think we need only one pair of specs. But if you’re into sports, you might want a different pair for fishing and the office. You might also want computer or gaming glasses. You might even want a few pairs, just for the fun of it – after all, you don’t carry the same bag or wear the same shoes every day. Speedy Specs offers a wide range of glasses, from affordable options at $195 including frames, lenses and coatings, to high-end specs from Korean and Canadian designer brands.

5. Take account of your prescription

Like it or not, your prescription might limit your frame choice. “For example, if your prescription is high, I might not recommend a larger frame because the thickness of the lenses would be very noticeable,” says Da Costa. “That’s one of the big advantages of seeing a licensed optician with your up-to-date prescription, as opposed to ordering from online, because they can advise you on those kinds of issues.”

Speedy Specs visits your home or office to deliver eye tests and styling sessions. It is now operating throughout the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley. Services may be covered by your insurer and direct billing is available.

""When you have an active baby in the house,"" July, now the mom of three young daughters, explains, ""the time between around five months and two years-old is when the baby could hurt themselves through walking, falling, bumping into sharp corners and so on. It's important to childproof the house so that baby can be independent, but still stay safe.""

Active Baby offers a complete range of safety products to help childproof the home. Consider these safety tips:

Kids on the move

When babies start to crawl or walk, they feel the sensation of independence. This is to be encouraged, except when the danger of stairs or a burning fireplace lurks around the corner. Active Baby offers a variety of safety gates to block off areas where you don't want your toddler to go.

Edge protectors can easily keep delicate heads from bumping against sharp corners when baby's on the move.

Kitchen safety

Kitchens are a fascinating place for babies. Who can't relate to opening a drawer and pulling out your own orchestra in the form of pots and pans? But not all cupboards and drawers contain safe items for a small child. Active Baby offers adhesive or magnetic drawer and cupboard locks, appliance locks, and electrical outlet caps.

""We also offer Childproofing Kits for new parents,"" July says. ""Or it makes great safety essentials for grandparents to help childproof their home too.""

Blocking access in the bathroom

Similarly, Active Baby has protective locks for bathroom cabinets and even a toilet lock for the toddler who thinks water looks like fun.

""Because we're parents ourselves,"" July says, ""we try most of the products to make sure they offer the protection we want for our children and for those of our customers. Parents are concerned about having a safe house for baby and we want to help them make that happen.""

Founder Gelareh Matheson worked in insurance before moving into flower arranging and event planning (she studied the latter at BCIT) and opening her own flower shop in Burnaby. 10 years on, her company, which has just moved to North Vancouver, will help you put together the event of your dreams, and she won’t charge a cent.

How it works: let her know your budget and the kind of event you want, plus any ideas you have. She’ll put together a Pinterest board that you can both contribute to, and a presentation suggesting the essentials like colours and theme, and recommending vendors including venues, photographers, caterers, bakers and more. “It’s all about helping people execute their vision,” Matheson says. “Think of me as a best girlfriend who can advise and support, taking the stress off so you can enjoy the fun bits of planning your event. After 10 years in this business, I know all the best vendors to suit every taste and budget, and because I’ve worked closely with them, I know they can be trusted.”

Matheson’s business model works through referrals, which is why there’s no charge for coordination providing you use her services for floristry, and you even get a discount on flowers if you book three other vendors through her.

The floristry services are second to none: flowers are fresh, everything is customized, and Matheson and her team will create sample floral arrangements while you watch, so that you can decide together exactly how everything should look. Her shop also has a coffee bar and DIY space, where she runs workshops for anyone who wants to learn how to arrange flowers. She’ll even let you host your bachelorette there! She welcomes school groups and will go into schools to deliver workshops – always a success before Mother’s Day.

“I love business and marketing, and also artistry,” says Matheson. “The business gets applied to the creativity, and vice versa. Ultimately, I love people – I enjoy hearing their stories – and helping them put together the event of their dreams is my dream come true.”

Normally called the summer slide, this phenomenon has been exacerbated by school closings across the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many schools are still struggling to fully transition to remote learning, and math learning has been especially hard hit.

Mathnasium of North Vancouver, an after-school math and learning centre that helps children from Grade 1 to 12, has reopened safely to help students fight the COVID slide and prepare them for the upcoming academic year.

“Students have been off academic instruction since the middle of March and it’s really going to affect them in September when it’s time to start a new grade,” Mathnasium of North Vancouver director Alvin Shin says.

“This is the time to ramp up that knowledge and get fundamentals in place.”

In addition to reopening centres with health and safety protocols in place, Mathnasium has launched Mathnasium@Home, an online platform that offers real-time, face-to-face instruction that students can access wherever they have an internet connection.

“This provides a lot of flexibility for students to get that learning in at home while getting ready for September,” Shin says.

In addition, Mathansium of North Vancouver is offering its students unlimited sessions for July and August to help prepare them for the new school year.

Mathnasium combines quality, personalized instruction with learning games to help students excel in math. When students first enter the program, Mathnasium does a comprehensive assessment to understand their knowledge and skill gaps, as well as their strengths. After that, they will receive an individual learning plan to work through with their engaged, face-to-face instructors.

Mathnasium improves a child’s confidence in math by fostering an understanding of the foundational skills of math. The centre doesn’t give out homework, but students can bring in their assignments and work through it with Mathnasium’s instructors or do exam preparation. Students have a chance to earn rewards for completed assignments and participate in theme days.

“Learning math doesn’t have to be boring and tedious,” Shin says.

“We want them to come in and know that learning can be fun.”

We’ve marvelled how the carefully designed and manufactured pieces fit together tightly and can form just about anything we put our creative powers to work.

And while that may have been a form of play, the staff at Squamish-based TAG Panels Ltd. uses many of the same basic principles when it comes to constructing a new home.

That’s because they use prefabricated building sections - computer designed and built entirely in an indoor, climate-controlled site - to expertly piece together a home.

They have done away with the traditional method of first constructing the framework of the building that not only takes more time and labour, but leaves the building site and materials open to the harsh elements for weeks.

“We can take a normal building floor plan, 3-D model it using special software, and build in all the structures including insulation, and then ship it to the site where it can be assembled in five to seven days,” explains operations manager Simon Hayes.

On average, it takes roughly four weeks to build a large home inside TAG Panel’s factory.

That’s much quicker than traditional construction - framing alone can take six to eight weeks - since the panels include all of the structural beams, insulation, membranes and taping.

And building prefabricated panels in a climate-controlled setting results in a better quality end product, free from weather-related warping, which can lead to cracking drywall as residual moisture evaporates.

“You wouldn’t build a car outside in the rain, so why would you do that with a house?” Hayes says.

Another key in quickly assembling prefabricated panels comes from the fact that each panel delivered to the construction site is loaded on the truck in a sequential order, meaning the first pieces off the truck are the first ones needed - and so on down the line.

“It’s all done systematically, so the last panel to be put on the house, is the first one loaded onto the truck,” Hayes says.

What makes this type of construction possible is the ability to employ a computer-aided design that not only produces panels built to exacting and environmentally efficient specifications, it also cuts down on waste construction materials.

“Because we are modelling everything from the beginning, we have an accurate cut list for timber and can order the materials efficiently,” Hayes says. “So, for a 3,500-square-foot house, our waste bin was about twice the size of a regular, family garbage can.

“There were no piles of off-cut, wasted timber.”

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

Maybe you heard the news last Thursday that the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police called for the decriminalization of people found with illicit drugs for personal use.

article continues below

Kind of a big deal.

That is, of course, if you live in a Canadian city other than Vancouver.

As I was reminded by a retired high-ranking Vancouver police officer a few hours after news broke of the chiefs’ support for decriminalization, the addiction-is-not-a-crime-and-should-be-treated-as-a-health-care-issue position is not revolutionary in these parts.

In fact, Kash Heed joked that he should sue the chiefs for plagiarism.

That joke was based on a serious presentation he made Nov. 7, 2001 to the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs. At the time, Heed was an inspector with the Vancouver Police Department in charge of the drug and vice sections.

The focus of his presentation concerned marijuana, but he made clear what the VPD’s approach was on people caught with all types of drugs for personal use, including heroin and cocaine.

“The Vancouver Police Department’s policies focus drug enforcement resources on people who are making a profit from the sale of drugs,” Heed said almost two decades ago.

“Generally, simple possession charges are not pursued, regardless of the type of drug unless there are extenuating circumstances. We recognize that many of the people who use, or are addicted to drugs must be dealt with outside of the law enforcement system.”

In practical terms, he continued, Vancouver has “de facto decriminalization or de facto legalization” based on the wide margin of discretion afforded to the police. For marijuana specifically, Heed said he wasn’t alone in going on record in support of removal of criminal penalties for possession of the now-legal drug for personal use.

Nineteen years later, one of Heed’s former colleagues, Adam Palmer, spoke to reporters last Thursday as president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP). Palmer is, of course, Vancouver’s police chief.

See if you notice any similarities in what Palmer said in 2020 to what Heed said in 2001.

“Being addicted to a controlled substance is not a crime and should not be treated as such,” he said from the VPD’s Cambie Street precinct.

“We are calling for the decriminalization of illicit drugs for personal possession of illegal substances. The CACP endorses alternatives to criminal sanctions for simple possession of illicit drugs for personal consumption. In other words, we recommend that Canada’s enforcement-based approach for possession be replaced with a health care approach that diverts people towards social and healthcare services and away from the criminal justice system.”

He continued: “Instead of police agencies recommending or laying criminal charges, we are suggesting that partnerships be formed and strengthened between healthcare, government, police and social service providers to ensure drug users have timely access to appropriate health, social and treatment services.”

As president of the chiefs’ organization, Palmer was reiterating what he’s already said numerous times in his tenure as Vancouver chief — that drug addiction is not a crime, more treatment is needed and such treatment should include a safe supply of prescription alternatives to deadly street drugs.

That’s all on the record, and has been for some time.

So has the VPD’s support of injection sites, with Vancouver being the first city in North America to allow a legal site — Insite on East Hastings — which opened in September 2003.

But, as reporters heard Thursday, Canadian police forces continue to arrest people for simple possession of drugs.

Waterloo Police Service Chief Bryan Larkin, who joined the news conference via telephone, said Ontario typically has the highest charge rate across Canada for simple possession. But those charges are beginning to drop off, he said, although he didn’t provide statistics.

“What we’ve seen in the last two years is a decline in simple possession charges,” Larkin said.

“We started to see a trend, not only in Waterloo, but across Ontario where officers are looking at more diversion — individuals who are chronic drug users now actually being diverted and, or, put towards acute care intervention.”

At the same time, seeking an alternative to a charge heavily depends on what type of treatment facilities and programs are available in the cities in which police work. As we’ve seen in Vancouver, there aren’t enough.

Canada, however, has made some significant gains in harm reduction since Heed’s presentation in 2001 to the Senate committee, with 49 injection sites now operating in the country. Another 14 applications are under review from Health Canada.

Safe supply is also available in B.C., including prescription heroin for a select group of less than 200 people. The last time I spoke to Judy Darcy, B.C.’s Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, she told me 3,500 more people in B.C. receive medication-assisted treatment than when the NDP took office in July 2017.

Three forms of methadone, hydromorphone, morphine and Suboxone were among the medications she mentioned.

Regardless of those gains, decriminalization — whether defacto, or not — doesn’t legally exist in this country and now we have another organization calling for it to be written or edited in law.

Palmer and his fellow chiefs want a national task force created to research drug policy reform, and they want government to amend the section of the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act related to simple possession.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who often talks about evidence-based approaches to policy, has repeatedly said his government doesn’t support decriminalization. That position does not appear to have shifted with pressure from police chiefs.

Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Attorney-General David Lametti did not respond directly to the chiefs’ request for decriminalization in their joint response emailed to Glacier Media following the chiefs’ news conference.

But the ministers said they “welcome their endorsement of a holistic approach including harm reduction and diversion, and thank them for their recommendations.”

“Working with other orders of government, substance use experts, service providers, first responders, law enforcement and people with lived and living experience, our Government remains committed to advancing evidence-based responses to help reverse the trend of opioid overdose deaths and other substance-related harms in Canada,” their statement said.

As many British Columbians know, the call for decriminalization has not just been made by harm reduction advocates — and now police chiefs — but by the very people the Trudeau government and Canadians now rely on for expertise in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic: public health doctors.

In B.C., Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Vancouver Coastal Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Patricia Daly, have gone on record in their support of decriminalization — Henry in a report last year, and Daly along with other public health doctors in a report in 2001.

Both doctors have pointed to the mounting death toll of people dying in B.C. of a drug overdose, with an all-time high of 170 deaths in the province in May — a statistic that brought Henry to tears.

More than 5,000 people died in B.C. of a drug overdose between the start of 2016 and end of 2019. In the first five months of this year, 554 people lost their lives in B.C. to drug use, most of them using alone inside a private residence.

As of Friday, 187 people in B.C. had died of COVID-19.

For Heed, who went on to become police chief in West Vancouver and then attorney general of B.C., he said he’s disappointed that 19 years after he spoke to senators about the need to decriminalize drugs that politicians continue to be politicians.

“They’re the ones that are going to be able to change the policy,” he said.

“The chiefs can say whatever they want. They have an amount of discretion that their officers can use, they have an amount of discretion that their organization can use in setting policy. But the overall policy has to come from our elected officials. And when we get this same rhetoric from our politicians, you can see even after almost 20 years, there’s been no real movement on this issue.”

Note: After I posted this piece, I came across some comments on Facebook from former Downtown Eastside cop, Dave Dickson. So here’s a take from another veteran of the streets on decriminalization:

“OK, I’m a little confused. The chiefs of police have now [announced] it’s time to decriminalize drugs. I remember 15 years ago as a police officer reading a memo from the federal Crown saying there will be no more charges for possession of marijuana, cocaine or heroin because it wasn’t in the public interest. I have spoken personally to most of the drug dealers out there in the Hastings corridor [and asked] if they are bothered by the police, and they just laughed. So can anyone explain to me why they think this is worth even discussing, as I think it’s pretty much already decriminalized, and it hasn’t made a difference whatsoever to the streets.”

Re: First North Shore Hydrogen Fuelling Station Opens, July 1 news story.



North Vancouver’s new hydrogen fuelling station [at Westview Shopping Centre] represents a positive step in expanding the types of zero-emission vehicles available in the region. Hydrogen can play a key role in Canada’s clean energy future if the hydrogen being produced and used is zero- or low-carbon.



Not all hydrogen is created equal. The climate benefit of hydrogen is dependent on whether it is made with renewable energy (green), natural gas with carbon capture and storage technology (blue), or with fossil fuels without any attempt to capture greenhouse gas emissions (grey, brown, or black). Most hydrogen being produced globally today is grey.



Zero- or low-carbon hydrogen’s greatest value may lie in its potential to reduce carbon pollution from hard-to-decarbonize sectors and end uses, including heavy-duty freight transportation. Realizing hydrogen’s full potential will require robust national and provincial strategies that will identify the sectors that will most benefit, fund research on new and cost-effective technologies, account for regional contexts, and introduce policies to encourage production and use.

It has been two disconcerting weeks of mostly playing pattycake so far. A skeleton crew of cabinet ministers and Opposition critics sit by themselves and the rest appear on monitors. They’re getting the job done, but the spark is missing.

Sitting two sword lengths apart is one thing. Sitting hundreds of kilometres away and arguing with a grainy headshot on the wall is another. Question period is like yelling at your TV.

Cue Liberal MLA Ralph Sultan, (West Vancouver-Capilano). He’s the courtly grandfather (make that great-grandfather) of the house. But every so often he likes to rain hellfire down on the NDP, just to stay limber.

Sitting in a home office with a headset and waving a sheet of paper around, he unleashed an interrogative indictment this week of the NDP’s decision to cancel the big bridge project former premier Christy Clark started to replace the Massey Tunnel under the Fraser River.

He took it personally. Understandable, given his background. Engineers react to cancelling major projects like kids would if you smashed their phones against a rock.

Instead of the usual halting questions and long pauses before non-answers are formulated and delivered, he unloaded all his thoughts all at once.

“I wish to ask the minister nine questions arising from the government’s decision to cancel the 10-lane bridge across the Fraser River to replace the existing four-lane George Massey Tunnel built in 1956,” he began. (Sultan got his engineering degree at age 23, the year it opened.)

“I will simply read them into the record and await a written response at the minister’s pleasure, if that’s okay with you.” That precluded all the stops and starts and bought him room for some momentum.

He said a new bridge was announced in September, 2012 and finalized for bids in 2016.

The estimate was $3.5 billion but a bid came in almost $1 billion lower and work began.

Then, the NDP took over, cancelled “Christy Clark’s vanity project,” and decided they’d start over.

“So B.C. taxpayers took a $100 million hit (on work to that date) and got nothing in return. ... Are these figures more or less accurate? You never know in this business.”

He recalled that Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claire Trevena then hired a consultant to review the 10-lane bridge project.

Why was he hired after the cancellation, rather than before it? “Isn’t that, in a rather peculiar fashion, putting the cart before the horse?”

Sultan surmised that the review was ordered to provide a (retroactive) cover story for the cancellation.

“Does the minister agree?”

The consultant (Stan Cowdell) suggested the bridge was somewhat over-built. But Sultan said that just meant it would ease congestion for a longer period, out to 2045.

“Does the minister view that as negative or a positive?”

After digesting Cowdell’s huge report, Trevena hired yet another consulting engineer firm. It reported six months ago and Sultan summarized the options:

• a deep-bore tunnel — $12 to $17 billion

• an immersed tunnel like the old one, only bigger — $4 billion to $5 billion

• an eight-lane bridge instead of 10, with no apparent capability for eventual rapid transit — $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion.

“Is there a smidgen of regret?” Sultan wondered. “Does the minister feel any remorse?

“Or should we conclude that capital costs are really not part of this government’s mindset when it comes to public infrastructure decision-making?

“I really look forward to your answers.”

No regret and no remorse, said Trevena’s response. She’ll give longer answers in writing, but said she took “a very rational approach that the previous project was too big for the region” and that the Liberals “didn’t do due diligence” on options.

She said she’ll settle on a new plan later this year.

In the meantime, $40 million has been budgeted for safety improvements to the old tunnel, which is somehow labelled under the heading of replacing it.

If the NDP had left it alone, the bridge would be about two years away from completion by now. Instead, they’re looking at more expensive options, another lengthy round of consultations and a ribbon-cutting probably seven years away, if it happens at all.

Regarding Coun. Megan Curren’s idea to eliminate natural gas heating in the District of North Vancouver, she may be surprised to know that electric baseboard heating is the most expensive option to heating a home. To heat a modestly sized home in Deep Cove with electric heat these last few winters is about $750 per month. Does she have a plan to offset that cost to future owners of new “green” homes by reducing taxes by a similar amount?

Our province is rich with natural gas and it leaves a small greenhouse gas footprint. Rather than burdening ourselves with unsustainable monetary rises in utility bills, we should look to increase our less expensive and sustainable self-dependence on our own natural gas resources here at home.

Travelling in the back seat through Stanley Park toward Lions Gate Bridge was an encouraging sign we were on our way home. It seemed only natural that the Douglas firs and hemlocks that lined the causeway heralded our entrance to the North Shore, with snow-topped Ch'ich'iyúy Elxwíkn, the Twin Sisters, in the distance.

article continues below

Stanley Park is symbolic for many people here on the North Shore as the link between the rest of the world and the emerald forest where we live.

At the top of the hill across the footbridge on Coal Harbour, Lord Stanley invites us “to the use and enjoyment of people of all colours, creeds and customs for all time. ...” (Say, should that statue still be there? Should a British bloke welcome us to the park that is on unceded Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh land? Well, whatever, it’s a nice sentiment if you don’t consider the source.)

I mention the statue because I passed it often enough cycling from work downtown back home. As a daily commuter, I would occasionally take a break from the relentless noise of the causeway and dilly dally up the footbridge, past Lord Stanley, by Malkin Bowl, the arbutus garden, the petting zoo and then charge down Pipeline Road.

Rather than electing to ride on the roadway up the steep hill to the bridge entrance, I would deke across to the Hanson trail, a wide gravel path created to allow people in mobility assistance devices to access the real park. Named after Rick Hanson, this route suited me fine when it was light out and sometimes even in the dark when I wanted to feel the forest at night. There were the same two nesting ducks in a little pond that would appear in spring and disappear in summer. Once I saw a squirrel scolding an impassive porcupine lodged in a tall broadleaf maple. Banana slugs oozed along, oblivious. Birds. Magical quiet.

This must surely be what Lord Stanley was offering to all: a place for a natural respite from city life. He wasn’t thinking about theatres, restaurants, aquariums, a zoo, or busloads of tourists. He wasn’t thinking about parking revenues or traffic management. He was thinking that people might want to visit the park to leave the city behind. (Though he might have been OK with the cricket pitch.)

The real attraction of a park is not its “attractions.”

Riding a bicycle in the park isn’t really about transportation per se, though a few of us use it occasionally to return from the city to the North Shore. It’s more about recreating, experiencing the natural environment. Riding and walking through the park is a way to experience its majesty without bringing the city along. If it were up to me, we would shut the park to motorized vehicle traffic.

This does not need to be exclusionary. We can work out ways for people of all colours, creeds and customs to access Stanley Park’s leafy, beachy escapes. Electric tri-shaws can wheel the elderly, or people with disabilities or just people who choose that mode of travel. People with no accessibility challenges could take advantage of micro-mobility devices. We could build an electric shuttle service or an at-grade e-train to transport people to where they want to go. Or extend the existing public bus service throughout the park. Tourists could rent e-bikes, e-boards or e-scooters to replace the belching diesel buses. Living buses with multiple riders are super fun.

There are a million ways around traffic jams in X̱wáýx̱way-Stanley Park. Maintaining vehicle access is not one of them.

Heather Drugge is a sustainable transportation advocate who has used her bike for transportation for 20 years. She’s looking at getting an e-bike and maybe a jetpack next. Northshoremoves@gmail.com.",[]

Re: Care Homes Will Soon Allow Visitors, July 1 front-page story.

article continues below

A thank-you to North Shore News reporter Jane Seyd [and interview subjects with parents in long-term care] Diane Montgomery and Kathie Boyd for a good news story of hope.

I was beginning to wonder if I was in the minority as a daughter who visited her mom frequently, missed her dearly and has been struggling daily. The voices of the long-term care families have been so quiet.

It was very touching to read this story and to be heard. My fingers are crossed I will also be allowed to hold my mom’s hand and let her know she was never forgotten.

I too was able to visit my mom through her patio door window, until she was moved to an inside room. I had a similar heartbreaking visit on July 3 in the lobby at Lynn Valley Care Centre. When I spoke to my mom the next day, I realized the depth of how much we were both set back by the experience. With no hope for a second visit until Oct. 1, based on the calculations of number of visits allowed per week divided by number of residents, it’s challenging to answer questions like: “Are you coming to visit today?”

The news of the government kicking in funding to hire staff to accommodate family visits was music to my ears. It should be possible now to increase the number of visits per week. Once again, a ray of hope.

Like Diane and Kathie, I am a hands-on daughter. Visits from family members helps to lighten the load for the care aides and nurses.

I believe we are all missing each other. I hope as the help with family visits increases, the communication lines open and families can feel less and less like they are being left in the dark.

My heart and my hopes go out to all families who are missing their loved ones. The steps it will take to successfully improve the lives of seniors in long-term care have now been simplified ... let’s visit, safely, often and as soon as possible. We’ve been patient and calm, please, grant this wish.

This year’s presidential campaign in the United States will be very different from the ones of elections past, with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting public gatherings, events and conventions.

article continues below

Research Co. has been tracking this democratic process, and some themes are starting to emerge. The last presidential contest that saw an incumbent seek a new term took place in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama ultimately defeated Republican Mitt Romney. I had the privilege of following that election from start to finish, and there are many differences between what we saw eight years ago and the mood of Americans in 2020.

In July 2012, there was no clear frontrunner in the race for the White House. Obama and Romney were supported by 47% of decided voters across the United States, with Independents barely breaking in favour of the incumbent president. Obama could count on the votes of most women and young voters, while Romney connected well with men and older voters.

This year, the situation is dissimilar. Trump, the Republican incumbent, sits 10 points behind prospective Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden at the national level. Across the country, in a survey that was completed before the Independence Day celebrations, 53% of decided voters said they would cast a ballot for Biden, while 43% would support Trump.

Independents, who backed Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, are no longer happy with the president. In this crucial group, Biden is ahead of Trump by 15 points (54% to 39%). Unless the numbers tighten among American voters who do not align themselves with the Democrats or the Republicans, Trump’s chances will fade.

In our tracking, Trump’s approval rating dropped to 40% this month, down six points since we checked in early June, well into the COVID-19 pandemic but before the protests about racial equality dominated media coverage. An approval rating hovering around 50% is usually an indicator of a lost election for an incumbent president. Trump is significantly below this threshold right now.

Trump’s approval rating is particularly bad with African Americans (21%) and Latino and Hispanic Americans (32%). These two groups are usually supportive of Democrats, so the results are not earth-shattering. Still, his numbers also fell to 46% among White Americans.

When we asked Americans to select six words out of a list of 18 to describe Trump, almost three in five selected “arrogant” (57%). Of the six words chosen, the only one that is remotely positive is “strong” (36%). More than a third of Americans perceive their current head of state as “dishonest” (40%), “uncaring” (39%), “foolish” (also 39%) and “out of touch” (34%).

This does not mean that Americans are enthralled by Biden. When we pose the same question about the prospective Democratic Party nominee, about three in 10 Americans describe him as “intelligent” (32%), “compassionate” (also 32%), “down to earth” (30%), “honest” (28%), “weak” (28%) and “out of touch” (28%).

We could look at Biden’s results as superior to Trump’s, since only one of the six words is overly negative (“weak.”) These numbers are very different from what Barack Obama and Mitt Romney posted in July 2012.

At that time, 50% of Americans regarded Obama as “intelligent” and 46% felt the same way about Romney. In an exceedingly polarized nation, the numbers on this indicator are significantly lower for both Biden (32%) and Trump (31%).

Right now, Biden is clearly favoured at the national level, but we still need to look into the way specific American states will behave. The Democrats hope to win the three jurisdictions that took Trump to the White House (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and perhaps make inroads in Florida and Ohio.

No election is decided four months in advance. In any case, three indicators point to Biden enjoying unique advantages in 2020: Trump’s weak approval rating, reminiscent of what Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush posted in 1976 and 1992, his difficulties in reconnecting with Independents, and a lower proportion of voters willing to cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.

In 2016, almost 6% of all cast ballots in the American presidential election went to third-party candidates, most notably Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Jill Stein of the Green Party. This year, Americans are not looking at third parties as much as they were four years ago, with only 3% selecting Libertarian Jo Jorgensen or “some other candidate.” However, we collected our data before a man called Kanye Omari West flirted with becoming the Ross Perot of the 21st Century.

Three people in B.C. have died in the past day from the virus that spawned a global pandemic, making the death toll in the province now 186. Of the 162 people actively fighting off the disease, 17 are in hospital, with three of those in intensive care. The rest are self-isolating at home.

More than 88% of those infected in the province, or 2,660, have recovered.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

The two acknowledged that there has been a second case of exposure to the virus in a strip club – at the No. 5 Orange bar on Main Street. That is the second instance of exposure at a strip club, following one at Brandi's Exotic Show Lounge on Hornby Street in late June.

Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the No. 5 Orange on July 1.

""If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop,"" Dix and Henry said.

494,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/opinion/columnists/prest-it-s-time-to-change-offensive-sports-team-names-1.24166457,PREST: It’s time to change offensive sports team names,['Andy Prest'],,"It took a global anti-racism movement to do it, but it seems that one of the most blatantly offensive bits of mainstream culture is about to change.

Yes, the Washington Racist Slurs professional football team announced last week it will be conducting a “thorough review of the team’s name” in light of “recent events around our country and feedback from our community.” The team’s name isn’t actually the “Racist Slurs,” although it is, as far as I know, the only North American pro sports team name whose definition in the Canadian Oxford Dictionary begins with the note: “dated offensive.”

article continues below

There are many ways to define offensive and there are certainly grey areas in some of the discourse over systemic racism, but this issue has very little grey. If you still aren’t sure about the name in question, or any similar such troublesome team name, ask yourself this: how would you feel approaching a complete stranger who is a member of the minority group in question and addressing that person to their face by that name? Would you be a little nervous about it? Is there a chance that person may be offended or hurt or shocked by someone calling them that name? Would you be the least bit worried that that person might consider, even for a split second, punching you right in the mouth?

If the answer to any of these question is yes, then that is most likely not a very good name for a sports team. And the Washington name is clearly the worst of them – even racists must look at it and be like, “dang, that’s blatant.”

Of course, people have been trying to get the Washington professional football team’s name changed for more than 50 years. George Preston Marshall, a co-owner of the team from 1932 to 1969, was the man who picked the name. Under Marshall’s watch, the Washington team was the last NFL franchise to integrate Black players. Also under his watch, and perhaps not coincidentally, the team was mostly terrible at winning football games.

Current Washington majority owner Dan Snyder has long defended the name, telling USA Today’s Erik Brady in 2013 that he would “NEVER” change the name, clarifying that “you can use all caps.”

NEVER, however, like so many other things, looks like it might be coming to an end in 2020. The cynic in me has a nagging feeling that the only “community feedback” that truly motivated the Washington team to review the name was from companies like Nike, FedEx and Pepsi, whose recent feedback about the name stands to cost the team millions of dollars in sponsorship and merchandising. You can’t shame those who have no shame, but it’s nice to know that a few companies interested in being good global citizens can still get things done with a little bit of empathy and several billion dollars’ bankroll.

Anyway, no matter how it happened, now is the moment. And it’s not just Washington either – other teams with other questionable names are also facing a reckoning. The Cleveland professional baseball team also recently announced they will look into the possibility of changing their name. There are also football teams in Kansas City and Edmonton that are facing questions, and a baseball team in Atlanta that last year was still handing out foam tomahawks and encouraging fans to do a “tomahawk chop” chant during games.

It is actually rather astonishing how many of these names and traditions have lasted this long, even while other pro and amateur teams have changed their names and moved on over the years.

Closer to home, change might be stirring at Burnaby’s Simon Fraser University, where the sports teams are called the Clan in honour of the school’s Scottish heritage. The name no doubt comes from a noble place, but for very obvious reasons it is now problematic, particularly with the school playing in a sports conference based in the United States. Change that “C” to a “K,” a switch that is imperceptible when spoken aloud, and you’ve got a team that would only be cheered by people in white hoods or the White House.

And so several SFU student-athletes have spoken out against the name through an “I am not your Clansman” social media campaign, and as of Monday afternoon more than 8,500 people had signed an online petition asking for the name to be changed. This one too seems like it will happen, as last week the SFU athletics department committed to a review of the name with the potential of having a new nickname by this fall.

These are small steps on the long road to addressing systemic racism, but they are meaningful. People love their sports teams, and for better or worse, these franchises have a large influence on the cultural climate of the day.

A name change won’t erase your favourite team’s history or take away its championships. It also will not bring an end to the fight for equality. But it is a good place to start.

Much of the North Shore was built up when gas was as cheap as it was leaded. A single-family home could be purchased on a single income. And there was scarcely a notion of the environment, let alone a desire to protect it.

We now know the real cost of petrochemicals. We don’t expect everyone to live in ever-sprawling, car-dependent suburbs. Yet, for some reason, our thinking towards our streets has barely evolved.

The District of North Vancouver has more than 350 kilometres of paved roads yet only 189 kilometres of sidewalks. Our street lamps don’t adequately light intersections.

Pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure has grown, but it is still apparent that it has only ever been an afterthought – sometimes a dangerous afterthought. The painted bike lane on Esplanade where North Vancouver resident Mike McIntosh was killed in January 2019 is a perfect example.

Undoubtedly city council will face some blowback from the motoring public, but we urge them to get on with implementing the strategy, sooner rather than later.

As these changes roll out, the city won’t just become safer for pedestrians and cyclists. We’d bet it will become a heck of a lot nicer for all residents and visitors too, no matter how they choose to get around.

But that’s about all she’s got. In terms of actual relief from the stunning rate hikes being imposed, all she can do is cite a piece of new legislation that tackles bits and pieces of reforms over an extended period of time.

article continues below

As the legislature resumed sitting on Monday, it was clear off the top that the government is in as big a jam as residents are when it comes to responding to the condo insurance crisis.

Opposition Liberals rounded up a fresh new round of horror stories was brought to Robinson’s attention. But all she had to offer were some new measures in the bill that would make a marginal difference at best.

• Leanne O’Grady heads a strata council of 57 row houses in Penticton, which is grappling with a jaw-dropping hike in their insurance premium. It was $20,000 last year and this year, the only quote they could get was from a company that will charge $179,000.

She said they have no viable options to cope with that kind of hike.

• A Ladner complex got word on New Year’s Eve there was no company willing to insure their building. They finally found one that charged 310 per cent more than last year.

• A Coquitlam strata saw the premium double, which added $115 a month more to the maintenance fee. The water damage deductible went from $15,000 to $150,000.

Liberals quoted one senior resident: “How am I supposed to enjoy retirement when I don’t have any money?”

There was also word that a Richmond complex was denied insurance entirely, solely because of the earthquake risk.

A broker is reportedly dealing with several other complexes there in the same dilemma.

The cascading effects of those situations on mortgages and resale values could potentially widen the scope of this crisis considerably.

The Opposition is sharpening its focus on the problem because the concerns keep pouring in.

It’s also demanding direct government help for condo owners, which could turn into a very complicated proposition.

Some Liberals have admitted publicly there’s no one single solution and even their ideas to date wouldn’t make the problem go away.

Those ideas include waiving the four per cent tax charged on insurance premiums, a tax that will bring in vastly more revenue this year than it has in the past.

Robinson quoted the Liberals admissions back to them on Monday. It was nice to see both parties in agreement. But dismaying to realize the thing they agree on is that the situation is almost hopeless.

She also cited various ideas in the bill introduced last month that purport to address the problem.

One section bans referral fees from insurance companies to property managers, something flagged in an independent report by a condo association.

(An experienced property Victoria manager advised me they had never heard of this before and after consulting widely, found only one instance of such a thing, at Whistler. That firm had to advise all clients it’s never had anything to do with referral fees.)

Robinson said she was shocked to learn of referral fees — a.k.a. kickbacks. But they might be so uncommon that curbing them won’t make much of a difference.

She defended the bill as an effort to round up good ideas from all quarters, even the Opposition, and make them law.

And she stressed the Financial Service Authority’s conclusions in an interim report: “There are no quick fixes.”

“We recognize that we have some work to do,” she said.

The bill will “help mitigate some of the challenges … so people can rest assured that there is a government that has their interests at heart.”

It’s a badly needed start on several reforms, but it doesn’t make a dent in gigantic premium hikes.

One section allows boards to dip into reserve funds to cover a broader range of costs — such as sudden huge hikes in their insurance premiums.

But O’Grady, in Penticton, said their reserve would be almost entirely consumed paying this year’s premium.

She said the bill “ is promising more promises in the future.

“It’s not much help right now.”

In this country, we have started to flatten the curve. Ontario and Quebec are not quite as far along as other provinces, but their spread rate of the virus has slowed considerably.

article continues below

If we stick to adhering to public health protocols – keeping our physical distance, wearing a mask in many situations, not congregating in large crowds – there is every reason to think the curve will continue to flatten while the pandemic continues.

Not so on the other side of the border.

The COVID-19 situation in the United States is almost out of control in many places. States like California, Arizona, Texas and Florida are getting steamrolled by a deadly virus that is rampaging through them.

There seem to be many reasons for the stark differences between the two countries’ experience in fighting off the virus.

Perhaps the most important difference is that Canada’s response to COVID-19 is being driven and determined by public health officials, not by politicians.

People like B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and federal public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam have been in charge for the most part and they are being guided by science, not politics.

The country’s political leaders, meanwhile, have primarily been responsible for devising financial aid packages for the millions of people hit hardest by the virus and have stayed out of the health side of the response.

Contrast that to the United States where, in some cases elected officials (notably President Donald Trump) publicly clash with public health experts and ignore or override their advice.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the respected U.S. infectious disease expert, has almost disappeared from public view. Evidently, that is because the Trump administration does not want him offering the country expert advice.

Can you imagine if the B.C. government tried to muzzle Dr. Bonnie Henry? A pitchfork-waving mob would instantly materialize in the streets.

Another key difference is that Canadians tend to follow rules created for the benefit of the larger community. We don’t chafe under state controls and when someone like Dr. Henry says, for example, that there will be no mass gatherings of people, there generally is not (the public protests against racism are notable exceptions).

Americans, on the other hand, love to boast about their constitutionally protected personal rights and have been thumbing their noses at things like crowd limits since the pandemic began. In fact, the current surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. can be traced back to the Memorial Day long weekend in late May, when huge crowds gathered to celebrate.

Finally, it cannot be a coincidence that a country with a public health care system is doing so much better fighting COVID-19. It allows us to use a centralized approach to taking on the virus.

The U.S., on the other hand, has a private system that has led to a decentralized approach. The result is a hodge-podge of results (within states, some neighboring counties have differing “lockdown” rules; some hospitals do not even report case numbers or deaths).

Two countries side by side, yet we could not be further apart in this pandemic.

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Seemed odd at the time, considering the mayor a few months previous supported an 8.2% tax hike going into council’s 2020 budget deliberations; council ultimately agreed on 7%.

article continues below

But, as regular readers will recall, Stewart had an explanation for what seemed like an about-face on his property tax stance.

“Well, when budgets come out, I like to support staff,” he said in response to a question from Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung in February. “And so I have each year said that I support the staff’s initial recommendations, but then listen to council debates and make my final vote accordingly. So in this case, however, I think going through two years of this [debate] that an early cap is important.”

A couple weeks later, council went at it again over the mayor’s motion and eventually landed on directing staff to report back on a 5% scenario in time for a mid-year update on what the budget looks like for 2021.

Then the world turned upside down.

People continue to get sick with COVID-19 and die, people continue to lose their jobs and the City of Vancouver is still reeling from the pandemic’s effect, having for a stretch lost up to $5 million per week in revenues.

Now we’re in July and city staff has prepared that anticipated mid-year budget forecast. It goes before council next Wednesday.

The report runs 17 pages and is filled with numbers, percentages and scenarios, including what it would take to arrive at a 5% tax hike, even as the city grapples with its financial future.

Let’s take a look …

Off the top, a 5% increase would see the owner of a median single-family home assessed at $1.6 million pay another $146 in 2021. The owner of a median strata property assessed at $688,000 would be dinged another $64 in tax.

Those bills, of course, don’t include increases in utility fees, which are forecast to go up by six to 10%, according to the staff report.

For a 5% scenario to unfold, it would mean a $17 million gap would have to be filled. That $17 million, by the way, is equivalent to a 2% tax hike.

So that’s why staff has, so far, said a 7% increase is what makes more sense at this time, when considering fixed costs, collective agreements and infrastructure work for 2021.

Staff makes it clear that any budget adjustments must come from service areas that are funded by tax. And the biggest service areas are the police and fire departments.

A total of 78% of their budgets is funded by taxpayers. So it’s no surprise that cuts or delays to those departments’ budgets play a major part in arriving at the 5% tax hike scenario.

The police department would be hardest hit, with a $6 million budget decrease that would mean a delay in hiring 20 officers and 10 staff. The department would also have to hold off on replacing up to 55 positions left vacant from retirements.

The effect?

“Reductions would lead to slower response times to emergency calls, reduced service levels to citizens and businesses, limited ability to respond to non-emergency calls, greater risk of unsolved crimes and cases being lost in court and increased rate of officer burnout,” the report said.

The hit to fire and rescue services would be $3 million and mean no new hiring and a delay in hiring 25 new firefighters, which would “reduce the ability of the department to effectively respond to all incident types and lead to potential increased risk of delayed fire response.”

It would also mean a delay in hiring two new fire prevention staff, which would slow down the department’s efforts “to reduce the volume and severity of fire calls through targeted community risk reduction activities, especially in more marginalized communities in the Downtown Eastside and at single-room-occupancy hotels.”

Also on hold would be the hiring of an assistant chief and “lieutenant of diversity and outreach” positions to “build on culture and diversity, increase focus on critical social issues and expand efforts to attract and maintain a workforce that represents Vancouver.”

Other cuts or delays to people and projects would have to come in the parks department ($1.5 million), engineering and public works ($1.4 million), libraries ($1 million) and other service areas, including funding capital infrastructure.

Staff makes it clear these are just examples, but are placed against a backdrop of uncertainty, as the pandemic persists and economic forecasts remain fluid.

The mayor himself is worried that not all residents will be able to afford to pay their taxes this year or next. That includes owners of business properties, too.

So is a 5% tax-hike cap realistic in these times?

That question has become further unanswerable and complicated with movements to “defund police,” mounting evidence of a second wave of COVID-19 to come and more anticipated job loss.

The staff report also makes it clear that senior government support is needed to fully restart city operations and “is critical to the city’s recovery plans.”

Staff says the city is now looking at a $124 million revenue decline this year. More than 1,500 city workers remain laid off, pay cuts are still in effect and community centres remain closed, albeit two of them providing refuge for homeless people.

February, as all of us can agree, seems like such a long time ago.

Last year, when Research Co. and Glacier Media asked this question, there was near-total consensus about the flag, the Canadian Armed Forces and the domestic economy. Significantly fewer respondents felt great about the monarchy, Parliament and the justice system.

article continues below

One year later, after the COVID-19 pandemic altered the way we live and communicate, the perceptions on some on these institutions and features went through noticeable shifts. The biggest drop is observed on the Canadian economy, which went from making 80% of Canadians proud in 2019 to only 53% in 2020. This is not shocking, as economic activity slowed dramatically during the lockdown and the unemployment rate is now in double digits.

Two other items that are near the top in 2020 underwent double-digit declines from 2019: the Canadian Armed Forces (74%, down 15 points) and the Canadian flag (82%, down 11 points).

While 64% of Canadians admit that hockey makes them proud, this number represents an eight-point drop from 2019. It has been difficult to get as worked up about the national sport as last year, with leagues – professional, youth and beer – being forced to cancel or postpone contests.

Three in four Canadians (75%, down two points) say the health care system elicits feelings of pride. Quebec is partly responsible for this result. The province has traditionally been more critical about this feature of Canadian life than all others, and this year is no exception. While only 61% of Quebecers are proud of health care, the proportion in all other provinces and regions fluctuates between 79% and 81%.

A similar proportion of Canadians (66%) say they are proud of the state of democracy in Canada, down four points in a year. We went through a divisive federal election late last year, as the regional breakdowns outline. The two areas that elected the fewest Liberal Party candidates in last year’s election to the House of Commons are less likely to be satisfied: Saskatchewan and Manitoba at 63% and Alberta at 58%.

Once again, the lowest-rated item on our list is the monarchy, dropping seven points to reach 40% across the country. Quebec pushes the national average down (31%), while British Columbia emerges as the most monarchist province in Canada (50%).

Unless a vaccine against COVID-19 is found relatively quickly, we will not have any official visits from Royal Family members that could sway these numbers. We found out earlier this year that indifference towards the monarchy has risen across the country, and the prospect of Prince Charles becoming king is not particularly thrilling for many Canadians.

Still, not all institutions and features of the country fared worse this year than in 2019. More than half of Canadians say they are proud of the Canadian justice system (55%, up 15 points) and Parliament (53%, up eight points).

In the case of the legislative branch, Canadians who voted for the governing Liberal Party are more likely to feel proud (72%) than those who cast ballots for the Conservative Party (42%) and the New Democratic Party (NDP) (41%). This is not unforeseen. When I had the chance to ask this question during Stephen Harper’s tenure in Ottawa, Tory voters were consistently euphoric while Grit supporters were dismayed.

The past few months have brought a new emphasis on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, especially in light of discussions related to racism and fairness. Seven in 10 Canadians (71%, up five points) say they are proud of multiculturalism, while more than three in five feel the same way about Indigenous culture (62%, up six points) and bilingualism (61%, up six points).

As expected, Quebec boasts the highest level of pride for bilingualism (71%). On Indigenous culture, pride reaches 67% in both British Columbia and Ontario. Multiculturalism is regarded positively by 77% of Canadians aged 18 to 34, but falls slightly to 70% among those aged 35 to 54 and to 66% among those aged 55 and over.

The differences between men and women are only sizable on three topics. Women are more like to feel pride in the health care system and multiculturalism (79% and 75% respectively) than men (70% and 66% respectively). Men switch on the monarchy, where 45% of female respondents are proud, but only 35% of male respondents join them.

The past 12 months were far from perfect, and the challenges are shown in the way Canadians are re-evaluating their relationship with what is supposed to define us. Our economy is no longer one of the top items on the list. The increases in pride for multiculturalism, Indigenous culture and bilingualism suggest that the country is growing fonder of what can be accomplished with consideration and an open mind.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 6, 2020.

The provincial government has extended its temporary authorization, which allows businesses with food-primary and liquor-primary licences to sell and deliver packaged liquor products, alongside meal purchases, for off-site consumption.

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

The centre, one of the oldest in Metro Vancouver, is constantly trying new things and adjusting its programming to better suit its climbers. That’s why it’s currently the only gym in B.C. to employ a World Cup certified route setter.

“We’re on the forefront, a step ahead of the others,” says Henry Wang, owner of The Edge Climbing Centre since 1998. “We’ve been here the longest, and we know what our clients want because we’ve been through the cyclical nature of how climbing works.”

The route setter designs the climbing wall routes, also known as climbing problems, using a combination of technical craft and artistic representation. A route setter holding a World Cup certification is better able to accommodate the route for all sizes and skill levels, and is also able to add another level of complexity to the various problems he or she designs.

“It’s a massive advantage,” says Wang, who has been climbing since 1995. “When a non-certified person sets a route, they’re only setting things they know in their limited experience. Having a World Cup certified route setter means there’s a higher minimum standard for everything set.”

The Edge Climbing Centre recently installed a 200-move climbing problem that wraps around the entire wall. The complex route encompasses all levels by starting at a beginner level and then becoming progressively more difficult as the route unfolds.

“Nobody’s been able to climb the whole thing yet,” says Wang. “But then, the whole point of climbing is to challenge yourself and to push yourself a little harder each time. It’s something you can measure over the course of a few weeks or a few years.”

When Bozena Latko arrived in Canada from Poland more than 20 years ago, she knew she wanted to have her own business. But life got in the way. She had her two children and stayed at home with them for 11 years, then went to work as a SuperStore supervisor. Over the years, she considered running her own business. “I thought about opening a daycare at one point, and then later I was planning to buy a restaurant because I love to cook and entertain,” she says. All her ideas drew on her experience as a homemaker. Then earlier this year, along came the perfect opportunity: Buying the Life Made Easy franchise for West Vancouver and the North Shore. “I’ve looked after my home for decades and I know how to clean,” she says. “My work in the grocery store means I can talk to customers and understand their needs. Now that my children have grown up, it’s my opportunity to think about how I want my future to be.”

The Life Maid Easy business uses only environmentally friendly, pet-friendly, non-hazardous products. Initially Latko wasn’t convinced. “I couldn’t believe that they would work as effectively as the products I was familiar with, but I’ve been amazed at the results – how clean and shiny everything becomes,” she says. “I also realise I don’t get headaches anymore even after hours of cleaning. I’m the person who’s most exposed to the products, so it’s important for my own health that they are clean and safe.”

Latko and her team offer a full range of services including regular, annual or occasional, move-in/move-out, laundry and bed changes. The hourly rate is $89 for two cleaners, and the team guarantees a good service. “I will always go the extra mile,” she says. “I think it’s a Polish trait. We don’t just show up – we never leave our work incomplete.”

Now that the idea of having her own business has become reality, what’s next on the cards for Latko? A move from South Vancouver to the North Shore “It’s my dream to live in Deep Cove – I think it’s just the most beautiful place,” she says.

We are blessed with acres of untouched rainforest in B.C., and experiencing the sights and sounds of the coast, including globally renowned Desolation Sound, is a rite of passage for British Columbians, and a must for international travellers.

Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours and Homfray Lodge offer an intimate experience which helps connect people to nature and the authentic B.C. coast. Equipped to navigate through hidden channels, the Pacific Bear, a refurbished fishing boat, offers you incomparable views of Desolation Sound, virtually unchanged from its earliest discovery. Says Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours founder George Bartel: “It’s a twist on traditional cruising… I’ve been in the travel business for almost 40 years, and I’m interested in reshaping how people experience this part of the world. It’s an experience that you are unable to find anywhere else.”

Passengers of the Pacific Bear will have an all-inclusive wilderness lodge experience which includes a stay at Homfray Lodge on the remote waters of Homfray Channel in Desolation Sound, as well as Grizzly Bears tours.

Desolation Sound has the warmest waters of the B.C. coast with temperatures in the Sound often exceeding 22°C (75°F) from June to September. It is the second-deepest sound in North America, reaching depths of 2,400 feet with peaks rising up to 8,000 feet from the water. With less than a knot of current, many global boaters and sea kayakers regard Desolation Sound as a spectacular destination.

This coastal haven of deep fjords and towering 7,000-foot peaks, boasts spectacular waterfalls, glacier-fed rivers and magnificent Coastal Mountains in the backdrop. And the small size of the boat allows guests to get up-close-and-personal with the fjords. “On the boat, there’s a rooftop where you can have lunch. We stop at the waterfalls and get so close that we can feel the splash of the water on our cheeks,” says Sabrina Ouellette, reservations coordinator at Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours, which runs the tours.

Exclusive and personal, Pacific Coastal Cruises & Tours and stays at Homfray Lodge have tailored different kinds of journeys for you, where you can access the best places on the BC coast.

“I recognize that buying or selling a home involves some of the biggest decisions that most people will ever make,” says Michelle Vaughan, a Realtor® with Royal Le Page Sussex Realty on the North Shore. “I’m excited to be able to facilitate such an important process.”

article continues below

Michelle has put together 8 tips for first-time buyers to take into consideration when they’re navigating the ins and outs of the real estate world:

1) Talk to a mortgage broker. Mortgage brokers will help you determine what you can afford. Otherwise, you end up looking at homes out of your price range, and that can be discouraging.

2) Beware of extra costs. There are typically costs associated with buying a home that aren’t in the purchase price including closing costs (legal paperwork) and property transfer tax (PTT). If you purchase a newly built home, you may also be charged GST. Check with your Realtor® if you’re not sure (which brings us to point #3).

3) Find a Realtor®. Finding a Realtor® who understands that you are new to house shopping and is willing to help you through the process will make the whole experience easier, less risky, and more productive. Ask people you know for recommendations. Don’t ever be afraid to ask your Realtor® questions!

4) Needs vs. wants. Make sure you differentiate your NEEDS from your WANTS. These can evolve when you start looking, but you need to start somewhere. You Realtor® can help you with this part of the process, too.

5) Let your Realtor® be your guide. Your Realtor® will guide you through writing an offer, including the best subjects to incorporate, such as financing and inspection. If you are looking at a strata property, make sure you request all the documents and thoroughly check the minutes (to see what is going on in the complex), the financial records, and a depreciation report, if available.

6) Once your offer is accepted, be diligent. After getting an accepted offer, do anything that needs to be done to satisfy your subjects. This can include working with a mortgage broker on financing, or getting an inspection done.

7) The deposit cheque: now it’s official. When you remove your subjects and give your deposit cheque, you have what is called a firm and binding contract. This means you are committed to following through on the sale. Your Realtor® will let you know the next steps to take.

8) Home insurance. Make sure you obtain home insurance before you close.

The Edge Climbing Centre in North Vancouver has been offering climbing parties for children for over twenty years.

""We're now seeing parents who attended birthday parties themselves as children arranging parties for their own kids,"" says Henry Wang, owner of The Edge Climbing Centre. ""It's a really cool thing to see.""

article continues below

While children make up 90 percent of the party bookings at The Edge Climbing Centre, Henry has seen a number of adult parties as well.

""We have people come for their pre-wedding parties and companies bringing employees for team building exercises. There's no difference whether you're 60 years-old or six years-old; you just turn up with a smile and we take care of the rest.""

To start, The Edge Climbing Centre's experienced and qualified staff will help participants with any necessary safety gear and make sure everyone knows the typical commands that they might need.

""For example,"" Henry explains, ""if you want off the wall immediately, you'll know exactly how to communicate that to the staff.""

The parties are designed for children with very little or no climbing experience. The Edge Climbing Centre staff gives a small demonstration to show your child how it's completely safe if they fall off the wall and on to the thick crash mat below.

""Once the kids have started climbing, our staff generally has a good idea of their capabilities,"" Henry says. ""The more nervous kids will be placed on the easier walls, but older children who are more adventurous or physically fit will be put on something a little more challenging. It really depends on the group.""

Because the client-to-staff ratio is low in these climbing party reservations, The Edge Climbing Centre is happy for parents to simply drop their kids off to have fun with their friends and leave for their own activities.

""We're fully staffed and able to take care of your children,"" says Henry, ""Parents have a number of options. They're welcome to drop the kids off and leave, stay and take photos of the fun, or even join in and climb themselves.""

After the climbing fun is ended, The Edge Climbing Centre has a private lounge that's available free of charge to continue the birthday party.

""We don't provide food,"" notes Henry, ""but many parents bring cake or pizza and they're welcome to book the lounge for an hour after the climbing at no extra cost.""

“My priority is the people I work with, not the transaction,” says Michelle, a Realtor® with Royal Le Page Sussex Realty. “It’s all about the client and what they want.”

Her full-service approach, which includes dynamic and strategic market planning, was developed from her previous experience in hospitality.

Through extensive market analysis and a keen detail-oriented eye, Michelle ensures your needs are met.

“I know this can be a confusing process,” she says. “I tell my clients to call me whenever they have questions, because that’s how I would want to be treated.”

“I’m so attached to this community,” Michelle says. “I know all the schools, I know what’s going on, and where the best places are to buy because I have lived here my whole life.”

With two teenagers in the house, Michelle keeps her finger on the community’s pulse, actively involved in her daughters’ schools and extracurricular activities.

“Real estate provides me with the opportunity to make a difference in peoples’ lives,” she says. “It’s not about having the biggest business it’s about making sure my clients are happy.”

We asked local real estate expert, Hayden Duncan, CEO of Harcourts, for a few tips for protecting your home when you’re not around.

article continues below

· Double check the locks: check your homes existing locks and if necessary refit new ones, such as deadlocks and bolts, on doors and windows.

· Make a list of valuables: keep an up-to-date list of any valuables such as jewellery, antiques, electronics and artwork. Take a photo of each item to keep on file and make sure your insurance company also has a copy.

· Keep keys in a safe place: don’t leave house keys hidden outside, as experienced thieves will know where to look. Instead, leave a set of keys with your Realtor™. “At Harcourts, we offer this as a no charge service,” says Duncan. “It’s part of our holiday secure key care.”

· Lock away garden tools and ladders as they could potentially help a would-be thief to gain access to your home.

· Use automatic timer switches for lamps, TVs or stereos to come on then turn off each night.

· Arrange to have your letterbox emptied daily: an overflowing letterbox and newspapers piling up on the lawn are an invitation to thieves in the area.

· For longer holiday breaks, arrange to have the lawn mown and the house aired with windows opened occasionally (whilst someone is at the house), so it’s apparent someone is either living in or visiting the home regularly.

· Don’t leave a message on your phone indicating that you are away and be careful not to mention the duration of your trip on social media. Recent research has shown that thieves canvas social media to identify people who may be leaving home for extended periods.

· If possible, ask a trusted friend or family member to be your house sitter.

Licensed optician Faranak Da Costa of in-home optical company Speedy Specs explains five ways you can keep your eyes in top condition.

article continues below

1. Know your family history

Conditions like cataracts, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration can be genetic. If you have a family history of any of those, discuss it with your optician when you have an eye exam. It might mean you need more frequent eye tests or other monitoring.

2. Eat the right food

OK, carrots won’t help you see in the dark, but a diet rich in fruit and vegetables will help keep your eyes healthy. “Supplements such as lutein may also be beneficial for eye health,” says Da Costa.

3. Maintain a healthy weight

“Being overweight can increase your risk of Type 2 diabetes, which can then lead to vision loss, as well as a number of other health problems,” says Da Costa.

4. Wear protective eyewear in the sun

Sunglasses aren’t just a fashion accessory. They protect your eyes from UV rays, which can cause or exacerabate conditions like cataracts and macular degeneration. “Look for options that block 99 to 100 per cent of UVA and UVB radiation,” says Da Costa. “And remember: They’re not just for the summer – on cold, sunny days, you need them just as much.”

5. Have regular eye tests

Even if you think your eyes are in perfect health, you need to have them checked. Everyone should have eye tests every two to three years. Da Costa recommends comprehensive dilated eye exams every year after you turn 60, and younger if you have a high risk of some conditions (for example, you have a family history or come from certain ethnic groups). If you’re too busy to head to the optician, or you have mobility problems that prevent you leaving the house, contact Da Costa. Her new business, Speedy Specs, offers eye tests from your home, office or care home. She has a background in fashion which means she can help you choose the perfect frames, and your new specs will be delivered within a couple of weeks.

Speedy Specs is now operating throughout the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley. Services may be covered by your insurer and direct billing is available. To find out more, visit www.speedyspecs.ca, call 604-500-3815, email info@speedyspecs.ca or follow on Instagram, @speedyspecs.",[]

The CSF is part of the public education system in British Columbia and uses the same curriculum in its schools that is used in every other public school around the province.

The student population at CSF has been growing steadily over the last five years in both the elementary and high school grades.

article continues below

""We're putting a lot of emphasis on growing our high school,"" says Laurent Brisebois, CSF Principal of l'école Andé Piolat on the North Shore. ""There's sometimes a misconception that kids need to switch over to the English system after elementary school to be more fluent in the English language.""

It's a misconception that M. Brisebois and his colleagues at other CSF high schools would like to challenge. In fact, students at CSF high schools consistently score higher than their unilingual counterparts in mandatory English language tests.

""One of the benefits of completing high school in the CSF system,"" says M. Brisebois, ""is that students can earn two certificates: the Diplôme de fin d'études secondaires in French and the Dogwood Diploma in English. This opens up the opportunities for the student to study at the university level in English, take programs in French at an English university, such as Simon Fraser, or continue their studies at a French university either in Canada or abroad.""

M. Brisebois also points to the time and effort by parents to help their child become bilingual.

""I tell parents that if they have been teaching their child two words for everything, one in French and one in English, since kindergarten only to let it go in grades 7 or 8, then by the time a student reaches the end of high school they will have forgotten everything,” he says. “A French education is an investment that should result in two graduation diplomas and more opportunities for their child.""

Another benefit of a CSF high school education is the opportunity to graduate from an International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This internationally recognized diploma is accepted by many universities worldwide.

""Again, it's about giving your child the tools to advance in their education and life,"" says M. Brisebois.

In other words, we know better than anyone how to make sure you have a great vacation here.""

""It used to be that you could make a decision on Wednesday for a trip that Friday or Saturday depending on the weather,"" he says. ""But it's difficult to do that now and still get a reasonable rate. We're finding that Tuesdays and Wednesdays have become the new Fridays and Saturdays! We do sometimes offer great deals on short stay packages at off-peak or shoulder season times.""

Or the delicious apples from the Okanagan? Or the full-flavoured wine from grapes grown in the Similkameen Valley?

Farmers from throughout the Lower Mainland, Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island, Okanagan, Gold Country, and even the Cariboo region travel every weekend to farmers’ markets on the North Shore to bring you the freshest, locally grown produce. For example, the famous super-sweet Forstbauer carrots are brought to you weekly from Chilliwack to the Ambleside Farmers’ Market.

“Our farm is a family farm and a lot of people help out,” Natalie said. In high season Monday through Wednesday we weed, seed and do some harvesting.

Come Thursday and Friday, you will find all hands on deck preparing for the markets; picking potatoes, cucumbers, greens, corn, squash, carrots, beets and more! The younger kids help out by gathering bunches, picking cucumbers and potatoes and playing in the dirt.

Mid week Katrina, Travis’ wife, makes her way to a farmers’ market and does a delivery to a local organic warehouse. Come Friday evening, as the sun goes down and most families are preparing dinner and sitting on the couch with a book in hand, you will find the Forstbauers loading the trucks with non-perishables, like their homemade pickles, squash and potatoes. The next morning around 4:30 a.m., all of the fresh picked bunches like chard, kale, and their famous carrots are packed into the truck by the bin full and off to market they go! Sunday is a repeat of Saturday with three markets on the go.

After an hour drive and a two-hour set up,the market begins to hustle and bustle just before the official start and Natalie joyfully helps her customers out as volunteers and her children finish set-up.

After the full market day on Sunday, an hour of take down packing up what did not sell and the long drive back you will find three Forstbauer families getting home from the markets at varying times with some of them heading out to pick the zucchinis and cucumbers before they are “too big”...while others unpack the trucks from the markets before heading for supper and a good night's rest.

“And then,” Natalie said, “we start all over again Monday morning with weeding and the harvest rain or shine.”

The Forstbauer family has been farming for forty years, when Hans and Mary Forstbauer founded Forstbauer Family Natural Food Farm. As pioneers of organic farming, they were one of the first farms to follow biodynamic agriculture.

Now, four decades later, the Forstbauer Farm continues to thrive under the same foundational passion to produce healthy food grown from healthy soil. They also work to build community through sharing that passion with children and adults alike at different farmers’ markets, like the Ambleside Artisan Market. After all, it was Mary, the late matriarch of her family and of the organic industry, who was a founder of Artisan Farmers’ Markets, a non-profit society that hosts three farmers’ markets throughout the Lower Mainland including Burnaby, Ambleside and Lonsdale.

With twelve children of their own, together, the Forstbauers worked on the farm. Many of them are still involved in the family farm today, regardless of full time jobs, and some have even started their own organic farms.

Natalie, the eldest is a mom with three kids; while she doesn’t work full time at the farm, you will find her at Ambleside Farmers’ Market selling and teaching about food or writing her memoir about living with a brain injury. As for her brothers, Niklaus and Travis and her Dad Hans, they work countless hours in the fields, beginning their days at 5 or 6 am going right through until dusk...or even into the night.

“We learned about EFry’s summer camps a few years ago from our social worker,” says Linda. “The girls’ older siblings were going and it seemed like the perfect opportunity for them to have fun and bond. They absolutely love camp and can’t wait to go. They also love the Saturday Club day camps. They’re always up to something different: rock climbing, Science World, crafts.”

Shawn Bayes, executive director of EFry and founder of JustKids says, “The JustKids programs are designed to support a unique group of children who have faced a lot of adversity. Children’s lives can be turned upside down when their parent goes to prison, especially when it’s their mother because incarcerated women are often single parents.”

Statistics show that without specialized supports, more than half of children who experience parental incarceration will one day end up behind bars. Fortunately, research also shows that risk can be dramatically decreased with specialized programs. EFry is currently the only organization in Canada to offer a suite of programs specifically aimed at supporting these children.

In the four years her foster children have been taking part, Linda has observed the positive impact. “Through JustKids, the girls not only get to stay in contact with their siblings, they’ve formed lasting friendships.”

Under its JustKids umbrella, EFry offers summer and spring break camps, Saturday Clubs, dental clinics, parent-child bonding programs, a Storybook Program where incarcerated parents are recorded reading books which are then delivered along with the recording to their child, as well as a holiday program that includes a Santa lunch and a toy bank.

“All our JustKids programs are offered at low or no cost, so poverty isn’t a barrier to participation,” says Shawn. “We are particularly grateful to our donors because all our work is made possible thanks to private sector support.”

Since launching JustKids, EFry has continued to expand the scope of its programs.

“Originally, our programs stopped at age 13 but the kids asked us to keep letting them come. So, we’ve evolved to continue being there for them as they grow,” says Shawn. “This year, some of our camp counsellors were former campers who participated in a training program we launched last year to prepare them for their first job. It’s turned out to be great role modelling for the younger children.”

Changes in editorial sensibilities, the rise of the internet, the Olympic Games coming to town and a catastrophe that nearly left us in the ash can of history.

article continues below

After joining the News as a controller in 1987, Foot rose up to general manager and, later, publisher after Speck’s retirement.

As publisher, Foot said it was time to modernize the editorial outlook of the paper.

One of the first things to go was the Sunshine Girl, sometime in early 2000 “just because its time had come.”

“Let’s face it. Could you imagine having it now? The world changes and you’ve got to move along with it,” Foot said.

Foot grits his teeth and rolls his eyes when recalling columnist Doug Collins. An Archie Bunker with none of the redeeming qualities. Though he didn’t fire Collins, Foot told him he’d have to be “less radical.”

“Try and find some new subjects. His subjects were the femmes and the teachers and Jews,” Foot said.

The newsroom had already gone digital in its production, except for the final and most critical step. When the paper was ready to go to the press, it wasn’t a matter of uploading files. Physical “flats” were still delivered by hand to the printers.

“There was no pushing a button electronically and there was no backup whatsoever. So we lived in fear. If that taxicab didn’t make it or had an accident or they got destroyed, we were really in trouble,” Foot recalls. “I didn’t ever want that to happen on my watch. I’d, most of the time, stay until the paper went to bed. … Lots of times, Christmas Eve or whatever, and I’d be waiting for the last piece to see the paper through.”

The paper never did miss an issue, although one day in February 2005 it came very, very close.

FIRE!

Foot remembers getting the call at 6 a.m. on Feb. 10. North Vancouver City Fire Department crews were already at the scene, but the longtime News office at 12th and Lonsdale was beyond saving.

“I’d be lying if I said I still don’t think about it. That was a long, long time ago,” he said. “You don’t think about it every day, but you do still think about it. You hear a fire engine and it brings back memories.”

News staff were shocked, but Foot made it clear, there would be a newspaper out the next day and deadline was approaching. The North Shore Credit Union offered up their boardroom as a makeshift newsroom and sales office. Employees cancelled plans and vacation days and worked until 4 a.m. Not seen by the wider community, the staff were already suffering headaches after transitioning to a new layout software that - guess what – wasn’t working.

“It was just pandemonium to get it all done. … Then we had to get up on Friday morning and do it all over again for our Sunday paper.” Foot said. “While I think it was one of the worst experiences of my career, it was one of best experiences of my career as well.”

No one was hurt in the fire. The North Shore News never missed an edition. But there was a bigger loss: 10 to 15 years of photo negatives and digital backups, now gone for good.

The fire was ruled to be arson but no suspect was ever arrested.

Two days before the building burned, managing editor Terry Peters recalled taking a threatening phone call from someone unhappy with an article in the newspaper’s online archive. “You don’t know what I’m capable of,” the caller told him.

There were also indications it was an inside job. According to police who originally investigated the arson, whoever set the fire likely used a key to get through two security doors at the building’s back entrance shortly before 5 a.m. The perpetrator went upstairs and turned off the security alarm by punching in the correct code numbers on the first try. Almost an hour passed before the arsonist started to pour gas — including under the door of the computer server room and around the editorial offices — and the time fire alarms were triggered.

Foot isn’t one to carry regrets but the fire clearly remains a sore point for him.

“I was really hurt by the fact it was arson and we still don’t know who did it. We still don’t know why they did it. I’m still really hurt by the fact the RCMP did their investigation but they never came to any kind of conclusions. They actually gave up on it. I think they could have done more,” he said. “Because we don’t want to live in a community where somebody can do that.”

Insurance covered the News’ losses and the paper found a new home at 15th and Lonsdale. But the bigger threat to the business was still looming.

NEWS, DISTRUPTED

nsnews.com went live in 1995, one of the first community newspapers with a website in B.C., Foot recalls.

“As far as the sales department, the attitude was ‘Yeah, I don’t really see how that affects us.’ In the newsroom, there was certainly hesitation that it was going to be more work. Why are we going to do it? Who is going to read it? All that stuff,” he said. “We weren’t quite sure what we were doing or why we were doing it, we just knew this was something that was going to be the way of the future.”

It wasn’t until the spring of 2006 when the news business model first started showing some vulnerability, worldwide, Foot said.

“Up until then, the web hadn’t really affected us. We had a website. We weren’t making any money on it. We weren’t trying all that hard and it wasn’t really affecting newspapers’ bottom line or the way they do things. Then Craigslist came along,” he said. “From then on, newspapers kind of realized this is the first onslaught. There could be several more. We need to start planning.”

Part of that was reminding customers that a classified ad carried more credibility than an anonymous free ad on the internet. At the time, craigslist was rife with bad deals, con artists and flakes. (It still is.)

“We would try to make sure our classifieds were clean and we checked them out and followed up on complaints – all the things that we could do. That helped short term,” he said.

Real estate advertising was next for disruption. Then car ads. Niche websites became destinations for niche markets, and advertisers went with them.

People go to print news to find things they didn’t know they were looking for, Foot reasons, and newspaper ads have a way of creating demand for products and services readers also didn’t yet know they were looking for. And the only way to create that kind of demand is to reach a wide market not already holed up in a niche.

“Right now, if you want to get to the majority of the people – because of the wonderful readership that the North Shore News has and not to a specific group ¬ I still don’t think there’s a better way to spend your money,” Foot said, who still advises clients to buy in print to get a return on their investment.

OLYMPIC GLORY

When the 2010 Winter Olympics arrived in Vancouver, the North Shore was a big part of it, with Cypress Mountain hosting snowboarding and freestyle skiing events – even though the weather was unco-operative.

Foot determined the North Shore News would start publishing a daily supplement in addition to its three regular issues. He set up a night shift for reporters and production staff, who could get all the day’s event results written, edited and packaged by 4 a.m., printed and distributed by the next morning. There was a semi-serious offer of cots for staff to sleep on. Foot remembers it as a time of great fun, in the newsroom and out.

“To Vancouver, it was absolutely incredible,” Foot said. “The Olympics, as you know, on the North Shore was a frickin’ disaster. At Cypress, they had to close some of the events because it rained and it was so wet and slushy, and they had to haul in all the snow… Other than that, it was fantastic. It was a big, giant party. It was a party on the North Shore.”

CHANGE OF HANDS

Foot was the boss for many years, but even bosses have bosses. In 1989, the North Shore News got its first corporate owner when Speck negotiated for the historic Southam Inc. and Madison Publishing to purchase the paper.

Later, Conrad Black’s Hollinger Inc. came along, and through a series of transactions, in 1996 came to own all of Southam’s assets including Lower Mainland Publishing, of which the North Shore News was the flagship paper.

“Those guys went to jail,” Foot said with a laugh.

When Hollinger fell apart, its assets were sold to CanWest in the early 2000s. That lasted until 2010 when Postmedia bought bankrupt CanWest’s empire.

With each transaction, running a newspaper became a little less fun, Foot said, particularly during Postmedia’s tenure.

“That was pretty difficult because it was all about cutting costs,” he said. “They were fighting a losing battle because every time they cut the costs, their revenue went down and they were chasing it all the way down.”

In 2011, Glacier Media stepped in and purchased Lower Mainland Publishing, including the North Shore News and its sister papers, the Burnaby Now, Royal City Record, Richmond News, TriCity Now, Surrey Now, and Vancouver Courier.

“I was actually quite happy when we got sold to Glacier because Glacier, that’s that they did. They had a bunch of community papers. We were still in the same industry, facing the same issues, but at least these guys cared about community papers and knew something about them,” Foot said.

In January 2015, Foot went corporate and left the News to work in Glacier’s head office. Soon after, Peter Kvarnstrom, who was already the vice-president of Glacier, took over as publisher of the North Shore News. It was something of a homecoming for Kvarnstrom who started in the business as a classified ad sales rep at the North Shore News in 1991 and later founded his own paper on the Sunshine Coast.

TOMORROW’S EDITION

The changes and challenges in the news business, regardless of medium, are no secret to anyone. Sitting behind his desk, Kvarnstrom said the core of the business doesn’t change.

“We as the North Shore News need to recognize that our core asset is our engagement with our audience and our audience continues to engage with us in a significant and relevant way. Both online and in print.” he said. “As long as we continue to focus on an audience-first strategy, we will continue to be relevant to our audience, we will continue to serve this community for many, many years going forward. In print and online.”",[]

I can’t really explain it unless I tell the whole story.

For me the 1960s were more or less a disaster or– as Zorba said, I think, a calamity wrapped up in a disaster; or is it the other way around?

article continues below

I was an enterprising young radiator mechanic. I worked for Carey Lockwood, of NorEst Radiators. He was a kind of father to me, and took me in as an apprentice in 1957, age 17, and taught me the radiator trade.

I married in 1961, age 21. My wife was from Lynn Valley and was 20. It now seems to me that we were so young. Everyone rushed to be engaged or married. There wasn’t the time to look around, to find out what other opportunities life offered, both in terms of career and long-term relationships. We seemed to think that this is what you did; you got married as soon as you could and had children, and somehow this is how you found yourself and got happy. It may be true, but these days my children are grown up and the patter of little feet in my home is rare. I live with my dogs now. I joke that if I had only started with dogs instead of children and realized how much easier dogs were I might never got around to having children. Just a joke. I love my kids and grandkids.

I quit my employer and went out on my own in the auto radiator trade. I was 22 . I knew nothing of real budgeting and very little about a lot else. And I had no money.

To make a long story short, my small proprietorship was a calamity inside a disaster, which was my marriage.

Too much of my cash and time went to the Avalon Hotel, or the Olympic, or the St. Alice. Entirely too much beer or whatever. It’s easy to pick out some of my mistakes in retrospect.

I didn’t charge enough, was loose with my cash, didn’t promote enough, had no working capital to start with, and most importantly, was afraid to let my guard down and ask for advice.

I didn’t have a budget. And drank and came home late sometimes.

The result was that I didn’t do a good job of providing for my little family. I was neither a good provider nor a good enough husband or caregiver or father, and I lost them for a long time and missed them a lot.

Sardines and cement plants

By 1966 my first marriage and my business were both over. I had been dimly aware of the possibility of bankruptcy from Day 1 of my radiator shop. No capital meant Damocles’ sword was hanging over my head and the pressure from creditors was uninterrupted toward the end. I went into the trustee’s office with fear and dread, and emerged feeling so incredibly light. It felt as if my shoes didn’t touch the floor. I had about $1,200 bucks left over after the bankruptcy. That let me rent a tiny two-room suite in the Capilano Highlands and pay my rent for a few months.

I am a North Shore person, though born in Montreal. I’ve lived all of my life here. And I love the place. My father was a West Van resident. Born in England, he came to Canada at age eight and lived with his parents in one of the West Van houses they rented from 1911. He got a degree in pharmacy, became a drug salesman and travelled across the country from coast to coast by rail, peddling his products. My mother was from Montreal and very French.

How and why they got together is a mystery but they did, and my late sister and I were a result.

The two of them were not a good match, there was much bickering over my father’s drinking, and money and other things, and they split up after my sister’s birth, 1942 or so. In 1947 mother brought us (mainly French speaking) children to West Van at my father’s pleadings. We ended up living in a beachfront cottage at 27th and Bellevue, which made quite an impression on this seven-year-old. I went to Pauline Johnson, which was not French immersion, as it is now.

(By the way, more to demonstrate inflation than to mourn, the cottage came for sale in 1950. It was offered to my parents for $4,900. Same lot now? Ten to $15 million.) My parents opted instead to buy a Norgate Park rancher for $7,800. My mother said she didn’t want to deal with any more rats, and besides, everyone knew that you got rheumatism if you lived too close to the sea.

I guess the point of telling this is that there was no other place than the North Shore to run away to, for me.

Bankruptcy notices appeared. I couldn’t hide. But really, nobody really cared. Except my ex-wife’s uncle, Jim Bezanson, who got stiffed for ten grand, and he never said a word about it until my discharge came and I was able to repay him. It took me about 10 years.

The three years after I went broke were pretty exciting, to put a happy face on what was a grim daily struggle, a hand-to-mouth existence.

I swept chimneys, dug ditches, cleaned oil stoves, cut firewood, dismantled old vehicles, worked on a sewer crew in the British Properties, lived for a few months in a construction camp in Powell River and did ironworker jobs in a cement plant, in Delta. That’s just what I can remember. I did a lot of looking for work.

The grub in the Powell River camp was fantastic and I was sorry when that job ended. I went back to looking for work every day, but as they say: sometimes chicken, sometimes just feathers.

The hand didn’t always get to the mouth fast enough and I lost 40 pounds in the first year. It was a good thing, diet wise, but harsh and of course there was no money for beer. I remember a week where my entire diet was a can of sardines, a sleeve of crackers and half a jar of peanut butter. I ate my meagre provisions with a small spoon and was grateful for them.

No money ain’t funny

In 1968, tired of the day labouring lifestyle, I asked a friend what else a person could do for a living that involved some creativity. He said “Do you think you could sell advertising?” and directed me to the Lions Gate Times weekly newspaper in West Vancouver, at 16th and Bellevue where I met and was hired (straight commission only) by Claude Hoodspith, the owner and publisher.

There were two weekly newspapers on the North Shore at that time: the Times, of West Vancouver, which had about 6,000 paid subscribers, and the Citizen, in North Van, with about 14,000 paid. There were about 45,000 addresses on the North Shore, and an advertiser in both papers could not reach half the community. Claude exploited this by publishing a yearly “progress edition,” which was to be distributed to all North Shore addresses, and my job was to sell the ad content to businesses.

I learned the newspaper business quickly at a time when printing technology was striding ahead after several centuries of lead type.

After selling his first round of ads, founder Peter Speck had enough to buy “a pair of shoes, a car full of groceries, and a bottle of Scotch.”

The Times, under the guidance of Joe Oetter, their printing foreman, had a foot in the past with a functioning linotype machine; a hot lead machine dating way back, used much like a typewriter but casting in hot lead the body type; racks of old-style movable type for headlines, and new typesetting machinery that printed the new cold-set type that was taking over so fast. They didn’t use the linotype much anymore but I saw it working once or twice.

The Progress edition went pretty well. I loved the new life. My tongue-in-cheek motto to myself on hard days was “Well, I am clean, dry, and mostly indoors,” which was a refreshing change from my most recent employments.

Being new to the ad sales business, I had no preconceptions. I did a lot of my selling on the phone and didn’t make too many basic mistakes.

I learned quickly. The Times employed a crusty Brit as editor. On production nights Sandy Sanderson would send me out for a case of India Pale Ale and I assisted and observed. Claude appeared pleased, so much so that he told me I was making too much money and put me on a modest salary.

My motivation took a serious dive and I parted company with Claude. I took my parting paycheque just before Christmas 1968 and went home and considered my future. But sulking doesn’t pay for rent and groceries. I remembered that the prospective advertisers I had been talking to over the couple of months were more interested in the whole North Shore. I began to consider a total market coverage advertising vehicle, and went back to Claude to ask him if he would like to do it.

He declined. I resumed sulking. My money ran out completely after Christmas. I pondered that paid circulation papers could not net all that much after all the costs involved: churn, distribution, bundle delivery, supervision and the like. My guess was that the circulation revenue was not that relevant and the draw to advertisers was more in the assumption that readers were more likely to be influenced if they paid for the paper. My feeling was that I didn’t need that, and if I could put a good-looking paper on every doorstep, then people would read it – whether they paid for it or not. And, thank God, they do.

To prove that was quite an issue. I got a map and began to total up the post office routes in the Capilano Highlands where I was then living. There were then about 6,000 residential and business addresses. I found a printer, got a quote for a 6,000-run tabloid-size newspaper, and found an advertising distribution company and got a quote for distribution in the Capilano Highlands area. Then I hemmed and hawed.

When you’re really out of money there is a lot of friction. Everything is difficult. A few litres of gas can be a big obstacle. If you don’t have the dollars, things can be done; but it is very hard at times. Having to buy a car battery can be a big blow to a hand-to-mouth person.

The great Spirit came to me, one evening, when I was sitting on the hearth at home, at the end of a long day. I was daydreaming of owning a waterfront farm, a dream since teenage years, and a kind voice told me to follow my dream, and there was no one else in the room.

One frosty January morning, early 1969, my significant other, on her way to her job at Eaton’s, gave me 50 cents and told me that she thought I had nothing to lose by trying. It was very reassuring. I was down but not out. And what did I have to lose if the adventure failed? By this time, not much. I put together a crude dummy issue, using the kids’ felt pens. With the money she gave me I bought an invoice book from McGill stationery on Edgemont Boulevard. And that moment might have been the real start of the North Shore News.

Following the dream

With a burst of new energy, I canvassed every prospective advertiser that was reachable in the Highlands area. Dry cleaners, furniture stores, garages, I knew them all by the time the pages were sold. I didn’t take any money up front, but told them that this was an effort that might not pan out, and if it did succeed I would bring the proof of publication with me and collect from them. In the interim, I asked them to sign an invoice in my book, telling them quite truthfully that there was not much chance of me getting this thing off the ground if they didn’t. By the time the 16 pages were sold I had rolled over a lot of rocks looking for crabs, so to speak. My only pair of street shoes were worn out. An advertiser, Barry Innes, who had a firm called Savon Furniture, reminded me years later that I sat in his office and cut out new cardboard insoles for my leaking shoes while we talked.

But the big day finally came. And I kept selling, but it was to banks this time, to get enough dough to put it together.

Each time I talked to a banker, after my preamble, an up-front disclosure of my discharged bankruptcy and other chit chat, I put the battered invoice book on his desk, and told my story using the same dummy that was toted on my rounds.

Turned down three or four times, I decided to change my approach and met with a Royal Bank manager in West Van.

This time I kept the book in my pocket and laid out my idea to him as a hypothetical future prospect, and asked him to lend me the money to make it happen. Of course he wouldn’t.

Then, I asked, what about if I went to every one of these advertisers and got a signed invoice? “Well, in that case ... maybe 50/50.” I put the book on the desk. He looked through it and frowned. “You tricked me” he said. But he lent me the 50 per cent, about $2,500, and that was just enough. I bought a proper glue pot, rented an IBM Selectric typewriter, bought some pages of Letraset, and off we went, a many-hour marathon of cutting and pasting, using Letraset headlines and improvised typesetting. Off to the printers and the next morning it was in print and the bundles were in the distributors’ trucks. It was a crude little thing with almost no news content, but mine own, as they say. I called it the North Shore Shopper.

After the distribution, I collected from the advertisers and paid off the bank. There was enough money left to buy me another pair of shoes, a car full of groceries, and a bottle of Scotch. I repeated the feat in another area. By turns, monthly, I did all the other areas, north of the highway, south of it, east of Lonsdale, west of Lonsdale, and West Van.

Business grew. As soon as I could I put the newspaper into total market coverage. It became obvious to me that the advertisers wanted it.

It was relatively easy to put the existing advertisers into one publication, but getting it to the readers was quite another matter.

Every door on the shore

Distribution was always a headache. The commercial advertising distributors, who used panel trucks to move their crew from place to place, missed a lot of addresses; it was very difficult to convince a merchant when he didn’t get the paper at home, or when it wasn’t delivered to his mother-in-law. We began to organize our own distribution system covering the entire North Shore. It’s easy to say, but it took years to do, with about 400 carriers and about 40 zone managers. As we progressed in our small revenues it became possible for my significant other to stay home and try to organize a growing army of routes and carriers. My sister Dede, a master of detail, took on the mapping tasks, creating maps for every carrier route. We ended up with the North Shore divided into several zones, each zone with specific maps.

Rome was not built in a day. It took ages to build our carrier network. We had to get real to hire carriers. It is hard to persuade a relatively well-off person, young or old, to trudge around with a gauche canvas newspaper bag unless you pay them well. That is still the case, apparently, and a further reflection of our communities is that nowadays it’s hard to find people to work who can live here, not just newspaper carriers, but waitresses, store clerks, carpenters and cleaners. I don’t know what the News experiences now but I would hazard that adults, with or without cars, are a big part of distribution. There just aren’t that many children around in our community, which has areas of the mainly elderly that seldom see kids.

I kept on trying to hire the right people, mostly sales people. I called myself in my mind Chief of Sales, which fit. Chiefly sales. I was a one-man band for a while, with the addition of my significant other. I tried to turn acquaintances into salespeople. When Ellsworth Dickson, then a budding photojournalist, came to see me (he had a photo of Wayne and Shuster at a Capilano Road gas station) I didn’t buy the photo but asked him to come work for me and sell ads.

We were calling the paper by another interim name, North Shore Shopper News, as we floundered our way to an identity.

He participated in our late-night and 24-hour marathons before I drove out to the printers in Abbotsford. At this time we were using a simple device called a strip printer to set our headlines. It was just strips of negative with alphabets on them. The operator sat on a stool in the shower, the only place we could make dark, in a red light. Every time one pressed the trigger, a bright white light etched a new letter. The effect of the flashes and the claustrophobia of the shower made this one of the most unpopular jobs. Ellsworth survived and is in the publishing business, owner of Resource World mining magazine of Vancouver.

There were disasters galore as we grew. People came, people went. People came on red hot in sales, and then took to drink or otherwise fizzled out. A look on an applicant’s employment records might indicate they may have done that before. Who had the time or wisdom to look? I was flying mostly blind. I wasn’t choosy and couldn’t be.

There were painful moments. One of my ad salesmen, who I thought I knew, suicided horrendously. Another died of cancer. Many good people couldn’t take the chance of working for such a flaky upstart company.

The turnover was disheartening and it took a long time for the right people to get to the places they were needed in this rapidly growing little enterprise.

The newspaper was still unprofitable.

I removed the newspaper operations out of my house just as soon as we could, to the relief of the neighbours, to a little white wartime house at 1123 West 15th, just off Pemberton. That was quickly not big enough. A rented Fabco trailer doubled the floor space but was also soon overrun.

Our staff quickly grew. We had paste-up people, office help and salespeople who used drawing tables, desks and phones wherever they could. It was noisy and cramped. The owner of the little white house told me the building was going to be demolished after me and not to worry about damaging the interior.

We butchered together crude racks and tables, laid plywood in the lower attic and started keeping our back issues there, with about four feet of headroom.

The 40 or so hours before I drove to Abbotsford with the flats in my car were all about hard work and not much sleep. Lots of coffee. The newspaper was created from scratch. Copy had to be set. Photos had to be screened. Copy had to be proofed. Ads made up and placed.

It was soon obvious that we had to move again.

While prospecting in Dundarave I met with David Ingram, the owner of Cent-A tax services, and one of the most original and eccentric persons I have met over the years. Jovial, chatty David suggested that I consider moving the newspaper to share his office premises at 1139 Lonsdale Ave., but his space proved too small and the North Shore News rented part of the upstairs in the same building. It was a nice office on a floor dominated by a large central open-air atrium with lots of plants. The second floor was a warren of offices. The North Shore News rented a quarter of the space on the floor.

We kept growing. Other tenants on the floor eventually moved out. Brian Morse took North Shore Sailing School to Granville Island. The lease on the room for the answering service next to us lapsed and we took that over. That gave us the whole top floor. Linda Greenslade moved her Lonsdale salon out. Pacific Books didn’t renew. In the basement of the building, leased to CNCP Telex, technology caught up and they didn’t need the space any more. The News continued to burgeon into every new cranny in the building.

By then, David Ingram had moved his Cent-A operation out of the building. We were the sole tenant at last. We secured a happy lease with our landlord and invested half a million or so in a complete renovation of the building. We were on much better terms with the banks by then. Architect Chad Mooney was very helpful as well as Mario Szijarto, my longtime designer and friend.

Now, with sunlight flooding the floors, an organized lobby, and proper office arrangements for our differing departments we had a smoothly running one-location business at last. The ground floor of the building on Lonsdale was the lobby and classified and offices. Distribution occupied the new offices in the basement. We used the parking lot for distribution. Display advertising, photography, editorial, my office and secretary were on the second floor, but it really was the third floor up from the lane.

We finally plowed into the black about 1974-’75. By the time we started making money I owed the banks quite a bundle. It never really occurred to me that newspapers could make pretty good money once they were past the break-even point. A very kind volunteer, a management consultant, pointed that out to me, but I was so immersed in day-to-day struggles that it didn’t sink in. I understood what had to be done to improve things but lacked the will to do it – until I fell in love with boats, and one boat in particular. The boat was for sale for about $40,000, which was far beyond my banking restrictions. But it was a mystic time in my life.

Big things happened. Before, I thought if I raised my rates by 10 per cent all the advertisers would leave; and I couldn’t sell two more pages a week because I was already “selling” 19 or 20. After the first bloom of affection for the sailboat I was suddenly motivated. One of my realizations was that what I thought were my sales were really services of advertising already sold. I bit the bullet and gave the advertisers to my commissioned sales team, and concentrated my attentions on new clients.

The two new pages became four, and then six, and more. It was an exuberant time. After the struggles to get thus far, it began to be a lot more fun. Heady times. And nobody left when I raised the rates.

‘The Classies’

The classified ad department was a story in itself. Initially, way back near the beginning, we ran a half-page ad on our unsold back pages inviting people to use our free classifieds (thousands didn’t), until my banker of the day made it clear to me that he was not going to support my tenuous plan (“after people get to really like us, maybe they’ll buy classified ads”); and then bounced my personal paycheque as a bit of an attention-getter. I think I was trying to emulate the Buy and Sell, which ran free ads but depended on people buying the newspaper for revenue. I thank my banker now for pointing out that there was not much upside for a newspaper like ours that was free to start with, but at the time it seemed like another blow.

The June 16, 1976 North Shore News records the send-off of Greenpeace Foundation’s historic save-the whales expedition and includes an image of Peter Speck bidding adieu to his assistant publisher, crew member Rex Weyler, who would later co-found Greenpeace International.

I came back from the bank with my tail between my legs and broke the news to my classified manager, expecting the worst. “Well, girls,” she said, “I guess we better get these phones hopping.” And to my great surprise, our paid advertising went from nothing to a page in the next issue, and we never looked back. Ah, those were the days.

Owning a newspaper, opined Norman Mailer, must be a bit like owning a goat, which you must feed every day, whether you feel like it or not, and that is the reality of the business of newspapering. Every page of news and reporting requires several pages of advertising to pay the bills. Armies march on their stomachs, said Napoleon. People-intensive businesses like newspapers also march on their stomachs. Payroll is a big number.

When the right person joined our little staff it felt like a bit more was taken off my daily grind.

I used to joke that I was publisher, editor and janitor, but as my load lessened there was a little more time to tinker, and the newspaper began to blossom editorially.

I even began to write a column, which usually got pecked out late at night. I wrote it perched on my bed with a portable typewriter on my knees. There was no time to research. I went with the flow. There is a newspaper joke that writing editorials is a bit like wetting yourself while wearing a dark suit. It feels nice and warm, and hardly anybody notices. I liked reading my own columns, but the goat was always hungry, and that last deadline soon became one more burden and I dropped the writing role.

Perfecting the pitch

Most of my days in the early years were spent making advertising sales calls – some planned, most cold called. I met many young through old people with small- or medium-size North Shore businesses and came to admire their hardiness. It’s tough to make a living on the North Shore. Rents are high, wages are higher and customers are choosy.

One of the rules of the sales business, that I learned the hard way, is that one never interrupts another salesperson who is making his pitch. You wait your turn, which is an opportunity to check the merchandise and formulate a pitch. One listens and watches customers and listens to staff while trying to design a way for the business to make more sales.

I sincerely told most prospects that I wanted the ads to make money for them, because then they would continue to use the North Shore News and know it cost them nothing; and urged them to make the News their voice at every North Shore door. One learns what would sell some merchandise for your prospect. One also listens to what’s going on if for no other reason than to find out when it’s a good time to become visible again, and one hears what customers have to say and how the other sales staff perform. One learns a lot.

Many small business owners and operators are not wealthy. They have payrolls and rent and taxes and also interest payments and a lot more. The first three expenses are all higher on the North Shore than they are elsewhere in the Lower Mainland. Payrolls are higher at a place where rents, taxes and values are sky high.

In the 50 years that the News has been active there have been massive changes in retailing. Box stores, internet shopping malls, category killers, Costco and Walmarts, all pretty well sprang into being over that. A great many small businesses and small chains disappeared. Franchises began to appear, a new avenue of escape for entrepreneurs.

Ever-changing media landscape

I was always ambitious, in an undisciplined sort of way. Looking back now I see a young man facing a pyramid of radiators and I’m grateful that the bankruptcy saved me from that. But I always wanted to escape. Because, for a lot of people like me, conventional employment didn’t work. Small business people aren’t always at their store or task because they want to be vendors. They want to escape too.

Some people just can’t stick to wage work. Some people can’t find jobs. Some people have beautiful dreams which they think the market wants. Franchisees make very few local decisions. Chains favour centralized flyer production and do not buy much ROP (newspaper advertising).

How the media world is going to look in a very short time is very interesting and alarming. The absence of many advertisers, who have moved to the latest thing, the internet, is forcing more and more restrictions on what traditional media can do in the way of investigation, reporting and effective dissemination of news and opinion. This is not just a newspaper concern. All media are suffering. Known and trusted names are disappearing as salaries are eliminated or frozen. Investigative reporting is rarer.

Mostly, I wonder what the mice are going to do, now that the cats are not able to look so hard. ◆

For the past 50 years we here at the News have toiled to tell your stories. We have run your birth announcements and obituaries. We have celebrated personal and community milestones, birthdays, engagements, many happy stories and many that were not.

article continues below

We have worked hard every week to listen to your stories and tell them in the pages of our paper (and of course now on our flourishing website). Our goal has always been to reflect our community’s views and news in an unbiased and trusted way. We have stirred debate and we have hosted forum.

Over these 50 years we have chronicled much change in our community and our world. We continue to do so every day with the same care, integrity and diligence we always have. We look forward to staying on that course, in print and via all the digital channels, for many, many years to come.

In the special edition published today, and also available online, we take a look back at some of those events and memories. We reflect on where we have come from and where we are headed and, most importantly, we celebrate our role in our great community and all of our current team and vast cast of alumni, and the work they have accomplished. Just as importantly, we celebrate our community’s history and the roles that so many of you have played in helping to build such a resilient, caring, welcoming, inclusive and incredibly vibrant community.

My own story with the NS News started in the year of our founding, 1969.

I was a newspaper carrier for the Citizen newspaper in West Vancouver when Peter Speck’s North Shore Shopper came along and soon thereafter put me out of my first job, as the Citizen went out of business. After a stint as a zone manager for the Penny Saver in Victoria during my university years, I took a hiatus from the newspaper business until July 1991.

That year I spotted an employment ad in the North Shore News for an advertising representative. Never did I imagine that fateful review of our classified pages would lead to a significant turn in my career path. After eight months in classifieds I had the opportunity to step into the position of retail advertising manager with the News where I remained, through some pretty interesting years, until 1997.

In 1997 I bade farewell to Peter Speck and the troops at the News and set out to make my own mark with a start-up paper, the Coast Reporter, on B.C.’s Sunshine Coast. Over the ensuing years, the Coast Reporter was sold to Glacier Media and they kept me on to oversee their many newspaper holdings across Western Canada.

In 2011 we came full circle with Glacier buying the North Shore News (and a number of other Lower Mainland papers), and I was once again involved with my hometown paper. In 2015 I took over the helm at the North Shore News as only the third publisher in its colourful history. It has been my pleasure and privilege to serve our North Shore communities since then and likely for many years into the future.

We’ve still got so many stories to tell, but in these pages you’ll find many of our favourites from the past 50 years. So get a cup of coffee (tea or whatever your choice is) and settle in for a great read, great memories and wonderful reflections and musings on our history, together here on the North Shore. We hope you enjoy the read!

The photo shows a baseball player in mid-stride after smacking the winning homerun. His teammate is holding the game hero’s jersey like a cowboy gripping the scruff of a jittery thoroughbred. And in that moment, with everyone’s face full of fireworks, a shutter winked.

Click.

The moment after was good. The moment before was fine too. But that crack-of-light click captured by Paul McGrath ... that was THE moment.

For more than 30 years a team of three photographers – McGrath, Mike Wakefield and Cindy Goodman – documented triumph, heartbreak, and beauty on the North Shore a split-second at a time.

“If everything worked out and all the gods were with you and you captured that moment, it’s the best feeling,” Goodman reflects.

With camera around her neck, Goodman would coax, cajole, and chip away at who you’re trying to be until she found out who you are.

She photographed six ballerinas with their slippers dangling off the edge of a bench at Anna Wyman’s dance school. But more than that, she caught six kids full of tranquility, impatience, innocence, humour, distraction, consternation, and a hefty dollop of sass.

An Emily Carr graduate, Wakefield had no intention of wasting his photographic talent.

“I’m an artist,” he remembers saying. “I’m not working at the North Shore News.”

Two days later, after some persuasion from his mother and girlfriend, he got hired as a darkroom tech.

He’d take the job, he decided – but only until he got bored or found something better.

“And I never did,” he muses without a ghost of regret.

Listening to Wakefield tell stories is like trying to chart the flight of a moth. His anecdotes are random and roundabout but somehow full of light.

There was the time he cruised to the old Shipyards site in his Dodge Dart Swinger. There was a half-soused woman who asked if he could, “hic,” fix her washing machine, Wakefield recalls, winking suggestively. And there was a 101-year-old man.

Wakefield’s snapshots of Bob Hope, Sophia Loren, and Charles and Diana were fine, he says. But James Burton is the one he still thinks about.

“The best photo I’ve ever taken,” Wakefield says. “And I probably had the least to do with it.”

Burton, 101, was being awarded France’s Legion of Honour for his service in the First World War when Wakefield met him.

Wakefield – as he always does – got chatting. There would be a grip-and-grin photo later but maybe, he suggested to Burton, they could get an “insurance shot” first.

Burton asked if Susan, his wife of 70 years, could be in the photo. Susan had Alzheimer’s, so they would have to go to the care unit, Burton explained.

They went.

Burton eased Susan into a chair, adjusted her collar, and combed her hair.

“I never said a word to them,” Wakefield recalls.

Susan gripped her husband’s hand. She smiled. Burton kissed his wife’s hair.

Then he looked up at Wakefield. “We are ready for our photo,” he said.

He’d already taken it.

Following layoffs earlier this year, Wakefield is the only full-time photographer left.

“We got along pretty well, the three of us,” Wakefield says.

Goodman nods.

“Working with Mike and Paul is the most fun I ever had in my life,” she says. “Of everybody in my life, you two are the ones that I am the most myself with.”

“We’re the last photographers you’re ever going to meet,” Wakefield says. “You don’t realize until it’s finished, or close to finished, how good it really was.”

And then a reporter walks into the room and says something about a photo assignment this afternoon.

Wakefield shrugs.

“I gotta get back to work.”

In mid-conversation, Me-An Laceste asks: “Do you, by any chance, have love letters?”

article continues below

A businesswoman, dancer and world traveller, Laceste is hunting yesterday’s passion locked in ink and pulp. Words that make you blush. Letters that carry a memory of the match you could never strike. She wants to inspire an appreciation for love letters in the next generation of unrequited romantics and undiagnosed poets, she explains.

In 1993, Laceste was a Sunshine Girl in the North Shore News.

For 30 years, the Sunshine Girl was standard issue in the North Shore News. The photo – sometimes suggestive, usually not – of a smiling woman or teenage girl dominated one-quarter of a news page.

“Oh my gosh, to be young again,” Laceste marvels, looking at her beaming black and white face preserved in a photo album.

When Laceste posed, the paper encapsulated her life in two declarative sentences. “Her favourite singer is Sade,” the writer offered. The other sentence noted Laceste likes: “diversity in culture, hats.”

It was like the paper cropped out Laceste’s life to make room for her face.

To be fair, Laceste offers, she still likes hats.

“I’m wearing a hat right now,” she laughs.

She must’ve been bold back then, she says. And young.

“I’m still young at heart,” she adds.

But while the former Sunshine Girl is still youthful, the Sunshine Girl feature is an artifact from an era when the sun never set on questionable taste.

* * *

As thunder follows lightning and regret trails a third martini, criticism stalked the North Shore’s new newspaper in 1971.

Why, readers wanted to know, was this newly launched paper stuffed with advertising?

To that query, the paper’s founder and publisher Peter Speck offered four words: “No ads, no eats.”

To carve out a share of the market, Speck’s fledgling paper co-opted an idea pioneered by tabloid merchant and future Fox News master of the universe Rupert Murdoch.

From the time the ink dried on his first edition in 1970, Murdoch’s newspapers were notorious. “No self-respecting fish would want to be wrapped in a Murdoch paper,” Chicago columnist Mike Royko once declared.

To boost circulation, Murdoch put partially clothed pinup girls on page 3 of Britain’s Sun newspaper.

Sometimes the Sunshine Girl even made it onto the front page, as in this 1977 issue.

The idea spread.

In Toronto and Calgary, newspapers offered an unflinching view of crime and politics. Only now with a little sex in it.

It was a “sign of the decline of journalism,” summarizes Peg Fong.

Fong, a Langara journalism instructor, had a front row seat for that decline when she was a child working at her family’s corner grocery store in Calgary.

Some customers grabbed the Calgary Herald. But when it came to the Calgary Sun, the men stopped, flipped to page 3, and looked.

“If they liked what they saw, I sold a newspaper,” Fong remembers.

It was a little puzzling, Fong recalls.

“I never aspired to be on page 3.

I always wanted to know: ‘How did you find them?’”

What boys like

In 1983, everybody wanted to be a Sunshine Girl.

“That was what everybody wanted do,” Angie Schoening emphasizes. “Everybody.”

Shoening remembers being 15 or 16 when her photo was taken.

“I was trying to be all professional,” she says, describing her white lacy shirt and black pleated pants.

“I looked so mature,” she says, her voice dissolving into peals of laughter.

A 1970s ad in the North Shore News.

At the time, she thought being a Sunshine Girl might advance her career.

“My mom was trying to get me into modeling,” she says. “It was a little stepping stone in my mind [and] in her mind.”

The interval between photo shoot and publication was excruciating.

“I was on pins and needles, dying to see it,” she says. “The week my picture was in the paper I was very popular with the boys.”

Katherine Spong was about 19 or 20 when she was persuaded to be a Sunshine Girl by the paper’s newest photographer.

“I got talked into it because Terry Peters was a personal friend,” she remembers.

Spong is naturally introverted but, she says, she trusted Peters.

“I don’t know if I would’ve done it with anybody else.”

Peters took photos of Spong in Bridgman Park.

“He knelt in dog crap when he was taking the picture,” she says. “I laughed my ass off about that.”

The photos were revealing, Spong remembers.

“A little more risqué than I’d expected,” she summarizes.

Her family teased her after the photo was published. Everyone seemed to recognize her. But then, she points out, everybody already knew her.

“That’s when it was a small town.”

Spong lives in Prince Rupert now. “It reminded me a lot of North Van when we were kids,” she says.

Looking back, the Sunshine Girl feature seems light and fun.

“There’s so many more important things going on in the world than having some young thing in the paper,” she says. “In my case, it was good for a giggle.”

Searching for sunshine

The North Shore News headline demanded: “Are you photogenic?”

Below the headline was a recruitment pitch for women “17 years and older” with poise and confidence.

For some girls and young women, being a Sunshine Girl came with prestige, and perhaps, one wondered, chauffeur service?

North Shore News photographer Mike Wakefield remembers waiting for a model one evening. He called.

“Are you heading over now?” he asked.

“I’m waiting,” she told him.

“What do you mean?”

“You know, the Sunshine Girl cab.”

The Sunshine Girl cab?

Wakefield eventually realized she must mean the Sunshine Cab company – which didn’t have a thing to do with Sunshine Girls.

“It hasn’t come to pick me up,” the model reiterated.

Wakefield sighed. “I don’t think it’s going to.”

Sending the right message

At 11 years old, Maria Spitale-Leisk hadn’t watched any R-rated movies or seen any steamy TV shows. The only provocative images to make it past the doorstep of her conservative, “church on Sunday, Catholic school” Blueridge household were in the North Shore News.

At her parents’ urging, she wrote a letter to the editor.

The North Shore News “is the best paper I have ever read, but there is one thing that I think needs improving. The Sunshine Girls are showing off too much of their bodies,” she wrote in 1990.

Not everyone was a fan of the Sunshine Girls feature. This letter from 11-year-old Maria Spitale appeared in the paper in 1991.

Nearly 30 years later, former North Shore News reporter Spitale-Leisk wonders if she sounded like a narc. “Oh, there’s the killjoy,” she laughs.

Now webmaster for North Vancouver School District, Spitale-Leisk remembers what was largely a “kid-friendly” publication.

There were great photos and stories about people she knew. And then, there was the Sunshine Girl.

“As a child, it was a jarring contrast to see these provocative images share a space with pictures of kids playing in the park,” she recalls. “I just felt it didn’t belong in a community newspaper. It wasn’t the Daily Mirror.”

It wasn’t about shaming anyone who posed, she says. “The sexist tone of the feature was sending the wrong message to young readers,” she explains. “If you fit our beauty criteria then you deserve to be in the spotlight.”

She was proud to see her letter in print.

“It felt empowering as an 11-year-old to have my voice heard,” she recalls.

Still, it would be almost a decade before the North Shore News scrapped the feature.

Bikini overload

In the 1970s, the North Shore News referred to local governments as “city fathers.” Council coverage was provided by, “Heather Jeal, girl reporter.”

One 1979 edition showed three women in bathing suits (four, if you include a fitness centre’s ad) over three pages.

Coverage of the destruction of squatters’ homes at Maplewood Mudflats refers to a resident as “Pretty” Colleen Wallace.

Cindy Goodman was a 20-year-old aspiring photog when she walked into the North Shore News office in 1987.

They were looking, as always, for more Sunshine Girls.

“I thought, well, that would be a good in,” she says.

The likes/dislikes conversation quickly segued into a photography discussion with Terry Peters, who was handling the hiring. The housing market was booming and the North Shore News needed real estate photos.

Luckily, Goodman just happened to have handy a portfolio of her photos.

“Do you still want to pose for Sunshine Girl?” Peters asked.

“I said, ‘Sure!’ So I did, just because I was young and dumb,” Goodman laughs.

She was a Sunshine Girl. And for the next 32 years, she was a staff photographer.

Sunset

By the 1990s, the Sunshine Girl supply line was getting longer and harder to maintain.

Local girls didn’t want to pose anymore, Goodman says. The reason so many models listed “bad drivers” as a dislike is because they were trucking in from Abbotsford, Langley and Richmond.

The paper briefly featured Sunshine Boys alongside the girls before the section was scrapped entirely.

In 2000, the paper offered a paean toward equality with the Sunshine Boy. Readers met Adam, a history buff who disliked standing still, spiders and research papers.

But despite those efforts, the feature seemed increasingly anachronistic. Women weren’t content to be seen. Or at least not just seen.

In May of that year, Sunshine Girl Michelle listed her likes as: “returning the environment to its natural state.”

By the end of the year, the Sunshine Girl died a “natural death,” Goodman grins.

“We didn’t miss it at all.”

Peg Fong echoed that sentiment.

“There is no place to show women on page 3 of a major print newspaper,” Fong says. “Maybe that’s too definitive but I don’t care. . . . You do not need to show women and exploit women that way.”

There are other ways to attract readers, she suggests.

“Do good journalism.”

The Sunshine Girl was something different, Me-An Laceste reflects. And maybe it could be different again.

“It’s not bad news, it’s not a political issue, nothing but: ‘Oh, look at that smile.’”

Maybe, Laceste says, the Sunshine Girl could come back. The accompanying write-up could be longer. And the “girl” could be an 80-year-old woman. It would send a message that growing old can be a beautiful thing, she says.

After posing in the North Shore News as a teenager, Schoening embarked on a short, somewhat unhappy modelling career.

“People being very critical of you and I was like, ‘Screw you.’”

Still, she loved being a Sunshine Girl.

“I have nothing negative to say about it at all.”

She works as a HandyDART driver these days. She has a son and a daughter. Her daughter, she notes, is at the same age Schoening was when she was a Sunshine Girl.

And would she be OK with her daughter posing?

“I could ask her,” Schoening replies. “She would be a perfect Sunshine Girl. She’s gorgeous.”

In the 50 years since the North Shore News first hit our doorsteps as the North Shore Shopper in 1969, there have been hundreds of magical local sports moments and achievements: from world and Olympic titles to the time your team came from behind to win that special beer-league championship.

It was extremely difficult to narrow down a list but, from my perspective, here are the 50 most noteworthy moments in the past half century, divided into three categories chronologically.

Undoubtedly, you’ll find some surprises and some you don’t remember or even know about.

Greatest moments

It’s a mix of heritage homes and older ranchers on tidy lots, interspersed with much bigger houses where the old ones got torn down.

article continues below

It’s also a neighbourhood with hills, which as a newspaper carrier, Harrison is well aware of.

“You wouldn’t notice if you’re driving,” he says. “You notice if you’re walking.”

The wagon trundles up East Queens Road, past houses with rose bushes where he’s known the neighbours for years and a large new house where he doesn’t. “The people who live there, we never see them at all. We’re not even sure people live there,” he says.

Harrison has lived all 13 years of his life in this neighbourhood. His paper route takes him past the church hall where his older sister once attended a Montessori preschool and just a few blocks away from Holy Trinity Elementary, where he just finished Grade 7.

Near the corner of this street, there’s a house where a big tree crashed down across the roof in a windstorm.

“It was crazy,” says Harrison. A port-a-potty left from the crew that came to fix the roof still stands at the end of the driveway.

This afternoon, neighbour Anne Patterson is out with her dog Sophie, enjoying the sprinkle of warm summer rain. “A bit of rain is good,” she says, eyeing the gardens.

Harrison is “the best carrier,” she says. “The paper is always there. It’s not thrown on the driveway.”

“I don’t think anyone’s going to have a bad word to say,” she says. “If they do, send them to me.”

Harrison rounds the corner and is up a block and on to East Kings Road.

As one of 60 kids who deliver the paper and 31 adult newspaper carriers, Harrison is part of a small army who get the North Shore News to about 37,000 houses and 13,000 apartments on the North Shore twice a week, on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Papers start arriving from the printer at the newspaper’s Brooksbank warehouse in the middle of the night, and the first adult carriers and delivery agents – who will drive bundles of papers out to the younger carriers – start arriving at 4 a.m., says Paul Watson, distribution manager at the News.

Adults with a car can deliver between 500 and 3,000 papers in a day. Most kids have a route with between 40 and 150 houses.

“The easier and flatter the route, the more children will apply,” says Watson.

Harrison usually starts his route around 4 p.m. When he comes home from school, several stacks of zap-strapped newspaper bundles are already waiting on his porch.

There are 78 houses on Harrison’s route. Friday’s paper is smaller, says Harrison, and usually fits in four bundles, while Wednesday’s is fatter and comes in five bundles. On Fridays, on the sections of the route he walks with a newspaper bag, “I’ll put 20 papers in my bag instead of 15,” he says. “On Fridays the papers have less ads.”

The News gives Harrison a sheet noting which houses to deliver to, which don’t want the paper and who’s away this week.

But as an experienced carrier, Harrison has most of that in his head already. “I know a lot of people very well,” he says of his neighbours.

When he started the route about three years ago, “I started because I wanted to make a bit of extra money,” he says.

He had a couple of friends who were newspaper carriers. One split the paper route with siblings. Another “had a very flat route,” says Harrison.

This is not one of those.

“I’m really hilly in this area.”

Equipment for the job is simple – a newspaper bag and a wagon or cart to pull the newspapers around in.

Like many jobs, it’s not like it is in the movies. “When you see it in the movies, it’s usually someone on their bike going really fast,” says Harrison, sounding slightly exasperated. Kids in his class have asked him if that’s how he does his paper route.

“I’m like, ‘How would I do it on my bike?’”

When he first started the paper route, his dad helped him the first few months to figure out a route. The trick is to be efficient, and make sure you’re pulling as little weight uphill as possible. Also, “we don’t want to back track,” says Harrison.

Papers tend to be lighter in the summer, which is good, says Harrison, because that’s when he’s pulling the wagon up hills in the heat.

Come fall, however, they will fatten up again, get heavier and be filled with more flyers. “Black Friday is usually the worst. And Christmas,” he says. “Black Friday they double stuff all the papers (with flyers). It takes a lot longer.”

If you want to know the state of the local economy, a newspaper carrier knows.

Kids who deliver papers make eight cents a paper plus extra for flyers and door hangers. For delivering a light summer paper on a route like Harrison’s, young carriers make around $10, twice a week. In the fall they make more. Then there are tips, especially at Christmas.

“This year I made $250 in tips,” says Harrison.

The best tippers are people who chat with him or the ones who used to be carriers themselves. “They know the experience,” says Harrison.

Delivering the paper has also led into some other work around the neighbourhood, like shovelling snow in winter. There’s also been talk of babysitting and dog sitting and picking up the mail for neighbours. “One house wanted me to water their plants while they are away,” he says.

“And my dad recently bought a lawnmower so I might start mowing lawns.”

Harrison heads down the gentle slope of East Kings Road lined with chestnut trees. He goes past one house that has cool decorations at Halloween including figures that jump out at you and move.

There’s a poster on a telephone pole for a missing black kitten named Lulu. “One time I saw a missing parrot poster,” says Harrison.

He’s seen raccoons in the neighbourhood before. “At one point there were cougar signs up here, cougar warnings,” he says. But he never saw one.

Wildlife on his route is mostly limited to birds and squirrels, which scold from the high branches of the trees along the street.

“I’ve seen owls,” he says.

He comes up to a large grey house where a cacophony of barking erupts from inside as he walks up the steps.

“It has these two huge dogs. They bark really loud,” he says. “They jump and belly slam the door.”

For newspaper carriers, dogs are an occupational hazard. Harrison says a dog bit him once, though it wasn’t serious. He takes most of the dogs in stride. Just around the corner is another dog house.

“The first time I walked up their driveway, their dog was going crazy,” he says. “The next day there was a sign saying do not enter that way.”

The sign is still very much in evidence, along with two more “Beware of Dog” signs, one in black and one in red, to underline the point.

“There are a lot of dogs on this route,” says Harrison.

A warm slightly overcast day like today is optimal for paper delivery.

“The best weather is not really hot. Maybe 15 degrees or something,” he says.

It doesn’t always work out that way. In North Vancouver, there is a lot of rain. And during the occasional winter cold snap, it can be hard to pull the wagon in the snow, he says. The hills can also get slippery.

In winter, Harrison starts his paper route a bit earlier and wears a reflective vest and visor. Some drivers aren’t paying attention for pedestrians, he’s learned. “They’re not busy streets at all so they just think they can go really fast.”

A small stretch of 29th Street – where cars are quickly zipping by – is one of the busier ones on his route. But Harrison only does a couple of houses here and he doesn’t cross the street. Luckily, his route also stops before the dreaded 29th Street hill.

Back on East Queens, he’s hit the sweet spot on his route – a row of townhouses. It was a woman who lives in one of these who gave him his biggest ever $50 tip at Christmas. Also, “They’re close together,” he says. “You can do them quick and fast.”

There are a few houses on the route that Harrison doesn’t deliver to but he doesn’t know the reason.

Usually, it’s something practical. Only once in a while do people cancel their papers because they’re upset about a story or an ad, says Watson, the distribution manager. A scantily clad lingerie model in an ad once raised some hackles. So did a photo of people involved in a cancer fundraiser wearing T-shirts telling cancer rather rudely just what it should do to itself. Readers were not amused.

Harrison passes a fig tree hanging green fruit over a fence, and carports stacked with recycling tubs and garbage carts. There’s a boat parked in a yard where he often stops and talks to a man who works on projects in his carport. Garden gnomes stare back at him from near the back door.

Houses here are on the flat and close together. “This part is really nice,” says Harrison. “Then I have to go up this huge hill.”

This part of Lonsdale is the busiest street he walks on his route and also the steepest.

He pulls the wagon up past the Queen’s Cross Pub, a gas station, a realty office and a daycare where a 7-11 used to be.

That’s where he used to see an odd guy hanging out in the parking lot sometimes, hoodie pulled up to shade his face. He told his friend’s dad, a police officer, about it. “He might be a drug dealer,” says Harrison. “I don’t know.”

“They were going to build condos there but they didn’t,” he says. “Now they’re repainting it.”

We pass another missing cat poster. Dobby, a Siamese described as “shy and cautious,” has been missing for over two weeks.

Back on East Kings, he passes a house with a wading pool in the front yard, where kids flying down the driveway on their sleds almost took him out once. The two-storey, 1960s-era house across the street with a curtain drooping from a basement window has recently sold for $1.3 million. The realty listing described the street as an “excellent sought-after neighbourhood.”

To toss or not to toss is an issue most carriers have to figure out.

For starters, there’s a way to hold the paper – grabbing from the outside, so the flyers are pointing in toward the fold. Holding it the other way means the flyers will spill out. That’s a rookie move.

A man on the street stops Harrison, asking if he has an extra. “Do they let you throw them? We used to throw them,” the man tells him. “I was a Province carrier.”

He tucks the paper into a neat firm rectangle, showing Harrison how to prepare for a toss, demonstrating a bit of newspaper origami still vivid after many decades. “You know, sometimes when you’ve gotta go up eight steps, sometimes it’s easier,” he says.

“We used to do it on bikes. That goes back to the ’50s.”

A lot of people tell Harrison how they used to deliver the papers.

For the most part, Harrison is still in the non-tossing camp. “I think it’s just disrespectful to do it,” he says. “If I throw it, all the ads fly out.”

He prefers to tuck the papers under a mat on the porch if possible. “I make sure it pokes out a bit so they see it.”

There have only been a couple of times when he had to stop delivering – once when he had pneumonia and once when he broke his leg skiing. “I was in a wheelchair for two months,” he says. His dad filled in until the newspaper got a temporary replacement and included notes explaining what happened. It was right after Christmas and he’d just earned some big tips.

“We didn’t want them to think I took their money and just left,” says Harrison.

He approaches the corner of St. Georges Avenue and East Queens and the last house on his route. A cat named Gypsy lives around here, says Harrison. She’s friendly. And not lost.

At this point he’ll often check to see how long it took him to do the route. Doing the papers usually takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half, depending. “When I first did it, it took two and a half hours,” he says. “It’s taken me two hours on days when it’s heavy and I can’t run.”

It’s about an eight-kilometre walk from beginning to end.

“My dad measured it on his app,” says Harrison.

But he’s also gotten faster and fitter doing the route.

Fifty minutes is his record doing the papers on his own. Once when a friend helped out, “We did it in 30 minutes.”

There are qualities that come in handy as a carrier, says Harrison. You need to be friendly. You need to have willpower. You need to be fit, “so you don’t get tired out.” You need to have a good memory for the houses.

He’s learned a lot about the neighbourhood as a carrier, he says. He’s gotten to know his neighbours in a way he didn’t before.

Next year he’s in high school, so he’ll just wait and see how it goes.

“It’s my first real job ever,” he says. ◆

Back in June of this year, she was stopped on her break while walking along Lonsdale Avenue and asked if she thought it was time to discontinue teaching dodgeball in gym class following recent academic research that suggested the popular ball sport was a tool of oppression.

article continues below

This wasn’t a new experience for Perrault. Thirty years earlier, when she was in her early 20s, she had been stopped by a different yet equally inquisitive reporter on Lonsdale who sought her point of view on objects in motion as well.

“The question at the time I’m sure – I’m positive – is they were trying to prohibit skateboarders going down the sidewalk at the time and they asked me what my opinion was,” says Perrault.

The reporters who stopped Perrault on both occasions, that time in the late 1980s and once again in 2019, were doing what’s referred to as “streeters” – essentially, journalism shorthand for going out into the community and getting people’s opinion on a subject.

Notepad and pen in hand, the reporters were tasked with doing streeters in order to include the responses from the public, alongside a small mug shot of those interviewed, to feature in a longstanding News section called Inquiring Reporter.

“What impresses me most of all is you would ask a teenager a question, yet you would also turn around and ask a 50-year-old the question,” says Perrault. “I think it’s great in that it’s completely unbiased and it looks over all generations and also grabs a good demographic … of who’s walking up and down Lonsdale” and elsewhere on the North Shore.

The News has been running the Inquiring Reporter feature, generally as part of the newspaper’s viewpoints and opinions section, for decades.

As the story goes, 50 years ago Peter Speck founded a once-a-week news flyer called the North Shore Shopper. By 1975, the Shopper officially became the North Shore News – and Inquiring Reporter was rolled out.

Through perusing decades’ worth of Inquiring Reporter questions, it’s evident reporters have galvanized the public with topics ranging from the light-hearted and fun, to the serious and sensational. Sometimes the questions were – and are – focused on a local North Shore angle. Other times they deviate from North and West Vancouver entirely to cover a topic that’s making national or international waves. The answers from the public can run the gamut from the enlightened to the jokey – it all depends on the person answering and the question being asked.

In 1979, reporter Ellsworth Dickson, observing the new phenomenon of people, for whatever reason, deciding to voluntarily run around their neighbourhoods in what he deemed the “fitness craze,” ventured to ask: “How do you keep fit?” for that week’s Inquiring Report question.

The responses he received back were generally kind, warm and thoughtful when it came to his fitness query, though one young man did fire back: “This fitness craze is for the birds; I like booze and sex.” Ah, the ’70s.

Jump forward to 2008. The News’ Stephanie Mosley asked, “Would a tax on disposable cups change people’s behaviour?”

“I would hope so,” responded Sheabon Smith from North Vancouver. Maybe Smith and other respondents, if they could have glimpsed the future in that moment, would have been relieved to see that our environmental discourse has largely moved away from disposable coffee cups and onto banning plastics straws and stumping for reusable shopping bags. Or maybe they would see it as not enough, given today’s news of pipelines and wildfires?

The look of Inquiring Reporter has changed over the years, but much has remained the same, like constant questions about traffic and the environment.

Another blast from the past: “Locals are tired of the traffic problems …” stated Martin Millerchip in his write up for his Inquiring Reporter question for that week, “Has BC Ferries outgrown Horseshoe Bay?” The year was 1999.

All three respondents for that week, 20 years ago, claimed they avoided the charming seaside neighbourhood due to overcrowding and congestion. Some things never change.

But some things do change. In 1977 the Inquiring Reporter asked: “Is the computer a blessing or a curse?” One perceptive reader from North Vancouver responded: “I think they are a curse because they put a lot of people out of work.”

• • •

Like anyone’s life, a lot has changed for Perrault in the 30-plus years since an eager reporter first stopped her on the street and sought her point of view. Perrault was born and raised on the North Shore, but moved to Squamish five years ago. When she was stopped on Lonsdale all those decades back she was a starry-eyed student at Capilano College studying commercial art, though for the past 28 years she’s worked in the health-care field at Lions Gate Hospital.

“It’s possible I was a waitress at the time,” she reflects, comparing being part of a reporter’s “streeters” then versus now. “It’s kind of ironic because I would say in terms of Lonsdale, it was probably within the same two blocks that I was stopped 30 years ago [and now].”

She doesn’t remember who the reporter was who spoke to her 30 years ago, though she does remember responding to the skateboarding question that she “didn’t seem to think there was a problem” when it came to four-wheeled cruisers traversing sidewalks.

Her perspective, to a degree, has changed with time; she can see now how “there would be a bit of a problem,” especially for older adults and others, if walkers and skateboarders were compelled to dodge one another on busy sidewalks. Laws, bylaws, and attitudes shift – and there’s always the chance she’ll feel differently about dodgeball tomorrow than she does today.

(Unfortunately, Perrault’s more-than-adequate response to the dodgeball query didn’t make it into the News after the on-scene reporter’s recording equipment mysteriously muzzled her answer over a string of white noise and traffic sounds.)

However, one thing she can say for sure has changed between then and now is the neighbourhood. “Lonsdale was a lot different than it is now,” she quips.

But one thing that hasn’t changed is Perrault’s passion for local news. “I pick up the North Shore News whenever I’m working here,” she says.

“It’s a great local newspaper.” ◆",[]

Years at the North Shore News: 1978-2015

article continues below

Current position: Retired

I started working for the North Shore News in February 1978. I was hired as a photographer and had no idea that this was going to become my career, which lasted until I retired 37 years later as the managing editor, in May 2015.

In 1978 the News was a small local paper that was changing the way community papers operated with its free distribution model. I was there near the beginning and was able to have a part in its growth. As a photographer I was fortunate enough to have an incredible range of experiences. I met the Queen and Prince Philip, I flew with the Canadian Forces Snowbirds, I walked underneath the harbour in the water supply tunnel from North Van to Stanley Park, and many more cool things.

Over the years I photographed hundreds of craft shows, elementary school plays, high school football games, and even Sunshine Girls. The joy of being a newspaper photographer is the access you are given. It doesn’t matter whether you are walking under the stage to pop up at the front to photograph the Rolling Stones or you are heading into a seniors centre (which coincidentally the Rolling Stones now belong in), you are given a glimpse behind the scenes and invited to tell a story of what you saw. I have always thought of my role as a storyteller and was grateful that over the years I was allowed to share so many stories. Later as managing editor I was able to work with a group of incredibly talented writers and photographers and guide the direction of the paper’s content.

The News has always excelled at telling those stories that make up the rich landscape of this amazing community. I worked with a wide range of characters, from the well-loved like Bob Hunter and Ellsworth Dickson, to the frequently despised Doug Collins. They each brought a different perspective.

As a team, the News could not be beaten and no greater proof of that was the attempt to shut us down by the arsonist who soon discovered he’d only destroyed a building and not the idea. We rose above that and never missed publishing a single paper. It was my greatest reward to be able to lead the editorial department through that time.

From humble beginnings to the best community newspaper in Canada, the News has grown with the community it has represented for 50 years. ◆",[]

We’re looking for the truth.

Well … most of the time we are looking for the truth. One day a year, however, we might take a few liberties, add in a touch of creative embellishment. Or, perhaps, we’ll completely make something up.

Media organizations have a long tradition of running fake news stories as April Fools’ Day pranks, and we here at the News sometimes can’t resist a good whopper. The North Shore News used to publish three times a week, now two, meaning that we don’t have a hard-copy paper hitting the streets every April 1. But when we do, you might need to read with a little extra scepticism.

One year we wrote about West Vancouver’s new “housing reduction strategy,” a policy to eliminate houses to give current residents “a little more elbow room.” Funnily enough, the next census revealed that West Vancouver actually did have a net loss in the number of dwellings that year.

Other early April exposés revealed a plan to put turnstiles on backcountry trails, a Mount Rushmore-like sculpture featuring B.C. premiers on Eagleridge Bluffs, and a new North Shore municipality dubbed the District of East North Vancouver.

Below we’ve reprinted a story, written by reporter James Weldon, that we published on the front page on April 1, 2007. It came in quite a convincing package, complete with a very official-looking illustration drawn up by one of the paper’s graphic designers.

This one fooled a lot of people, including a provincial minister who left us an angry phone message only to call back later with a more sheepish response.

Would you have been fooled? Give it a read, and try to decide where the reasonable becomes the ridiculous:

Province considers waterfront bypass ; Faster traffic means fewer emissions

James Weldon

April 1, 2007

The North Shore’s commute may soon be getting a lot easier with the province’s approval this week of a preliminary plan for the North Shore Greenway, an east-west arterial connector along the North and West Vancouver waterfront.

The plan, described by the Ministry of Transportation as a “bold new vision for green transit,” will allow traffic to pass rapidly and unimpeded past the Lions Gate and Ironworkers bottlenecks to the Sea-to-Sky corridor. At its eastern end, the four-lane thoroughfare will ultimately connect to a suspension bridge over Indian Arm, tentatively planned for 2015.

By smoothing the flow of traffic through the area, the new bypass will reduce idling, cutting North Shore greenhouse emissions dramatically.

“We’re putting drivers in the fast lane to a cooler planet,” said a ministry official, who asked not to be named because of the plan’s preliminary nature.

The project will have other less obvious benefits also, said the official. By eliminating many of the mature trees in North Shore parks -- including one stand of old growth, which he described as “outdated” -- the road will likely halve the area’s native fauna, a major source of carbon emissions.

“If we want to reduce our greenhouse output 33 per cent by 2020 (promised in February’s Speech from the Throne), we have to take bold action now,” said the official. “And this is nothing if not bold.”

The loss of parkland, including parts of Cates Park, Ambleside Park and the conservation area at Maplewood Flats, will be made up with an equivalent expansion of North Vancouver’s industrial zone.

While placing high-speed traffic between residents and the beach will result in a moderate erosion of pedestrian security, the loss will be more than balanced out by improved driver safety on a 90 km/h freeway with few major bends or intersections.

The ministry is hoping to get expropriations and other administrative details out of the way quickly, to have the North Shore portion of the P3 project complete before 2010.

“Not that it’s for the Olympics,” added the official.

The process should be further accelerated by the elimination of the usual community consultation, in accordance with the new structure of TransLink.

Despite appearances, the Greenway will not run contrary to the province’s commitment to public transit, said the official. By channelling traffic to the waterfront, space will be freed up for the North Shore’s handful of buses to access commuter routes.

“It’s similar to the logic of starving funding to the Evergreen Line in favour of expanding highways,” said the official. Fast-tracking that project or other mass transit proposals would have been “an environmental catastrophe.”

North Shore developers contacted by the News expressed cautious support for the proposal. While it is unclear how it will impact them -- if at all -- several have submitted requests for density bonusing “just to be safe.”

The plan’s final draft is expected one year from today: April 1, 2008. ◆

535,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/nsn-50th/a-newsroom-reflects-on-former-north-shore-rescue-leader-tim-jones-1.23921473,A newsroom reflects on former North Shore Rescue leader Tim Jones,['Andy Prest'],,"Most people in these parts know the late Tim Jones as the legendary team leader of North Shore Rescue, but here at the North Shore News we got to see a side of him that wasn’t readily apparent to the general public.

One of the most important parts of search and rescue work is educating the public so that there will be less unprepared wanderers in need of rescuing. Early on in his career, Jones realized that developing strong ties to local media outlets was the best way to get the message out to the masses.

article continues below

The proof is in the numbers. A rudimentary search of “Tim Jones” in the North Shore News online story archives reveals an astonishing 557 stories containing his name. And that archive only goes back to 2001, covering roughly half of his career with North Shore Rescue. You’d be hard-pressed to find any name, aside perhaps from those belonging to reporters themselves, that appears in our paper more than his over our 50-year history.

Jones was always keen to give blow-by-blow accounts of NSR’s rescues to the North Shore News. Often we’d call him up to learn about the happy resolution of one rescue only to be told that he was back out on some treacherous cliff taking part in the next rescue. He’d always get back to us, though, with an account of what happened and a tip for what the public could learn from it. Jones got so good at the drill that he could give reporters everything they needed, colourful quotes and all, without even talking to us.

“It got to the point that Tim could call and leave a voicemail, anticipating all of the questions I would ask about a rescue and leave enough information that I could write a complete story without having to call him back, including the always important public safety lesson learned,” says North Shore News reporter Brent Richter.

Every reporter from the Tim Jones era has a story to tell about him. I recall calling him up with some brilliant idea about an exposé about out-of-bounds skiers.

“Nah, you don’t want to write that,” he answered. “Here’s your story….”

He proceeded to describe in great detail some of the dangers around the growing trend of backcountry showshoeing, and he was right: his story was 1,000 times better than the one I was cooking up and earned me my first Ma Murray Newspaper award. It was all Tim.

Jones died of a heart attack in 2014 at the age of 57. The public memorial and send-off confirmed his status as North Shore royalty. He was a very important figure on the North Shore, and a treasured source for the North Shore News.

“Tim was one of the few people whose phone numbers I had memorized, we did so many NSR stories,” says Richter. “And I have, so far, refused to take his name and number off my contact list.”

We all know that West Vancouver snowboard legend Maëlle Ricker claimed gold at Cypress Mountain in 2010, becoming the first Canadian woman ever to earn an Olympic title on home soil. The story, of course, was front page news in our paper the next day.

article continues below

What readers don’t know, however, was that the story almost didn’t make it onto the page. It wasn’t quite a “stop the presses!” moment, but it was as close as I’ve ever come.

As a relative newbie on the sports reporting scene back in 2010, I wasn’t able to secure one of the much-coveted but hard-to-come-by media accreditations for the Games. That forced me to get a bit creative with the coverage, catching what I could from TV broadcasts and adding colour from sources on the scene.

Ricker was dominant in snowboard cross in the years leading up to the Games, making her one of the favourites coming into the competition. It didn’t start out well, however, as some bad weather made the course treacherous for the morning qualifying runs and Ricker crashed on her first time trial. Then the weather got worse, and there was debate about whether or not they should skip the second round of qualifying altogether and just go straight to the final, a move which would have bumped Ricker out of the race for gold.

Eventually the second qualifying runs were held and Ricker blasted to the third best time of the day. That on-course delay, however, not only caused stress for Ricker but also for our news staff, as we were now pushing up hard against our mid-afternoon print deadline for the Wednesday paper. Any more delays and the story would have been too late to get in the paper, leaving a big hole on our front page.

Ricker held up her end of the bargain though, and the gold medal final was glorious.

I know reporters are supposed to be unbiased, but there was a massive roar and even a few tears in the newsroom when our local star flew off that final jump and landed a spot in the history books.

But now the pressure was really on – 20 minutes until our drop-dead deadline. Gah! I quickly called two contacts on the mountain: fellow North Shore Olympic snowboarder Drew Neilson, who was stationed up at the starting gate to help Ricker get the jump on the competition, and team trainer Anthony Findlay, who was at the bottom watching with the crazed Canadian fans.

Neilson described the peculiar “Deerfield Posse Sign” that he and Ricker exchanged just before the race, an homage to a North Vancouver apartment called The Deerfield that Neilson once shared with Ricker and other friends.

“You take your right hand and you pound your chest, you pound your heart, and then you put the horns on your head,” Neilson told me about their cute little pseudo gang sign.

Meanwhile Findlay had a hard time describing exactly what he’d seen at the bottom of the course.

“I couldn’t [see]; I was crying,” he said. “She is the best in the world – she proved that today.”

Great quotes! And now, time to write! I’ve never typed so fast. With editors breathing fire down my neck, I had just enough time to throw in a probably-too-cheeky lede (“West Vancouver native Maëlle Ricker moved a mountain yesterday”) and get that thing on the page and out the door before getting strangled by the people running the printing press.

To this day I still get chills anytime I watch that race and hear announcer Jamie Campbell scream “Here in Vancouver, Maëlle Ricker’s Olympic dreams have come true!”

I felt honoured to share the story with our readers, even if it left me in a quivering puddle following those frantic few minutes. It was a golden North Shore sporting moment we’ll not soon forget.

Here Layne Christensen, the current editor of the North Shore News and a longtime staffer, lets readers in on what they might hear if they dropped into the newsroom on a press day:

Turbo

A printout of a photo with a caption for layout. Takes its name from the make of a long-forgotten newsroom printer used to output news photos. “Hey Mike, where’s that turbo of the Cut crash?”

“Dogs, Bears, Trees”

A bear? In a tree!?! Deploy the photographer! file photo Kevin Hill, North Shore News

Frivolous [and not actual] formula for story selection during the dog days of summer, when absolutely everyone books out of town – school officials, politicians, neighbourhood tipsters, and even criminals -- typically resulting in a news drought. Recently expanded to: “Dogs, Bears, Trees, Traffic.” Also a fairly accurate listing of the types of stories that typically generate the most reader reactions.

Page 3

A Focus feature story, photo essay or investigative piece planned for page 4 of our Friday print edition. Back in the day when we put out a Sunday paper, and before a newspaper redesign, the Focus feature always ran on page 3 of our weekend edition. The name remains, even though the stories never appear on page 3 anymore. “Brent’s on the Page 3 schedule for this week. Looks like he’s pulling another all-nighter.”

“Deploy the photographer!”

Said in jest when a reporter gets a breaking news alert. First uttered in the 1990s by a dogged reporter known to closely monitor the newsroom police scanner, in excited response to a newsworthy police dispatch.

Inq Rep

Short for “Inquiring Reporter,” where an intrepid reporter takes to the streets to ask readers their opinions on all manner of subjects. In journalism, it’s known as a “streeter.” At the News, it’s a rite of passage for every new hire. Nothing feels better, though, than to gleefully hand Inq Rep duties over to the latest J-school intern. “Where’s Ben? He’s out doing Inq Rep. In the rain.”

Dummy

The preliminary layout of our print edition showing ad placement and what editorial “holes” are to be filled with photos and copy. Most definitely NOT what we would call the latest J-school intern.

“Squish it down, sex it up!”

One editor’s directive to a stringer [freelance reporter] upon reading a lacklustre story on municipal statement of financial information reports. It means chop some copy and find the news hook. A variant of the print journalism rule: “Keep it tight and bright.”

Pub date

Alas, not a description of hardworking newsroom employees raising a pint after the paper goes to press, but rather a notation for when the print edition hits doorsteps. Pub date is short for “publication date.” ◆

Editor’s dispatch from the 1990s North Shore News movable feast. Warning to readers with food allergies and sensitive stomachs: some items on offer could prove difficult to digest.

Appetizers, entrees and daily specials include fashion-forward Sunshine Girls, thick-skinned columnists, dour press council decisions and raw censorship debates. For some, there might also be a few just deserts.

In short, that North Shore News movable feast on most days was a robust and spicy meal.

The editorial kitchen was therefore similar to other commercial kitchens preparing dishes for a diverse audience: hot, oft-times chaotic, air thick with the danger of egos being bruised from unpasteurized diner feedback.

Not a place for the faint of heart. Nor likely would it have been a place permitted to remain uncensored were it somehow to be airlifted into the social media age.

Consider, for example, the aforementioned Sunshine Girl feature. Its origins predated my editorial watch, but it really began to offend the easily offended in the 1990s.

Maybe they were upset that not all of the girls featured were from the North Shore. Truth be told: some were from out of town! And some were, shall we say, less inhibited than the girl next door.

The News by then was becoming a lightning rod for local and regional controversy on several fronts, so the writing was on the wall for the Sunshine Girl feature. Even the addition of a Sunshine Boy could not save it.

Best, perhaps, that it was sent packing by the forces of enlightenment. Hymns from their community newspaper choir book preached neighbourhood harmony and cohesion.

No argument there.

Harmony and cohesion are far less taxing on editorial kitchen blood pressure. But ensuring that Anti-Saloon Leaguers and other self-righteous meddlers don’t outlaw debate over difficult issues requires more than harmony and cohesion. A bit of bare-knuckle boxing, for starters.

So there was more than cheeky Sunshine in News pages back then.

The paper employed at various times during the 1990s a stable of columnists who kept readers plugged into that debate and aware of how easily lost their hard-won freedom of expression can be.

Stable stalwarts included Greenpeace original and environmental activist Bob Hunter; author, longtime daily newspaper columnist and former member of Parliament Paul St. Pierre; former provincial court judge Les Bewley; radio hot-liner Gary Bannerman; independent MLA David Mitchell; right-of-centre feminist Ilana Mercer; eloquent Vancouver Sun columnist Trevor Lautens; News eminence grise Noel Wright; and, of course, Doug Collins.

Wright, it should be noted here, was integral to the development of the North Shore News’ persona. The former public relations man, photographer, linguist and senior intelligence officer with the British occupation forces in post-war Germany was big on debunking views held by those not much interested in thinking for themselves.

But, of course, the conductor at the head of this controversial choir of edgy opinion spinners was News founder Peter Speck.

No room in this space to discuss the complexities of working for Mr. Speck. Let’s just say that, for him, running a community newspaper was as much about fighting bad bills and hounding tax-happy governments from office as it was about making money.

That made things uncomfortable for editorial kitchen staff; especially for an editor who was also working a restaurant beat that included reviews of local hospital food and digesting threats of legal action over dining reviews that were not always four-star approvals.

It also generated a string of press council hearings targeting the News and later a costly human rights tribunal that drained company financial resources and divided opinions within and without the newspaper.

The newspaper’s readership became a large part of the movable feast here. It put its money where its newspaper’s mouth was by contributing roughly $200,000 in volunteer donations to help fund the three-year fight against the tribunal’s attempts to criminalize opinion.

That will likely never be duplicated here or anywhere else in this age of under-thinking, over-reacting and information degradation.

Nor will the run of drama, debate, vitriol, vilification and adulation that was directed at the North Shore News in the 1990s.

It was a rich and raucous meal.

I’m still digesting it. ◆

There had been a lot of anxiety in the months leading up to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games and sadly that filtered into our newsroom. Warm weather, venue construction delays, and the threat of protests had all those living in the Lower Mainland a little on edge.

Traffic was another concern, but fear not, we were told, specifically those of us commuting to the newsroom from areas off the North Shore. Since the bridges would be impassable due to the influx of Olympic watchers, we could sleep in the paper’s lunchroom or boardroom on cots for the duration of the Games.

While thankfully it didn’t come to that as to everyone’s surprise, traffic had never been lighter than it was during Vancouver 2010, I was reminded of my team’s dedication to meeting publishing deadlines. That same team had never missed an issue, including during the period directly following a devastating 2005 fire that ripped through the NSN’s former Lonsdale home.

The caller told me the body was “stinky” and he needed my help negotiating a reward with the RCMP. It turned out the same guy had called police with this story, but they told me he refused to send pictures as proof of his claims.

Years at the North Shore News: 1990-2000

Current position: Publisher of thebreaker.news

A typical damp North Shore day in February 1990. A nervous, shy 19-year-old intern from Langara journalism walked into a funky office building at 1139 Lonsdale and climbed the creaky wooden stairs.

I grew up reading and delivering the North Shore News. Now I was becoming part of the team publishing the tabloid. A journey that lasted more than a decade, interrupted by stints in Maple Ridge and Richmond.

Barrett Fisher was leaving the editor’s chair to Tim Renshaw. One of his first decisions was to put me to work. Pages were still cut-and-paste and photographs developed in chemical-laden darkrooms. Bulky computer terminals began to displace typewriters.

I sat near founder/publisher Peter Speck’s office. A great storyteller in his own right who told me Greenpeace held some of its first meetings a few steps away; co-founder Bob Hunter, one of my favourite News columnists, gave me an interview right there one day, during a book tour.

Tim’s second-in-command was the late Michael Becker. His smile and laughter always kept the newsroom bright. They often sent me out to do the Commercial Avenues business feature and even Inquiring Reporter streeters.

Assignments ranged from Horseshoe Bay (the first BC Ferries Fastcat journey) to Deep Cove (Dan Culver, the late Everest climber). From Lonsdale Quay (the Old No. 5 Ferry that became the Seven Seas floating seafood restaurant) to the Peak of Grouse (2001 Mountain Bike World Championship).

I developed a habit of turning vacations into business trips, such as a 1999 jaunt to Ottawa to shadow local MPs John Reynolds and Ted White around Parliament Hill, and a visit to Toronto’s Royal Ontario Museum that included the opening reception of Bryan Adams’ photo exhibit with the North Shore rocker himself. His mum Jane was so delighted her world-famous son got noticed by the local newspaper that she wrote me a thank-you note. Adams cherished his privacy, but Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described his West Vancouver home studio to me after coming north to mix the Seattle band’s posthumous live album.

Famous ex-North Vancouver mother Margaret Trudeau came to Mount Seymour one day with future prime minister Justin to promote avalanche safety, just over a year after another son, Michel, died snowboarding. Miraculously, another mother avoided tragedy after she dropped her daughter from the Capilano Suspension Bridge, a breaking news story that gained worldwide attention.

A Davis Cup tie came to the grass courts on Hollyburn, the biggest local event of Grant Connell’s career. Clint Smith’s hockey career was more than four decades over, but he felt like a kid again when I invited him to pose with the Stanley Cup at North Vancouver City fire hall. His name was on the replica from his time with the 1940 New York Rangers.

A community paper is only as good as the people in the community. Too many to name, but three pop out. The seemingly eternal North Vancouver City Mayor Jack Loucks. Visionary recreation director Gary Young, who asked Sport BC’s John Mills “how about an Olympics for Vancouver?” And the late paramedic Tim Jones, the tireless leader of local heroes North Shore Rescue.

Oh, and then there’s the retired Terry Peters and the tireless North Shore News photography team, and the North Shore Indians lacrosse team and its old-timers, like the late Squamish Nation elder Simon Baker. And how could I forget Nardwuar?

I could go on forever, and that’s the point. Is there a better place in the world to begin a newspaper career, or a better paper to do so with?",[]

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

Mario Canseco is president of Research Co.

Results are based on an online study conducted from July 10 to July 12, 2020, among 800 adult British Columbians. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in British Columbia. The margin of error, which measures sample variability, is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.",[]

She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

He built his law firm on a foundation of compassion, trust, and approachability. In his experience, finding the right lawyer to help with your personal injury case is crucial.

“First of all, you want someone who is local,” he says. “You want to be able to build an ongoing connection with the lawyer and that is easier to do if the law firm is close by.” Hanson & Co is conveniently located in the heart of North Vancouver. They are also actively involved and supporting a number of community non-profit organizations.

Finding a legal representative that you feel comfortable talking to is also important. “Personal injury cases can be traumatic,” Jim notes. “You want to deal with someone who listens, who is supportive, and who, above all, genuinely cares about you and your case.”

Many lawyers offer free initial consultations and people should take advantage of that appointment to chat about the law firm’s approach to personal injury clients. “Be sure they are listening in a non-judgmental way,” advises Jim. “You shouldn’t feel like you are being judged. You are the victim. A lawyer should be able to communicate in a way that makes you comfortable that they understand the elements of the case and that they are there to represent you and only you.”

Checking out the lawyer’s experience in personal injury matters is also high on Jim’s list. “At Hanson & Company, we have been around for a long time. Longevity and experience are important.”

In other words, make sure the lawyer has experience in the area of law for which you require their services. For example, just because a lawyer is very good at family law does not necessarily mean he or she has the experience you need for a personal injury case. “Do your homework,” advises Jim.

Make sure that the law firm has the resources, both financial and staffing, to see a case through to its successful conclusion.

“At Hanson& Company,” says Jim, “we have three lawyers, each highly experienced in personal injury law, and a full complement of support and paralegal staff. We are also able to offer a contingency arrangement for billing. Of course, the initial personal and confidential consultation is free.”

It’s an amazing and popular tool that helps protect your privacy on the Internet.

article continues below

And why is it necessary?

The following will explain why you should start using one, like the type PureVPN offers.

VPN is a network of servers spread out in different places. It allows clients to pass their online traffic through the VPN servers.

This can help you in many different ways, because when you connect to a VPN server, your original IP address changes and takes on the form of the server’s IP address.

But is it okay to call a VPN some form of glorified proxy service? The answer is easy.

A VPN goes beyond an ordinary proxy service, depending on which one you use. If you connect to a premium VPN service, such as PureVPN, you will be able to get a whole lot more when you browse on the web.

Premium VPN services come with unique features offering complete online security and privacy thanks to special encryption, securing you from all kinds of online threats.

Considered to be unbreakable, the encryption can’t be bypassed by hackers or cybercriminals. Even some of the biggest surveillance agencies, including the FBI and NSA, cannot break through.

Internet security has been a major issue over the past decade, and cyber security threats are on the rise.

Gone are the days when thieves used to loot banks or perform pick-pocketing to earn money. Modern thieves use advanced tactics, performing thefts from the comforts of their laptop.

Modern thieves know the art of hacking into people’s devices. They can scan for software loopholes to be exploited, and once hacked can steal any data they want. This data can then be used in various ways. In some cases, it’s used to blackmail victims. In others, it’s sold on to the dark web.

Most victims are those who use public Wi-Fi networks in hotels or coffee shops. Hackers are known to wait inside these places and hack the network so they can monitor whatever traffic passing through them.

Thankfully, a VPN service, such as PureVPN, can protect you.

Users can keep themselves safe from all kinds of online threats lurking online.

PureVPN is one of the most reliable VPN services around a fact acknowledged in reviews by top publications such as CNET and Trustpilot.

""Often, when that conversation doesn't happen, children are unclear as to their parent's wishes,"" Nicole explains. ""I've seen cases where one child has said that their parent wanted to buried and another felt that cremation was wanted. It leads to family arguments and the possibility that your wishes may not be carried out.""

The Memorial Society of B.C. has been encouraging members and their families to have an end of life planning conversation for more than 60 years. With in excess of 242,000 members around the province, the Society is the largest memorial society in North America.

""Your survivors can benefit from our help when the time comes,"" says Nicole. ""Their first phone call should be to the Society. We can have your wishes for the disposition of your remains on file. We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents. I've been at information sessions where a parent has shared that they have a pre-paid plot for their remains, but their child sitting next to them was totally unaware. They can't carry out your wishes if they don't know what they are.""

It seems natural that we all plan for our vacations and retirement, but we don't want to plan for the end of life. This is a mistake, says Nicole.

""A man I know opens his lectures by saying, 'Dying is not a choice. It is going to happen.' With that in mind, it is important that we plan for the end and make sure our loved ones know our wishes. It will save them money and heartache at a difficult time.""

What has been the secret to its success?

article continues below

Simple - its team of transportation professionals is united by one singular purpose – expediting your success.

And the strategy of what SPI calls “supercharging your freight brokerage business” can be broken down into five steps.

1. Examine Ways to Cut Costs

Reducing what your customers pay while maintaining a high level of service will attract new customers, and allow you to retain your current client list. This can be achieved by:

• Consolidating shipments to ensure on-time delivery with the fewest possible trips for your drivers and the most effective use of available space and fuel.

• Employing a variety of shipping modes to find the most affordable method.

• Avoiding unnecessary risks to keep shipping expenses low.

2. Diversify Shipping Options

Companies specializing in one or two specific business sectors can increase profitability and efficiency by opening up their business to other markets.

For example, if you routinely ship produce and refrigerated materials, your business model could easily be expanded to carry other perishable items in the same trucks. This could allow you to avoid half-empty trucks and transports that can cost your company time and money.

3. Create Contingency Options

Creating a contingency plan to overcome unexpected issues typically requires some or all of the following steps:

• Identifying potential risks.

• Prioritizing these risks in order of their impact on your company and your operations.

• Creating a detailed plan to address each of these issues.

SPI Logistics’ dedicated experts provide customers with insights into the potential risks of their current business plans, and can help determine the best and most practical ways to expand and protect your freight brokerage business.

4. Collect Data on Your Shipments

Collecting, compiling and maintaining accurate information on the composition of shipments and the ways products and materials are transported provides a basis for making decisions about your business.

The right data will allow fleet expansion in the most cost-effective and practical manner. Trends can also be better spotted that will allow quicker action to take advantage of new directions in the industry.

And the right record keeping will ensure you stay on the right side of any regulations or requirements imposed by outside agencies now, and in the future.

5. Make the Best Use of Technology

Automating the logistics processes can save time and effort in dealing with shipping and warehousing requirements. Working with a company that specializes in these types of activities can help streamline processes and promote the best and most practical solutions for all shipping activities.

SPI Logistics provides effective technological solutions without the expense or a learning curve.

With a network of more than 50 locations in the United States and Canada, SPI Logistics is a leader in logistics and transportation consulting, and can provide the right solutions for your business needs now and into the future.

The Memorial Society is a non-profit organization registered under the Societies Act of B.C. and is the only member-based, volunteer-driven memorial society in B.C.

""Everybody should be a member of the Society,"" Nicole says. ""Everybody alive will pass away at some point and for a $40 one-time membership fee, we can take the burden off your loved ones by referring them to a designated funeral service provider for the disposition of your remains and related issues.""

Upon joining the Society, members are asked to complete an arrangement form stating their wishes for their remains and detailing any pre-paid arrangements they may have.

""People need to have this conversation with their children,"" Nicole says, ""It's not a pleasant topic for most people and you don't need to dwell on it, but it's a conversation that must be had.""

John S. Clark, President and Founder of Pacific Spirit Investment Management would like to change that.

""At Pacific Spirit, we believe that every client should have a formal, written retirement plan,"" he says. ""It serves as a road map and tells us where you are now, where you need to be when you retire, and how you're going to get there. If you don't have that road map, you increase the odds that you're not going to get to your financial destination.""

A financial plan is also the best communication tool for your portfolio manager to discuss with you your objectives, risk tolerance, and future expectations.

""All those things are captured in a good plan,"" John explains. ""If the market experiences a shudder and isn't performing as well as we'd like, we can refer back to the plan and give our client some comfort that they're still on the right road to their retirement destination.""

In John's opinion, the worst thing a client can do is to abandon their plan at the wrong time.

""In our experience,"" he says, ""a well thought out plan keeps a client focused on the long term goal. Abandoning the plan at the wrong time, such as when the market takes a temporary downward turn, can have disastrous effects and destroy a family financially. With a plan in place, an investor can stay the course.""

Establishing a comprehensive financial plan is not a one-time event and should include some flexibility for life changes.

""With every significant life change,"" John says, ""we'll update the plan. It could be a career change, a death or illness in the family, or a birth of a child. Whenever there are circumstances that may warrant a change in direction, we advise updating the plan.""

Offering financial planning and wealth management advice for more than 20 years, John and the Pacific Spirit team tailor their services to each individual client family.

""The key members of our team have been with Pacific Spirit for between 10 to 20 years,"" John says. ""We have trusted designations appropriate to the profession and we all believe in being client-focused. We're not a huge firm, so clients can pick up the phone and call us for personal attention.

So when Jenny Karmali, of Journeys with Heart, which arranges domestic and international tours supporting local charities, approached Bishop about hosting the organization’s first excursion in 2008, the answer was “of course!” “The first trip we did was to India, and it was a three-week trip benefitting the BC Women’s Hospital Foundation. We had twenty-plus people along to join the journey and it was quite amazing,” Bishop explains.

After the first excursion, Bishop was hooked and has continued hosting one to two journeys each year. In 2018, the chef is looking forward to hosting tours to Newfoundland and Labrador (June 2 to 12) which benefits the North Vancouver City Library, and to Israel and Jordan, (October 1 to 14), supporting Aunt Leah’s Place.

As the lucky participants would expect, the tours Bishop hosts have a strong foodie component. “I have friends in Newfoundland and Labrador who have restaurants and brew pubs there so we are going to be having meals with them,” he says.

While Bishop says he is blessed to be able to combine two of his passions while also supporting local charities, he says that one of the most fulfilling aspects of hosting the tours is the opportunity to travel with participants who come back year after year. “We’re like a big group of friends going on a trip together,” he says. “Sharing this experience, this travel adventure of discovery, being able to visit various parts of the world … it’s very memorable.”

Miss CEO Nail Salon takesa conscious and clean approach to beauty, using non-toxic nail polishes and waterless hand and foot care using a medical pedicure machine—making it the first of its kind in B.C. to do so.

Not only are the cosmetic treatments safe and 100% bacteria-free, but they also guarantee long-lasting results.

After all, water and nail polish have never been friends.

If you’re fed up with paying for a gel manicure, only to have it chip a week later, the waterless method can help. That’s because your nail temporarily expands after your hands are soaked, which causes the nail polish to buckle and chip once your nail returns to its original shape.

Instead, Miss CEO Nail Salon will use a electrical device equipped with a rotating burr that hygienically and gently files away tough skin in less time than with a standard file.

Enjoy longer-lasting silky feet while saving water and the planet with this European pedicure technology, available exclusively at Miss CEO Nail Salon at 835 Drake Street in Yaletown.

""It’s considered a luxury brand without the luxury price tag—a brand that offers drivers a unique combination of strength, safety and stability.""

Shaun has actually experienced VW’s legendary safety features firsthand.

""Years ago in the U.K.,” he recounts, “I was hit at 70 mph (112 km/h) while driving a little VW Polo—and I literally walked out of the car. If I'd been driving anything else, it probably would have been a very different story.""

Thinking about buying a VW? Shawn has some advice on how to choose which VW model is right for you.

""Always buy the car you need rather than the car you want,"" he says. ""A lot of people choose a car they want, regardless of their needs. Then, about six months later, they realize that a sporty, high-end model doesn’t really suit their lifestyle. ""

Of course, if you’re still not sure, one of the staff at Capilano VW would be happy to help you find the VW that’s right for you. And don’t worry—Capilano’s stress-free approach to car-shopping is what’s made them so popular with car shoppers over the years.

""We have a ten-foot rule,"" says Garry Speranza, Sales Manager at Capilano VW. ""When any of our employees sees a customer within ten feet of them, they approach the customer with a smile and ask them where they're going. They then walk the customer to the department they're looking for. If they're driving on to the lot, we give them a few moments to orientate themselves before approaching them in a friendly and honest manner.""

Shaun suggests that looking for a vehicle at Capilano VW is a lot easier than most people think.

""One of the things we do to put people at ease is offer them a complimentary coffee or water before anything else,” says Shaun. “Buying a vehicle is a big decision and everybody needs to work through the process at a pace they’re comfortable with. The last thing they need is for someone to ask them 'do you want to buy this car?' right away. We start by asking the customer what they need and go from there. Our goal is to make sure that the customer gets the best advice possible from the best-trained people.""

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

Haig Farris sent in these photos of a two-hour battle between a large sea lion and a pod of 10 or so orcas. ""It was terrifying, sad, exciting, tragic and powerful!"" wrote Farris.

The provincial government has extended its temporary authorization, which allows businesses with food-primary and liquor-primary licences to sell and deliver packaged liquor products, alongside meal purchases, for off-site consumption.

The authorization would have expired July 15.

Prior to the measure, restaurants and bars were in general only allowed to sell liquor for consumption at their establishments. The sale of alcohol for off-site consumption has provided businesses with an additional source of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The province is also extending an authorization that allows for increased hours of retail liquor service. Extended hours will remain in place until August 31.

Dr. Michael Schwandt, who was one of the first infectious disease specialists from Vancouver Coastal Health to help contain outbreaks at sites like the Lynn Valley Care Centre, made the comments not long after a group of 239 scientists from 32 countries wrote an open letter to the World Health Organization, successfully appealing for the world health body to change its guidance on aerosolized transmission.

article continues below

“We'll be watching closely the science around airborne transmission. At this time, we don't think it's played a major role in the outbreaks in Vancouver Coastal Health that we've had direct experience with,” said Dr. Schwandt.

The new W.H.O. guidance, which came last Thursday, accepts that the novel coronavirus can spread through aerosolized particles — tiny droplets in the air — in crowded indoor settings for prolonged periods of time.

“There have been reported outbreaks of COVID-19 in some closed settings, such as restaurants, nightclubs, places of worship or places of work where people may be shouting, talking, or singing.

“In these outbreaks, aerosol transmission, particularly in these indoor locations where there are crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected persons spend long periods of time with others, cannot be ruled out,” reads the W.H.O.’s new guidance, which also calls for more research into aerosol transmission. aerosol transmission.

But Dr. Schwandt said his team doesn’t view the airborne versus droplet transmission debate as a binary, and that while the virus can be traced at varying distances at concentrations, most of the cases he’s come across in Vancouver Coastal Health region, home to the first outbreaks in the country, have been from “face-to-face” transmission.

The proof, he said, comes from Vancouver Coastal’s success in tracing contacts based on direct contact, an experience a spokesperson for Fraser Health told the Tri-City News has been echoed in their health authority.

“Without taking airborne transmission into account as a risk factor, we've been able to bring outbreaks under good control, really looking at close physical contact as the main risk factor,” said Dr. Schwandt.

That means, at the moment, current ventilation systems in places like long-term care homes are not considered a risk factor in the spread of the virus.

Airborne or not, sharing air in large, indoor public gatherings raises everyone’s risk of transmitting the virus, as Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reminded British Columbians in her daily update Tuesday.

“Stay away from closed spaces as much as possible,” she said. “If it’s a house party, you may not know all the people who are there.”

And like the W.H.O., health officials in B.C. said they are keeping an eye on the science.

“If more evidence were to develop around airborne or aerosol transmission, then naturally we'd need to look at preventative measures that include attention to ventilation,” said Dr. Schwandt.",[]

In a letter sent Wednesday to various ministers, the country's largest airline says the situation is becoming ""increasingly urgent"" as Canada has made virtually no change to its quarantine restrictions since mid-March despite improvements in containing the spread of the virus.

Air Canada's chief medical officer, Dr. Jim Chung, wrote that the restrictions are severely impacting the airline, its customers and employees, as well as an overall recovery.

He says the proposed measures mirror those adopted by the European Union, Britain and other jurisdictions.

The Montreal-based airline says it is not proposing relaxing U.S. border restrictions that are expected to be extended until at least late August.

It notes that requirements in place to travel to various countries include pre-departure medically certified negative COVID-19 tests to enter the Caribbean; a waiver of quarantine requirements after a negative test on arrival to Iceland, Austria and Luxembourg; and mandatory testing on arrival to South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau and the United Arab Emirates.

""There are many other interests affected by the quarantine restrictions — not only jobs and pensions, but also the social and economic well-being of individuals and communities that rely on air travel, as well as basic freedoms of mobility,"" says Chung.

""Business and labour leaders alike have implored the government to act on easing these restrictions in order to strike a better balance, without adversely impacting public health.""

In one cluster, at least 17 cases have been traced to a group of people who met up in Kelowna, some from the Interior and Alberta, others from the Lower Mainland.

“There are a number of people who have been exposed in those events,” said Henry Tuesday.

More troubling still is the emergence of new cases at the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, where two have been identified among migrant workers. They were among 62 cases identified in B.C. between Friday and Monday.

“Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission,” said Dr. Henry in a written statement today.

But others have expressed concerns that not enough is being done to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable groups. Where newly arrived immigrants were disproportionately affected at earlier outbreaks at poultry plants in Coquitlam, others say migrant agricultural workers still run higher risks due to inadequate housing.

“As anticipated,” said Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health, an organization that works to protect migrant workers from predatory practices. “We knew that something was going to happen because the situation for housing in that farm is terrible. They were all crowded.”

‘WAY ABOVE MY COMFORT ZONE’

Yesterday, Dr. Henry warned 25 cases a day was “distressing” and “cautionary to us.” And while not unexpected due to the increased travel and social interaction of phase 3, she said “That’s way above my comfort zone.”

Dr. Henry urged anyone who attended Canada Day parties in the vicinity of the Kelowna cluster to self-monitor for even the mildest of symptoms, noting that anyone can be tested should they feel they’ve been exposed.

Just how quickly a province or state can backslide has been painted in stark relief among our neighbours to the south.

In comments to the press Tuesday, Health Minister Adrian Dix pointed to surges in several U.S. states where record breaking daily caseloads in several states have led jurisdictions like California to re-introduce physical distancing protocols, in what Dix described as “lockdown 2.0.”

“All our neighbouring jurisdictions continue to see an increase, whether it’s our neighbouring province to the east, Alberta, or others, Washington, Oregon and California, in Nevada, Arizona and in other American states — we’ve seen record days of new cases of COVID-19 recently,” said Dix.

Here in B.C., Henry said that on Monday, she checked how weekly caseloads are tracking with the province’s modelling that suggests British Columbians keep their social contacts to 65% of normal.

“We are still skirting that line. The RT, the reproductive number, is hovering around one… which is sort of pushing the limits of where we need to be,” she said.

While health officials work to contain the outbreak in Oliver, it’s unclear how a potential surge in cases will affect that calculation, and Byron Cruz of Sanctuary Health said he expects more cases to crop up in coming days due to their tight living quarters.

What is clear is the more cases are contained to a single cluster, the easier they are to track.

“This is going to be our dance over the next few months, where we do what we can do, we travel, we have those social interactions, but we do it in a thoughtful way so we do it with the people we know we’re with,” said Dr. Henry.",[]

The question is whether strong summer sales — driven in part by delayed purchasers waiting to buy since spring's lockdown — will carry forward to fall, experts said.

The Canadian Real Estate Association on Wednesday reported that June sales were up 63 per cent on a month-over-month basis, and 15.2 per cent higher than the same time last year. Prices also rose from June 2019, up 6.5 per cent to an average $539,000.

""Home sales, prices and starts have effectively regained all the ground lost during the shutdown,"" BMO chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a note to clients.

""However, fair point that some of this outsized strength is simply pent-up demand for the lost sales from the key spring season.""

The real estate industry came to a near standstill earlier this year as non-essential businesses closed to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. CREA said the jump in sales returned them to ""normal levels"" for June, noting they were up 150 per cent from where they were in April.

Porter said the housing market now must keep up its momentum headed into autumn. Though at a glance, the numbers appear to suggest nothing ""amiss in the economy whatsoever,"" the market will have to balance slowing immigration levels, low interest rates and short housing supply, he said in the note. This tension will come with lasting scars, he said.

Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada released its quarterly outlook, forecasting an uncertain economic recovery ahead, and suggesting housing activity will slow over the next few years.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said that the ""pent-up demand"" in the market has been boosted by first-time homebuyers looking for bargains during the downturn. That can crunch the number of new listings, since first-time owners don't have a home to sell, he said, noting CREA's data showed housing inventory at a 16-year low. The association said that the number of newly listed properties climbed 49.5 per cent from May to June.

If there are too many home buyers and too few listings available, that can drive up prices, said Soper. Soper predicts that more existing homeowners may list their homes in the fall, which may cause price increases to level off.

""We're seeing upward pressure on prices, and the highest levels of demand in Ontario and Quebec,"" said Soper. ""Things are good in other parts of the country, but they're quite calm, where the number of people looking for homes and the number of homes available for sale are roughly equal.""

Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, said in a client note that home prices are declining in Calgary, while elsewhere on the prairies, prices are either flat or rising.

Tim Otitoju, a Regina, Sask.-based real estate agent and chairperson of the province's real estate association, said that while the supply of homes for sale is steady and a bit low, sellers are getting more comfortable with the provincial measures to re-open business.

""We saw a surge in demand in June — we are actually attributing that to the buyers that held off during the shutdown,"" said Otitoju. ""It seems that buyers and sellers are showing a lot of confidence in the provincial reopening plan. Sellers are starting to put their houses back on the market.""

Soper said that he was reassured by the recovery in the West, given oil price volatility and regulatory changes in British Columbia. If immigration does slow, said Soper, it may be a few years before the long-term impacts surface, since homeownership for new Canadians spikes between three and seven years after arrival.

While home sales may be hitting ""normal levels,"" the overall housing market is ""obviously not back to normal at this point,"" said Shaun Cathcart, CREA's senior economist.

""The market has recovered much faster than many would have thought, but what happens later this year remains a big question mark,"" said Cathcart in a statement.

""That said, daily tracking suggests that July, at least, will be even stronger.""

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business surveyed more than 4,500 small business owners online from June 26 to July 2 and found that 2,100 respondents took on an average $135,000 in debt ($285.4 million for the responding group as a whole).

article continues below

Laura Jones, the executive vice-president of the organization that represents at least 110,000 small businesses, said debt has ballooned as 58 per cent of small businesses re-opened fully.

About 35 per cent are back to full staffing but only 24 per cent are back to normal revenue, she said.

""I've talked to many businesses that are open again, but are worried about being able to outrun the debt they have accumulated, particularly with sales still down,"" Jones said in a statement.

At the national level, that debt amounts to billions of dollars.

To finance COVID-19 revenue shortfalls and extra costs, the CFIB survey found 37 per cent of businesses are relying on personal savings, 34 per cent on credit cards, 18 per cent on bank loans, 11 per cent on retirement savings and 9 per cent each on mortgages and loans from families and friends.

Josie Rudderham, a co-owner of Cake and Loaf Bakery in Hamilton, Ont., wasn't surprised by the findings because her 12-year-old company was hit hard when COVID-19 began.

Cake and Loaf temporarily closed one location, permanently shut down a second and laid off workers right as the company's busiest season — Easter — hit. It emptied out what treats it had ready for sale and sent them home with employees or over to health care workers and food banks.

""A lot of expenses didn't stop, the overhead really didn't slow down that much, insurance itself is a big chunk of what we pay and that didn't get reduced. In fact, it went up,"" she said.

Rudderham, who has since reopened a location for curbside pickup, had to take out a loan to deal with cash flow issues and said many of her fellow small business owners did the same because they don't have the cash reserves larger companies do.

""I anticipate it will take us more than a decade to pay off some of this debt that we've had to take on because we are never aiming for profit,"" she said. ""We're aiming to break even every year and then every year we also increase wages because living wage gets recalculated every year.""

James McIntosh, the founder of Meaford, Ont.-based Duxbury Cider and chair of the Ontario Craft Cider Association, also stumbled on troubles when bars and restaurants were forced to close in March.

Duxbury's sales dropped 53 per cent, but McIntosh still considered himself fortunate because his family operates the farm and only has a few workers on staff.

He took out a loan and later, when patios reopened saw about a fifth of his licensed business came back.

Others borrowed money and didn't have such luck. They could be trying to cover what they lost for far longer, he said.

""Some of the smaller guys were really hurt because they didn't have an LCBO or grocery store (selling arrangement),"" he said. ""They were basically relying on what business they could drum up locally with bars and restaurants.""

According to the polling industry's generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

“The decision about criminal jury trials is entirely in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Court and the judiciary,” David Eby said. “On our end, the sheriffs and court services branch are working very closely with the judiciary to support the courts in getting jury trials up and running as soon as we can.”

The court is expected to make an announcement on criminal jury trials this week.

The pandemic has created a significant backlog in court cases, Eby said. Four thousand cases were adjourned when in-person hearings were restricted in B.C. Supreme Court. The provincial court has adjourned more than 10,000 cases, including traffic tickets, family matters, minor prosecutions and small claims.

To help deal with the backlog, Eby has proposed a one-year restriction on civil jury trials.

But people accused of a criminal offence have a constitutional right to a jury trial. It’s considered the key to a fair and just system. To choose a jury, whether civil or criminal, requires the assembling of a significant number of people, Eby said.

“Potential solutions include larger venues for jury selection and doing tiered selection, where you bring in one group of people, and then another group of people, as opposed to typically bringing in around 200 people and selecting from the pool,” he said.

The order of the provincial health officer limiting all public gatherings to 50 people makes it a challenge, he said.

At the Victoria courthouse, defence lawyers have been setting criminal jury trial dates for the fall, even though they believe it’s unlikely their trials will go ahead.

Criminal defence lawyer Jordan Watt said it’s difficult to conceptualize getting 12 people together, approximately one foot apart from each other, to listen to the evidence throughout a trial which could last one week or up to three or four months.

“Then to get them to deliberate together without there being some type of massive construction to the current courtroom setup that we have right now, it’s just not going to happen,” Watt said.

“Even if you go a step further, I think you’re going to have problems getting people to come to court in order to be selected as jurors.”

All the provinces are struggling with the issue, said Eby, who is part of a national committee co-chaired by Chief Justice Richard Wagner and federal Justice Minister and Attorney General David Lametti.

The committee offers national guidance to chief justices, judges and court administration officials on the gradual resumption of court operations across Canada. The action committee is dealing with the challenges of jury trials and hearings in small court rooms, circuit and remote courts. It has released a document around best practices for jury trials and how to try and conduct jury trials in the COVID-19 era.

Eby has repeatedly asked Lametti to give increased discretion to judges under the Criminal Code around jury trials to address the realities of COVID-19.

“He’s indicated that he’s willing to look at those things, but the earliest they could be in the legislature is in the fall, so we’ve got quite a period of time before that happens,” Eby said.

The provincial attorneys general have also been asking the federal government for guidance on the timelines of the Jordan decision during COVID-19, Eby said.

In July 2016, in R. v. Jordan, the Supreme Court of Canada created new limits of 18 months from the time a charge is laid until the trial is completed in provincial courts and 30 months in superior court. Anything longer violates the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time, unless the prosecution can show exceptional circumstances.

“It’s clear that in exceptional circumstances you can go beyond the Jordan timelines,” Eby said. “The question for everybody is how long is the exceptional circumstance in relation to COVID.”

He hopes the federal government can give the provinces a legislated COVID-19 period that is deemed to be an exceptional circumstance “so we don’t end up with different exceptional circumstances across Canada and different standards of access to justice for the accused.”

Eby is calling for mandatory arbitration of ICBC claims to deal with the backlog.

“There were already a significant number of people waiting a long period of time for their trials,” he said. “Now we’re looking at allowing plaintiffs to require ICBC to enter into a binding arbitration process so they can have their matter heard sooner and relieve pressure on the court.”

Another strategy would allow people to appear virtually in both traffic and family matters. This would free the court from restrictions on how many courtrooms and how much spacing is needed, he said.",[]

That’s been the automatic response in most of the world. It’s undeniably effective, and an overwhelmingly popular approach. So Finance Minister Carole James committed Tuesday to carrying on. But her fiscal update vividly illustrated what the government is up against.

article continues below

Her February budget was balanced, with a few hundred million in reserve.

The new estimate is a deficit this year of $12.5 billion, the biggest ever, and one that developed almost instantly.

That’s not a forecast. The situation is so wildly unpredictable they’ve give up doing forecasts. They’re just “scenarios” now. So it could go higher.

As James said: “That's why we've developed a scenario, rather than a typical forecast, because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the economic decline caused by the pandemic.”

She’s acknowledged there will be deficits for at least the next three years. But it’s more likely to be a decade or more.

(Two years ago officials marked the elimination of just one component of B.C.’s debt, the operating debt stemming mostly from accumulated deficits. It took 40 years to accomplish that.)

The federal government did a similar update last week. Its projected deficit of $34 billion has jumped to $343 billion because of the pandemic.

So the on-going federal-provincial plan to keep helping people is based on borrowing more and more money to pay for it.

Rock-bottom interest rates will ease some concern about the hole they’re digging.

And there are projections that the economic collapse will only last for a year. So an optimistic outlook would be a one-year catastrophe followed by a bounce back in 2021, followed by years of whittling deficits back down to size.

Government finances obviously depend entirely on the private sector economy. James’ briefing included an exhaustive list of crises in different sectors.

Roughly half the new deficit is the new spending to help people cope ($5 billion in direct aid, $1.3 billion in deferred taxes and extensions). The other half arises from a collapse in government revenues.

There is a billion less in personal income tax, another billion less in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion less in sales tax, as examples. That’s all due to retail sales dropping 24 per cent, home sales down 45 per cent, 235,000 fewer jobs, corporate profits down 36 per cent and a seven to eight per cent drop in the provincial GDP, all in the last five months.

“No one has a playbook for dealing with this,” James said. So the plan they’ve fashioned is based on the fervent hope this is a one-year nightmare.

She has plans to announce a “recovery plan framework” in September, which would outline the expectations for how $1.5 billion in stimulus spending might be used.

But all the “scenarios” depend on the COVID-19 daily counts. Any sustained increases or outbreaks could delay recovery plans. That would make economic calamity even grimmer and more protracted than it already is.

Whatever the virus does in the next while, COVID-19 will be around for years as an economic factor.

Just So You Know: James spent 60 minutes detailing the extent of the economic catastrophe. She ran through 24 slides showing devastating impacts on every single aspect of the economy.

But the official news release covering her update was a study in deliriously-upbeat positivity. It was headed: “B.C.’s strong fiscal response, economic foundation support people.”

It rehashed all the previous good news announcements, ignored all the alarms and buried the stunning news there “could be” a $12.5 billion deficit.

It’s probably a firing offence for communications staff to write anything that leaves a negative impression in these sorts of releases.

But in a world where governments are spending more than ever, getting their own news out and covering themselves on all platforms as they see fit, the release is a reminder: It’s good to get an independent view.

Amendments to the Workers Compensation Act would increase the maximum insurable earnings to $100,000 from $87,100.

article continues below

The government says it is aiming for at least 90 per cent of workers to have 100 per cent of their earnings covered if they are can't work because of an injury suffered on the job.

The bill would also allow the safety agency to obtain search and seizure warrants when it investigates workplace safety infractions, if authorized by a court.

As well, it would allow victim impact statements to be heard in court in serious workplace prosecutions.

Labour Minister Harry Bains said the changes will help injured workers and their families, while also giving WorkSafeBC more tools to investigate workplace incidents.

""This bill makes modest but important improvements to several aspects of British Columbia's workers compensation system,"" Bains told the legislature.

The legislation would strengthen the way occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens are handled by fast-tracking the presumption for when a virus was contracted on the job, if established by WorkSafeBC's board of directors.

The government says this would mean people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to get benefits more quickly.

It would also expedite health care for a worker before a claim is accepted in cases when treatment would likely prevent a significant deterioration in health.

The government says in a statement that the legislation would allow WorkSafeBC to adjust a one-year time limit on mental health claims because it ""is not realistic for most workers, given the delay or gradual onset of some mental disorders.""

The amendments to the Workers Compensation Act were developed after three expert reviews, which included consultations with employer, labour and Indigenous organizations.

The government says it also considered systems that are in place elsewhere in Canada and took into account the possible effects of the changes on employer premium rates.

More than 100,000 new claims are made in B.C. every year due to workplace injuries or fatalities, the government says.

There were 140 workplace fatalities last year, with 84 of them caused by occupational disease, 40 by traumatic injury and 16 the result of a motor vehicle incident.

The province says WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations in 2019.

Exactly one week ago, on July 7, the province recorded 12 new cases. What followed was an uptick in recorded cases:

• 18 new cases on July 8;

• 20 new cases on July 9;

• 25 new cases on July 10;

• 21 new cases on July 11;

• 20 new cases on July 12; and

• 21 new cases on July 13.

""I know it was distressing to me to see 20, especially 25 [new cases] one day,"" Henry said. ""That's way above my comfort zone.""

She added, however, that the slight rise in cases was not unexpected, given that the province has been allowing restaurants and other indoor businesses to reopen.

""We do know where those cases are,"" she said. ""We're testing the people who need to be tested.""

It would be more concerning, she said, if the cases were spread out across the province in an unlinked way. The most recent cluster of cases is linked to the Krazy Cherry Fruit Company in Oliver, she announced yesterday (July 13).

Given B.C.'s population, 20 cases in one day is also better than some other jurisdictions, she said.

The province has identified 3,128 infections since the virus first appeared in the province in late January.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,015 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1649 in Fraser Health;

• 135 in Island Health;

• 212 in Interior Health;

• 65 in Northern Health; and

• 52 people who reside outside Canada.

Of the 209 people currently fighting COVID-19 in B.C., 14 people are in hospital with five of those in intensive care units. That leaves 2,730 people who have recovered from the virus.

No new deaths from the virus were identified in the past 24 hours, leaving the death toll at 189 people.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreak at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred from the hospital.

So far 399 residents and 252 staff at seniors' care facilities have been infected by COVID-19 in B.C.

Health Minister Adrian Dix said that it is his understanding that the federal government and the U.S. government have agreed to extend the closure of the two countries' border for one additional month, until August 21.

""This is obviously positive and necessary news,"" he said. ""Everybody who lives in B.C. knows how inconvenient and how difficult that is for many businesses and many individuals for a variety of circumstances.""

In a fiscal update Tuesday, B.C. Finance Minister Carole James said the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ""the worst downturn experienced in our province in recent history.""

article continues below

""The projected numbers are staggering, but they're not without hope,"" James said, in summing up B.C.'s fiscal position.

She said B.C. had entered the pandemic perhaps better situated than other provinces, as it had a balanced budget, a triple AAA credit rating and one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

B.C. also managed to contain the pandemic and flatten its growth curve better than some other provinces, and it has been able to move earlier on a phased economic restart plan.

""Because of that strength, we were able to take immediate action to help people, to help businesses, to help communities with our $5 billion COVID action plan,"" James said.

She said the province is expecting a loss of $4.2 billion in tax revenue, including $1 billion less in personal income tax revenue, $973 million less in corporate taxes, $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax revenue, $300 million in natural resource revenues and $882 million less in Crown Corporation income.

The province is also spending $5 billion in emergency spending, and has approved $1.3 billion in tax credits and deferrals. In total, the increased spending, lost tax revenue and foregone revenue will bring the deficit to $12.5 billion.

In February, James brought down, but never passed, a balanced budget and modest surplus of $227 million and provincial GDP growth projections of 2% in 2020.

""Mere weeks after the budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed,"" James said.

James said the B.C. economy is now expected to contract 6.8% in 2020, according to some forecasters.

Since February, B.C. lost 235,000 jobs, and saw retail sales declined by 23.6% in April compared to February. Overall, home prices dropped 4%.

Home sales declined 45.4% in May, compared to February, and B.C. merchandise exports are down 14.7% year-to-date, compared to January to May 2019.

""While the job losses in March and April were record-breaking, figures for May and June in fact have seen some recovery of the losses that we experienced in the previous two months,"" James said.

Asked if her government planned to resort to spending cuts to address the deficit, James said ""now is not the time to be able to cut back on services and support for people and business in British Columbia.""

As for any long-range plans for dealing with debt and deficits, James said: ""I do not believe that it's going to be a quick fix.""

Asked if the $5 billion that her government has already approved could be added to later this year, James said ""I believe the $5 billion is enough now.""

However, she added no one can predict what might happen should there be a second wave of COVID-19.

As for the $22 billion in capital spending allocated in the 2020 budget over three years for big capital works projects, like new schools, hospitals, bridges and roads, that will continue to be spent.

""This is going to serve us very well because it translates into huge investments,"" James said.

According to the survey released on Tuesday, 19.3 per cent of businesses could operate at their current level of sales and spending for less than six months but would have to take additional action if it lasts for a longer duration. Nearly 35 per cent of hotels and restaurants only have the runway for six more months of lockdown measures, says the survey conducted May 29 to July 3.

The results come as many businesses are looking at government programs or credit to remain afloat.

Almost 64 per cent of survey respondents said they were approved for outside credit or government funding programs such as Canada Emergency Business Account loans or wage subsidies. Less than 24 per cent of businesses said in the survey that their rent or mortgage payments were deferred during the pandemic.

While working from home has increased during the pandemic, only about a quarter of survey respondents indicated they would likely offer teleworking as an option going forward after COVID-19 spread is contained.

The version released on Tuesday was a follow-up to a crowd-sourced questionnaire on the Statistics Canada website, a collaboration launched in April, with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, that surveyed 12,600 businesses. The sample was not designed to reflect the overall Canadian economy.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to ""discretionary"" travel like vacations and shopping trips since the pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, a rolling 30-day agreement that's currently set to expire July 21.

article continues below

Officials on both sides of the border who are familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until late August is all but inevitable, thanks to a towering wave of new COVID-19 cases that's swamping efforts to restore a modicum of normality in the U.S.

New York Rep. Brian Higgins, one of several members of Congress from northern states keen to see a plan for reopening the border, expressed dismay Tuesday at news he called disappointing but hardly surprising.

""With no leadership from President Trump to address the pandemic, cases in the United States are spiking and as a result U.S. citizens are not welcome in several countries around the globe, including many of our allies,"" Higgins, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Recent calls from Higgins and others for a plan to start easing border restrictions have been greeted with social-media scorn and derision in Canada, where recent polls make clear the idea of allowing entry to Americans any time soon is a non-starter.

The novel coronavirus has been particularly resurgent in southern states like Florida, Texas, Georgia and Louisiana, where businesses tried to reopen early, contrary to the advice of public health officials, and the wearing of face masks became a partisan issue.

""The U.S. and Canada should be developing a plan that lays out what continued, nuanced management of the border during a prolonged pandemic will look like,"" Higgins said.

""But the administration's failure to develop a national plan for widespread testing, (personal protective equipment) distribution and the rejection of social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread doesn't inspire confidence that such a plan is in the works.""

Wearing a mask, perhaps the simplest way to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, has evolved into one of the most complex and flummoxing points of division in the U.S., thanks in part to conflicting signals early in the crisis about its effectiveness and the obvious reluctance of the commander-in-chief to embrace the idea.

It was only just this past weekend — nearly four months into the crisis — that Trump himself was photographed wearing one in public, during a visit with wounded service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Americans to mask up Monday, saying facial coverings for everyone in the country would break the pandemic's back in less than two months.

""It's our major defence to prevent ourselves from getting this infection,"" Redfield told a news conference in Charlotte, N.C. ""If all of us would put on a face covering now for the next four weeks, six weeks, I think we could drive this epidemic into the ground.""

Paradoxically, new online polling from Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggests the idea of mandatory masking in public is more popular in the U.S. than it is in Canada.

Leger's latest online poll, conducted July 10 to 12, found 72 per cent of 1,001 American respondents supported the idea of mandatory masks indoors, compared with 67 per cent of the survey's 1,523 Canadian participants. Of those surveyed in the U.S., 41 per cent said they would consider it a violation of their personal freedoms, compared with 27 per cent of those in Canada.

""Americans are far more likely to agree that rights are at issue,"" said ACS president Jack Jedwab. ""Yet, despite the fact that Americans strongly agree that the mask requirement is a rights infringement, they nonetheless believe that mask wearing should be mandatory.""

Trump appears to be capitulating on other border issues as well: on Tuesday, facing a lawsuit from Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the administration abandoned a controversial measure that would have forced international students whose courses move entirely online to either transfer schools or leave the country.

That news likely comes as a relief to untold thousands of Canadian students studying south of the border, many of whom have been forced into virtual classrooms with colleges and universities having cancelled in-person classes.

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, was reluctant Tuesday to discuss the worsening COVID-19 situation in the U.S. in any detail.

But he said cross-border travel in a public health emergency is usually a matter of ensuring that both countries have a similar grip on the circumstances, taking into account factors like their respective health-care systems, testing and contact-tracing regimes and strategies for preventing transmission.

Given that a number of U.S. states are experiencing community transmission of COVID-19 and don't have the situation under control, it will likely be weeks or even months before the benefits of additional preventative steps become apparent.

""It will take some time,"" Njoo said. ""If I were to travel anywhere, I would stick to Canada for the time being.""

Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic assumptions that his product — or any of the numerous vaccine hopefuls in development globally — can bring the pandemic to a screeching halt if proven viable.

Clark notes more than 120 companies are trying to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine, many of which have never been in the vaccine space before.

He doesn't doubt that ""something's going to come out of this,"" but he questions how effective it may be.

""Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it's a miracle — it's not going to be perfect,"" says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

""It's going to have to undergo development, it's going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It's not the panacea.

""To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.""

Canada's deputy public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo expressed similar cautions Tuesday, while acknowledging the need to develop viable vaccines and therapies.

""Lots of different steps are still ahead of us before we might even anticipate that there might be a safe, effective vaccine that would be available for use in the general population,"" said Njoo.

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago's first phase of clinical trials will test the safety of a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

It's the same method Medicago has used for a proposed seasonal flu vaccine that Clark says is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. If approved, Clark says it would be the first plant-based vaccine in the world.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

""In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you're able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.""

Meanwhile, Clark says viruses are prone to mutations as they adapt and grow in an egg, which could result in a vaccine that doesn't exactly match the circulating virus. In contrast, ""a plant is a plant,"" and that makes production easily scalable.

""One plant behaves like 100,000 plants,"" he says.

The trial will evaluate three different dosages alone, or with one of two adjuvants provided by GlaxoSmithKline and Dynavax. An adjuvant can boost the effectiveness of a vaccine for a better immunological response, thereby reducing the required dose, Clark adds.

He hopes to know the safety of the product, as well as effectiveness of the adjuvants and dosing by October. Based on that, researchers would kick off a second, more targeted trial phase involving about 1,000 participants.

If that's successful, Clark says a third phase would involve about 15,000 to 20,000 subjects, include older cohorts, and may be a global study, depending on circumstances of the pandemic by then.

If the vaccine proves effective, Clark points to another uncertainty.

Because the company's commercial plant is across the border in Durham, N.C., he says there's no guarantee of a Canadian supply.

""'Guarantee' is a strong word,"" says Clark. ""Strange things happen to borders in the context of a pandemic.""

Such border complications were made clear to Canadians in April when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau complained about problems with incomplete or non-existent deliveries of critical COVID-19 supplies. At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered U.S. producers to prioritize the domestic market.

Clark suggests similar hurdles could impact vaccine distribution, putting immediate pressure on Medicago to complete construction of a large-scale manufacturing facility in its home base of Quebec City.

""Certainly, we need a facility in Canada,"" Clark says.

""There's no guarantee on the easy flow of materials back and forth across the border should we have a successful vaccine. We have to keep the focus on completing the Canadian facility so that we have domestic capacity. I think this is what most countries are concerned about.""

By the end of 2023, the Quebec City plant is expected to be able to produce up to one billion doses of a COVID-19 vaccine annually.

Until then, Medicago says it expects to be able to make approximately 100 million doses by the end of 2021, assuming its trials are successful.

Clark says countries must temper any nationalist agendas that might emerge with a viable vaccine and acknowledge that the fight against COVID-19 is global.

Meeting that demand would require multiple manufacturers, multiple distribution routes, and lots of co-operation, he says, possibly through the World Health Organization.

""There has to be some ability to share those around and distribute, whether that's through an entity like the WHO, or something equivalent.""

The Liberals last week revealed this year's projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

article continues below

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn't know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

""Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we're doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

""We're going to continue to do that vital work.""

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week's fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn't set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

The survey asked respondents which of two routes traditionally use to cut deficits they would support.

In the survey, 60 per cent said the government ought to focus on cutting government spending, while 21 per cent said the focus should be on raising taxes.

Finance Minister Carole James said the numbers are staggering with job losses of 235,000 since February and a predicted GDP decline of 6.8 per cent by the end of this year.

article continues below

“We were preparing for economic moderation, we were well-equipped to be able to weather the challenges,” James said at a news conference Tuesday.

“What came next was unprecedented. Mere weeks after Budget 2020 was tabled, our entire world changed.”

The government has provided $6.26 billion in financial aid to businesses and individuals. Among the losses it anticipates this fiscal year because of the pandemic are close to $1 billion in personal income tax, $973 million in corporate income tax and $1.3 billion in provincial sales tax, James said.

The projected GDP decline in 2020 would be the worst on record going back to the 1980s, although it is also projected to increase by 3.1 per cent in 2021.

James said for context, B.C.’s real GDP has only declined twice in the past 40 years, falling by 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 6.4 per cent in 1982.

“As those numbers remind us, this could be the worst downturn experienced in our province recent history,” she said.

B.C.’s restart plan is showing signs of hope for the economy as consumer confidence increases, she said. The unemployment rate is slowly rebounding and fewer wildfires and floods have helped the bottom line.

However, she warned that the province’s financial forecast could change depending on many risk factors, including the possibility of a second wave of infections, the possibility of a vaccine, as well as the success of relief measures and central bank policy.

Regardless of how B.C. copes with the pandemic, James said its economy is also subject to the economic health of other jurisdictions, particularly those that buy from the province.

James said it wouldn’t help the economic recovery to pull back on spending, but the government will review every cent spent as it heads into the next budget year.

The B.C. government has tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits, which James said will be re-examined each year.

James said she believes people care about provincial deficits because they understand it’s taxpayer money, but they also understand the emergency the pandemic created.

She declined to predict how long the recovery would take, given the many moving pieces at play.

“There is no question that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the economy of British Columbia and that’s not short term,” she said.

The job losses have been widespread but some have been disproportionately affected, depending on a worker’s age, gender or which sector they work in, James said.

Young workers are among the hardest hit, with the unemployment rate rising sharply from 9.1 per cent in February to 29.1 per cent in June for those aged 15 to 24.

Women, who dominate the service industries and many of whom have also left jobs to care for family members, are another group more affected. Their unemployment rate rose from 4.8 per cent in February to 13.4 per cent in June.

The hardest hit industries include wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services, construction, culture and recreation.

The overall unemployment rate of 13 per cent remains at its highest level since 1987. While the job losses in March and April were record breaking, the figures for May and June have seen modest recovery as the economy started to reopen.

“The projected numbers are staggering but they’re not without hope. Things are getting better each and every day when we follow the provincial health officer’s advice,” James said.

The NDP government’s fiscal update was met with calls for an economic recovery plan by its political opponents, with the Opposition B.C. Liberals asking what happens when federal benefits like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit run out.

Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson also suggested the government should reconsider its pre-pandemic spending priorities.

“People in every corner of B.C. have had to adjust to a new normal and adapt their household budgets, so why is this government pretending it’s business as usual?” he asked in a statement.

The Green party said the province should transition to a green economy by helping traditional industries become more sustainable, spending on training and building local businesses into the supply chain.

“We can seize the once in a generation opportunity to strategically drive stimulus spending towards a future British Columbians want: an innovative, low-carbon, sustainable, just and inclusive economy for all,” interim leader Adam Olsen said.

That brings the total confirmed cases to 3,115. Of that number, 51 are non-residents who live outside of Canada but are currently in B.C. Although public health officials aren't saying where these non-residents are from, it is likely that some are temporary foreign farm workers, as there have been outbreaks at a number of farms in B.C.

There have been two deaths since Friday attributed to COVID-19. While there have been no new community outbreaks in long-term care or acute care facilities, there have been a number of community exposure events in the Okanagan.

Public health has issued an isolation order for the Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver, where two cases have been identified at the farm. Interior Health has also issued alerts for possible community exposure events in Kelowna.

""Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate,” provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint release Monday, July 13.

“Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.

""Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a large number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

article continues below

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don't weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need ""to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact"" on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada's consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June's inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government's economic ""snapshot"" last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what's coming as a ""central planning scenario"" for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Indigenous communities closed during pandemic but at economic cost,['Nick Wells'],,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

article continues below

""Of course it's negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,"" said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. ""I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.""

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there ""is still no vaccine, no anti-serum and no cure for COVID-19.""

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, had been stopping cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

While Tofino is now welcoming back visitors, the Tla-o-qui-aht communities of Ty-Histanis, Esowista and Opitsaht remain closed to those who haven't been invited. The closure includes part of Long Beach in Pacific Rim National Park.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

""A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,"" she said. ""If you're in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It's not the same with our communities.""

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

""We're such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it'll spread like wildfire,"" said Duffy Edgars, the chief councillor of the Old Massett Village council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation's state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

""It's disrespectful,"" he said. ""These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.""

The fishing lodges that have opened say visitors and staff will not have contact with the Haida Gwaii communities, and they have emergence evacuation plans in place if a COVID-19 case were to develop.

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

""It's really frustrating,"" said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. ""We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we're all working collaboratively together.""

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in inter-provincial tourism.

""We're seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we're seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that's a really high concern for our community,"" said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk's Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

""Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,"" she said. ""So our community has been hit hard.""

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn't have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot'in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government's reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions, which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally safe contact tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can't see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

""Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,"" said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. ""At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.""

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot'in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for not recusing himself from discussions about the administration of Ottawa's $900 million student volunteer program.

WE Charity was initially selected to deliver the initiative under a nearly $20 million contract. Trudeau said he was aware of his family's ties to the organization, but unaware of the honorariums his mother and brother received for their involvement.

""It is not a surprise to me that they got paid by WE, but I did not know that they got paid by WE,"" Trudeau said.

""In this situation, I should have recused myself,"" he added, acknowledging that his involvement in Ottawa's student volunteer program has created controversy. Members of the Conservative Party of Canada have called on Trudeau to address his involvement before Ottawa's ethics committee.

""I get that. I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussion.""

Trudeau said he will evaluate any requests to address the issue before parliament. He also said that, because of his involvement, the rollout of the student volunteer program has been a bit delayed – an outcome he deeply regrets.

In addition to addressing the issue, Trudeau said on Monday that the federal government will extend its wage subsidy program until the end of the year. More information on the extension is expected this week.

The prime minister also said he spoke with U.S. president Donald Trump earlier in the day about the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement – which took effect July 1, – Black Lives Matter, China, the two Canadians who remain detained in China and U.S. aluminum tariffs.

""I highlighted to the president that the pandemic has disrupted usual manufacturing processes and supply chains,"" said Trudeau. ""It would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time when we're celebrating the new NAFTA.""

Trudeau briefly told reporters to expect a joint announcement regarding the closure of the Canada-U.S. border.

Non-essential travel across the border is banned until late July.

Trudeau didn't say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

""I don't think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,"" he said.

""We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.""

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

""Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we're in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,"" Kelly said.

""It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.""

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

""You don't want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose"" the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing ""disincentives to growth"" in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it's scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government's fiscal and economic ""snapshot"" last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy ""must encourage Canadians to transition"" off the CERB, and ""create a positive incentive to return to work.""

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The ""snapshot"" also said men may be ""slightly more likely"" to be covered than women although there aren't firm numbers to rely on.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from ""private parties"" at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city's waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

""When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,"" Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it's also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

""Whether it's a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,"" Dix said.

If you're gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

""We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.""

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna's Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it's reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

""Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,"" it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Powell River-Sunshine Coast MLA Nicholas Simons has been adapting to new ways of carrying out democracy, mandated by regulations required to cope with the pandemic.

article continues below

Simons said he is going to be attending the legislature next week for the first time in what is being called a hybrid session. He said this means some people are in Victoria and others are functioning in their communities via videoconferencing.

“It’s very busy and there are a lot of issues that are related directly to the pandemic that I assist with when I can,” said Simons. “There continue to be issues for me relative to other sectors, including, of course, ferries, forestry and other ongoing interests.”

Simons said up until now, every day the legislature sits, he has been going onto Zoom and participating in the debate. He said if he is rostered to be doing his chamber duty in the legislature, such as next week, he simply attends in Victoria, where the number of MLAs has been substantially reduced due to physical distancing and maximum assembly numbers.

He said one significant change in legislative business has been the voting schedule. Rather than votes taking place during the day, they all get lined up and voted on at the end of the day, negating the need for everyone to be at their computer constantly from 10 am to 6:30 pm. The system, for the most part, has been working well, although there is the occasional glitch, said Simons.

There was one situation where the MLA who was voting remotely could not be heard, and so the clerk at the table phoned the member and got confirmation regarding the member’s vote.

Simons said those running and coordinating the hybrid system have done an “amazing job.” There are four screens in the legislative chamber and those in that setting can see members participating from their constituencies.

Simons said this is the first time a hybrid form of parliament has been conducted, so once again, BC is leading the way.

He said Question Period has taken on a new dimension because the chamber is not packed with close-together bodies “stuffed like sardines.” He said the opposition still has the opportunity to ask questions and the government has the chance to explain its actions on issues.

“It’s important for democracy,” said Simons.

When asked if British Columbians were being well served by the new system, Simons said: “I hope so. We’re making every effort to adjust the needs of our communities. There are challenges that everybody is facing.

“What we have to continue to do is figure out how government can best help our communities, our businesses, our industries and get to the challenges that are lying before us.”

Simons said with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the incredible focus by health minister Adrian Dix, and his dedication to the issue, has served the province well. He added that Dr. Bonnie Henry, as provincial health officer, has all of the necessary abilities to give confidence to the public.

“In this kind of situation, when you have dedicated people, incredible changes have been made to our health system,” said Simons. “We were prepared for the worst and we managed to relay good medical advice and the vast majority of people adhered to the recommendations and continue to do so.

“The message is as important today as it has always been. I’m completely confident that our government and our health officer have done their absolute best and the statistics indicate that we have been an outlier in our success.”

The new normal in the legislature has no horizon. Simons said the impact of COVID-19 will be present for a while.

“We are doing what we need to do,” he added, “and everybody recognizes that British Columbia can continue to stay strong.”",[]

With recent data indicating a gradual but steady decline in Ontario's COVID-19 caseload Premier Doug Ford is expected to unveil the next phase of the province's reopening strategy.

The province said in a document released in late April that Stage 3 would include ""opening all workplaces responsibly"" and ""further relaxing the restrictions on public gatherings.""

The document didn't get into specifics, though it did say restrictions would remain on large gatherings such as concerts and sporting events.

Meanwhile, health officials in Quebec, the epicentre of the pandemic in Canada, are concerned about a spike in COVID-19 cases in Montreal linked to the reopening of the city's bars.

Over the weekend Montreal's public health authority urged patrons and employees who have frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested for the coronavirus.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections Sunday, boosting its total to 56,521 cases.

The province is to introduce mandatory masks on public transit starting today, with a two-week grace period before users will be denied service as of July 27.

Montreal has also indicated that it intends to bring in mandatory masks for enclosed public spaces as of that date.

On the East Coast, Prince Edward Island is reporting another new case of COVID-19 — a woman in her 80s from Queens County tested positive and is self-isolating at home.

P.E.I. has reported four new cases of the infection since July 4 after being COVID-free during the months of May and June.

Canada's COVID-19 case total currently stands at 107,589, including 8,783 deaths and 71,467 cases considered resolved.

""I can't say no to a good time,"" said Edmonton Oilers fan Jeet Jermana. ""I'd be hard-pressed not to jump into a big party.""

article continues below

On Friday, the NHL board of governors and NHL Players' Association said they had ratified the return-to-play plan, paving the way for the league to resume its pandemic-hit season later this summer.

Toronto and Edmonton were also officially unveiled as hub cities where all games will be played, beginning Aug. 1. Training camps start Monday in the 24 cities with teams still in the running for the Stanley Cup, including six in Canada.

In 2017, when the Oilers nearly advanced to the Western Conference final, Jermana was among the thousands of fans who partied in Ford Hall at Rogers Place arena and in bars along the popular Whyte Avenue district.

But with COVID-19 this year, where teams will play in empty arenas, Jermana said he'll likely watch more games at home, maybe with just a few friends.

That is, he said, until the Oilers advance and he and other fans won't be able to resist going out.

""Once it becomes the 'real playoffs' I think more and more the momentum will grab,"" he said.

Matt Black of Hotel X Toronto, located west of the city centre where multiple media outlets have reported that several teams will be based, said the prospect of any accommodation for celebratory fan gatherings, even outdoors, seems unlikely.

Nevertheless, Black said he expects citywide excitement will be palpable, even with empty arenas.

""You look back to those scenes of Jurassic Park and Maple Leaf Square and all of that ... it would be great for people to be able to get together again but you just need to make sure that you're doing it in a safe manner,"" said Black.

The players themselves aren't to have any contact with the general public.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto's associate medical health officer, said in an emailed statement that players and staff arriving from abroad will also have to serve a modified 14-day quarantine as well as undergo rigorous screening and daily testing protocols, wear masks in indoor settings, physically distance and wash hands often.

An Edmonton police spokesperson said the service wouldn't be able to comment over the weekend on what sorts of preparations they might make for crowds when the season resumes.

Geoff Grimble with the City of Edmonton said the city's civic events management team would likely discuss the issue during a scheduled meeting on Monday.

""The City of Edmonton's first priority is public safety and we'll continue to follow the advice and requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure fans, players, coaches and staff remain healthy,"" Grimble said.

Oilers fan Brendan McLeod admitted he may be lured to a street celebration when — not if — his team advances, but said he still wants to maintain physical distancing.

""We have to get through this together or else it's not going to change,"" said McLeod.

But Shadi Merhej, who said he enjoys both hockey and the Oilers, noted the sport doesn't have quite as strong attraction for him in the summer.

""It's daylight 'til 11 o'clock. You don't want to spend half your day watching hockey,"" Merhej explained.

""I'd rather go for a bike ride, or rollerblade or golf.""

Shaw told reporters on a Zoom conference call that he was ""a little tone deaf"" with the tweets last Friday that were ""out of frustration"" and that he took responsibility for them and didn't want them to become a distraction.

article continues below

""I apologize for that, at no point was I saying I was going to break the rules or we're going to break the rules,"" Shaw said. ""We know as a team that's not an option and to get through this season, everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to whatever protocols we're set under.""

He noted if other teams don't follow public-health guidelines, the season may be derailed in any case.

Shaw had raised concerns about the length of time players may need to stay in their current environment. He replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are the same maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

""We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,"" Shaw tweeted.

In an email reply, the club said arriving in Toronto, players understood the maximum penalties for leaving the Rogers Centre footprint during camp.

""The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here, it was the first I was hearing about that we could be possibly be in here all summer,"" Shaw said, adding he should've chosen his words differently.

He explained he'd rented a place one block from the Rogers Centre and had looked forward to taking walks by the water to get away from the game. Living in a hotel was not an ideal situation, he said.

Shaw said Blue Jays management — president Mark Shapiro and general manager Ross Atkins — spoke to players on Saturday about the situation.

""I was a little bit tone-deaf to the situation, I should have said what I said, should have worded it a little bit differently,"" Shaw said. ""I apologize for that, take full responsibility.""

The Blue Jays are training in Toronto while figuring out where to play this coming season as the shortened 60-game schedule starts in less than two weeks.

Ottawa has given the ball club the green light to hold training camp in Toronto, but hasn't made a call on games. No fans will be in the stands.

The Buffalo News reported over the weekend the club had checked in with that city about playing in that city, usually the home of the their triple-A club. Blue Jays officials have said Dunedin, Fla., the club's spring-training facility, is the most likely venue for home games if the team can't play in Toronto.

For his part, Shaw said he and his teammates are hopeful Toronto is the club's home this season.

He noted that weather and the COVID situation in Florida means that Dunedin would put the Blue Jays at a competitive disadvantage.

The Blue Jays are slated to open the season July 24 at Tampa Bay. The home opener is July 29 against the Washington Nationals.

Shaw said he doesn't foresee opting out of the 2020 season, given he was looking to this year as a bounce-back season on a one-year contract after an admittedly poor 2019.

Meanwhile, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo said right-hander Chase Anderson is day-to-day with an oblique strain.

Anderson was projected to be a member of the Blue Jays' five-man starting rotation.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida shattered the national record Sunday for the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any state since the beginning of the pandemic, adding more than 15,000 cases as its daily average death toll continued to also rise.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases, and 45 deaths were recorded.

article continues below

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, set on Wednesday. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week as Florida reported 514 fatalities — an average of 73 per day. Three weeks ago, the state was averaging 30 deaths per day. Since the pandemic began in March, 4,346 people have died in Florida of COVID-19, the state says.

Testing has doubled over the last month, going from about 25,000 tests per day to almost 50,000, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than 5% of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19%.

About 10.7% of Saturday’s 143,000 tests came up positive, with an average age of 38. ""I still think we need to increase our testing a little bit more,"" said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins, adding that the state and local health departments should ramp up their contact tracing.

Prins said that she's still concerned about large crowds, gyms and some restaurants as being places of mass transmission. Reports of illegal clubs and raves in South Florida is also a worry, she said.

""I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,"" she said. ""I know people want to live their lives. There have been a lot of other times, people have made those sacrifices in order to benefit our society. It’s almost like a war effort. That’s what we need right now.""

Terry Shaw, AdventHealth’s president and CEO, said Sunday on CBS’ Face the Nation that the peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be ""sometime in front of us in July.""

While on the program, he said that the health system, which has hospitals in nine states including 30 in Florida, has adequate PPE, a stockpile of ventilators and a clinical team that’s learned how to better treat the disease.

""I give you an example. Our length of stay in our ICU for COVID patients has dropped in half. The number of people coming in to our hospital with COVID that need a ventilator, we’ve also been able to cut that in half. And because of those things, our death rate has also been cut in half"" since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said

The health system’s ICU capacities in Florida are currently running at about 85% to 90%. He said the system could turn some ""progressive care units"" into ICU units if needed.

Hospitals in several counties have stopped doing elective surgeries. HCA West Florida have ceased inpatient elective procedures at hospitals in Hillsborough, Pinellas and six other nearby counties, said an HCA spokeswoman on Sunday. Florida ceased elective surgeries statewide from March until early May in order to free up beds, and to reserve personal protective equipment for health care workers caring for COVID-19 patients.

Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are the top three counties for hospitalizations, with 3,232 people hospitalized — 42 per cent of the 7,542 people in hospitals statewide for coronavirus.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez told CNN on Sunday that his county's hospitals will soon reach capacity, but he said more beds can be added, including for intensive care.

""We still have capacity, but it does cause me a lot of concern,"" he said.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions — and the number of positive cases began rising, but it wasn't until the last week that the daily death total began rising, too.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention's nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

On Saturday, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom reopened at Walt Disney World in Orlando, concerning health experts who urge people not to gather in groups. Guests at the park said that people were wearing masks and social distancing, and videos showed near-empty parks.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that even with the rising rates, he still wants the schools to reopen as scheduled next month, saying children have not proven to be vectors for the disease in states and countries where campuses are open. He said while each county will have to come up with procedures, depending on their local infection rate, not opening the schools would exacerbate the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students.

""We know there are huge, huge costs for not providing the availability of in-person schooling,"" he said. ""The risk of corona, fortunately, for students is incredibly low.""

Helen Ferre, a spokeswoman for DeSantis, said Sunday that the state has tested more than 2.4 million people for COVID-19.

Ferre said the important statistic isn’t the raw number of positives, but the percentage — on Sunday, it was just over 11%, about 8 percentage points lower than the weekly average.

""The more people who get tested and are proportionately reporting negative for this virus is meaningful,"" she wrote in an email to The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, a commissioner for a county near Jacksonville is seriously ill with the virus, according to a posting by his daughter on Facebook.

St. Johns County Commissioner Paul Waldron had recently voted against a county ordinance requiring masks, but not because he opposed them. He said he wanted more answers from county administrators about which masks are most effective and whether the county had enough for employees and visitors at government buildings.

So what about 142 days?

""Every game might end 0-0,"" the Calgary Flames general manager quipped.

With summer training camps set to open Monday as the NHL lurches forward in its plan to restart a season stopped in its tracks four months ago by COVID-19, the temptation might be to spring a surprise or two — maybe a new power-play setup or a tweak to the penalty kill — when the games return Aug. 1.

Coaches for the 24 teams set to feature in the league's return have had ample time to plan, brainstorm and re-assess their systems and rosters. The 16 taking part in the best-of-five qualifying round have known for nearly seven weeks which opponent they'd be lining up against if the league got back up and running.

But don't expect to see massive changes — especially early — from the men standing behind the benches in those empty arenas in Toronto and Edmonton once the puck is dropped.

They have enough to worry about when it comes to their own players.

""Every coach is going to look at and break down the opponent and have a game plan to attack,"" continued Treliving, whose club will take on the Winnipeg Jets in the qualifying round. ""But because of the uniqueness of this time, there's more of a focus to get your team ready. I remember last year preparing for the playoffs and we're sitting there going, 'What are we going to do with the four days between our last regular-season game (and the playoffs)?'

""We thought we had two months to prepare last year and we were dealing with four days. You're dealing with four months here. So the focus for the 24 teams is how do we get up to speed? How do we get to our 'A' game when we haven't played for so long?""

Like most teams, Montreal Canadiens head coach Claude Julien and his staff met remotely via video conference on a regular basis after the NHL suspended the schedule because of the pandemic in mid-March.

And after it was announced they'd be facing the Pittsburgh Penguins in the qualifying round, those preparations ramped up significantly.

""I'm a believer that as a coach you can never get too much information — as much as you can get is great,"" Julien said. ""The important part is what you share with your players. That's where you have to be careful.""

Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said his focus will be shaking off the rust and getting his group prepared for a situation that will see teams go from zero to 100 in short order.

""There are significant challenges from a mindset standpoint and making sure that we get out of the summer hockey mode or the social distancing skates into real competitive hockey,"" he said. ""Because that's what we're going to be faced with in a short period of time.""

But Toronto Maple Leafs winger Zach Hyman, whose club is set to face the Columbus Blue Jackets in the qualifying round for a spot in the usual 16-team playoffs, still believes there could be some subtle changes around the league.

""This is the unknown,"" he said. ""When you go in from the regular season into playoffs, you don't really tweak too much, you just kind of roll into the playoffs, rolling off your momentum from the regular season. This is a completely different beast, where what you watched a couple months ago may not be the team that you're playing against in the summer. It's almost like a brand new year with the same rosters.

""It'll be interesting to see how everything turns out around the league with the long layoff.""

Canucks defenceman Christopher Tanev said he expects Vancouver's coaches to have plenty to share about the Minnesota Wild.

""I'm sure they'll have a lot of information,"" he said with a smile. ""They'll know every little detail about the team and every player.""

The Wild, however, shouldn't expect more than the basics on the other side.

""It's unique that we've known who we're playing here for a while,"" Minnesota interim head coach Dean Evason said. ""The challenge, at least for our group, is we don't want to overload them.""

The Boston Bruins are in a slightly different position as one of the top-4 teams in the Eastern Conference. They'll take part in round-robin games against Washington, Tampa Bay and Philadelphia to determine the No. 1 seed on that side of the playoff bracket, but the Bruins won't know their first-round opponent until after the qualifiers.

""We're not going to introduce a whole lot of new concepts,"" Boston head coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Even though you've had a lot of time to dream up a lot of different things, I don't know if it's the best time — a short turnaround with a lot of the line — to start messing too much with your game.

""We're going to try to keep it as simple as we can.""

For all the time coaches have had, that might end up being their best play.

Passenger numbers have risen to about 70 per cent of what they were at this time last year, said Tessa Humphries, communications manager for B.C. Ferries. In the early days of the pandemic, they were about 20 per cent of normal.

Passenger capacity had been capped at 50 per cent, but that restriction is being phased out to increase service, Humphries said.

That level was set by Transport Canada, which gave operators a choice between limiting capacity and implementing enhanced cleaning and physical- distancing measures.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries implemented both measures at first but has now decided to phase out the capacity limit. B.C. Ferries consulted with Transport Canada on the change, she said.

Enhanced physical-distancing and cleaning protocols, including clear plastic barriers and face- coverings, remain in place. Passengers are asked whether they’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms prior to travel, and those in vehicles are allowed to remain inside their cars.

More than 300 sailings per month have been added on major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland since the start of June. The company is aiming to keep capacity about 20 per cent above demand, Humphries said.

“We will have fewer sailings than in summer schedules of the past, but significantly more than what was available as a result of the service cuts in April,” she said.

The company has also added an additional vessel on the route between Departure Bay and Horseshoe Bay on Fridays and Sundays, and a second vessel on the route that services the southern Gulf Islands on Thursdays through Mondays.

“We did also hear from the communities that there was a struggle for capacity there,” Humphries said, adding that it wasn’t uncommon for sailings on Gulf Islands route to be completely booked.

Passengers travelling by car are encouraged to book in advance or choose less busy times to travel.

Humphries said B.C. Ferries expects it will take a couple of years before passenger numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.

Onboard food services have resumed on some minor routes, including between Swartz Bay and the Gulf Islands, and the Passages gift shop reopened Friday on sailings between Swartz Bay and Tsawwassen. Packaged food and limited hot food resumed on three major routes between the Island and the Lower Mainland in June.

The Lands End Café in the Swartz Bay terminal also recently reopened. Markets in the Departure Bay and Tsawwassen terminals reopened in late June.

The drop in ferry traffic has cost B.C. Ferries millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Humphries said the company is evaluating the financial situation daily and reopening onboard amenities will provide another revenue stream.

“But we’re all doing all of that carefully and gradually, as well as safely reintroducing these services,” she said.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country's known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

""This is the big effort over the next four weeks,"" said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

""What's going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.""

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they're all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

""That's a very different infection-control problem,"" said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won't be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

""A second wave is likely,"" McArthur said. ""But we've never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we'll beat it.""

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the look-out for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur's doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn't coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.

Trump flew by helicopter to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in suburban Washington to meet wounded servicemembers and health care providers caring for COVID-19 patients. As he left the White House, he told reporters: ""When you're in a hospital, especially ... I think it’s a great thing to wear a mask.""

article continues below

Trump was wearing a mask in Walter Reed's hallway as he began his visit. He was not wearing one when he stepped off the helicopter at the facility.

The president was a latecomer to wearing a mask during the pandemic, which has raged across the U.S. since March and infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 134,000. Most prominent Republicans, including Vice-President Mike Pence, endorsed wearing masks as the coronavirus gained ground this summer. Republican governors have been moving toward requiring or encouraging the use of masks as the pandemic has grown more serious in some states in the South and West.

Trump, however, has declined to wear a mask at news conferences, coronavirus task force updates, rallies and other public events. People close to him have told The Associated Press that the president feared a mask would make him look weak and was concerned that it shifted focus to the public health crisis rather than the economic recovery. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private matters.

While not wearing one himself, Trump has sent mixed signals about masks, acknowledging that they would be appropriate if worn in an indoor setting where people were close together. But he has accused reporters of wearing them to be politically correct and has retweeted messages making fun of Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing a mask and implying that Biden looks weak.

Questions remain whether Trump will wear a mask with any regularity.

The wearing of masks became another political dividing line, with Republicans more resistant to wearing them than Democrats. Few masks were seen at recent Trump campaign events in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Phoenix and South Dakota’s Mount Rushmore.

The only time Trump has been known to wear a mask was during a private part of a tour of a Ford plant in Michigan.

A spokesman for the Biden campaign cast the president's action as too little, too late.

""Donald Trump spent months ignoring the advice of medical experts and politicizing wearing a mask, one of the most important things we can do to prevent the spread of the virus,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""Rather than taking responsibility and leading, he wasted four months that Americans have been making sacrifices by stoking divisions and actively discouraging people from taking a very basic step to protect each other.""

On its website, Walter Reed carries this recommendation: ""Whenever you’re out in public, like at your local grocery store or pharmacy, where it’s difficult to maintain 6 feet of social distance, you should wear a cloth face covering."" The facility also notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus.""",[]

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be ""modest"" at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

""When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I'm quite sure this is less than one per cent,"" he said.

""The reality is, it's not going to move the needle.""

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a ""reasonably meaningful positive"" morale boost to Canadian sports fans who've been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL's hub cities on Friday night.

""The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,"" Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren't allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey's return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

""The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,"" said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

""They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.""

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to ""pander"" to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

""Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, 'We exist. We're on the map. Come look at us,'"" he said.

""But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It's not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.""

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with ""beauty shots"" of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

""You never know,"" he said. ""Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.""

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

""If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario's COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,"" she said.

""If those two come together it's just going to be the most beautiful thing.""

Collins made the comments in a July 8 update on summer travel and the impact of COVID-19 on the ferry service.

article continues below

Local governments on the Sunshine Coast and the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee have been pressing Ferries to add more trips to the Langdale-Horseshoe Bay route to meet the anticipated demand from residents, businesses and tourists now that travel within the province is no longer being discouraged.

Although BC Ferries is now running eight round-trips a day on Route 3, with two additional sailings on Fridays and Sundays starting July 10, there have still been frequent overloads and delays.

In a recent letter to BC Ferries, Sechelt councillors pointed out that the Sunshine Coast economy is “heavily reliant on tourism” and reduced capacity on the Langdale route could “limit our community’s recovery.”

“Our vision for Route 3 this summer is simple – provide the same level of service as last summer,” the letter said. “This would include the additional sailings we had last summer and maintaining increased time between sailings to ensure ferries run on time.”

Councillors in Gibsons are also sending BC Ferries a letter, asking the ferry company to “recognize the needs of small businesses on the Coast requiring deliveries of materials, including perishable goods, for their operations.”

In his update, Collins said traffic is beginning to grow again after dropping around 80 per cent in March and April and is expected to continue to increase throughout the summer.

“This summer, we are going to need your help, your patience and your understanding,” Collins said. “While we’re adding sailings as fast as we can, there still will be some sailing limitations this summer as we weren’t able to hire and train summer seasonal staff in March and April due to COVID-19. We are planning for summer service to exceed demand, but we won’t have the same number of sailings as last summer.”

Collins also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by schedule changes, some of which have happened on short notice. Sunshine Coast residents in particular have complained about trouble with rebooking reservations and long waits on hold with customer service.

“Over the past month or so, we’ve revised our schedules more often than normal, as we bring more sailings back into service,” he said. “I know this has impacted some of our customers, but every time we add more sailings, we need to revise the schedules one more time.”

Collins said BC Ferries is putting the bulk of its efforts into brining back service and is working with the province “to examine the impact COVID-19 is having on the ferry system.”

“We need to protect the core of the ferry system and continue to provide safe, reliable service to British Columbians.”",[]

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have active outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital. The outbreak at the Tabor long-term care home was declared over on July 7.

B.C.'s provincial health officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a July 10 joint statement that the province recorded 25 new cases in the past 24 hours, for a total of 3,053 cases since the virus that has caused a global pandemic first appeared in B.C. in late January.

North Island-Powell River MP Rachel Blaney has been working through her parliamentary commitments to ensure the reshaped government is being responsive to Canadians.

Blaney, in an interview on July 8, said she had just sat through a hybrid sitting of the House of Commons, which was “one for the record books.”

article continues below

“We’ll see what happens next but it was interesting,” said Blaney. “There were some parliamentarians in parliament and the rest of them were across the country. When we are sitting in front of our screen, we are seeing our colleagues from all over in their offices and their homes. We are participating in our democracy in a completely different way.”

Blaney said as the parliamentarian who represents the NDP on the procedural and house affairs committee, what is being done by the committee is looking at what the House of Commons can look like in the fall, and how to address the issue of being able to do the full spectrum of work that is usually done, understanding that everybody cannot be in the house simultaneously. She said a report will come out and will be made public.

Blaney said there have been a lot of discussions at the committee level about security, such as with online platforms, and what kinds of methods should be looked at in terms of voting.

“We all know that is very important,” said Blaney, about voting. “If there is any voting happening now, it’s just the members in the house, percentage wise, representing each party. It’s definitely been an experience doing the work that you’ve done for your career but doing it in a very different way.”

Running the federal government in a hybrid system has many complexities. There are 338 parliamentarians, so accommodating the sheer number of people in the House of Commons and online is an issue. Blaney said one intricacy is that as parliament does its work, everything has to be simultaneously interpreted in French and English.

She said one of the things being looked at in the report is around the reality that in the last parliament, there was also some indigenous language spoken with an interpreter present, so there is a process that has to happen to allow that in the revised House of Commons.

“Now that we are in a different format of parliament, we are trying to find a way to follow the rules we’ve set for ourselves for that kind of flexibility,” said Blaney.

She said the committee has looked at other parliaments across the planet, seeing how other governments are coping with administration of democracy during the pandemic.

“I’m not sure what the final recommendations will be but I do believe there has to be a way to allow people who can only participate virtually to have a voice,” said Blaney. “It’s really important to honour those voices and make sure they have the capacity to represent their regions.”

In more remote areas of the country, where internet service is not as robust as it is in other areas, there may also be some issues with connectivity, said Blaney. She said the committee has worked closely with the House of Commons to make sure those issues are taken into consideration.

“If we’re in a position of taking a vote, how do we make sure those folks don’t miss out because of some sort of technical challenge that has happened?” said Blaney. “The committee has been looking long and hard into those issues, wanting to make sure we really honour parliament and the history of parliament, but recognizing that sometimes we have to adapt to these new circumstances.”

She said she is ultimately looking forward to going back to Ottawa and participating in parliament and seeing all of her colleagues there, because she thinks that part of the work is very important. Blaney acknowledges that a return to the old method of governance is an unknown. COVID-19 is the reality and everyone has seen how things have fundamentally changed, she added.

The work of the all-party COVID-19 committee in parliament is done, said Blaney, so parliamentarians will continue to meet through the hybrid system.

She said the hybrid parliament will be meeting at least four times this summer and it is something the NDP fought for during negotiations.

“We wanted to make sure, during changing times, the government was held to account twice a month over the summer months because things are changing quickly and we need the ability to ask questions and to hold the government to account during these very challenging times,” said Blaney.

She said the parliamentary structure is fundamental to Canada, and if it is going to be changed or altered, she said she hopes the government is thoughtful in how it is going to change it, and that parliament is not taken for granted.

“We need to focus on how we are going to do the work,” said Blaney, “in the middle of a pandemic.”",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.'s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

article continues below

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor's move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

""Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,"" said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

""The decision was our own.""

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a ""courtesy email"" to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw's decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized ""the news would be public immediately.""

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

""We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,"" he said.

He called it ""one factor among others"" contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis's email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn't recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

""In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,"" he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

""Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.""

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he ""wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.""

He said he would ""absolutely not"" characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

""What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,"" he said in a statement.

""The executives all admitted to exchanging 'courtesy emails' and 'courtesy calls' on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee's ruling on that.""

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

The matriarchs, known as Gaandlee Guu Jaalang or ""daughters of the river,"" say in a statement the Queen Charlotte Lodge and West Coast Fishing Club reopened as a local state of emergency remains in effect because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

""Haida Gwaii is a remote community with limited health-care services and only two ventilators,"" the statement says. ""One case would devastate our communities.""

The statement says the matriarchs are upholding Haida law through the occupation of the villages, Jung and Sk'aawats.

Both the fishing lodge and club say they are fully complying with orders and guidelines issued by the B.C. government, health authorities and WorkSafeBC.

Brian Clive, vice-president of sales and corporate development for the lodge, said it has had several meetings with Haida leadership and developed plans so that workers do not go into town or anywhere near a Haida community. It also has medical staff on site and if a COVID-19 case were to develop, there's a plan in place to evacuate the affected person by air to Vancouver.

""We have gone to incredible lengths to avoid any contact with the communities and therefore have created what we call a zero-risk chance of contamination in the communities,"" he said.

The lodge expects about 80 guests at a time, down from the typical 125, he said. None will be travelling from the United States because the border is closed, he said.

President Brian Legge said the West Coast Fishing Club is remotely located about 83 kilometres from the nearest community and only accessible by boat or air. It also has an emergency evacuation plan in place.

""First and foremost we would never put the health and well-being of Haida Gwaii communities and residents at risk and equally as important our staff and clients,"" he says in a statement.

""That's why we have worked hard and gone to significant expense to eliminate all contact with the residents of Haida Gwaii and their communities through direct helicopter transportation from the mainland to our remote island and back.""

Without the plan, the club's employees would have been out of work and the business faced possibly unsustainable losses, Legge said.

The club is continuing to speak with the council of the Haida Nation, he added.

Duffy Edgars, chief councillor of Old Massett Village, said he supports the matriarchs and expected 20 to 30 people to occupy the villages. He said he didn't expect any interactions with lodge staff.

""We're just occupying our land and doing some fishing,"" he said.

Haida member Deana Young, who was on her way to support the matriarchs, said the community is following physical distancing protocols, while children have not returned to school and are not seeing their elders.

""One person coming from outside our region is one person too many,"" said Young.

The occupation of the land is an exercise of Haida rights to the land, she said.

""What we are doing is occupying our lands, asserting our rights to harvest the foods that we live on and to ensure food security for our communities,"" she said.

The new listing did not specify which seats were affected on the flights, meaning any passengers aboard the flight should “self-isolate and monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the flight.”

Cargill's beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take ""reasonable precautions"" at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

""This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That's why it's so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,"" said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

""Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.""

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

""At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.""

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada's beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

The league and NHL Players' Association announced Friday the return-to-play protocols — featuring Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities — and a four-year extension to the current collective bargaining agreement have been ratified.

article continues below

The NHL board of governors and the union's full membership gave the documents, which were tied together in an all-or-nothing bundle, the thumbs up in separate votes.

""It was pretty civil,"" Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat said of negotiations on the deal that was tentatively agreed to Monday. ""We're happy to get things going.""

Bringing the hubs to Canada, where coronavirus infection rates are largely under control, proved to be the logical choice after a significant spike in cases across the United States in recent weeks.

""While we have all worked very hard to try to address the risks of COVID-19, we know that health and safety are and will continue to be our priorities,"" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. ""We know that all of our fans are excited about our return to the ice.""

Training camps for the 24 teams primed to compete in the league's restart to a 2019-20 campaign that was suspended March 12 are scheduled to begin Monday — also the deadline for players to opt out of participating with no penalty — in each franchise's home market.

The plan will then see Eastern Conference clubs report to Toronto on July 26, while those from the Western Conference head to Edmonton before the games resume Aug. 1. The conference finals and Stanley Cup will be held in Edmonton as part of a first-of-its-kind NHL Final Four that could stretch all the way to Oct. 4 and result in next season being pushed into December or early January.

Once in Canada's largest city and Alberta's capital, players are set to be kept away from the general public in so-called ""bubbles"" that include strict health measures, daily testing, and mostly confine teams to hotels and empty arenas.

The extension of the current CBA, which was slated to expire in September 2022 and now runs through at least the 2025-26 season, provides both players and owners clarity on a number of challenging financial realities caused by COVID-19.

It also give the green light for negotiations with the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation on participation at the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games. The NHL skipped the 2018 Olympics after taking part in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The salary cap's upper limit will remain at US$81.5 million in 2020-21 and stay there until hockey-related revenue returns to $4.8 billion — this season's projected total prior to the pandemic. Players have agreed to defer 10 per cent of next year's salaries, and have owners pay that back over three consecutive seasons starting in 2022-23.

""This agreement is a meaningful step forward for the players and owners, and for our game, in a difficult and uncertain time,"" NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said. ""We are pleased to be able to bring NHL hockey back.""

Escrow payments, a consistent thorn in the side of players that guarantees a 50/50 split of HRR with owners, will be capped at 20 per cent in 2020-21, and decrease throughout the deal. If teams are still owed money following the 2025-26 campaign, the CBA will be extended another season.

The agreement marks the first time in Bettman's 27-year tenure as commissioner the NHL has bridged two CBAs without a work stoppage. Both the 1994-95 and 2012-13 seasons were cut to 48 games because of lockouts, while the 2004-05 campaign was cancelled.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney was the most outspoken politician with regards to having his province host one of the hubs, pointing to a low infection rate and Edmonton's facilities.

He also penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in hopes of securing a waiver for the NHL when it came to Canada's mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in the country. The federal government approved the league's proposal of a cohort quarantine last month, granting an exception that paved the way for Toronto and Edmonton to get the nod as hubs.

Speaking outside Rogers Place, Kenney said Friday's news will create jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity.

""The Stanley Cup is coming back to Edmonton, to Alberta,"" Kenney said in a video posted to Twitter as he stood next to a statue of Wayne Gretzky. ""We are going to get an unbelievable amount of free advertising across North America and around the world that will set us up well for the future relaunch of our tourism industry when travel comes back post-COVID.""

The Cup was last awarded in Edmonton when Gretzky hoisted it over his head for a fourth and final time on May 26, 1988.

Each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 people into the bubbles, including a maximum of 31 players.

Meanwhile, it was also announced the NHL draft lottery's second phase has been tabbed for Aug. 10. The eight losing teams from the qualifying round will have an equal shot at the first pick in the draft, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10.

Much like Kenney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory supported their city's hub potential.

""There is no better place for the NHL season to continue,"" Tory said. ""We will make sure we put on a great show for the game of hockey ... while following all proper health and safety protocols.""

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto General Hospital, said choosing to hold the NHL's restart in Canada reduces the overall risk, but it's far from a fool-proof endeavour.

""We'd be blind to think that there isn't COVID-19 in Canada, there's just significantly less of it here compared to parts of the U.S.,"" he said. ""Everyone has to pay close attention to COVID-19 because even with the best laid plans, there still can be small weaknesses that might be exploited by this virus.""

Vancouver was the other Canadian city originally in the running to host, along with seven American markets, before the provincial government expressed concerns about the NHL's health and safety protocols.

Ford was asked prior to Friday's announcement why the plan worked for his province when it didn't for British Columbia.

""They have very stringent rules and regulations for their players,"" Ford said of the NHL. ""When they told me (players are) getting tested every single day, I'm no medical professional, but I don't think they need testing every day.""

The 24-team format — which includes every Canadian franchise, save for Ottawa — will see the top-4 clubs from both the East and West play mini-tournaments to determine playoff seeding, while the other 16 will battle in a never-before-seen qualifying round.

Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia are set to compete for the No. 1 slot in the East, while defending champions St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas will do the same out West.

The East's best-of-five qualifying series include Pittsburgh vs. Montreal, Carolina vs. New York Rangers, New York Islanders vs. Florida and Toronto vs. Columbus. In the West, the matchups are Edmonton vs. Chicago, Nashville vs. Arizona, Vancouver vs. Minnesota and Calgary vs. Winnipeg.

In all, there will be as many as 52 games played over the first nine days before the teams get a break on Aug. 10.

The four winners of the best-of-five series in each conference will then be pitted against the top-4 seeds to fill out the usual 16-team playoff bracket.

There could, however, still be choppy waters before the 2019-20 season can actually resume.

Players won't be quarantined during training camp, but instead asked to practise physical distancing when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and Monday during voluntary workouts, 23 results came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in those optional sessions.

The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the lockout scratched the entire season.

There's now a firm plan in place to — hopefully — see it handed out this fall.

The Burnaby Community Action Team (BCAT) on the Overdose Crisis penned a letter to council in late May with two calls to action for the city, including providing overdose response training and supplies to warming centre staff.

article continues below

“As illicit drug overdoses continue to rise, it is imperative that facilities supporting the homeless population in our city follow best practice measures,” reads the letter. “This means ensuring warming centre staff have access to overdose response supplies and basic training in relation to overdose recognition and response.”

The letter is cosigned by Michel Pouliot, executive director of Burnaby Family Life, and Dr. Lindsay McCaffrey with the Burnaby Division of Family Practices, along with several BCAT member organizations, including the Progressive Housing Society, Mosaic Burnaby Centre for Immigrants and the Burnaby Society to End Homelessness.

“In the event of an overdose, the wait time between a call to first responders and their arrival can cause permanent brain injury or death. Such experiences can be incredibly upsetting for witnesses and for staff,” reads the letter.

“Frontline workers who are not provided with the training and tools to respond often feel traumatized and powerless.”

The letter notes staff have taken sick leave in other jurisdictions as a result of that trauma, and some Burnaby warming centre staff are already taking naloxone to work.

In a report to council this week, staff said the city would need to “evaluate the operational implications of the request and would have to determine the advisability and feasibility of the request in order to evaluate whether or not this would be an effective additional measure to prevent overdoses in this context.”

Asked why the city would need to study the measure when naloxone training has been widely available for years, city spokesperson Chris Bryan said it is “standard for the city’s risk manager to review all procedures which may affect the health and safety of our patrons and staff, and which may result in liability exposure.”

The BCAT letter also called on the city to expand its resources for the homeless community in Burnaby during the pandemic, including keeping the warming centres, the last of which closed on July 1, open until an emergency shelter has been established in the city.

An emergency shelter is currently planned for the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex, and in the meantime, BC Housing has secured more hotel rooms to house local homeless individuals.

That Burnaby Lake emergency shelter, however, is only expected to be open until December, when construction of the Burnaby Lake complex replacement is set to begin.

“As the health of this population is already compromised, a COVID-19 outbreak would have a devastating impact,” reads the letter. “We know that the proposed locations for the ERC may serve as recreational sites when restrictions are lifted but the need to support vulnerable people and save lives must absolutely supersede residents’ access to such facilities.”

Staff also suggested the city work with community partners to develop short- and long-term actions to address homelessness.",[]

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.'s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.'s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that's also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month's gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

""They're making sure that their employees are safe, they're making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.""

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

""When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,"" read their statement.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that's hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip's ""Bobcaygeon"" left empty.

article continues below

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

""The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Cohen said.

""We're not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It's a bad scene.""

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada's live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada's arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who's granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that's supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues ""a good start"" that needs to be built upon in short order.

""It's better than nothing,"" she said.

""It'll help some companies for a very short amount of time...but we're not done here. We can't be done.""

While Cohen doesn't know if he'll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he's skeptical about how much it'll actually help the Horseshoe.

""I'll be able to pay two weeks of rent,"" Cohen said, pointing out it's roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

""It'll be something, and we'll be grateful for it... but I'm skeptical until I actually see the payments.""

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

""Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don't think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren't. I don't think we even know,"" Cohen said.

""The eligibility makes no sense.""

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal's music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

""It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it's acoustic shows only,"" she said.

""Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.""

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding's attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she's concerned for her business, she's also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That's motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she's been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She's also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would ""put more money in the artists' pockets"" over the coming months.

""I'm going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,"" she said.

""We're huge believers in live music.""

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn't resist: ""We may all be moving to Canada soon,"" he deadpanned.

article continues below

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent's lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America's increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada's reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

""I don't blame them for wanting us out of there,"" the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

""I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries' response to COVID-19: America's has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.""

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

""The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,"" they wrote.

""We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.""

That doesn't mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

""Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,"" he said.

""A phased opening could expand the category of 'essential traveller,' but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

""The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,"" Yelich said. ""The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.""

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada's economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

""It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.""

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it's past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

""There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,"" Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

""Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,"" Trautman said. ""Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.""

Statistics Canada's labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

article continues below

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn't include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don't ever come back.

""I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,"" said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

""We aren't remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.""

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren't at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

""A lot of areas of the economy still aren't running at full capacity,"" Bernard said. ""So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn't come back to normal.""

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa's response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

""Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,"" Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government's plan was working, before adding many Canadians still ""face real challenges during this time.""

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

""We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn't look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

""It means that even if there are jobs, some women won't be able to take them because there's no way they can leave their kids,"" said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

""So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.""

Three Cabinet ministers in the administration of Bolivian leader Jeanine Áñez have also tested positive for the virus, including Health Minister Eidy Roca and Presidency Minister Yerko Nuñez, who is hospitalized.

article continues below

The infections in Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia, which is seeing a spike in cases, come after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández tested positive in June and was briefly hospitalized.

Áñez said she will remain in isolation for 14 days when another test will be done, but she will continue to work remotely from the presidential residence.

""I feel good, I feel strong,"" she wrote on her Twitter account.

Bolivia’s Health Ministry says the Andean country has 42,984 confirmed coronavirus cases and 1,577 deaths, and is seeing a rebound in the number of new cases amid reports that hospitals are being overwhelmed in some regions. In the highland city of Cochabamba, scenes have emerged of bodies lying in the streets and coffins waiting for days in homes to be taken away.

Bolivia is scheduled to hold a presidential election Sept. 6. Áñez is running third in opinion polls. Former Economy Minister Luis Arce, who represents the party of ousted President Evo Morales, is in front, with ex-President Carlos Mesa in second.

In Venezuela, meanwhile, socialist party chief Diosdado Cabello revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19, making him the highest-ranking leader in the distressed South American nation thus far to come down with the virus.

Cabello is considered the second-most powerful person in Venezuela after President Nicolás Maduro and made the announcement on Twitter, stating that he is isolated, getting treatment and will overcome the illness.

""We will win!"" he wrote in conclusion.

Economically struggling Venezuela is considered one of the world’s least prepared countries to confront the pandemic. Hospitals are routinely short on basic supplies like water, electricity and medicine.

The nation has registered considerably fewer COVID-19 cases than others in the region, but the number of infections has grown in recent weeks. As of Wednesday, the government had reported 8,010 confirmed cases and 75 deaths.

Cabello was last seen Tuesday, when he met with South Africa’s ambassador, Joseph Nkosi. Photographs released by the government showed him standing alongside and bumping fists with the diplomat while wearing a black mask.

The 57-year-old politician is head of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful legislative body created by Maduro’s government in 2017. He had missed his weekly television program Wednesday, stating at the time that he was ""fighting against a strong allergy"" and resting.

Maduro said in a broadcast Thursday that Cabello’s diagnosis was confirmed with a molecular exam — a test that is usually conducted with a nasal swab sample. Venezuela has done far fewer of these tests than neighbouring countries, instead largely deploying rapid blood antibody tests. Some experts fear that relying so heavily on the rapid tests, which don’t detect signs of illness early in an infection, means cases are being missed.

""Venezuela is with Diosdado,"" Maduro said. ""I am sure soon enough we will continue on in this fight.""

In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday.

He appeared Thursday on an online broadcast from the presidential residence as defiant as on previous occasions. He coughed once, but did not show other symptoms of the disease that has killed more than 69,000 people in the South American nation.

Bolsonaro repeated his view that the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic is more dangerous than the coronavirus itself. He insisted that mayors and governors need to reopen the country for business.

""We need governors and mayors, within their responsibilities, to reopen commerce. Otherwise the consequences will be harmful for Brazil,"" Bolsonaro said, wearing a gray shirt and sitting comfortably in front of two national flags.",[]

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn't paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

""With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,"" company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of ""a significant number of money-losing stores"" it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

""All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,"" he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

The cancellation of the 2020 national football championship game because of COVID-19, and U Sports not altering an age eligibility rule, accelerates the swan song of roughly 300 football players.

article continues below

U Sports has said student-athletes whose championships are cancelled in 2020-21 because of the pandemic will not lose a year of eligibility.

But football players have seven years after graduating from high school to complete their five-year eligibility. Many play junior football before entering the university ranks.

The only U Sports sport with an age limit is football.

University of Calgary quarterback Josiah Joseph of the defending Vanier Cup champion Dinos is among those caught in a rule designed to limit the age of players in Canadian university football to under 25.

Players who turn 25 before Sept. 1 age out of university football. Joseph turns 25 on July 10, 2021.

Approximately 300 players out of 2,335 will be similarly impacted in 2021, according to U Sports.

Joseph hoped U Sports would make an exception for players like him.

""All they would have to do is amend the rule and push it to maybe January first due to extreme circumstances,"" he told The Canadian Press.

""It's devastating there's that many players in my position.""

U Sports adopted a football age cap to prevent large gaps in physical maturation and experience between players in a collision sport, and also to create room on rosters for younger players, according to U Sports interim CEO Dick White.

""I really understand the disappointment of the players that this affects,"" said White, who took over for departed CEO Graham Brown last month.

""Our legal advice that we received was very firm. If we believe the age cap should be 25 for the health and safety of athletes then we should not under any circumstances alter that.

""The reasons for having that age cap have not changed even though we've had the tragedy of COVID.""

Joseph argues there is no physical or experience difference between a player who turns 25 in March and one who turns 25 in October.

""There's already 25 year olds playing in the league so what's the difference of a couple months?"" he asked. ""There is none.""

U Sport cancelling the 2020 Vanier Cup and the two bowl games — Mitchell and Uteck — that serve as semifinals doesn't stop conferences from playing football in the fall.

But Canada West, Ontario University Athletics and Atlantic University Sport have already declared there won't be football in 2020 because of the pandemic.

The Reseau du sport etudiant du Quebec is still working on running football this fall.

University of Bisons head coach Brian Dobie points out fifth-year players aren't the only ones impacted.

Any current university football player whose birthday falls before Sept. 1 will lose a year of football eligibility because of the combination of the pandemic and the current rule.

""What about that kid who had two years left and he just got a starting spot? Now Johnny has one year left. What about Billy who had three years left and now has two years left?"" Dobie asked.

""If you have one kid in your program that is negatively affected by this, as a coach you should be outraged. Every kid should count just the same and you should be outraged.""

Losing a year of football eligibility also means losing a year of athletic scholarship to pay for school, Dobie added.

""The reality is the age cap is 25 and it's not 26 and somewhere you draw the line,"" White said.

""If the football institutions wish to re-address the age cap to 26 or no age cap, that's up to our member institutions. There's a process to do that.

""The big picture here was there was a very good reason we put the age cap in. Our board of directors, supported by the legal opinion, said 'don't move it.'""

Joseph doesn't buy that rationale.

""It doesn't seem like it's reflecting the interests of a lot of coaches and players that make up U Sports football that make it successful, the guys that are going to be there for five years who are going to graduate that are going to be proud alumni,"" he said.

""That's what makes up university football in Canada.""

In addition to the impact on each individual’s care, test data is critical to strategic planning and public policy.

As well as informing us, however, testing issues have also created a great deal of confusion and frustration. The terminology and specifics are new to most, and the criteria for and access to testing has fluctuated a great deal in a short period of time. After four months, here’s where we stand:

article continues below

Summary points

* Testing is now available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, however mild;

* Those needing COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call their family doctor or nurse practitioner's office, call 811, or attend the hospital emergency department (ER);

* Powell River and qathet Region District have had very few confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, but remain at risk for future outbreaks. Ongoing attention to public health measures is still critically important.

Criteria for testing

Most COVID-19 patients have cold or flu-like symptoms, though onset may be gradual over days. Those with severe symptoms should attend the ER without delay. Common symptoms include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, sore throat, lack of appetite, and loss of taste or smell. Headaches, confusion, runny nose, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rashes are less typical, but may occur.

People without any symptoms (asymptomatic) are not generally tested in BC, except in special circumstances such as a public health investigation of an outbreak. In addition to using limited resources, testing asymptomatic individuals can lead to high rates of false positives (test is positive, but the person doesn’t actually have the virus). An online symptom checker is available at https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en, or through 811.

Where to get tested

People are encouraged to call their nurse practitioner or family doctor if they feel they may have COVID-19. In addition to reviewing criteria for testing, a primary care provider knows their patient's medical history and can direct them accordingly. Some clinics offer testing on site, including drive-through testing, while others will refer to another office or to the hospital.

Assessment and testing for COVID-19 at Powell River General Hospital is located in the ambulance bay of the ER. There is a separated space for one patient at a time, and it is cleaned after each use. Efforts are being made to reduce wait times, but these do vary.

Those coming to the ER for respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 assessment are encouraged to call ahead (604.485.3211), and will be directed outside to the ambulance entrance where there is a buzzer to advise staff on arrival. Testing is available 24/7, if needed.

People being assessed and tested for COVID-19 will only be brought into the main ER department if they need further investigations or treatment. Dedicated areas are used for this purpose.

Procedure for outpatient testing

Testing for COVID-19 involves essentially a small cotton swab on a plastic stick that is inserted into one’s nose, turned a few times, then removed and placed in a tube. Nasal swabs may make one’s eyes water, but are generally described as uncomfortable rather than painful.

Locally, all COVID-19 swabs are packaged at the hospital and flown to Vancouver once or twice daily for processing. Results are typically by 8 am the day after they are received in Vancouver.

Powell River Hospital has secured a small supply of rapid tests that can identify a COVID-19 result within an hour. Owing to the very limited supply, these are generally reserved for critical situations.

Most people with COVID-19 (over 80 per cent) will be well enough to stay at home during their illness.

After being tested, patients are given instructions and an information sheet on how to self-isolate until test results are available. Staying home when sick is considered by many experts as the single most effective strategy to limit COVID-19 in a community.

Results

To confirm a negative test people may wish to speak with their primary care provider, use myehealth.ca, or call the BCCDC negative results line between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm, seven days per week, at 1.833.707.2792.

Those with positive test results will be notified rapidly by Public Health. In BC thus far, over 98 per cent of positive cases were reached in under 24 hours. The family doctor or nurse practitioner will also receive the result.

If someone tests positive for COVID-19, a public health staff member will call them daily until they are cleared (usually 10 days if minimal symptoms). They will offer direction on self-isolation and help advise how to manage symptoms, including when to seek further care.

The public health team will also take a detailed history to identify who has had close contact with a positive case, including up to 48 hours before that person's symptoms first developed.

Those people identified by public health as having a significant risk of exposure (e.g. sustained close contact, household members, no physical distancing or protective equipment) will be notified as soon as possible, and will be advised to self-isolate (and to test if they develop symptoms). Contact tracing is not generally done for very brief, distanced, or other low risk encounters.

Future plans

Blood testing for immunity (i.e. past infection) is not yet available for routine use. It is still unclear how accurate these tests are, and how long immunity from natural infection can be detected.

As we move into the fall, we expect an increase in respiratory viruses of all types. Detailed plans for additional testing sites have been developed and will be implemented based on capacity and need.

Powell River data

Local medical officer of health Dr. Geoff McKee reported last week that the lower Sunshine Coast has had a total of six cases thus far in the pandemic, and that Powell River region has had fewer than five cases to date (because of the low number and the potential privacy risk for so few cases, the exact number was not given).

Dr. McKee also noted that there were no active cases being followed on the Sunshine Coast. Unfortunately, there could be cases that simply aren’t identified yet, or new cases that may arise at any time. For this reason, regardless of the exact number of confirmed cases, we all need to follow public health recommendations if we hope to protect our community from this virus.

A recent survey completed by the Powell River Division of Family Practice identified that roughly three per cent of people surveyed in our region have been tested for COVID-19. Several barriers to testing were identified by community members, which we are working to address.

Conclusion

While our region has had relatively little COVID-19 activity thus far, global cases continue to rise rapidly. Until there is widespread immunity or a universally effective treatment, we are all vulnerable.

Local physicians will continue to prepare and behave as if there are active cases in the community. Staying home when sick, washing hands, physical distancing with most people, and wearing masks or protective equipment when needed, continue to be the cornerstones of defence for all of us.

In addition public health measures, testing (and contact tracing) is an extremely powerful tool to limit the spread of COVID-19. Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms should call their family doctor or nurse practitioner, call 811, or attend our local emergency department.

Be smart, be safe, and be kind. We are in this together.

Seniors, in particular, are a focus of the report from the Senate's social affairs committee, from those in long-term care homes to those with low incomes.

article continues below

Just this week, the Liberals rolled out one-time special payments of $300 to the more than six million people who receive old-age security, and $200 more for the 2.2 million who also receive the guaranteed income supplement.

The income supports are meant to help seniors facing increased costs as a result of the pandemic, such as more frequent prescription fees and delivery charges for groceries.

Senators on the committee wrote of evidence of ""financial insecurity and increased vulnerability"" for low-income seniors as a result of the first wave of the novel coronavirus.

A potential second wave, which could coincide with the annual flu season that starts in the fall, would make the situation even worse for these seniors ""without concrete and timely government action,"" the report says.

Senators say the Liberals should deliver a plan to help low-income seniors, among other populations vulnerable to economic shocks like new immigrants, no later than the end of August, and contain short- and long-term options.

The report also says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

The document made public Thursday morning is the committee's first set of observations on the government's response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Before then, the Liberals are planning to provide another economic update like the one delivered Wednesday, or possibly a full budget. The government shelved plans to deliver one at the end of March when the House of Commons went on extended hiatus due to the pandemic.

The long-awaited economic ""snapshot,"" as the Liberals styled it, said federal spending is closing in on $600 billion this fiscal year. That means a deficit of $343 billion, fuelled by emergency pandemic aid that the government budgets at over $230 billion.

The Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada said the spending figures demand a ""full and transparent assessment"" to see what worked, what didn't and what needs to change for an economic recovery.

Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said the Liberals should take back up their promise to create a national pharmacare system as the government considers its next steps.

A federal advisory council last year calculated the cost of a program at over $15 billion annually, depending on its design.

""The last thing we want to have is Canadians in frail health as we're dealing with this pandemic and I think the government really needs to think of that,"" Yussuff said in an interview Wednesday.

""Had it not been for the health care system we have right now,"" he added later, ""think of how this country would have fared in this pandemic.""

The Senate committee's report also notes the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves wasn't managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck.

Committee members added concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of ""inconsistencies from international procurement.""

The stock market crash in March and the plunge in interest rates left many investors feeling uncertain and vulnerable, while still more have been left without work.

article continues below

Tina Cheung, a wealth adviser at Vancity, says it is always important to review your financial plan on a regular basis, but a review can be especially important during times like these.

""During these times of uncertainty it is important to have peace of mind, and to have that peace of mind, to achieve it, is to get a financial check up,"" she said.

Investors who were shocked at the state of their investment portfolios at the end of the first quarter might breathe a sigh of relief when checking their statements for the second quarter as stock markets have rallied off their lows seen near the end of March.

However, Canada's main stock index is still down from where it was a year ago and well off the highs it hit in February before the pandemic struck the markets.

""The effects of the pandemic on the market will eventually pass, like the global financial crisis did, but if these few months created any stress or loss of sleep, we need to go back and talk about your risk appetite,"" Cheung says.

But she says if your risk appetite has not changed and your goal hasn't changed, then it is critical to think long term and stick to your plan.

Before heading into a meeting with your adviser, it is important to have a firm grip of your budget and what your goals are for the meeting.

Cheung says you need to be prepared to have an open discussion and be ready with information like your monthly income and expenses.

For some, reviewing their financial plan may mean difficult decisions, facing depleted emergency funds due to the loss of a job and little prospect for a return to work at a level seen before the pandemic.

A poll done for TD Bank found that 38 per cent of those surveyed identified as financially vulnerable in April 2020 compared with 15 per cent in November last year. The poll also found that 13 per cent of those asked in April felt confident in their financial future compared with 20 per cent in November 2019.

If you have taken advantage of the payment deferrals offered by many lenders, you need to have a clear plan for when those deferral periods come to an end and you need to resume making payments.

Gio Bazile, a district vice-president at TD Bank, says some borrowers may start to struggle once the deferrals come to an end if their income hasn't picked back up again.

""Part of what is going to be really critical is understanding what your future cash flow is going to look like and how do you work with your financial adviser with an impending financial hardship, how do you best balance your wants and needs,"" he said.

Bazile says everyone is going to face their own situation, but it's key to have a candid conversation with your partner or family to understand where you are financially.

""If your cash flow is low or if you are kind of over-leveraged from a debt perspective, then that's probably a time to actually spend some time with your financial adviser,"" he said.

That is, if they can survive long enough to see daylight again.

Those were two of the conclusions in the most recent Restaurants Canada survey of its member businesses.

The survey, which heard from nearly 1,000 restaurant owners representing more than 11,500 restaurants, found 56 per cent of restaurant owners believed it would require a year or more to recover from the pandemic, and that at least 50 per cent of them are currently operating at a loss. “Restaurateurs are eager to help rebuild the economy and revive neighbourhoods, but they’re going to need continued assistance from government to remain operational under ongoing restrictions,” said the organization’s vice-president, David Lefebvre.

The results of the survey come as no surprise to Ian Tostenson, president of the B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

While Tostenson said the provincial situation is a bit of a “mixed bag” of results as B.C. continues to open up its economy, he made it clear there is trouble in the industry.

“Of the nearly 15,000 restaurants in B.C. maybe 60 per cent are actually up and running,” he said, noting many have decided to remain closed temporarily as there’s no business for them and others have closed for good. “Some may never come back. We expect to lose between 20 and 30 per cent of the industry … it’s just too much to expect some of these small businesses to hold on.”

That is especially true in the major markets.

“Downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver are just disasters,” he said. Downtown restaurants rely heavily on tourism and office workers to stay afloat. “Volumes in those two big markets are tracking 20-30 per cent of where they were at this point last year.”

On the upside, Tostenson said suburban operators and restaurants in small cities and towns around B.C. have reported doing alright.

Overall, he said, they are still dealing with the fact people aren’t yet feeling safe about going out to eat despite the myriad safety precautions the industry has taken.

The survey results have spurred Restaurants Canada to call for the federal government to extend and strengthen support for food-service businesses by maintaining the federal wage subsidy, extending and expanding rent-relief programs and expanding loans for small business.

The first time, he showed up an hour before the public testing site was set to close and was told they had reached capacity. He was turned away from a second centre when rain shut it down, and voluntarily left a third after someone ahead of him said they had been waiting in line for more than three hours.

article continues below

""If you have symptoms and you are just driving around the city trying to figure out how you can get a test, for people who are positive, it is not ideal,"" said Lee, who finally got a test on June 29 after he showed up at a site before dawn and waited for more than two hours. Another five days passed before he was able to view the results online, and he didn't receive a text with the results until seven days after being tested.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., Americans confronted with a resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites in the summer heat or are getting turned away. Others are going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis.

Some sites are running out of kits, while labs are reporting shortages of materials and workers to process the swabs.

Some frustrated Americans are left to wonder why the U.S. can't seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning as the virus wreaked havoc in China and then Italy, Spain and New York.

""It’s a hot mess,"" said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson of Tucson, Arizona. ""The fact that we’re relying on companies and we don’t have a national response to this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people who need tests from getting tests.""

It took Hudson five days to make an appointment through a CVS pharmacy near her home. She booked a drive-up test over the weekend, more than a week after her symptoms — fatigue, shortness of breath, headache and sore throat — first emerged. The clinic informed her that her results would probably be delayed.

Testing has been ramped up nationwide, reaching about 640,000 tests per day on average, up from around 518,000 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis. Newly confirmed infections per day in the U.S. are running at over 50,000, breaking records at practically every turn.

More testing tends to lead to more cases found. But in an alarming indicator, the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country, hitting almost 27% in Arizona, 19% in Florida and 17% in South Carolina.

While the U.S. has conducted more tests than any other nation, it ranks in the middle of the pack in testing per capita, behind Russia, Spain and Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

""I am stunned that as a nation, six months into this pandemic, we still can’t figure out how to deliver testing to the American people when they need it,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute. ""It is an abject failure of leadership and shows that the federal government has not prioritized testing in a way that will allow us to get through this pandemic.""

Testing alone without adequate contact tracing and quarantine measures won't control the spread of the scourge, according to health experts. But they say delays in testing can lead to more infections by leaving people in the dark as to whether they need to isolate themselves.

In other developments:

— While the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. hit 3 million Wednesday by Johns Hopkins' count, health officials have said that because of inadequate testing and the many mild infections that have gone unreported, the real number is about 10 times higher, or almost 10% of the U.S. population.

— A crowd of thousands attending President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in late June, along with large groups of people who showed up to protest, ""likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases in the area, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday. Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed cases on Monday, a new record one-day high, and another 206 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Trump campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

— Most New York City students will return to school in the fall two or three days a week and learn online the rest of the time under a plan announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said schools can’t accommodate all their students at any one time and maintain social distancing. The school system in New York is the biggest in the nation, with 1.1 million students. It has been closed since March.

In New York City, the most lethal hot spot in the nation during the spring, testing was scarce early on but is now widely available. As many as 35,000 tests are conducted daily through a combination of private health organizations and city agencies, according to the city Health Department.

""Widespread testing holds the key to reopening our city safely,"" de Blasio said.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week said it will open free ""surge testing"" sites in three hard-hit cities: Jacksonville, Florida; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Edinburg, Texas. The sites will be able to conduct as many as 5,000 tests a day in each city, with results in three to five days, officials said.

In Georgia, one of the states where cases are surging, officials are rushing to expand testing capacity as demand threatens to overwhelm six major sites around Atlanta, said DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

""If you project this out over the next three weeks, we can’t handle it,"" he said.

In New Orleans, people were turned away from a free testing site for a third consecutive day after it reached its daily allotment of tests. Health care providers are running low on trays and chemicals needed to run machines used in the tests.

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the situation there ""desperate"" as residents have sat in sun-baked cars for up to 13 hours to get drive-thru testing. Robert Fenton, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA is doubling the testing supplies it plans to ship to Arizona.

Patrick Friday, a United Methodist minister in Alabama, went to several hospitals and clinics in Birmingham this week to get checked after his school-age son tested positive. But he was told that unless he had a preexisting condition, he didn’t qualify.

Finally, he ended up at a site offering rapid-result tests and his negative result came back quickly.

""We are several months into this,"" he said. ""How can it be that we can’t go in and get a test?""

""Unfortunately, as we don't anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,"" Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect on July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

Winnipeg to Churchill is the sole route in service, according to Via Rail's website, which was last updated June 26.

Several routes have partially resumed, while Toronto to Niagara Falls, Toronto to Vancouver, and Montreal to Halifax remain interrupted with all trains cancelled. Some of those routes are slated to resume service Nov. 1.

Via Rail said it plans to bring back employees ""as soon as the customer demand allows it.""

The passenger rail service has faced a rough year with rail blockades impacting service earlier in 2020.

""The current year has been filled with unprecedented challenges,"" said Garneau.

The company temporarily laid off roughly the same number of employees in B.C. and Ontario during rail blockades in the winter. The company said in March that most of those employees would be brought back early that month.

Some routes in those provinces were halted when protests in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation blocked railways across Canada.

Morneau delivered a ""snapshot"" of the federal finances Wednesday, for the first time since the pandemic brought much of Canada's economy to its knees.

article continues below

In the update, he said the government is well aware some segments of the population are hurting more than others.

""This crisis has exposed and amplified many inequalities in Canada,"" Morneau said.

The same people have in many cases also been affected more by the virus itself, in part because women, new immigrants, racialized Canadians and Indigenous people are more likely to work in the jobs where contagion is a risk, such as health care, retail and warehouse work.

The documents are careful to note that while racialized Canadians are more likely to work in economic sectors hit hard by the virus — including health care, accommodation and food services — little data has been collected to truly understand the impact on visible minorities and other marginalized communities.

So for example, there is no racial breakdown of who applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Nor has much data been collected on the ethnicities of people diagnosed with COVID-19. One recent report from Ottawa Public Health said two-thirds of cases over the previous six weeks in its territory were racialized Canadians or new immigrants, but that report was limited in scope and for just one city.

The fiscal snapshot shows women, youth, low-wage workers, racialized Canadians, Indigenous people and new immigrants all saw higher rates of job loss or reduced working hours, and are also seeing slow, and in some cases no, benefits as the economy begins to recover.

Jobs in sectors dominated by men, such as construction and manufacturing, were faster to come back than those in service industries, tourism, and accommodation, where women and immigrants tend to be employed in bigger proportion.

New Canadians in particular have seen very little job recovery thus far, the report says.

Businesses owned by women and racialized Canadians were more likely to report declines in orders and clients, and a higher need for rent relief.

Women were also hit harder by the closing of schools and daycares, with women who have kids under the age of six reporting significantly larger declines in hours worked than women with no children or older ones.

""Going forward, anything we do must be about growth, resilience, and creating opportunity for those who were most impacted by this crisis,"" said Morneau.

""This pandemic has identified clear gaps and it’s giving us a chance to reset.""

Exactly how he plans to do that is not clear. The government has said some of the $14-billion aid package offered to provinces to help them safely reopen their economies needs to include child care investments.

""We've been very clear that having access to child care is going to be critically important for us to get back to work,"" Morneau said in a news conference with reporters. ""Women have been harder hit through the course of this pandemic and our measures therefore need to consider that challenge.""

But a month after Ottawa put the $14 billion on the table, the provinces have not yet accepted Ottawa's requirements for getting access to that money.

There is also little information about how the government intends to try to level the economic playing field so the gaps that led to inequalities going into the pandemic are closed.

Morneau said for now the government is focused on the safe restart of the economy and the longer-term recovery plan is still in development.

Green MP Elizabeth May said governments have to make child care and safe school reopenings a bigger priority because without those things, parents — and most often mothers — are not going to be able to return to work.

""We know that's an economic blow we can't risk and we know that's a step back for women's rights we can't accept,"" she said.

May said the snapshot was ""exception"" for the depth of its gender-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on women. She said the answer to stopping the damage is three things: ""Child care, child care, child care.""

“The court has gradually resumed some regular operations, including trials, chambers applications and other hearings and conferences, many of which proceed remotely,” B.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Christopher Hinkson said in a July 7 directive.

“While the court has expanded the scope of its in-person operations, counsel, parties, litigants and members of the public are discouraged from attending courthouses unless their personal attendance is necessary or the court so directs,” he said.

B.C. Court of Appeal

In B.C.’s high court, the suspension of service and filing deadlines for existing appeals and chambers applications started March 18 and has been extended to July 27. As of July 14, parties may now request that appeal hearings proceed in a courtroom or by Zoom videoconference.

The court registry is accepting filings in all matters. In civil appeals, electronic filing remains mandatory for lawyers and optional for self-represented litigants.

The time periods for filing cases remains suspended.

“You can wait without concern that the limitation period to start civil or family proceedings will expire,” a July 7 directive from Chief Justice Robert Bauman said.

“Persons in the courtroom are not required to wear masks, but everyone may of course do so, except when addressing the Court at the hearing,” Bauman said. “Counsel/litigants must bring their own water supply and present their arguments from their own table (individual lecterns will be provided). Furniture will be cleaned and disinfected between hearings.”



B.C. Supreme Court

Effective July 13, in-person registry services will resume at all Supreme Court registries and the interim process for requesting a hearing of an urgent or essential matter will no longer be available, Hinkson said.

In criminal matters, bail and bail review hearings, detention review hearings, regular fix-date appearances and regular pre-trial conferences, COVID pre-trial conferences and case management conferences will continue by phone, a directive from Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes said.

Those using registries are recommended to continue using electronic, mail or fax filings where possible.

For family law matters, parties are no longer automatically relieved of the requirement to attend a judicial case conference before making an application by written submissions but that can still be done via phone.

Judicial case conferences already scheduled to occur on or after June 1 will resume by phone.

Civil and family trials scheduled to begin on or after June 8 have resumed unless otherwise directed.

“The resumption of civil and family trials may be subject to change as a result of limitations on available facilities or public health recommendations,” Hinkson said.

Jury selections remain cancelled until September. In civil cases where a jury notice has been filed and served, if all parties consent to proceeding by judge alone, they may seek such an order at a trial management conference.

Effective April 15, a ministerial order suspended limitation periods and mandatory time periods for the commencement of a civil or family proceedings from March 18, 2020 to the date on which the last extension of the declaration of the state of emergency.

“Once this suspension is lifted, more directions will be provided by the court,” Hinkson said.



B.C. Provincial Court

Chief Judge Melissa Gillespie announced July 8, provincial court would return to receiving all filings at the applicable court registry either in-person or remotely.

The provincial court had already begun re-opening June 15 courtrooms on a limited basis outside hub centres of Surrey, Vancouver Victoria, Prince George, and Kelowna where limited in-person hearings began a week earlier.

As of July 8, 2020, registries will accept all family cases filings. Small claims filings will be accepted July 13 while urgent small claims matters will only be heard by telephone.

Among the student-volunteer positions advertised as available on the I Want to Help website are 1,500 spots with YMCA Canada to help create online exercise regimes for kids and seniors in their communities.

article continues below

Yet the YMCA says those positions were actually the brainchild of WE Charity, the organization originally tapped by the Liberal government to administer the Canada Student Services Grant, and that the YMCA never agreed to them.

Both the YMCA and WE blame a miscommunication as WE scrambled to get the grant program — through which students can get up to $5,000 toward their schooling if they volunteer the maximum 500 hours — up and running as quickly as possible.

WE has since withdrawn from running the program.

In an interview, YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said his organization proposed hosting 391 volunteers through dozens of YMCA locations. They would focus on three areas: helping local branches with marketing and website design; data analysis; and assisting seniors with tech questions.

The YMCA arrived at the number after reaching out to branches across the country, Dinsdale said, after which the national office drew up a draft memorandum of understanding with WE to formalize the arrangement.

""We sent a draft in and they sent a draft back and that's when we saw these other positions and we asked to separate them,"" he said of the 1,500 positions for online exercise regimes. ""And they said great. And we haven't heard from them since all this has gone down.""

""These discussions (with the YMCA) took place quickly, given our short timeline for delivery, and some confusion arose around the two separate agreements,"" WE said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

""That confusion contributed to a misunderstanding on our part which led to one group of service positions being posted, rather than the other group of service positions.""

It nonetheless means those advertised positions are not actually available.

The status of thousands of other positions apparently created by WE to meet the requirements of the volunteer program remains uncertain.

Youth Minister Bardish Chagger's spokeswoman Danielle Keenan stood by the Canada Student Services Grant program on Wednesday, saying that while there will be delays in its rollout following WE's departure, the government remains committed to it.

""The Canada Student Service Grants program provides opportunities for students who want to help with their communities COVID-19 response,"" Keenan said in an email to The Canadian Press.

""Although the delivery of the program will change, our objective has not changed which is to ensure students, not-for-profits, and communities are supported throughout the pandemic.""

WE and the Liberal government announced last week that they were ending a sole-sourced contract to have the charity manage the grant program after questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the organization.

Dinsdale said the YMCA did not know the 1,500 positions had been posted, noting the agreement with WE was never signed. At the same time, the 391 positions that the YMCA does want to fill have yet to be advertised. Dinsdale said the YMCA is waiting to hear from the government on those.

""The 391 that we're actually putting forward, our Ys are ready and willing to engage in it and there are some really interesting opportunities that could exist for youth and our YMCAs and communities,"" he said. ""So we're certainly hopeful those go ahead.""

Thousands of other positions posted on the federal website involve the creation of online content or the mentoring of other students on such topics as COVID-19's impact on the environment, nutrition and cyberbullying.

Some of those are posted in huge batches, such as a call for 1,000 volunteers to be trained to hold one-to-one sessions with people on ""the impact of COVID-19 on food security in your community.""

Another seeks 1,250 volunteers to devise ""social-media assets"" such as captions, memes and videos, for local and regional awareness campaigns to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

None of those postings includes the name of a hosting organization: they're listed as ""supporting local non-profits in your community"" rather than with a specific agency.

WE did indicate that it was behind many of them as it sought to meet the government's requirement that in order to be eligible for the student grant, positions must be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The purpose of the CSSG was to engage tens of thousands of post-secondary students in service programs to assist with the impact of COVID-19,"" WE said in its statement.

""COVID-19 has been in Canada for a relatively short period of time and there are limited new service opportunities related to addressing (it). This is partly why WE was brought in (to) develop and co-ordinate service roles that fulfil the program guidelines and deliver a meaningful impact.""

Employment and Social Development Canada, which will now administer the grant program instead of WE, did not respond to repeated questions about the positions, including whether they would move ahead or not.

Conservative employment critic Dan Albas said the questions about the federal website underscore the need for answers when it comes to the student grant program, including how positions have been chosen or created and what benefit they are expected to have.

""To find out that perhaps hundreds of positions have been put forward and in good faith maybe people have applied for those positions without having a correction from the government?"" he said.

""This is public money. They need to come clean and clean up this program so that any dollar that is spent gets the maximum opportunities for young people and value for money for taxpayer dollars.""

The service industry — which includes businesses such as hair salons, schools, hospitals, gyms, hotels and restaurants — have racked up 104 orders out of 334 issued to up to July 3.

The next most common industry to receive an order as of July 3, is the manufacturing sector, which includes meat processing plants, which have been hard hit by COVID-19, including a poultry plant in Coquitlam, as well as breweries, sawmills and pharmaceuticals.

In mid-May, an outbreak at Superior Poultry was declared over, and the plant allowed to re-open after instituting safety protocols.

Still, WorkSafeBC reports that most employers are doing their due diligence when it comes to meeting industry-specific guidelines.

However, when employers aren’t taking measures to protect workers from COVID-19 exposure, they could be issued an order for health or safety violations.

For the most part, though, employers have been taking the proper steps to re-open their businesses safely during the provincial re-start plan.

“Overall, the vast majority of employers are taking health and safety very seriously during the re-opening. Our inspections are finding that businesses want to be in compliance, and our prevention officers are providing support to help them have an effective COVID-19 Safety Plan,” stated Ivy Yuen, media relations representative in an email to The Tri-City News.

Data is not broken down regionally, so it is difficult to ascertain how many Tri-City businesses were given an order to beef up health and safety protocols.

Since, June 26, WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 12,000 worksite inspections in B.C. related to COVID-19.

The focus of these inspections has been to ensure employers have a COVID-19 Safety Plan in place, according to Yuen, who noted: “This plan needs to assess the risks to workers, and implement measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace.”

Orders are usually issued as a result of an inspection or can be part of a follow-up activity.

Data posted by WorkPlace BC online shows that employers have a lot of questions about how to manage in the new pandemic reality. In recent weeks, it has has fielded 9,823 questions, 1,728 reports of potential violations and 21 workplace incidents.

There have also been 12,646 inspections, with the large service sector receiving the most at 4,615, followed by 2,988 for trade-related businesses, which includes supermarkets, retail stores and gas stations, 1,256 for the manufacturing sector, 886 for primary resource companies, such as oil and gas, 234 for transportation and warehousing, and 180 for the public sector, including government and law enforcement.

Other industries are being ordered to improve their safety protocols, according to the data.

The surge in June ended a streak of three months when recreational rounds played in Canada dropped precipitously due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As restrictions were lifted across the country in May, the number of scores registered increased.

In May, 165,026 rounds were registered between the 1st and the 15th but 265,480 scores were submitted in the final two weeks of that month. The May 1-15 numbers are a nearly 40 per cent drop from the same period in 2019 (211,809) but the May 16-30 numbers are just five per cent lower than last year (269,266).

Helmer said he expects the number of rounds submitted to Golf Canada to continue to climb through July and into August.

""We've heard anecdotally that a lot of newcomers have joined the sport, especially now that school is done we're going to see an increase in juniors too. We think the trend is going to continue,"" said Helmer. ""Golf has seen a pretty big lift and it's emerged as the sport of the summer.""

The upward trend comes even as Golf Canada had to cancel all of its amateur and professional championships due to travel restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A shift in how scores are registered has also been seen, with most recreational players entering their scores online instead of in the course's clubhouse or pro shop, which have largely been closed this summer because of physical distancing protocols.

Golf Canada plans to launch an updated version of its scoring app later this month, helping to keep players physically distant and improve their game.

He cautioned Wednesday (July 8) some “hotspots” still remain in long-term care and some agricultural setting.

The prime minister made the comments in a media briefing ahead of a scheduled fiscal update — or “snapshot” — from Finance Minister Bill Morneau later in the day.

Trudeau said he would leave the details of the snapshot to his finance minister, but added it was imperative for the federal government to have acted right from the outset of the COVID-19 crisis.

“The cost of doing nothing would have been far more,” he said, adding the pandemic has not been a time for “belt-tightening.”

He said the country has been able to slow down progression of the novel coronavirus significantly and parts of the economy have since been able to reopen.

Trudeau repeatedly touted the nation’s historically low interest rates, which he said would help pay off the accumulated debt.

“If the federal government hadn’t taken on significant debt in order to send money to Canadians to support businesses and households, what would Canadians have done?” he asked.

“They would have loaded up their credit cards, they would have scrambled to try and find ways to pay their bills, pay their groceries and figure out how to care for their loved ones.”

The prime minister said he’s confident about the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has included hundreds of billions in spending, because of the reduced spread of COVID-19 over the past four months.

“This recession is very different from the last recession,” Trudeau said, adding the 2020 economic problems are related to a health crisis.

“There are going to be really important discussions and political debates about what our economy looks like in the coming years.”

He stated earlier in the briefing that his government was also at work at addressing racial injustices that have been brought to the forefront of conversation following the death of unarmed Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.

Trudeau said fighting discrimination is a top priority and mentioned the need for more capital to help fund racialized entrepreneurs.

The prime minister also faced questions on his involvement in the government’s decision to award the handling of $900-million student grant program to the WE Charity, which has longstanding ties to Trudeau and his family.

“The recommendation to use WE to get opportunities out for young people was made by the public service, but as a cabinet we ratify those decisions,” Trudeau said, adding he did not recuse himself from any cabinet decisions related to the charity.

“I love long worked on youth issues both before I got into politics and since I’ve been in politics.”

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador are meeting in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to recognize the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaces NAFTA.

Trudeau had earlier declined the invite from Trump but he was quick to reiterate his concerns over the potential for the Americans to reintroduce aluminum tariffs on Canada.

He once again said the U.S. does not produce enough aluminum to fulfill domestic manufacturing needs and any tariffs against Canada imposed by the Americans would hurt the U.S. economy by adding additional costs to customers.

Trump originally hit Canada with aluminum tariffs in 2018, citing national security concerns.

Most recently, she worked full time as a server at the Chateau Victoria Hotel’s Vista 18 restaurant for two years before being laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 17.

article continues below

“Growing up in Victoria where the hospitality sector is such an important part of our economy, I always thought that this would be a safe industry to work in,” she said Tuesday during a rally for hotel workers at the legislature. “As long as I worked hard and provided good service, I never worried about the insecurity of losing my job, until now.

“Since being laid off I constantly teeter on what tomorrow’s going to look like with financial burdens and obviously emotionally it’s impacted me heavily, as well.”

Only a few people have been called back to work at Chateau Victoria since the pandemic started, Spiteri said.

“And there’s no word on when the rest of us are going to be brought back to the hotel.”

Spiteri was among about 60 people demonstrating for a legal right to return to their jobs as the recovery from COVID continues. Participants were from Victoria, Vancouver and other parts of the Lower Mainland.

Spiteri said the level of insecurity she is feeling is “overwhelming.”

“I’ve been on [Employment Insurance] for a really, really long time and at this point I’m barely scraping by.”

The industry will eventually improve, she said. “Why won’t the industry promise to bring us back? Why won’t the government make that guarantee for us?”

Spiteri said she and other hotel workers at the rally have built careers in the hospitality industry.

“These aren’t just jobs, they’re a vital part of B.C.’s economy.”

Unite Here Local 40 organized the rally. The union has 6,000 members in B.C., including 500 in the capital region working at establishments such as the Chateau Victoria Hotel and Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina, said Stephanie Fung, union spokesperson. They are among more than 50,000 hotel workers in B.C.

The B.C. Hotel Association is seeking support from all levels of government to keep its businesses — and its jobs — alive, at a time when hotels are not profitable, even if many are open.

Ingrid Jarrett, hotel association chief executive, said it is critical that province extend the temporary layoff provision past the Aug. 30 end date and for the federal government to extend the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit in tandem. It proposes that those supports last until the sector regains 70 per cent of its historic revenues.

The association wants B.C. to allow municipalities to grant property tax relief for hotels.

Without this kind of help, Jarrett predicts a third of B.C.’s hotels could shut down.

“It is a very, very dire time and we have very limited confidence that the summer is actually going to allow many of the businesses to survive.”

B.C. has 83,000 hotel rooms in 1,252 hotels. Of those hotels, 25 per cent remain closed, she said. Those that are open are running at about 30 per cent capacity.

More than 80 per cent of hotels in B.C. are small and medium-sized businesses, she said.

Jarrett would like to see B.C. opened to travellers from elsewhere in Canada this summer.

The association is proposing that B.C. allow meetings and conferences, possibility by fall. They would follow health and safety protocols, and allow attendees from elsewhere in Canada and from international locations where the infection rate is low.

Frank Bourree, tourism consultant and vice-chair of the South Island Prosperity Partnership, pointed to the relationship between jobs and a healthy industry.

“The problem is that very few tourism businesses are going to be up to full capacity in order to bring everybody back, even through the fall. So is there even a job for them to come back to?

“I think it is great that they [workers] are bringing profile to the loss of tourism jobs here but there has to be an employer there to employ them. And the industry is really precarious right now.”

Employees need to be supported until their jobs come back, Bourree said.

Another key factor is that when the temporary layoff period winds up, employers have to pay severance. “For the employers, if they’ve got a huge severance hit, that might push them right over the edge into bankruptcy,” Bourree said.

Tourism represents 10 per cent of the employment base in the capital region, Bourree said.

Greater Victoria hotels are running at about 25 per cent occupancy, down from 80 per cent a year ago, he said.

“Nobody believes that we are going to see international travel into B.C. for the balance of this year.”

Even when a hotel is open, it is unlikely to be profitable, Bourree said. Most open hotels are operating on a “shoestring,” he said.

The challenge locally and within the rest of the province, is that B.C. visitors stay on the weekends and not during the week, meaning the industry is not filling enough rooms. Travellers from elsewhere in Canada and internationally typically stay long and stay during the week, Bourree said.

It’s easy for Canadians to look southward and shake their heads in bemused smugness at the daily penchant of Americans to indulge in conspiracy theories and demonizing of disfavoured segments of society.



But I’m getting a whiff of that attitude here in Canada now. It serves as a reminder how easily irrationality and fear can spark reactions leading to full-blown witch hunts and targeting of the “others.”

The past few days I’ve seen multiple news reports of people reporting cars with U.S. plates. For some, the immediate reaction was to assume the owners of those cars have no right to be where they are, and then make the irrational link that anyone who comes from the U.S. must be dripping with coronavirus that will spread to anything they touch.

article continues below

These fears were stoked by some unfortunate remarks by the premier, which were fortunately walked back by more measured remarks by Dr. Bonnie Henry.

This jump to conclusions affects me personally. Last month, my wife and I moved to Victoria from California. It is a move we have planned for five years and was irretrievably set in motion a year before anyone ever heard of the novel coronavirus.

But now that we are here — thoroughly inspected and interrogated by both CBSA and provincial health officials at the border and after completing our 14-day isolation (which confirmed our symptom-free condition during the three months of lockdown in California) — we are now faced with a very un-Canadian attitude of guilt-by-association for anyone whose car (as does ours) bears U.S. plates.

Leave aside the fact that COVID-19 spreads generally by transmission of fluids during close (usually confined, indoor) contact with someone else; leave aside the fact that wearing a mask and keeping distance are the two most effective ways to avoid transmission, wherever the suspected carrier hails from; leave aside the fact that the incidence of mask-wearing in B.C. seems far below what my wife and I expected and practise ourselves.

The mere fact someone belongs to a “suspect group” (owners of cars with U.S. plates) does not make them public-health pariahs; that is the heart of the conspiracy-driven, fear-mongering in the U.S. we Canadians rightfully disparage.

The news reports invariably actually talk with the car owners and discover that they are here legitimately.

But they fear reprisal from the unthinking, who are quick to grab their pitchfork and call for a witch-burning.

I know my wife and I are concerned about that as well, wondering if our car will be keyed by some anonymous COVID-19 vigilante; that’s why I ask my name not be reproduced with this letter.

While we all need to remain vigilant and compliant in fighting the pandemic, turning on superficial scapegoats without knowing their full story is no solution and just imports northward a different epidemic we should work equally hard to keep out.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams' exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

article continues below

""The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,"" Bogoch said during a telephone interview. ""There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there's going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

""The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they'll have to sit down collectively and decide, 'Is this worthwhile.' As individuals they'll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, 'Am I willing to play?'""

The CFL and CFL Players' Association continue to discuss amendments to their current collective bargaining agreement that would allow for a partial '20 season. The earliest action would begin is September, but commissioner Randy Ambrosie has said a cancelled campaign also remains possible.

In March, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a global shutdown of sports. In Europe, pro soccer has resumed while domestically Major League Soccer, Major League Baseball, the NHL and NBA are all attempting to either restart or open their seasons.

But it hasn't been easy as all four North American circuits have had players or team officials contract the virus. FC Dallas was forced to withdraw from the MLS is Back Tournament in Orlando after 10 players and one coach tested positive.

The NHL hopes to open training camps Monday and resume play in Edmonton and Toronto on Aug. 1. Players would stay in tightly controlled bubbles and play games without fans.

Teams can bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to their hub. Everyone in the bubble will be tested daily — including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers.

Players and team officials will remain inside the bubble except in specific extenuating circumstances. That includes medical attention, the birth of a child or death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games due to a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

However, perhaps the biggest challenge the CFL faces is a financial hurdle. Unlike other major sports entities, it doesn't have a billion-dollar TV deal and thus isn't flush with money.

Ambrosie has stated often the nine-team CFL collectively lost $20 million last year. That hardly puts it in an ideal position to cover food and lodging costs for its teams as well as daily testing.

Bogoch said regardless of the measures taken in a hub or bubble, positive test results are inevitable.

""Oh, 100 per cent and there already have been,"" he said. ""If they do proceed, I think the leagues and fans should be aware that anything can happen.

""The leagues could come to a halt should there be an outbreak or safety concern, individuals or teams might be pulled out. Quite frankly, as much as we want to have high expectations we should really lower them. We're in the COVID-19 era, anything can happen.""

No league has said a specific number of positive tests will result in the cancellation of games.

Bogoch said hubs and bubbles are beneficial. With the exception of baseball, the other three North American leagues are going with hub plans.

""First, they reduce the probability of introducing infection within the bubble,"" he said. ""If (infection) is introduced, it really reduces the probability that it can be transmitted.

""If there's infection it will hopefully be rapidly identified because of the high frequency of diagnostic testing and symptom checks. Now, the best-laid plans can still have holes in them but what we've seen with basketball and soccer is these plans work in that they've identified positive cases and players have been isolated. That tells me the safety mechanisms are working and that's fantastic.""

But the mounting positive tests have prompted many to question sport's return before the discovery of a suitable vaccine.

""The key is ensuring if you're going to play pro sports, you're doing it in a safe and ethical manner,"" he said. ""Safety really means player safety, safety of the auxiliary personnel but also public safety as well.

""Ethical manner means you're not drawing resources away from the community in which you're playing. Can that occur while there's still an ongoing push to ensure safety across the country and develop a vaccine and develop programs? I personally think if it's carefully planned out, they can both be done very well.""

Bogoch, a Calgary native, is a recreational hockey player in his spare time. But he also watches at least two CFL games each year: The Labour Day Classic between the Calgary Stampeders and arch-rival Edmonton Eskimos; and Grey Cup.

""That (Labour Day game) is just ingrained in my DNA,"" he said with a chuckle. ""The Labour Day Classic is so quintessential Alberta, it's wonderful.

""There's something so Canadian about (the Grey Cup), it's 40 below in a blizzard and the guys are out on the field. It's just wild.""

While Bogoch appreciates sport isn't a priority for some, he said it can definitely provide a boost for others during a pandemic.

""When we step back and think about what's been happening the last six months and especially since our lockdown in March and throughout our gradual reopening, people have taken a tremendous hit,"" he said. ""We've taken financial hits . . . we've taken emotional and psychological hits by staying at home.

""While some people might say (sport) isn't an essential service and they're correct, I think we can also say professional and amateur sports and other forms of entertainment like the arts are extremely important to the psychological and emotional well-being of our society. This may help provide some intangible benefits as well.""

Mercifully, Bogoch sees light at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic tunnel.

""I think we'll gradually see this start to wind down as vaccines are developed and rolled out globally,"" he said. ""In the best-case scenario it could be as early as late 2020 . . . but more realistically needles will start going into arms in 2021.

""I think the key word there is globally because if there's an infection in one part of the world, there's a problem in all parts of the world. This thing is pretty contagious and people are mobile so we need this vaccine deployed on a global level.""

The economic and fiscal ""snapshot"" from the government today lays out the Liberals' belief that there will be a slow return to a new normal, with unemployment high and economic growth low through to at least the end of 2021.

article continues below

Even though the government believes the worst of the economic harm from the pandemic is behind the country, the document says a recovery can't begin in earnest until an effective vaccine or treatment becomes widely available.

Things could, however, get worse under two alternative scenarios the Finance Department lays out.

Should prolonged shutdowns stay in place, or restrictions not fully roll back, a return to normal activity for households and businesses will be uneven and slower than hoped for, leading to a more pronounced drop in economic output than is already expected.

And should the country be hit with a second wave of the novel coronavirus during the annual flu season, the ensuing lockdowns would cause what the Finance Department describes as a ""deeper and longer-lasting negative impact on the economy.""

The Liberals have repeatedly promised to use the federal treasury as a financial shield between Canadians and irreparable harm, and the cost of that promise is now at $231.9 billion in direct spending and a deficit comparable only to those seen in the Second World War.

Whatever the costs, they're worth it, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference Wednesday morning, before the snapshot was released.

""As we measure the cost of helping Canadians, we shouldn't forget that the cost of doing nothing would have been far more,"" Trudeau said, insisting that this is not the time for belt-tightening or austerity.

The document tries to make that case, saying that the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which had paid out $53.5 billion in benefits as of late June, has covered Canadians' estimated $44.6 billion in lost labour income through the first half of the year.

The $2,000-a-month benefit is estimated to have covered the monthly housing, food, phone and internet costs for the bottom and middle thirds of households, according to Finance Department calculations.

Historically low interest rates mean all the hundreds of billions in borrowing comes with ""manageable"" costs, Trudeau said, and the alternative would be for individuals and households to load up with debt themselves to cope with months of no or little work.

Adding to the deficit is a $37.3 billion boost to the federal wage subsidy program to bring its budget to $82.3 billion, signalling an expansion and coming changes to the benefit that covers up to 75 per cent of wages to a maximum of $847 a week for eligible companies.

The Liberals expect more workers to move onto the wage subsidy and off the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as that $80-billion program winds down.

Those who fall through the COVID-19 financial safety net are expected to be caught by the employment insurance system that has been largely dormant since the CERB replaced it in late March.

Government officials admit there will still need to be policy changes to the EI system to help some self-employed workers qualify, and capture EI-eligible workers who, due to the pandemic, haven't been able to work the necessary qualifying hours.

For this calendar year, the government expects the unemployment rate to hit 9.8 per cent, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Although that's a bump from the record-high unemployment rate of 13.7 per cent in May for a labour force of just over 19 million, it is still almost double the record low of 5.5 per cent pre-pandemic.

The document doesn't contain the five-year forecast traditionally part of federal budgets owing to the uncertain path the pandemic will take and the state of the economy beyond that.

""Even when the pandemic is over, lasting consequences may cast a long-term shadow over economic developments, for example via more indebted businesses and households, persistent unemployment and substantial structural changes in the economy that have been accelerated through the crisis,"" the government's update says.

""In the coming months and as needed the government will announce measures to support the recovery.""

Opposition parties had wanted Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

In his own morning news conference, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said the Liberals mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic by being slow to close borders and by instituting too-rigid emergency aid programs.

Canada can't afford for the Liberals to mishandle the economy as well, he said, by keeping benefits in place that remove incentives to go back to work while the novel coronavirus remains a risk.

""Liberals put all their faith in government, Conservatives put our faith in people,"" Scheer said.

He said the Liberals should take up a Conservative proposal to offer a ""back to work bonus"" and send more money to the federal auditor general so her office can study the government's spending more closely.

Next week, the Bank of Canada is to again update its forecasts when it releases a monetary policy report along with a scheduled interest-rate announcement.

Last month, the central bank said it expected a decline between 10 and 20 per cent in the second quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. That is an improvement from the 15-to-30-per-cent drop in the quarter highlighted in the bank's worst-case scenario in April.

There were no new deaths and there remain 16 people in hospital, with four of those in intensive care units.

That makes 2,990 people who have tested positive for the virus that has caused a global pandemic since COVID-19 first appeared in B.C. in late January.

Of those, 183 people have died, 2,645 people have recovered and 162 people are still battling the disease. Most infected patients are self-isolating at home.

The breakdown of all COVID-19 infections by health region is:

• 1,013 in Vancouver Coastal Health;

• 1,576 in Fraser Health;

• 133 in Island Health;

• 203 in Interior Health; and

• 65 in Northern Health.

""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has now been declared over,"" B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement on July 7.

Two seniors' long-term care facilities have outbreaks: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility and Maple Hill long-term care facility. There also remains an outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital, which spawned the outbreaks at Tabor and at Maple Hill, when infected patients were transferred to those homes from the hospital.

""While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community,"" Dix and Henry said.

""There has been a new community exposure event at Hotel Belmont bar and nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on June 27 and June 29.""

B.C. is estimated to have a population of about 5,190,000 people so it has so far had about one case of COVID-19 for every 1,735 residents, or 0.576 people per 1,000 residents. That compares with Washington State's estimated population of 7,615,000 people and 36,970 cases, for about one case of COVID-19 for every 206 people, or 4.85 people per 1,000 residents.

B.C.'s death rate, however, at more than 6.1%, is slightly higher than other jurisdictions.

Washington State, with 1,384 deaths, has a 3.7% death rate for COVID-19 patients.

Johns Hopkins University's Centre for Systems Science and Engineering has recorded 11,712,663 COVID-19 cases and 540,582 deaths globally, for a death rate of slightly more than 4.6%.

The record high of 10,028 new cases in Texas served as another alarming new measure of the swift resurgence of COVID-19 nationwide and the failures of the country’s response. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas aggressively began one of America’s fastest reopenings in May but has begun reversing course in recent weeks, ordering bars closed and mandating face coverings.

article continues below

New York and Florida are the only other states to record more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. New York hit that grim total back in April, when New York City hospitals were overwhelmed and hundreds of people were dying every day. Florida topped 10,000 confirmed cases last week.

The record mark in Texas partly reflects a lag in testing results from the Fourth of July weekend, when newly reported cases were far below what Texas has seen in recent weeks. But Abbott said the numbers should still be ""an alarm bell for everybody"" who is skeptical about whether the virus is a threat.

""We have rapid spread of COVID-19 in the state of Texas right now,"" Abbott told San Antonio television station KENS.

Later in the interview, Abbott was noncommittal about whether he would attend his own party's convention next week in Houston, which the Texas GOP has remained bent on holding even as the mayor, doctors and businesses pressure the party to cancel. Houston has emerged as one of the nation's hot zones in the pandemic. However, Republican activists, some of whom have called the fears overblown, have resolved to press forward with the indoor three-day convention.

Texas surged past 8,000 statewide hospitalizations for the first time over the long holiday weekend — a more than quadruple increase on the past month. On Tuesday, the number of hospitalizations soared past 9,000. Texas also set a new high for deaths in a single day with 60.

Mayors in some of the biggest cities in the state and U.S. — including Austin, San Antonio and Houston — have warned that hospitals could soon become overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Along the Texas-Mexico border, some cities imposed curfew orders in hopes of cutting down on large parties or social gatherings as cases have skyrocketed.

""Many of us are running at capacity and have created new wards,"" said Todd Mann, the chief executive officer at McAllen Medical Center, which on Tuesday had more than 130 coronavirus patients taking up more than half of the facility's beds. ""The physical space is obviously limited, and most of the hospitals are running out of that pretty quickly.""

The record count was reported on a day that also saw the State Fair of Texas cancelled for the the first time since World War II. Fair organizers said the event, which draws more than a million visitors to Dallas each fall, was not feasible during the pandemic.

It also came as President Donald Trump leaned on governors to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons. Texas education officials announced Tuesday that face coverings will be mandatory for students older than 10 years old and that school districts must offer on-campus learning to any family that wants their child in a classroom.

Deaths remain lower in Texas compared to other big states. As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed that at least 2,715 people have died due to COVID-19. But fatalities have climbed in recent days, and in addition to an alarming acceleration in new cases in Texas, the seven-day infection rate has climbed to 13.5%.

The number of infections is likely far higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip.

A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

Face masks will be offered to people visiting centres in provinces or municipalities that have mandated their use in indoor public spaces.

Anyone going to a centre that doesn't fall under any such provincial or municipal requirement will be encouraged to wear a masks and use hand-sanitizer.

While the newly reopened centres will handle queries for social insurance numbers, employment insurance and the Canada Pension Plan among others, the government says passport and biometrics services won't be available at first.

Days after public health authorities closed businesses and ordered workers to stay home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Liberals closed the sprawling network of Service Canada centres.

Some of the offices, such as one tucked inside Ottawa's city hall, had already started to close before the official announcement in March as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased and workers were needed elsewhere, or resisted going in.

The government says an online Service Canada portal opened in response to the closures has seen more than 700,000 requests. That's about half the number of in-person visits Service Canada locations would see in the same period in normal times.

In a release, the government is still urging Canadians to use online services wherever possible, including to book appointments online for in-person help.

The network of 318 Service Canada centres, along with almost 250 more outreach centres, received about 8.4 million visits during the 12-month period between April 2018 and March 2019. The figure, noted in a recently posted evaluation of federal services, included over 1.9 million people walking in to use a self-service kiosk.

Central 1 says it expects home sales to recover marginally in 2020 and 2021 after tumbling by 55 per cent between mid-March and April.

article continues below

Deputy chief economist Brian Yu says despite values plunging to levels not seen since the early 1980s, home prices have stayed firm because fewer properties were available for sale.

He predicts median prices could rebound to about $710,000 before slipping to around $540,000 late this year or early in 2021.

Yu says unemployment, business and health concerns will further weaken the market, while population growth, which has traditionally propped up the sector in B.C., will slow to a trickle next year, dampening sales.

He says a second wave of COVID-19 has the potential to shave home prices by 15 per cent as more owners already hit by the pandemic's first wave are forced to sell during a second downturn.

The report released Tuesday notes positive developments as B.C. enters the third phase of its recovery plan including restarts in the accommodation, spa, film and television industries.

Vacancy rates could also climb as high as three per cent over the next year, writes Yu, ""providing an opportune time for renters to negotiate rental rates before the market tightens up again.""

Housing starts are forecast to slump 33 per cent in 2020 and remain flat in 2021, which ""set the stage for a housing supply shortage in coming years,"" the report says.

The timing of a second wave and its impact on the economy would draw out the effect on the housing market, potentially carrying into 2022, it says.

Summer is officially here, with sunny weather, full ferries, and a few statutory holidays thrown in for good measure. As much as it feels like the perfect time to relax and have fun, please continue taking every measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak on the Coast. We don’t have to look very far south to see what can happen if we are not careful, and we need to keep working together to keep our community safe.

While there have been some welcome changes with Phase 3 of our provincial Restart Plan, it is important to remember that all of the other personal and business recommendations from Phase 2 remain in place. Phase 3 is not a return to normal and we should all continue to act as though COVID-19 is still here.

This means that businesses should be following Public Health and Worksafe BC guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers. This includes limiting the number of people on premises at any one time, ensuring adequate spacing, and the use of masks and barriers when physical spacing is not possible. Please respect our businesses who are doing their very best to ensure the safety of everyone who enters.

In our local health-care facilities, visitors are allowed, but are restricted to essential visits only. For the hospital, each patient may have one visitor at a time for a maximum of two hours per visitor. For our long-term care facilities, residents may have one designated person who is able to visit. Virtual visits are allowed at all facilities, and tablets are available for residents and patients who do not have access otherwise.

For individuals, our recommendations remain the same:

• Maintain physical distancing with people outside of your household (or your very limited family/friend bubble), and wear a mask whenever you can’t maintain a distance of at least two metres.

• Wash your hands frequently, especially after touching high contact surfaces.

Do not touch your face unless you have just washed your hands, and make sure you wash your hands after touching your face.

• Avoid large groups if you can, especially indoors. If you do meet up with others, please meet up outside whenever possible and maintain physical distancing.

• Exercise extra caution if you are older and have high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or other significant health issues.

If you do develop new cold or flu symptoms (no matter how mild), please stay home and self-isolate until you have been assessed. Do not go to work. Do not go shopping. Do not meet up with others. Do call your family doctor or the Respiratory Assessment Clinic (Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) to arrange for further assessment and testing, if indicated. The Respiratory Assessment Clinic can be reached by phone or text at 604-740-1252 or by email at coastrespclinic@gmail.com.

We continue to test everyone with possible COVID-19 symptoms, so please do not hesitate to call if you become ill. If you have more severe symptoms and believe you may need to be admitted to hospital, please go to the Sechelt Hospital Emergency Department. If you need an ambulance, please call 911. The Emergency Department is open and safe for anyone with a medical emergency.

With respect to non-emergent non-COVID-19 health issues, our local medical clinics remain open Monday to Friday, with virtual and in-person walk-in services available through the Gibsons Medical Clinic from Monday to Saturday. Please note that all of our family medicine clinics are currently booking people without a local family doctor.

In order to provide as safe an environment as possible for both patients and staff, the majority of medical care will continue to be provided virtually. This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. If you have a medical issue that requires a physical assessment, an in-person appointment will be arranged.

Please check the Coast Reporter and The Local Weekly for periodic updates on COVID-19 in our community. As local parks, programs and facilities open up, please visit the SCRD, the Town of Gibsons, and the District of Sechelt websites for updates.

But just three weeks before Green and her family were set to fly from Edmonton to Sydney, N.S., on July 17, WestJet announced it was ending its policy of leaving the middle seats on its flights empty.

article continues below

""I was devastated,"" Green said, noting her family spends every summer in Nova Scotia with her 93-year-old grandmother who is suffering from severe dementia and another family member with an incurable form of cancer.

""We all knew it could very well be the last summer we would spend with them.""

When Green called WestJet to see if any accommodations could be made, she told the company she has a heart condition that puts her in the high-risk category for COVID-19.

Despite her pleas, Green said the airline told her it was unable to make any special accommodations, nor would it allow her to change the date of the flight to before July 1, when the rules were relaxed, without paying a fee.

And Green's not alone: as provinces begin to relax domestic travel restrictions, the cessation of physical distancing rules by two of Canada's biggest airlines — WestJet and Air Canada — is causing frustration and grief among some passengers.

Gabor Lukacs, head of the advocacy group Air Passenger Rights Canada, said he has fielded countless complaints from passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are related to the same issues: airlines refusing to offer refunds or accommodations amid the abolition of physical distancing rules.

While he acknowledges the effort to fill seats is due to airlines attempting to recoup billions in lost revenue, Lukacs argues the companies risk deterring customers from flying at all.

""The question is: do we allow economic considerations to override public health? We don't allow supermarkets to sell spoiled meat because it's cheaper. Are we going to allow doctors to skip disinfecting their tools to save the cost?""

There's some evidence he's right: a new poll conducted by Leger and the Association of Canadian Studies found 72 per cent of respondents say they are not comfortable flying now that Air Canada and WestJet have culled their seat distancing policies.

Only 22 per cent said they would be OK with flying under the newly relaxed rules.

In response to criticisms, WestJet forwarded The Canadian Press a statement from a July 3 blog post regarding changes to its seat distancing policy.

""The blocked middle seat was introduced at the beginning of the pandemic before the myriad of safety measures were put in place and mandated on board,"" the statement reads.

""Seat distancing was never intended to be in place permanently or throughout the pandemic.""

The post notes a number of measures WestJet has taken to help stop the spread of COVID-19 on its flights, including mandatory masking, pre-boarding questionnaires for all passengers, temperature screening, thorough cleaning of aircraft between flights, and the restriction of in-flight dining services.

However, the company has also denied it's putting passengers and staff at risk by filling flights up, pointing to other safety measures as mitigating the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Air Canada provided a similar statement, acknowledging the inconvenience the change may have caused to customers.

""While we would all like a single measure that reduces risk, we are left to use a combination of approaches to mitigate risk as far as practical,"" the airline said.

Yet some passengers report first-hand experiences in which masking protocols were not followed.

Maureen Isabel Green, 31, flew from Vancouver to Fredericton three weeks ago with Air Canada to visit her family, and said she was shocked by the lax use of masks by both airport employees and the passengers on her two connecting flights.

""I just think of all the people who are getting on a flight and risking their life, or risking the life of the people they're going to visit, because some people don't want to wear a mask for a few hours,"" she said.

Green, who is a health-care worker, said there were numerous instances on her flight from Vancouver to Montreal where a group of young, male passengers took off their masks when flight attendants were not present.

While at the Montreal airport, Green said a man was able to board a flight without wearing a mask, simply by telling attendants he had a medical condition that prevented him from doing so.

Air travel has been at the centre of several headline-grabbing incidents throughout the pandemic — particularly since travel restrictions have been eased in some regions.

On July 2, health authorities in B.C. warned the passengers of four separate flights that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Just a day before — on the exact day the airlines ended their social distancing policies — the Nova Scotia Health Authority warned passengers of a Toronto-to-Halifax WestJet flight from the previous week that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

And on Sunday, a Halifax man reportedly walked off of a St. John's-bound flight after learning he was the only passenger travelling within the so-called ""Atlantic bubble,"" sparking discussion about the effectiveness of airlines' COVID-prevention policies.

The YMCA Canada, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada and the Royal Canadian Legion are among those that say they are facing severe financial difficulties and been forced to permanently close some locations even as demand for their services has increased.

article continues below

A YMCA facility permanently closed its doors in Yarmouth, N.S., because of the pandemic while the Boys and Girls Clubs shuttered its operations in Edson, Alta. The legion has seen three halls close for good in Ontario and one in New Brunswick.

While the fear is those are just the beginning, the government is also being warned that failing to help now could cost more in the long run as organizations that provide child care, emergency food support and other social services disappear.

""The problem is the bill will come due later,"" said Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada president Owen Charters. ""Because as these organizations disappear, the social safety net becomes a tax burden where the government needs to step in and provide those services directly.""

The sector began to bang the drums with alarm at the end of March as Canadians started to realize the pandemic would last longer than a couple of weeks and donations and other sources of income such as the provision of child care started to dry up.

Dozens of charities signed a letter on March 25 asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government for financial aid to prevent ""irreparable damage,"" particularly at a time when more people needed their services.

Ottawa has since included the sector in some of its COVID-19 supports such as wage-subsidy and rent-deferral programs. It also created a $350-million fund for organizations to provide emergency assistance to Canadians during the pandemic.

While welcome, those interviewed say the already-announced federal programs and funding fall far short.

""What we need is direct supports to make sure Ys can survive the crisis,"" YMCA Canada president Peter Dinsdale said. ""There is a real need for sector stabilization. It's not just YMCAs in this country. It is Boys and Girls Clubs, the United Way. So many entities out there require support.""

The government has been told as much numerous times, with letters written and phone calls made. Yet those interviewed say there has yet to be a real response. That silence has sparked concern and frustration.

""We sent off two letters,"" said Royal Canadian Legion dominion president Tom Irvine. ""There was no acknowledgment of receiving the letters or nothing. So I'm pretty discouraged at this time, but still hopeful. This is a Canadian institution and if we don't do something, we could lose it.""

Social Development Minister Ahmed Hussen's spokeswoman Jessica Eritou on Tuesday praised the work of the charitable and non-profit sector and touted the $350-million emergency fund, which organizations say does not address the core of their concerns.

""We are continuing to look at ways to work with charities and non-profits supporting Canadians during the crisis,"" she added.

""We continue discussions with organizations to help support the important work they're doing in communities across the country and we will keep looking for the most effective ways to help Canadians during this unprecedented crisis.""

Cardus, a charity that does research on the non-profit sector, released a paper on Tuesday urging the federal government to start matching donations from Canadians to different organizations using money set aside to cover the costs of a tax credit for Canadians who donate.

But Dinsdale and Charters said matching programs will still leave many organizations struggling, and that the only real solution is direct federal support to help the sector weather the pandemic and continue providing essential services.

A lack of safe places for children to be while their parents work is an obstacle to economic recovery, economists have warned, particularly for women.

""While the federal government's been focused on macro-economic approaches like the wage subsidy, like CERB and other initiatives, they have ignored this sector,"" said Dinsdale, whose organization runs child-care centres across the country.

""And they've ignored this sector at the risk of not having the most critical social services available to Canadians as the economy reopens.""

The figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report released Tuesday morning as policy-makers consider how to shape emergency supports set to expire in the fall.

article continues below

Planned federal spending to date on pandemic-related aid now tops about $174 billion, in a range of programs meant to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The idea of giving a government-guaranteed basic income to Canadians has gained steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau and other senior cabinet ministers have repeatedly been asked by senators and MPs about the concept. Advocates argue that it would be an expansion of the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for workers who saw their incomes crash.

The CERB and a $45-billion wage-subsidy program are set to expire in October.

Providing six months of a basic income starting that month could cost between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion, depending on how much of the benefit is clawed back from people whose other incomes increase.

Budget officer Yves Giroux's report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients depending on the phase-out rate.

Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, who asked for the costing, said a basic-income program could fill in the gaps in Canada's social safety nets, a patchwork largely run by provinces, that have been exposed by the pandemic.

""It's a huge undertaking to launch a basic income for the whole country on a permanent basis. The costs are extremely high and the political resistance is likely to be fierce, but we are in a period where it is likely we will have to spend large sums of money on income support going into the balance of 2020 and into 2021,"" Woo said in a telephone interview.

""The question to my mind is how we spend it, and in what form.""

A basic income means different things to different people, but it is usually viewed as a no-strings-attached benefit that governments provide to citizens instead of various targeted social benefits.

Also known as a guaranteed minimum income, it can be delivered as a universal payment, or as a means-tested benefit that declines as a recipient's other income rises.

Giroux's report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic-income program, which Woo added would likely have to wrap in existing measures to avoid duplication.

The overall cost of the program might be higher than the budget office estimates. The PBO's estimates rely on some Statistics Canada income data that doesn't include people living in the northern territories or in First Nations, or some military members.

Nor can the figures simply be doubled to determine a full year's cost because that might overstate the financial impact. The economy appears to be bouncing back slowly from a bottoming-out in April, and the cost of the program would depend on how many employees are rehired or find new jobs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses nationwide, said Tuesday that about one-third of members responding to a survey reported being back at full staffing levels, but suggested many believe it will take six months to get back to normal profitability.

Statistics Canada is to release June's jobs report on Friday.

Projections released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimate Canada's unemployment rate at 11 per cent for the second quarter of the year.

The 37-member international body predicted the national unemployment rate would decline to 7.7 per cent by the end of the year, or to 8.4 per cent should a second wave of the novel coronavirus force renewed lockdowns.

NDP finance critic Peter Julian said Tuesday that the uncertain economic path ahead requires the Liberals to say how the government plans to reshape emergency aid in Wednesday's fiscal update.

He said a more universal benefit, which the NDP has pushed, would have helped more people and cost less had the Liberals used it from the start.

""It makes more sense to make sure that everybody who needs the benefit can actually get it than the government's approach,"" Julian said.

The Liberals have said the update on Wednesday will provide an economic outlook, an accounting of spending to date and projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, including the expected deficit. The PBO and others estimate that to be at least $250 billion.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they're not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

article continues below

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they're comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There's more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

""What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,"" the airline said.

""The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.""

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that's lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can't be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.'s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with re-opening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should re-open and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don't feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that's already passed.

The spike in deaths includes one death in June but which only recently was confirmed to be a result of the COVID-19 virus, Henry said.

""To lose six people, all in long-term care, over the last three days is a source of enormous grief,"" said BC Health Minister Adrian Dix.

There have been no new outbreaks in B.C. since Friday. There were 31 new confirmed cases since Friday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,978. Of that number, 2,629 people have recovered, leaving 166 active cases in B.C.

There are currently three long-term care facilities in B.C. with active cases of COVID-19, and one acute care facility.

Responding to a spike in cases in Seattle, and the question of whether public demonstrations may have contributed to the uptick, Henry was asked whether any cases in B.C. have been traced to large anti-racism public protests that took place in Vancouver in June. She said it appears those large gatherings did not result in any spread of the virus.

""Currently, we do not have any cases that have been associated with the protests that took place,"" Henry said. ""In talking with my colleagues in the U.S., they also have not seen surges related to those activities.""

The fact the protests were held outside may be one of the factors that limited the potential spread of the virus.

Henry, health authorities and long term care operators have been working together to relax the restrictions on visitations in long term care homes. Given the recent spike in deaths, Henry was asked if that did not raise concerns about reintroducing the virus into care homes.

She conceded that, once the virus is in a care home, the potential for it to kill elderly people is high.

""The good news is that we have reduced the amount of transmission in our community so much so that we have very people in hospital,"" she said. ""We have very few people who are transmitting in our community, and that's why we feel we're at that balance where we need to allow more people to go into long-term care.""

The league and its union announced Monday the two sides have hammered out a tentative deal on the return-to-play protocol as well as a memorandum of understanding on a four-year extension of the current collective bargaining agreement.

The NHL board of governors, the NHLPA's executive board and full membership must now ratify the documents, which are tied together, in three separate votes. If the proposals get the green light, training camps would begin July 13, with the 24 teams set to resume heading to the two Canadian hub cities on July 26. Competitive game action would then commence Aug. 1.

The league has yet to announce the two hubs for its return-to-play plan this summer, but Toronto and Edmonton are the destinations, a person with direct knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the league and the NHLPA have not released this information. The person said the league is in part being cautious and allowing itself flexibility in the event of potential spikes in COVID-19 infections in not yet determining which cities will host the conference finals and Stanley Cup final.

Hashed out in the shadow of unprecedented economic conditions brought on by COVID-19 — and viewed as crucial for a resumption of play — the proposed CBA would bring at least 14 consecutive years of NHL-NHLPA harmony after lockouts wiped out the 2004-05 season, and cut the 1994-95 and 2012-13 campaigns to 48 games.

While details of the CBA, which would last through the 2025-26 season, weren't made public Monday, it's believed the salary cap, escrow payments from players to owners, and Olympic participation all figure prominently. Escrow, which guarantees a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, was a thorny issue for players before the pandemic significantly impacted the league's bottom line when the schedule was suspended March 12.

Getting back to the Olympics has also been a priority for players. The NHL, which would still have to negotiate with the International Olympic Committee, skipped the 2018 Winter Games after participating in five straight between 1998 and 2014.

The league and players unveiled the 24-team format for a resumption of play in late May.

The plan to resuscitate the season calls for players to be segregated from the general population in tightly-controlled ""bubbles"" — games will be played without fans — in hopes of keeping the coronavirus at bay. The NHL, which will test everyone inside the bubble daily, has consistently maintained one or more positive results wouldn't necessarily derail the restart.

The NHL and the NHLPA outlined extensive health and safety measures for training camps and resumption of play Monday — referred to as Phase 3 and Phase 4, respectively, of its return-to-play plan — in two documents totalling 47 pages.

Teams will be allowed to bring 52 personnel, with no more than 31 players, to its hub. Every person in the bubble will be subject to daily testing, including players, staff, hotel workers, food service employees and bus drivers. Every team member/player inside the bubble will be expected to remain there except in specific extenuating circumstances, including medical attention, the birth of a child or a death in the family.

Anyone returning to the bubble will be subject to a minimum four-day quarantine with daily nasal swab tests for COVID-19.

While the league is encouraging physical distancing at all times, players won't be required to wear masks when exercising or on the ice. The same goes for coaches behind the bench and off-ice officials. Masks are required to be worn inside the bubble by any individual not in their hotel room.

The NHL and NHLPA have the ability to delay, postpone, move or cancel games in the event there's a ""risk to player health and safety"" and/or a chance that ""the integrity of the competition"" is in jeopardy, including ""an uncontrolled outbreak of COVID-19.""

There is not, however, any specifics as to what would constitute ""an uncontrolled outbreak.""

Individuals leaving the bubble without permission may be subject to consequences up to and including removal from Phase 4. Teams could also be hit with steep punishments, including fines and/or loss of draft choices.

Players are allowed to opt out of Phase 3 and Phase 4 without penalty, but have to notify their team this week.

Vancouver, Las Vegas, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Minneapolis/St. Paul were the other cities originally in the running to be hubs.

The NHL is looking to restart its season with a blueprint that includes eight best-of-five qualifying round series before pivoting to the typical 16-team playoffs. It's hoped the Stanley Cup, which has been awarded all but twice since 1893, will be handed out sometime in the fall.

Las Vegas was viewed as a hub front-runner because its massive hotel complexes could be more-easily secured in a bubble scenario until a recent surge in COVID-19 cases across large swaths of the United States — the death toll there currently stands at more than 130,000 people — likely made the destination far less appealing.

But despite Monday's good news, there remain difficult waters to navigate.

The league and NHLPA will not quarantine players during training camp, but instead ask they stay home when not at the rink in hopes isolation and testing will be enough to avoid any outbreaks.

Of the 396 NHLers tested at team facilities between June 8 and July 6 during voluntary workouts as part of Phase 2 protocols, 23 results — in the neighbourhood of six per cent — came back positive. The league said it's also aware of 12 other positive tests for players not taking part in Phase 2.

The Tampa Bay Lightning closed their practice facility last month after three players and additional staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 24 teams poised to resume play, 18 are located in the U.S., including current virus hot spots like Florida, Texas and Arizona.

Four clubs previously confirmed 10 positive tests in the spring, with five coming from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche, and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 6, 2020.

As travel editor at the Vancouver Courier newspaper, vice-chair of the B.C. branch of the Travel Media Association of Canada, and a member of the Society of American Travel Writers, travel is a big part of my life, which meant I already had the contacts in place to get started.

Now with some destinations looking to slowly reopen, and, in an effort to catch a glimpse of future travel trends, I’m continuing to reach out to travel experts and tourism bureaus across Canada and the globe for answers to five similar questions.

And while no one can predict the future, all are hopeful travel will soon resume. But, how exactly that will look is anyone’s guess.

If you are part of a destination management organization or represent a property and want to share your thoughts, please drop me a line at writersblock5@hotmail.com.

Five questions with Lessner Gomez, director, Cuba Tourist Board, Toronto office.

How did COVID-19 impact tourism in Cuba?

Like other tourist destinations around the world, Cuba closed to international travel because of the Corona Virus. Cuba is now ready to slowly open to visitors.

In order to control and isolate any possible infection, Cuba has reopened its doors in Cayo Largo, Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo, Cayo Santa María and Cayo Cruz effective July 1.

Cuba is beginning to reopen to tourism. Who are the first international visitors Cuba will be expecting?

Cuba is looking forward to welcoming travellers from Canada and Europe. We have enjoyed a special relationship with Canada for over forty years.

We look forward to welcoming Canada back to our beautiful beaches.

How important are Canadians to tourism in Cuba?

Historically Canada has always been the biggest international inbound market for Cuba.

What does the future hold for Cuba and are there any trends we can look forward to?

As with the rest of the world, the future is hard to predict, but we are very positive.

Cuba enjoys a world class health system with particular expertise in the treatment of diseases of the lungs. In fact, throughout this pandemic we have offered medical support to countries around the world.

We believe we can offer tourists from Canada the confidence to return to our wonderful destinations and we look forward to welcoming them.

We believe that by opening gradually, tourist will feel comfortable with our planning and slowly we can begin to open other parts of our country.

What enhanced safety measures have been put in place to ensure visitors to resorts, hotels and attractions will be safe?

Over the past few months, the Cuban government has focused its efforts on the battle against the pandemic.

During this time, government officials took steps to improve all hotels and tourism infrastructure. Hygiene and sanitary protocols were put in place in order to ensure the safety of the Cuban people and its international visitors, as tourism activities are reactivated.

Hygiene and sanitary protocols will be practiced from the first phase, for example:

In order to operate, tourist facilities must obtain government certification called: Most hygienic and safest tourism (T + HS).

Workers with respiratory symptoms will not be allowed on resort premises and anyone with symptoms will be immediately directed to a health center.

International tourist circulation will only take place at the cayos (islands) where tourists enjoy their holidays.

Excursions will be offered only at the cayos for the international market.

The nautical activities and operations at international marinas of tourist centers approved for international tourism are reactivated.

As approved by the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, in the second phase, foreign tourists will undergo the PCR test free of charge upon their arrival in the country.

Bonus question

Where do Americans fit into the scheme of things in Cuba right now?

There are no changes on the Cuba-US relations and related travel restrictions.

The ferry company announced July 3 that starting on July 10 two round trips would be added to the schedule on Fridays and Sundays – a 4:20 and 6:40 p.m. departure from Langdale and a 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. departure from Horseshoe Bay.

article continues below

BC Ferries is also adding more trips on other busy routes, including Horseshoe Bay-Nanaimo.

The addition of more sailings comes as local governments are calling for a return to a full summer schedule and travellers continue to voice frustration online.

In a lengthy post on her Facebook page July 3, Sechelt Mayor Darnleda Siegers asked residents upset with the current level of service, short-notice schedule changes, and problems rebooking reservations to “cut [BC Ferries] some slack.”

“Behind the glitches and the mistakes are humans just like you and I and they are trying as best they can,” she wrote.

But Siegers is also urging Coasters to lobby the province and the federal government for more financial support for BC Ferries.

“BC Ferries needs financial assistance from the provincial and federal government as they are using their capital funds, previously earmarked for the Langdale ferry upgrade and our second ship and other capital expenditures, to cover off their operating costs,” said Siegers.

Siegers also called the $180,000 the provincial government has already committed to keep sailings from being cut on minor routes, including Earls Cove-Saltery Bay, “a drop in the bucket.”

“There is some money earmarked for B.C. from the federal government that will be provided within the next while,” she said. “I’d like to see some of it go to BC Ferries.”

The money Siegers is referring to is part of a $14-billion “safe restart agreement” between Ottawa and the provinces.

West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country MP Patrick Weiler has also suggested that agreement could be the source of funding to backstop BC Ferries against the financial losses caused by the sudden drop in ridership in the early phase of the pandemic.

“I believe that one of the areas that they want to make sure that funding is going to go towards is transit, which has been very much hit hard by the pandemic similar to BC Ferries, which could also be an option for that funding,” Weiler said during a June 23 update for the Sechelt and District Chamber of Commerce.

In response to Coast Reporter’s inquiry to the premier’s office about the status of the discussions on the safe restart agreement and whether some of the money would be used to support a return to normal service levels on BC Ferries, officials with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure replied that the government is “pleased to see the federal government agreeing to provide much-needed support for a variety of important provincial issues.”

“However, the number and size of programs that have been included in this list is substantial,” the email from the ministry continued. “So we look forward to seeing the details to make sure it can adequately support our recovery efforts.”

On the specific issue of BC Ferries the ministry said, “We know ferries are vital for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and for people who live and work on our coast, and continue to work with the federal government on solutions.”",[]
657,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/covid-19/public-gets-inside-access-at-gibsons-library-for-first-time-since-pandemic-hit-1.24165700,Public gets inside access at Gibsons library for first time since pandemic hit,['Sophie Woodrooffe'],,"As of July 6, people wanting books from Gibsons and District Public Library will no longer have to order them like pizza – for the first time in four months, they can walk inside and browse the shelves themselves.

“We’re looking forward to it,” said library director Heather Evans-Cullen an hour before Monday’s official 10 a.m. opening. “If I could have a ribbon cutting or slab cake, I would.”

article continues below

At least five people had already arrived before opening hours, she said. Hours of operation are now Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Doors may finally be open again but operations are far from normal. For the first two weeks, a maximum of 20 patrons will be allowed inside at any given time, “to make sure we can maintain distancing,” said Evans-Cullen.

The layout has been modified and Plexiglas installed to maintain physical barriers, returned books are quarantined for 72 hours and staff wear face shields.

The library has been closed to the public since March, when public health restrictions due to COVID-19 took effect. In late May it began offering curbside pickup and drop-off services on site, but patrons weren’t able to enter the building.

The curbside “takeout” book service is still being offered and access to digital media “contactless services” such as audiobooks, ebooks and databases, remains available.

About 65 per cent of the Town of Gibsons residents are patrons of the library, far higher than the provincial average, said Evans-Cullen. “I think it’s a special relationship this community has with this library.” With the opening, “they’re coming back home a little bit.”

And with the opening, two other important services will now be available to the public: computers and washroom facilities. “Our washrooms will be open. That’s been a huge limitation for people who may be homeless or not have sustainable housing,” said Evans-Cullen, adding that washroom access was something B.C. provincial health officer Bonnie Henry had asked libraries to provide, if possible.

Takeout delivery remains in place at the Sechelt Public Library. Interim library director Leianne Emery anticipates opening the doors to the public to browse shelves by the start of August, but an exact date will depend on a potential building envelope project, “which will affect the library interior,” she said in an email.

In the meantime, three major interior construction projects are underway and protective glass is being installed. Those projects should be completed by July 20, at which point the library will begin adding limited public computer access and in-person tech help to the other services it is already providing, including offering materials for “takeout,” providing online and phone tech help, exam invigilation, photocopying and faxing services and reciprocal borrowing between Sechelt and Gibsons libraries.

The Sechelt library is aiming to have outdoor “under the tent programming” up and running for small groups within the next couple of weeks. And children can pick up their reading logs at either the Gibsons or Sechelt library for the Summer Reading Club.

The Roberts Creek Community Library has been open to the public since June 19 but with modified hours.

In July, the library is open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sundays from noon to 2 p.m., Tuesdays from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Wednesdays from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Safety conditions apply and instructions are available at the library’s entrance. Only one patron and child are allowed inside the building at a time.

A return to in-person services kicked off quietly at the Pender Harbour Reading Centre on July 2, according to board chair Karen Dyck. It is now open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and will be fully staffed with volunteers until the end of August. As with the Roberts Creek library, only one person is allowed inside at a time with some exceptions for children. Masks are required for borrowers and volunteers. And because people have been dropping off materials throughout the COVID-19 epidemic, “we have lots of books on the shelf,” said Dyck.

Over the course of the pandemic, no orders have been issued by the provincial health officer requiring libraries to close.

A May 7 letter from Vancouver Coastal Health’s (VCH) deputy chief medical health officer Mark Lysyshyn stated that VCH “believes that the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these environments can be mitigated and consistent with B.C.’s Restart Plan, that it is possible to safely operate these facilities at this time.”

Libraries must operate with a COVID-19 safety plan in place that draws from WorkSafeBC protocols.",[]

Representatives from Teamsters Canada, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Canada and Unifor point to the dozens of retail and warehouse workers who remain sickened with COVID-19 and a report Monday from CTV News in Windsor, Ont. that two workers had just tested positive in the border city.

article continues below

Some of those previously sickened have returned to work. A few workers have died from the novel coronavirus disease.

Speaking to a House of Commons committee Monday, the union leaders recommended stricter labour standards and oversight for the sector, beyond getting to the bottom of why the pay premium was abruptly rolled back by some of the largest grocery chains.

Unifor national president Jerry Dias said the fact two more workers now have COVID-19 ""is probably proof positive"" that the pandemic premium for hourly workers shouldn't have disappeared.

When the pandemic struck Canada in March, major grocery chains said they would boost front-line workers' wages on average about $2 per hour.

But late last month, one after another, the chains announced they were ending the pandemic pay bump because the pace of business had eased, giving the unions short notice about the decision.

MPs on the industry committee agreed to look into the matter and will have a chance to question retail executives at the end of the week.

""Look, the argument is nonsense and every one of us on this panel understands that and I will argue they understand that as well,"" Dias said, referring to grocery-chain executives.

""So this had nothing to do with somehow the pandemic, 'Oh we're seeing a pot at the end of the rainbow,' this was a decision made about money.""

Paul Meinema, national president of the food workers' union, said the federal government should play a more active role in boosting wages for workers in the sector.

Grocery stores were among the businesses governments deemed essential services that didn't have to close as public health restrictions forced companies to cut operations to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The pandemic pay was supposed to recognize that workers were being asked to come in to help feed a population ordered to stay home. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said she wanted to determine how to properly compensate workers who are being put in that situation.

Spending on things like gasoline and travel fell but spending on groceries has gone up — one of the few areas of the economy where things appeared positive during the lockdowns of April and May.

NDP MP Brian Masse, who represents a riding in Windsor, Ont., said the industry needs more oversight, calling the committee probe ""the first dive at this.""

The byelection is expected to fill the seat of Nick Volkow, an eight-term councillor who recently died of brain cancer. According to provincial laws, a byelection is required to fill a vacancy that opens up prior to an election year.

To kick off the byelection, the city is supposed to appoint a chief election officer, but city staff is recommending that be put off for now, citing concerns around COVID-19. For instance, strict rules on large congregations of people could put a chill on voter turnout, while lifting those rules would create a potential hazard for voters.

According to a staff report to council, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, as well as a referendum in Kamloops, to protect residents from COVID-19.

The staff report noted city clerk Kate O’Connell reached out to the ministry to ask about guidelines for votes held during the pandemic. In response, the ministry indicated it was in the process of developing those guidelines and recommended the byelection be deferred.

Staff passed that recommendation on to council ahead of Monday evening’s regular meeting, saying it is “not practicable” to hold a byelection without the guidelines.

The election guidelines are being developed by Elections BC, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs, the Local Government Management Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, according to the staff report, and development is still in early stages. Staff noted there is still no clear timeline for when those guidelines are expected to be completed.

Options to do so are now on the table as members of Parliament and hundreds of behind-the-scenes staff begin to plan for what their headquarters could look like come fall, to the extent they can.

article continues below

""Is it better to meet in person or virtually come September?"" House of Commons Speaker Anthony Rota said to the procedure and house affairs committee Monday.

""COVID has been changing so drastically along the way it's very difficult to predict what will happen in a month and a half or two months from now.""

But in the meantime, a mobile app could be deployed to allow MPs to vote whether they're on Parliament Hill or off, Rota said.

The app is fully bilingual, meets accessibility standards, and is secure, including providing administrators the ability to know where MPs are when they vote and authenticate their identities.

""The proposed approach for an electronic voting system respects several key principles,"" Rota said.

Finding a way for MPs to vote while limiting the risk of COVID-19 transmission has been a sticking point for the Liberal government as it has faced pressure from the Opposition Conservatives to allow for the full resumption of Parliament.

MPs have grappled with how they can do their jobs ever since Parliament, like much of the rest of the country, shut down in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

Those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business that would expand the powers MPs have available to press the government and get more information.

Right now, Parliament is expected to resume sitting full-time on Sept. 21, though there is a single sitting day scheduled for this week.

Summer sitting days were among the concessions opposition parties won as they've fought for greater accountability.

The virtual voting plan is best to be rolled out come fall, Rota said, citing the time needed to get the right system in place.

In addition to an app, he's presented MPs with the option of a video-conferencing approach that would piggyback on the hybrid arrangement in place now.

Rota's report, however, raised several concerns with that, including unstable internet connections, the amount of time it would take, and the sensitive issue of MPs not being present to vote.

A video-conferencing approach would need to name each MP in turn to double-check an MP isn't on mute or having trouble with the connection.

""The absence of members would be highlighted to the public, to the media and to other members of the House, contrary to current practice,"" the report said.

Conservative MPs have come under scrutiny in recent weeks for their absence from the current special COVID-19 committee of MPs that replaced the normal House of Commons sitting.

Unlike in regular sittings, for the committee it is possible to see exactly who attended, and tallies have suggested many Tories haven't shown up regularly.

When it comes to virtual voting, the Conservatives have largely opposed the approach, citing a resistance to anything that keeps MPs off the Hill.

They argue it is possible to adjust regular procedures to allow for physical distancing, and had asked for a look at how voting could take place in person.

Pandemic-safe options could include lining up outside the Commons chamber to vote, voting in shifts or voting by proxy, Rota's analysis suggested.

Among the issues in-person voting raises is the question of time and resources needed to keep the chamber clean as well as how long the votes themselves would take.

The MPs are aiming to have their recommendations in place later this month.

The league says 23 of 396 players checked for COVID-19 at team facilities have tested positive since voluntary Phase 2 workouts began June 8 — a rate of just under six per cent. In that same time period, the NHL added it is aware of 12 additional positive test results.

article continues below

That's an increase of eight players in Phase 2, and one from outside the NHL's testing system, over the last week.

The NHL says it has administered more than 2,900 tests at team facilities.

Ten additional players were confirmed to have tested positive in the spring — five from the Ottawa Senators, three from the Colorado Avalanche and one each from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins. That brings the total number of NHLers with confirmed positive tests to 45 since the schedule was suspended in mid-March.

The league is no longer providing details on the players or clubs with positive tests. There was no word on the health status of the 35 players in question, including whether or not they experienced symptoms or have recovered.

""All players who have tested positive have been self-isolated and are following (government) protocols,"" the NHL said in a statement released on Twitter.

The league and NHL Players' Association on Sunday night agreed on protocols to start training camps and resume the season. That includes daily testing once games get under way for players, coaches and staff.

Resuming is contingent on each side approving an extension of the collective bargaining agreement and the return-to-play protocol.

The central bank's business outlook survey suggested about half of firms foresee a rebound in their sales within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions.

article continues below

The survey report published Monday suggests many service-sector and energy companies don't expect a return to pre-pandemic employment levels.

The worry among workers about losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen in the bank's regular survey of consumer expectations, released alongside the business outlook report.

Workers' expectations of how easily they could find new work dropped to the lowest level in the survey since the 2015 oil-price shock as the country faces a different and far deeper economic crisis.

Lockdowns and stay-at-home requests from governments put the economy in a deep freeze in mid-March, with the thaw beginning in recent weeks as restrictions began to be rolled back.

Nearly half of all businesses reported an outright decline of their sales in the past 12 months because of COVID-19, low energy prices and the uncertainty both wrought.

More than half of businesses expect their total sales over the next 12 months to be lower than they were in the last year, with future sales indicators at record lows.

About half of firms expect their sales will ""mostly recover"" within the next year as COVID-19's effects recede, but the expectations of a return to pre-pandemic levels often depend on lifting government-mandated restrictions. Some companies said they could get back to normal operations within a month of public health restrictions being lifted.

""Overall, while the economy is on the mend, it's still early days and both businesses and consumers will continue to grapple with uncertainty over the foreseeable future,"" TD economist Ksenia Bushmeneva said in a note.

""This will manifest in lower spending by households and weak investment plans by businesses, both of which will weigh on the pace of economic recovery.""

Consumers' expectations for wage growth were below what they anticipated for inflation, while the outlook for growth in household income dropped to its lowest level in the survey's history.

The consumer survey said spending expectations have tumbled, which the bank says suggests consumers have become more cautious due to the economic impact and health risks related to the pandemic.

The bank said consumers expect to spend mostly on essentials and less on durable goods like cars and furniture, as well services that involve face-to-face interactions like eating out, travel or going to the movies.

A Royal Bank report Monday estimated the drop in economic output and sharp rise in spending could put the federal deficit at $265 billion this fiscal year.

The report said deficits could be close to double those the Liberals predicted just over six months ago as revenues drop — not including an expected need to spend more to help the economy recover.

""If they needed to extend some of the (aid) programs to ensure that the economy wasn't going to be ... more meaningfully impacted, they're in the fiscal position to do so,"" said RBC economist Colin Guldimann, who co-wrote the report.

""Of course, there is a position when some spending becomes too much spending and it's really hard to know where that is.""

Federal spending on fighting the pandemic and its effects, by the government's most recent figures, amounts to about $174 billion.

About one-third of service and energy companies told the Bank of Canada they have tapped a federal wage subsidy to reduce or avoid layoffs. Other firms looking to rehire or hire new staff cited an emergency federal benefit for workers as a hurdle to their plans.

The latest figures from the federal government show the $45-billion wage subsidy program has paid nearly $17.1 billion to 245,160 companies as of June 29. Meanwhile, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, or CERB, has paid $53.53 billion in benefits to 8.16 million people as of June 28, since it was introduced in late March.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, argued in a research note Monday that the Liberals shouldn't make deep cuts to their aid measures.

He calculated that households will have a surplus in their budgets by $202.9 billion due to Ottawa's deficit spending, while corporations would see a surplus to the tune of $37.1 billion.

""As federal deficits can create surpluses in other areas, the opposite is also true,"" Macdonald wrote. ""Federal surpluses, through cutbacks and austerity, must force another sector into deficit by the same amount.""

We have seen countless televised messages from elected politicians, as well as heated discussions about the proper use of masks. As we enter a very different summer, Research Co. and Glacier Media tracked the views of Canadians on political and behavioural matters.

The one consistent finding throughout the pandemic has been the high level of satisfaction that Canadians express toward the federal government. In our latest survey, 70% of Canadians are happy with how Ottawa has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, practically unchanged since we last asked in May (69%).

article continues below

The rating for provincial governments and municipal governments improved as more Canadians were able to leave the isolation pod. Three in four Canadians (75%, up 11 points since May) are satisfied with their provincial administration, and seven in 10 (70%) feel the same way about their local government.

The big jump for provincial governments was not uniform across the country. In Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, satisfaction reaches 86% and 83%, with positive perceptions increasing by 19 points and 14 points, respectively.

Two other areas experienced double digit rises in satisfaction: Saskatchewan and Manitoba (78%, up 19 points) and Ontario (76%, up 23 points). The lowest ratings are observed in Quebec (69%, up three points) and Alberta (62%, up six points). Quebec had the highest level of satisfaction when we started asking this question in March; Alberta has consistently been at the bottom.

On the behavioural side of things, there are some remarkable changes in the way Canadians are approaching the pandemic. Time and reassurance have made many residents feel safer about take-out and delivery. In April, 40% of Canadians said they were not ordering food because they feared infection. The proportion has dropped to 23%, in what will surely be welcome news to an industry that has been greatly affected by the pandemic.

Three in 10 Canadians admit to overeating, unchanged since April. There is an increase in consumption of alcohol at home (18%, up five points) and a steadier curve on losing our tempers more often (16%, down two points).

Throughout the pandemic, the gender gap on some questions related to safe practices has been staggering. This time, it is evident on two questions. Fewer Canadians (40%, down seven points) are cleaning the groceries they buy to prevent infection. While only 36% of men are sanitizing the provisions they buy, the proportion jumps to 44% among women.

Still, the biggest behavioural change is on our faces. Back in April, only 14% of Canadians said they wore a protective mask every time they went out. This time, practically half of Canadians (48%) are not leaving home without them. Regionally, Ontarians are leading the way in wearing masks (63%), followed by Albertans at 51%. The proportion is slightly lower in Quebec and British Columbia (each at 48%).

Again, women are being more meticulous. Most female respondents (57%) say they are wearing masks outside, while only 39% of male respondents report the same behaviour. There is also a generational gap, with more than half of Canadians aged 18 to 34 (55%) always bringing their masks, compared with 46% for those aged 35 to 54 and 44% among those aged 55 and over.

Mask or no mask, Canadians appear resigned to staying close to home and avoiding big crowds. Only 11% of Canadians expect to be able to travel abroad before the end of September, while a similar proportion (12%) believe they will be able to go to a live sporting event. There is slightly more hope about attending or hosting a large social gathering at some point before Labour Day (21%).

More than a third of Canadians think the calendar will hit December before they take a trip abroad (39%), witness a live sporting event (35%) or go to a large party (also 35%). In a sign of the difficulty of issuing any kind of forecast during the pandemic, the proportion of undecided respondents is high on all three options.

Even the seemingly simple task of shaking the hand of a person who is not at our home appears distant, with 20% of Canadians expecting to do this before September, and 29% foreseeing it perhaps as a Christmas miracle. In addition, three in four Canadians (75%) say they will “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine against COVID-19 is one ultimately becomes available, up two points since April.

Even if the future seems bleak, Canadians are more optimistic now. In March, only 22% were willing to say that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was “behind us.” The proportion barely moved to 24% in May, but reached 49% at the end of June. Oddly enough, Quebecers (57%) and Ontarians (49%) are more enthusiastic about the corner being turned than those in two large provinces that have fewer COVID-19 cases: Alberta (44%) and British Columbia (39%). •

Think you might have symptoms? Take a self-assessment

On this page

Symptoms of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include:

new or worsening cough

shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

temperature equal to or over 38°C

feeling feverish

chills

fatigue or weakness

muscle or body aches

new loss of smell or taste

headache

gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)

feeling very unwell



Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.

In severe cases, infection can lead to death.

Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.

Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who:

have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)

never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)

While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.

If you or your child become ill

If you are showing symptoms of COVID-19, reduce your contact with others:

isolate yourself at home for 14 days to avoid spreading it to others if you live with others, stay in a separate room or keep a 2-metre distance

visit a health care professional or call your local public health authority call ahead to tell them your symptoms and follow their instructions



Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.

If you become sick while travelling back to Canada:

inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer

advise a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada if you believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, even if you do not have symptoms this is required under the Quarantine Act the Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow



Check if you have been exposed

Have you been on a recent flight, cruise, train, or at a public gathering? Check the listed exposure locations to see if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Take care of your mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic is new and unexpected. This situation can be unsettling and can cause a sense of loss of control. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or worried in a crisis. Make sure to care for your mental and physical wellbeing and to ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.

Diagnosing coronavirus

Coronavirus infections are diagnosed by a health care provider based on symptoms and are confirmed through laboratory tests.

Treating coronavirus

Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own.

If you are concerned about your symptoms, you should self-monitor and consult your health care provider. They may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms.

Vaccine, therapeutics and medical devices

At this time, a vaccine and therapies to treat or prevent this disease have not yet been identified. But research and development are underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global review of therapies that may be used to treat or prevent the disease.

Health Canada is fast tracking the importation and sale of medical devices for use in relation to COVID-19.

Flu vaccine

If you have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses, but will help prevent the flu. Getting the flu could make you more vulnerable to other infections.

Getting the flu vaccine will not increase your risk of illness from coronavirus. For more information, please refer to this recently published Canadian research study.

About coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.

COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact.

There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the:",[]

Limit contact

Only one healthy person should provide care.

Do not share personal items with the ill person, such as toothbrushes, towels, bed linen, utensils or electronic devices.

Use a separate bathroom from the ill person, if possible. If not possible, the ill person should put the toilet lid down before flushing.

Some people may transmit COVID-19 even though they do not show any symptoms. Wearing a mask, including a non-medical mask or face covering (i.e. made with at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can help protect others around you.

Prevent contact with animals, as there have been several reports of people transmitting COVID-19 to their pets.

Protect yourself

If possible, people who are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19 should not care for someone with COVID-19. These people include elderly persons, those with chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) or compromised immune systems.

If you need to be within 2 metres of the ill person, wear personal protective equipment: a medical mask disposable gloves eye protection

Wear disposable gloves when touching the ill person, their environment and soiled items or surfaces.

Avoid re-using medical masks or gloves.

Clean your hands often for at least 20 seconds, especially after contact with the ill person and after removing gloves, face masks and eye protection.

Dry your hands with disposable paper towels. If not available, use a reusable towel and replace it when it becomes wet.

You can also remove dirt with a wet wipe and then use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wearing masks Medical masks are recommended for COVID-19 patients in the home and for protection for those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home.

N95 respirators must be reserved for healthcare workers and should not be used for caregiving at home.

If medical masks are not available, non-medical masks or face coverings (i.e. constructed to completely cover the nose and mouth without gaping, and secured to the head by ties or ear loops) can be worn by the ill person, if tolerable. This will cover their mouth and nose, and may prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces.

A non-medical mask or face covering may also be worn by those providing direct care to COVID-19 patients at home. However, wearing a non-medical mask or facial covering in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it.

Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and maintaining a physical distance of at least 2 metres from the ill person, will reduce the chance of being exposed to the virus.

Non-medical cloth masks should be carefully removed when soiled or damp, laundered in hot water and then dried thoroughly.

Hands must be cleaned before and after putting on and removing a mask.

Keep your environment clean

Place used medical masks, gloves and other contaminated items in a lined container, secure the contents and dispose of them with other household waste.

Place possibly contaminated laundry, including non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings, into a container with a plastic liner and do not shake. Wash with regular laundry soap and hot water (60-90°C), and dry well. Clothing, linens and non-medical cloth masks and facial coverings belonging to the ill person can be washed with other laundry.

At least once daily, clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch often, such as toilets, laundry containers, bedside tables, doorknobs, phones and television remotes.

Use only approved hard-surface disinfectants that have a Drug Identification Number (DIN). A DIN is an 8-digit number given by Health Canada that confirms the disinfectant product is approved and safe for use in Canada.

When approved hard surface disinfectants are not available, for household disinfection, a diluted bleach solution can be prepared in accordance with the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 5 millilitres (mL) of bleach per 250 mL of water OR 20 mL of bleach per litre of water. This ratio is based on bleach containing 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution. Follow instructions for proper handling of household (chlorine) bleach.

If they can withstand the use of liquids for disinfection, high-touch electronic devices (e.g. keyboards, tablets, smartboards) may be disinfected with 70% alcohol (e.g. alcohol prep wipes) at least daily.

Monitor yourself for symptoms

If you have always used the recommended precautions, then monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days following your last close contact with the ill person.

Quarantine (self-isolate) at home for 14 days from your last exposure and contact your local public health authority if you have no symptoms but: cared for a person who has COVID-19 without the recommended personal protective equipment live with or had close physical contact (e.g. intimate partner) without using the recommended personal protective equipment live with or have had regular close contact (within 2 metres) with a person who has COVID-19 up to 48 hours prior to symptom onset or while they were symptomatic and not isolating had direct contact with the body fluids of a person who has COVID-19 (e.g. were coughed or sneezed on) without the recommended personal protective equipment



If you start to develop symptoms, isolate yourself as quickly as possible and contact your local public health authority for further instructions.

Maintain these supplies

Medical masks if available, or non-medical mask or face covering

Eye protection (face shield or goggles) for use by caregiver

Disposable gloves (do not re-use) for use by caregiver

Disposable paper towels

Tissues

Waste container with plastic liner

Thermometer

Over the counter medication to reduce fever (e.g. ibuprofen or acetaminophen)

Running water

On Tuesday July 14, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer and Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, announced 13 new cases of COVID-19 in the province for a total of 3,128 cases in British Columbia. Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,015 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. There are no new community outbreaks, but there have been several exposure events particularly in the Kelowna area. These occurred when a group of people from different areas including the Okanagan, lower mainland and Alberta got together. To date, 17 of these individuals have tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Henry says as people become more active and travel, we will see more cases. Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow. Of note, the first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete.



Economic and fiscal update for 2020-21

The British Columbia government is forecasting a $12.5 billion deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincial budget for 2020, tabled just months before the global pandemic, predicted a budget surplus of $227 million for 2020-21. Carole James, Minister of Finance, says the pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society, and reminded us of the need for strong public services and supports. Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.

Warning about calls appearing to come from Squamish General Hospital



Vancouver Coastal Health is warning the public not to provide personal information over the phone if they receive an unexpected call that appears to come from Squamish General Hospital. Someone claiming to be a hospital employee is calling people and asking for their full names, social insurance number and date of birth. This is in no way associated with Vancouver Coastal Health, and appears to be a phishing scam, where people are tricked into providing personal information that can be used fraudulently. RCMP have been advised.



Testing

Anyone in the VCH region with cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, however mild, can now be assessed for and get a COVID-19 test. Contact your physician or nurse practitioner's office, or a local community collection centre to arrange for a test. Phone numbers and locations of collection centre can be found by visiting: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing or by calling 8-1-1. In Vancouver, the City Centre and REACH urgent and primary care centres can provide testing as well as the St. Vincent's drive-up location at 4875 Heather Street. The Richmond Assessment Centre is located at 6820 Gilbert Road, in the parking lot of the Richmond Tennis Club. On the North Shore, testing is available at the North Vancouver Urgent and Primary Care Centre. If you think you need testing, please call ahead before visiting your doctor, urgent and primary care center or health clinic.



VCH Medical Health Officers, our provincial partners and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect yourself while out in public, wash your hands frequently and maintain social distance. For more information on COVID-19, please visit www.vch.ca/COVID19.

In his new film, The Art of Self-Defense, Eisenberg goes from friendless office lackey to a man with the ability to kill his opponent with an index finger to the head. Accountants everywhere are signing up for karate classes as we speak.

article continues below

Eisenberg plays Casey Davies (“that’s a very feminine-sounding name”), a solitary man who is victim of a violent mugging. His life changes when he wanders into a karate studio and meets the charismatic Sensei (Alessandro Nivola) who promises to make him more of a man, starting with the “mental component;” Casey must abandon adult contemporary music; only metal from now on. And no more coddling his decidedly un-masculine dachshund with human contact.

“When I first read it I thought it was unbelievably hysterical, possibly the best comedy dialogue I’d ever read,” Eisenberg says via phone from Montreal, where he is promoting the film. It wasn’t until filming got underway that the actor appreciated how dark Riley Stearns’ script actually was.

Then something else happened: the #MeToo movement gained strength, along with the accusations against industry heavyweights like Harvey Weinstein. “Halfway through shooting we’d read these horrific accusations against men and all these stories of bravery from women, so the movie took on this strange other life,” he says. “It became kind of a commentary on the dangers of toxic masculinity and the way that it affects women and our society.

“I love the movie and its part in bringing these issues to life.”

Anna (Imogen Poots) is the only female in the class and seems forever destined to be a brown belt. “Her being a woman will always prevent her from becoming a man,” says Sensei. Anna can draw blood quicker than any man in the dojo but apologizes for her inferiority nonetheless. It’s anti-feminism at work and mirrors a lot of the backlash in our culture today.

Sensei is the alpha who keeps Anna down. His character is ludicrously deadpan, and Nivola plays it perfectly. Eisenberg acknowledges that it was nearly impossible to get through a scene without breaking character. “His dialogue is incredibly funny and so absurd, and the goal is to deliver it with a straight face,” he says. “We would make each other laugh especially because we were characters who would never laugh, who had no self-awareness, and because of that it’s extra funny and extra hard to maintain self-control.”

The Art of Self-Defense is destined to do for karate what Fight Club did for white-knuckle brawling. It’s also a nice companion piece to Office Space, although the only thing to take a beating in that film was a perpetually uncooperative photocopier.

A large part of Eisenberg’s performance in the film is his body language, which screams meek and mild before Casey even speaks a line of dialogue. The actor says that he channeled “a 10-year-old version of myself” to communicate the sense of a man who is all but invisible to the people around him. “I put my hands at my sides, I tried to embody being like I was as a kid … The way the face moves, as if he’s always in awe of new things...” He says he tried not to over-think it too much: “The less I analyze myself the more I succeed.”

Eisenberg is currently enjoying success as a playwright, too. He has penned Asuncion, The Revisionist, The Spoils, and most recently Happy Talk, the off-Broadway play starring Susan Sarandon. His writing has definitely informed the way he evaluates the scripts he is offered, he says. “I like to, if possible, immerse myself in something that I never would’ve written myself. And in this film the way the characters speak, their bluntness, the way my character acts like a child, is something I never would’ve thought about.”

The actor has played an eco-warrior in Night Moves, a sleight-of-hand expert in Now You See Me, a zombie-killer in Zombieland, and – most famously – Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (for which he was nominated for an Oscar). He has co-starred with Kristen Stewart three times (in Café Society, American Ultra and Adventureland), been in two Woody Allen films, and starred in one movie directed by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst.

He would love to collaborate with Kristen Stewart again. “We’re talking about this movie we did – Adventureland,” he says. “We all had friends working on it, and [director] Greg Mottola, he’s just brilliant and he holds that movie in a special place ... So we’ve been talking about maybe making it into a series on Amazon…”

He’s open to a reprisal of his role in Superman Vs Batman as Lex Luthor, a turn that drew a lot of attention, and some criticism from devout DC Comics fans. “I’d love to do that part again because I really enjoyed it. But I’m not dying to play any other comic book characters because I don’t really know much about that world,” he says honestly.

Zombieland 2 is another story: Eisenberg is thrilled to be returning to the role of Columbus a decade after the original. “It was fantastic!” he says of filming the sequel with co-stars Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin. He says the cast wanted to jump into a sequel right after the original was made but they couldn’t find a story they were happy with. “It became such a beloved cult movie we felt it had to be really worthy for fans of the original. It took many drafts and writers to get it just right.”

What has changed and what hasn’t for Columbus? “My character in the first movie is very worried about everything and only survives because of a strict set of rules,” Eisenberg says. “Now he’s very confident, very comfortable being a family man, set up in the White House. But then things take a turn for the worst, as they must.”

In between shooting films and writing plays, Eisenberg is father to a two-year-old son with his partner Anna Strout. In terms of what he will he teach his son about what it means to be a man, Eisenberg quickly responds: “I’m outsourcing all of that to my wife, who has a much better sense of how men should behave.” He notes that Strout’s late mother ran one of the most important women’s domestic violence shelters in America, and his wife “has been marching since she was a baby.”

“She has taught me more about male behaviour and how men should behave, so I’m letting her handle everything with the baby.”

The toddler went to all Eisenberg’s classes during shooting, so “he’s taken more karate than most two-year-olds,” he laughs.

The actor is circumspect about the prospect of his son following in dad’s footsteps. “When you get criticized for this thing that you love – as we frequently do – it can take the joy out of it. So you really have to love it, need it and want it to pursue it. That’s what I will tell him.” It’s a message Eisenberg delivers when he goes to schools in New York with his wife and chats to students. “I try to be realistic with them: it’s an unstable industry, and even if you’re successful at it you can spend half the year looking for work. You need to really love what you do.”

But how about that all-important question: adult contemporary, or heavy metal? “Adult contemporary. Only because I have a baby now and if it were metal, he’d get no sleep.”

But this week most movie screens in Canada went dark.

Cineplex, the largest movie theatre chain in Canada with 165 cinemas across the country, announced Tuesday that it would close its doors until April 2. Vancouver’s independent cinemas The Cinemateque and the Rio also closed this week, with plans to reopen April 15. And Vancity Theatre suspended all screenings with plans to resume business Thursday, April 16 “at the earliest” and invites regulars to the downtown not-for-profit theatre to help them during this challenging time by purchasing gift cards for future showings at viff.org. A press release from Vancity further says “Since VIFF’s inception, we’ve sought to further empathy and understanding through the art of cinema. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to demonstrate those attributes as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances as global citizens.”

We’re not alone, of course. Stateside, AMC theatres – which had already been limiting audiences to 50 people or less – are now closed for six to 12 weeks. Regal closed all 543 of its theatres “until further notice”. Movie houses in Quebec were ordered closed for a two-week period while home of the Toronto International Film Festival – the Lightbox – has closed until April 14. The same goes for theatres in New York, Los Angeles and Seattle, as well as in other major cities.

Some of the season’s biggest releases had already been scuttled to a later date. Disney’s live-action remake of Mulan was bumped, and the 25th Bond film – No Time to Die – moved from April to a November release date. Paramount Pictures pulled A Quiet Place Part II, starring Emily Blunt, saying “we believe in and support the theatrical experience, and we look forward to bringing this film to audiences this year once we have a better understanding of the impact of this pandemic on the global theatrical marketplace.”

In an unprecedented move, NBCUniversal announced earlier this week that recently released Universal titles The Invisible Man and The Hunt, plus Focus Features’ Emma, will be made available on demand as early as this weekend at a suggested price of $19.99 for a 48-hour rental period. “Given the rapidly evolving and unprecedented changes to consumers’ daily lives during this difficult time, the company felt that now was the right time to provide this option in the home as well as in theaters,” read NBCUniversal’s release. DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls World Tour, set to open in theaters April 10, will hit home audiences the very same day. “We hope and believe that people will still go to the movies in theaters where available,” said NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, “but we understand that for people in different areas of the world that is increasingly becoming less possible.”

Independent movies are going the same route. For example, Lorcan Finnegan’s Vivarium, starring Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots, debuted during Critics’ Week at Cannes and was set for a March 27 release. But, lucky you! Canadian distributors Mongrel Media announced that the film will be available on the Apple TV app and VOD March 31.

So what can a housebound cinephile to do? There are top-10 pandemic movie lists all over the internet, if panic is your thing, but here are a few other film-related activities you can do while self-isolating as much as possible:

Stream, Stream, Stream

There is a reason that #QuarantineAndChill is trending right now: the masses are streaming their hearts out. Services that usually offer free trial periods are being extra generous during this time. Acorn TV, which specializes in Canadian, British and Australian dramas, comedies and thrillers, is offering a free 30-day trial for new subscribers (just sign up at acorn.tv and enter the special code FREE30). Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix also offer 30 days; you can enjoy Criterion’s collection for 14 days, while many others such as Disney Plus and Britbox are available free for a week.

Rent – yes, you can still rent – a movieTo press time, Videomatica and both Vancouver locations of Black Dog Video were open for business (check websites for updated info). There are a few mom-and-pop shops scattered around the city that rent, too. Go old-school and rent a flick… just promise to be quick.

Curate your collection

If you’re like me you have a pretty impressive collection, culled somewhat over the years by garage sales and trips to the charity shop, of DVDs. If you’re also like me, however, your kids won’t even look at them, preferring the one-click convenience of On Demand. If your family is guilty of this, rediscover old favourites and titles you never even got to among those lonely DVDs gathering dust on the shelf.

The Oscar goes to… me!

I also have a few – wait for it – VHS tapes of my six months spent in Japan (recorded on a camera so big it sat on my shoulder) and my disastrous first appearance on cable TV. Dust off the VCR in your closet (you know it’s there somewhere) and cue family memories you haven’t relived for a while. Nothing distracts from a pandemic like really embarrassing footage from your childhood!

You’ve seen the movie, now read the book

OK, so you might not be up to reading all 864 pages of Anna Karenina to see if Keira Knightly nailed it in the 2012 film version, but how about dusting off that childhood copy of Little Women, downloading Gone Girl on your device, or ordering Crazy Rich Asians online? Better yet, read Dune by Frank Herbert, The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn, or Agatha Christie’s classic Death on the Nile: all have big-screen adaptations in the works, so you’ll be prepped and ready when the films come out.

Get Creative

Rumours abound that Shakespeare wrote King Lear while quarantined by the plague. You’re such a film buff, why not finally put pen to paper and write that story that’s always bouncing around in your head? Who knows: you may just have the next great screenplay at your impeccably sanitized fingertips.

And finally, pledge to get out there when it’s all over. Let’s hope that this enforced embargo on big-screen entertainment makes us realize how much we’ve missed the movies and the shared experience of laughing, sniffling or being terrorized alongside like-minded folks in a darkened theatre. Hang in there, film friends, we can do this.

There’s a long history in Hollywood of tough guys hitching a ride with cute kids in order to cross over from the wrestling ring and cookie-cutter villain roles to more nuanced fare.

article continues below

Arnold Schwarzenegger did it way back in 1990 with Kindergarten Cop. Hulk Hogan followed suit with Mr. Nanny. Dwayne Johnson donned a tutu for The Tooth Fairy. And John Cena voiced Ferdinand, and starred in last year’s Playing With Fire.

But these bridge films between thug roles and thespian are usually cut from the same flame-retardant cloth: a precocious kid buddies up with an emotionally closed-off lunk of a guy who – spoiler alert – gradually learns how to love again just in time to marry the kid’s single mom. Go in knowing this and you’re all good

It’s Dave Bautista’s turn to play a softie in My Spy. Hot on the heels of his Stuber release, Bautista plays JJ, a former special ops soldier now working for the CIA. When we first meet him, JJ is busting out of a slick suit jacket in the Ukraine, dispatching Russians like a whirling dervish.

The best moments occur in this first scene, as JJ quotes Notting Hill to a cold-blooded killer while another assassin criticizes his questionable Russian accent: “You sound like Mickey Rourke in Iron Man 2.” As the opening credits roll JJ is lamenting the fluffy Eurovision pop all over the radio, and settles for Britney.

Too bad JJ killed everyone off before he could bring vital intel home to his boss (an underused Ken Jeong), who tells him that he’s not cut out for the Intelligence agency: “you have no finesse.” As punishment, JJ is sent on a last-chance mission with Bobbi from tech support (Kristen Schaal), who also happens to be JJ’s number-one fan. Their assignment is to head to Chicago to keep tabs on a young girl and her widowed mom, whose dead husband may have had terrorist ties in France.

They move in to the same apartment building as their targets and set up hidden cameras and the requisite half-dozen video monitors, which always make things look very spy-ish. But before they have even plugged everything in, nine-year-old Sophie (Chloe Coleman) is on to them and has traced the signal right back to them.

JJ suggests killing her, but Bobbi intercedes. Sophie has a better idea in the form of good old-fashioned blackmail: if JJ will take her to an ice-skating party while mom is at work, she’ll forget the whole thing. “I miss dealing with terrorists,” JJ complains. However, the arrangement is mutually beneficial for them both, since Sophie desperately needs friends at her new school and JJ needs to communicate with someone other than his pet fish.

Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) is the most trusting mom ever, abdicating most of her parenting duties to the gruff, mammoth, tattooed stranger a few doors down the hall. Yet somehow the twosome spend enough time together that the movie meanders into rom-com territory, with JJ getting a “Queer Eye” makeover from the gay couple next door and showing off some bull-in-a-china-shop dance moves.

Writers Jon and Erich Hoeber throw in the other required elements here – a car chase, an appearance by the baddie, a kidnapping – and director Peter Segal (50 First Dates) makes sure things hum along smoothly, if predictably. He’s aided in no small part by young Coleman, previously seen in Big Little Lies, who portrays just the right mix of adorable and annoying. Bautista may be the former wrestler, but it’s Coleman who is left to do most of the heavy lifting.

Directed and written by Michael Winterbottom. Starring Steve Coogan, Isla Fisher and David Mitchell. Rating: 5 (out of 10)

In the immortal words of Gordon Gecko, “Greed is good.” But even that totem of Wall Street corruption has nothing on the louche, morally bankrupt Sir Richard McCreadie, billionaire huckster of the low-rent fashion world.

article continues below

Director Michael Winterbottom and frequent collaborator Steve Coogan clearly had a billionaire (or two) in mind with their portrayal of “Greedy” McCreadie: he’s got Richard Branson’s lion’s mane of hair and the reported ethics of controversial fashion billionaire Philip Green. But the message Winterbottom hammers home is accompanied by equally urgent preaching about the plight of Syrian migrants: more than one human rights issue per film and our mind begins to wander and feel guilty about the fact that the chocolate in our theatre munchies isn’t sustainably sourced.

After a public inquiry into his umpteenth declaration of bankruptcy sullies his reputation (and fragile ego), McCreadie decides that the antidote is – what else – a garish display of wealth and excess: a party in Greece to celebrate his 60th birthday. Fittingly for a tyrant, McCreadie’s favourite movie is Gladiator, so a replica colosseum is constructed, togas are made mandatory, and there’s even a real lion thrown in for good measure.

There has been a year’s worth of preparation but nothing goes according to plan leading up to the party, around which the film’s narrative revolves. The colosseum is nowhere near ready and high-profile guests keep cancelling, forcing party planners to hire lookalikes to fill in the gaps (leading to a very funny bit involving George Michael). On top of everything, there are Syrian refugees camped on the public beach, spoiling the view for everyone.

McCreadie’s cash-loving ex (Isla Fisher) enters the fray as do several of his kids, including the withdrawn Finn (Asa Butterfield) and daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson), with a reality film crew in tow. Lily sees nothing wrong with handing out food to homeless migrant children for the benefit of the cameras, then taking it back from them when the crew needs a retake. Unforgiving characters all.

Observing and recording all is McCreadie’s official biographer (Brit comedian David Mitchell). It’s by way of Nick’s interviews and footage that we learn about the fashion mogul’s ignominious rise to fame, from his private school expulsion to bare-knuckles negotiations with Sri Lankan sweatshops. Nick forms a friendship of sorts with hotel employee Amanda (Dinita Gohil), a British ex-pat who still has family working in one of McCreadie’s garment factories; she has a crisis of conscience over working for the billionaire who puts crumbs, not bread, on her family’s table.

There are cameos galore: James Blunt has a moment, as does Stephen Fry; Keira Knightly, Chris Martin and a few British celebs send McCreadie birthday greetings.

Coogan is great as the self-aggrandizing McCreadie, who hurls abuse at his employees with language as dazzling as those too-white teeth of his. But most tycoons and tyrants have an Achilles heel, a soft spot that explains their villainy: a neglectful mother, an abusive father, a childhood spent in poverty. McCreadie has no such weakness, only an insatiable appetite for profit.

By the time our perma-tanned villain tricks the refugees into working his party for free (including one played by Kareem Alkabbani, a former refugee who came to Greece in 2016), we’ve more or less had enough of being manipulated.

But wait! End titles further educate us on the gender gap, the appalling average wages in developing countries, the statistics on migrants to Europe, and the fact that the 26 richest people in the world have as much money as the poorest 3.8 billion.

We knew from the title that we’d be confronting one of the deadly sins; we just didn’t know we’d still be doing penance as the credits rolled.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

The supermodel, actor and businesswoman who co-created ""America’s Next Top Model"" will replace longtime host Tom Bergeron and take on the role of executive producer, ABC said late Tuesday.

In a statement, Banks said she’s a fan of the contest's approach of ""fun mixed with raw emotion, seeing celebrities push past their comfort zones, the sizzling dance performances ... it’s always transported me to my days of turning it up 10 notches on the catwalk.""

Banks lauded Bergeron, host of the show since its 2005 debut, as having set ""a powerful stage"" and said she’s excited to continue the legacy.

Co-host Erin Andrews also is leaving the series, which is getting a ""creative refresh"" while honouring America’s affection for it, ABC said. Andrews was not expected to be replaced.

When the show will get to unveil its new approach in season No. 29 remains clouded by the pandemic-caused production halt affecting the return of most TV series.

The announcement that Banks is joining the show followed word Monday of Bergeron and Andrews’ exits. In a Twitter post, Bergeron called working on ""Dancing With the Stars"" an ""incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career.""

Last year, Bergeron drew attention when he expressed concern over the show’s decision to include former White House press secretary Sean Spicer among the contestants for last fall's season.

Bergeron tweeted then that he had suggested to producers the new season be a ""joyful respite from our exhausting political climate"" and urged them to avoid ""divisive bookings.""

ABC thanked the departing Bergeron for his ""trademark wit and charm"" that helped the show succeed and Andrews for her sense of humour.

He also said the couple's tempestuous marriage broke down for good after an incident in which he accused Heard or one of her friends of defecating in the couple's bed.

article continues below

""I thought that was an oddly fitting end to the relationship,"" he said.

Depp was concluding almost four days of evidence in his libel case against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of physically abusing Heard. The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a ""wife-beater.""

In the High Court witness box, Depp has described a volatile relationship with Heard that descended into screaming matches which sometimes turned physical. But he has strongly denied hitting Heard and accused her of compiling a dossier of fake claims against him as an ""insurance policy.""

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy ""The Rum Diary"" and married in Los Angeles in February 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year and obtained a restraining order against Depp on the grounds of domestic abuse. The divorce was finalized in 2017.

Depp said one of the triggers for the couple's separation came when a cleaner found feces in a bed at their Los Angeles penthouse the morning after Heard's 30th birthday party in April 2016. Heard claims the couple fought after the party and Depp threw a magnum wine bottle at her. He denies it.

Heard blamed one of the couple's Yorkshire terriers, Pistol and Boo, for the defecation incident, but Depp was convinced a person had done it.

""It was not left by a three- or four-pound dog. I was convinced that it was either Ms Heard herself or one of her cohorts involved in leaving human feces on the bed,"" he said.

He said he initially laughed at the ""absurd"" incident, with one text message referring to ""Amber Turd.""

But soon after, he said, he realized that the marriage couldn't be saved.

""I wanted nothing to do with her,"" Depp said.

The court was read a text message Depp sent Heard after their separation in which he sent ""all my love and regrets ... I wish you nothing but good.""

""That is what I felt,"" he said. ""I didn’t think there needed to be any poison at that time, because the bad part was over, which was the relationship, and now we just had to finish it.""

By June 2016, however, Depp said he had become ""quite bitter"" because he felt he was being publicly depicted as ""a wife beater.""

Heard obtained a restraining order against Depp in May 2016, claiming he'd hit her and thrown a cellphone at her during an argument, bruising her cheek. Depp denies the allegation.

""I went, if you’ll forgive the analogy, from Cinderella to Quasimodo in 0.6 seconds and I was without a voice,"" he said.

That August, Depp wrote in a text to an associate that Heard was ""begging for total global humiliation ... She's gonna get it.""

The Sun’s defence relies on a total of 14 allegations by Heard of Depp’s violence between 2013 and 2016, in settings including his private island in the Bahamas, a rented house in Australia and a private jet. He strongly denies all of them.

Under cross-examination by The Sun’s lawyer, Sasha Wass, Depp depicted a tumultuous relationship with Heard during a period when he was trying to kick drugs and alcohol, and sometimes lapsing.

He recalled telling Heard several times: ""Listen, we are a crime scene waiting to happen."" But he denied being violent.

The Sun's lawyer alleged that during a fight at the LA penthouse in December 2015, Depp, in ""an uncontrollable rage,"" trashed Heard’s wardrobe, threw a decanter at her, slapped her, pulled her by the hair and headbutted her, causing two black eyes.

Depp claimed Heard was the aggressor, and he had only tried to restrain her ""to stop her flailing and punching me."" He conceded he might have headbutted her, but only by accident, and denied causing her injuries.

Depp also rejected Heard’s claim that he subjected her to a ""three-day ordeal of assaults"" in March 2015 in Australia, where Depp was appearing as Captain Jack Sparrow in the fifth ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film.

He agreed that the couple had an altercation, which ended up with their house being trashed and Depp’s fingertip being severed to the bone.

Depp accuses Heard of cutting off his fingertip by throwing a vodka bottle at him. She denies being in the room when the digit was severed.

A short section of Friday’s hearing, which related to allegations of sexual violence, was heard in private after the judge agreed to a request by The Sun’s lawyers.

Near the end of his testimony, Depp was asked by his lawyer, David Sherborne, about medical notes from August 2014 that referred to Heard's ""history of substance abuse,"" including an addiction to cocaine. The notes said Heard experienced anxiety, insecurity and jealousy and had ""severe outbursts of anger and rage.""

The lawyer asked Depp whether the description tallied with his experience of Heard.

""Yes,"" Depp said.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to testify next week.",[]

So Binkley and his wife and business partner Michelle headed to Europe for a year, making stops in Italy and Spain, to rediscover his muse.

article continues below

Upon returning, the North Vancouver resident opened up his new studio and gallery at #12 – 38936 Queens Way in Squamish. The couple had owned the space for years, Binkley said, but felt it was an appropriate time to start making use of it. He's been in the space since September, dedicating six months to getting it set up and ready to produce and display his work.

""I've really enjoyed the space,"" he said. ""Now, we're just making our foray into the community and trying to connect with people.

""We intend to integrate ourselves more into the community in the coming months.""

Unable to hold a proper grand opening for because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Binkley has instead opted to start a Summer Saturdays in the Studio series, where the studio will be open to the public between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Saturdays in July and August (with the exception of Aug. 8).

There were seven visitors for the opening event on July 4.

""Because it's not in a commercial area, we can't rely on walk-by traffic, so that's why Michelle and I had this idea this past week to dedicate one of the days of the weekend this summer to be here and generate some interest in the new space that we have,"" he said.

Binkley set up in the space shortly after returning from Europe, as living abroad was a goal for the couple for years before they took the plunge. As part of the sojourn, Binkley worked in Italy and did a two-month residency at the Kitty Harri Sculpture Garden in Andalusia, Spain.

""My creativity had been greatly compromised and needed some sort of jump-start, so we decided that being in Europe for a year would satisfy that,"" he said. ""I'm much more energized and that year abroad was crucial in rediscovering my muse.

""The outward stresses that we were dealing with in years prior resulted in me not getting any artistic inspiration happening at all.""

Binkley said inspiration can strike at any time, and that his sources can vary, as he draws on his observations of the world.

Being back in Florence, he said, was just what he needed, as it was where he fell in love with sculpting 40 years ago after primarily pursuing two-dimensional mediums such as drawing and painting.

When abroad, Binkley is somewhat limited in what he can work on, given that his electrical tools, for example, do not work in Europe. However, he has embraced virtual sculpting, where he designs a piece on the computer and it is produced by either a 3D printer or a CNC robot arm.

""I'm able to be mobile with my computer and still create sculptures,"" he said.

""It does speak to an age-old methodology of creating stone sculptures and that is, for centuries, craftsmen created marble sculptures from clay masters that were done by the artist,"" he said, noting that French artist Auguste Rodin operated that way. ""In other words, for centuries, humans acted like robots to copy an artist's creation in clay and transpose it into stone.""

Before taking interest in virtual sculpting, Binkley did not work with clay models, instead embracing direct sculpting.

""I pick up my tools, approach a block of stone and take away what's not supposed to be there,"" he said. ""If I make a mistake, then it's on me and I've got to start over.""

Also on display in the gallery are Binkley's haiku drawings, taking inspiration from the word's translation of ""cutting."" The drawings are black on white paper, with Binkley creating female nudes using 17 vector lines instead of the poem's 17 words.

""Haiku poems have two themes and the theme of the poem is usually cutting two dramatically different ideas,"" he said. ""I decided to use the two colours of black and white, so the black cuts the white and that's satisfying the theme of the haiku poetry in that respect.""

Visitors are able to get a taste and try sculpting marble during a visit, and Binkley said the only preparation they need is to wear casual clothing, since it can get dusty.

Binkley's wife and business partner Michelle said holding open houses was commonplace at the former studio space, though not in recent years, which she described as a time of transition.

""For 25 years, we've been involved in our community. We like to reach out and get people interested in art,"" she said. ""We chose Squamish for two reasons: one is that being close to nature is pretty important for us, and also, it came down to cost. What we could afford in Vancouver isn't as much square footage as we could get in Squamish.""

Then, as he puts it, a few months later everyone else sort of did as well.

Or, at least, they found themselves stuck at home a whole lot more.

article continues below

“It’s been interesting,” he says, of retiring as co-owner of Couch Potato furniture in North Vancouver last fall. “Everything becomes comedy for me, but the joke is we retired at the end of October – and then in March, everybody else did.”

He jests, though as a longtime business owner himself he’s also highly sympathetic to the fact that COVID-19 has wrecked the bottom line for scores of places across the country. Whether they want to retire or not, many business owners, proprietors and staff are reckoning with the reality they may be forced to close up shop sooner rather than later.

Morrison wants to prevent that from happening by doing what he does best – getting people to laugh.

On July 10, he’s organized an online stand-up comedy showcase called Life Is Still Funny, with proceeds earmarked to support the Corner Stone Bistro in Pemberton Heights, one of his favourite local restaurants.

“When we worked over there, it was a place that we went to,” says Morrison. “First of all, the food is fantastic. It’s a hidden gem.”

The digital show, which is being broadcast via Zoom, will feature six comedians, including Morrison, as they get people laughing and hooting from the comfort of home, reminding them that although times are tough, things can still be hilarious.

“The name changed from Life Is Funny to Life Is Still Funny, and that’s with the pandemic in mind. There’s still things in life that are funny and you can still enjoy life,” says Morrison.

Inspired by the sharp banter of Johnny Carson and the “What’s-the-deal-with-…?” observational stylings of Jerry Seinfeld, Morrison braved the impossible and jumped headfirst into his first comedy class in 2007.

He recalls getting a kick during an exercise that involved making observations about fellow classmates that turned into a commentary on Morrison’s older age relative to the others.

“Everybody was getting weird stuff and ripped, but with me, because I’m older, they just said he looks like he’d be a very good grandpa, or a nice dad – all these pleasant things,” he says. “About as far off as it got was: ‘He looks like he’d be the guy on the strata council who would be overly concerned with the lawn.’”

Morrison was hooked. Shortly after that class ended, he booked a showcase at Lafflines Comedy Club in New Westminster, featuring plenty of other talent including himself, and sold out the venue. Then he basically retired from comedy until 2016.

But in the years leading up to his retirement, he started getting back into it, seeing it as an opportunity to have a good time and get others laughing when he had more time on his hands.

“Even the last year our store was open, I did almost 100 shows,” he says.

A classic example of a Morrison joke involves riffing on him being “the oldest guy on stage,” he says, noting that he started going bald when was 21and has always looked older than his years.

“I got the results of my annual physical last week and the doctor told me I was healthy for my age, but she looked at me and she got serious and she said, ‘But Ray, at the age that you look, you had better start living life one day at a time,’” he quips. “I stopped buying green bananas right away; I only buy the travel size toiletries now; Everyday when I get in the car I put $2.20 worth of gas in – I don’t mind dying but I’m not going to die with a full tank of gas.”

His real comedic joy, however, comes from organizing the comedy show itself and giving plenty of opportunities for other comics to ply their craft.

In addition to Friday’s digital show, Morrison, who lives in Burnaby, has also organized benefit gigs for both a consignment furniture store and restaurant in New Westminster, as well as another restaurant in Burnaby.

All of the proceeds for the Corner Stone Bistro gig will go to support the restaurant. And while the evening will be light-hearted and hilarious, its aim is serious, notes Morrison.

“I know as a business owner they got a long road ahead, especially with restaurants,” he says. “It’s not over, this is when they need us the most.”

Life Is Still Funny, a digital stand-up comedy show in support of Corner Stone Bistro in North Vancouver, Friday, July 10 @ 8 p.m. Zoom link will be sent an hour before showtime. Tickets: $10. Go to Eventbrite.ca and type in “Cornerstone” for more information or to purchase tickets.",[]

So she pivoted. Over the course of three days in Toronto, just before heading to Bowen to isolate with her family, Spear recorded her first digital-release EP, Morning & Melancholia. Where there would’ve been studio musicians, there’s just Spear and the producer, engineer and player of steel pedal, guitar and piano Aaron Goldstein.

article continues below

A single from the EP, “If I had Wings,” was released this week while the entire four-song EP is coming out July 31.

Folk with a bit of country and a bit of bluegrass, Spear described her latest endeavour.

Spear grew up on Bowen playing a lot of music with her family. Her mom (Dyan) brought her to bluegrass camp in Sorrento and her dad (Ted) taught her how to play guitar. After high school, Spear moved to Montreal and was quietly playing music until two years ago.

After a bad breakup, Spear decided to put her music out into the world. “It was just a way to work through those feelings,” said Spear. “I was like, ‘I’ve got nothing to lose, I’m just going to start releasing music.’”

After an ex-partner died in a car accident, Spear started writing about that. “It’s just been a way to self soothe and work through things that are going on in my life,” she reflected.

The title of the EP Spear adapted from Sigmund Freud’s 1918 essay “Mourning and melancholia” about the ways people experience grief.

“Grief is such an interesting thing and it changes day to day,” said Spear.

She clarified that the title isn’t to endorse Freud’s larger body of work but rather she used the book to consider her own grief and mourning. “Music, it’s a source of comfort for me,” said Spear. “It’s nice to create a song and then…if it was written in a moment of deep sadness or whatever it was, to move away from that and then come to it anew and experience it in a different way.

“A theme that I talk about in the EP is when someone passes away being the sole keeper of a shared memory and how memory changes.

“When you only have one side of the story, it’s like a great weight and responsibility to get it right and remember it right,” said Spear. “Because our memories are so slippery.""

Spear signed with the American label Secretly Canadian and the Canadian label Royal Mountain and had been all set for the album when COVID disrupted the everyone’s plans.

“This period has been a very interesting time for musicians because people are working with limits,” said Spear. “There’s this idea that if you’re making a big record, then you go somewhere to do it and you use people from L.A. like I’m doing, but that’s not the way that has to be.”

“I think what I’m learning is how many resources I have all around me all the time and how creating a sense of community in music is so important and to work with people that are close to you.”

Now, for the first time in a decade, Spear is back living with her family on Bowen, including her older siblings, Bowen’s filmmaking twins known as the Spear Sisters (who filmed part of the music video for “If I Had Wings.”)

“I look up to my parents and my sisters so much and they are just always working and creating so I guess that fostered this need to make things,” said Spear. “ But I’ve also always had such support from them and the community growing up here.

“I think you have a twisted sense of how you’re doing because everyone’s just so behind you.”

But also on Spear’s mind these days is the style of music she plays as a white musician in Canada. “I’ve been doing a lot of research on the history of bluegrass and country and folk and there’s a lot of Black artists that have been teaching me a lot about the true history and the erasure of Black artists within the genres that I play,” she said. “That’s definitely been on my mind. And something I think that all musicians should consider.”

“It’s made me want to reconsider my position in the industry and make sure that I’m elevating [Black, Indigenous and People of Colour] voices as much as I can,” she said. “Also figuring out systems of oppression within the music industry and understanding how to dismantle them and also paying tribute to the people that shaped the music that I play like Arnold Schulz…the true father of Bluegrass.”

Spear is donating her share of the royalties from “If I had Wings” to the following organizations: Taking What We Need, Vancouver Black Therapy and Advocacy Fund and Black Women in Motion.

Kelly Peterson told The Canadian Press that as trustee of the late musician's estate, she's always looking for ways to further his legacy and welcomes the effort by a Montreal man to see her late husband recognized.

A petition launched last week by Naveed Hussain calling on the city to rename the Lionel-Groulx metro station after Peterson, who grew up in the nearby Little Burgundy neighbourhood, has been gaining steam with more than 15,000 signatures.

""I love the idea, I love the idea of Oscar being honoured,"" Peterson said on Thursday. ""It always really warms my heart and thrills me to see him being remembered ... and to have so many people in the neighbourhood in which he grew up wanting to honour him and remember him that way is really overwhelming.""

But the City of Montreal and the city's transit agency have said that renaming a metro station is complicated and not likely to happen.

The Montreal Transit Corp. has had a moratorium on name changes since 2006 and has only ever made five name changes since opening. A spokesman said stations are typically named after the streets or nearby landmarks.

A previous grassroots attempt to rename the station for Peterson in 2008, shortly after the musician's death, did not succeed.

In Montreal, a concert hall at Concordia University bears Peterson's name as does a park not far from the Lionel-Groulx station. There's also a mural across from the green space in Little Burgundy near the metro station inaugurated in 2010.

A city spokeswoman indicated this week officials would be open to finding a different way of honouring the jazz legend whose career spanned more than 60 years.

Just last year, the city honoured Peterson's late sister, Daisy Peterson-Sweeney, an accomplished music teacher, with her own park in the neighbourhood.

""I would be delighted and thrilled and honoured if the city wanted to do something to honour Oscar even more,"" Peterson said. ""It's not something I ever expect from anyone — I don't just mean Montreal — Oscar was always humbled by every honour he received, and I feel the same way.""

Kelly Peterson's focus has been on promoting his musical legacy — the songs that he recorded and played, but more recently, those he composed himself so that people can see a more complete version of Oscar Peterson.

""People play Bach, people play Beethoven, I want people to play Oscar Peterson,"" she said. ""I've always felt that his music will outlive all of us: People will be listening to Oscar's music 100 years from now, so it would be nice if there are other things that represent him as well.""

Oscar Peterson does have schools named for him in the Ontario communities of Mississauga and Stouffville, as well as a small square in Toronto's financial district.

But Kelly Peterson, who lives in southern Ontario, added it's not for her to get involved in Montreal city politics or change its policies.

""I don't live there, I don't feel I have the right to get involved in something that has an impact on the residents, and I'm not one of them,"" she said. ""But the honour? Absolutely, I love it.""

700,nsnews,https://www.nsnews.com/entertainment/jazz-world-mourns-bandleader-hugh-fraser-1.24156636,Jazz world mourns bandleader Hugh Fraser,['Mike Devlin'],,"Hugh Fraser’s reputation as a jazz musician and educator was such that when he spoke, everyone listened intently. But when the pianist and trombone player performed, he could communicate volumes without saying a word.

Fraser, whose career spanned several decades and countries, died Wednesday at 61 after a long battle with cancer.

As news of the death of the Vancouver-based musician — who was born in Victoria and taught at the University of Victoria and Victoria Conservatory of Music — spreads through the jazz community, tributes have been pouring in from across North America.

“It’s really hard to quantify the impact he had on the music world,” Qualicum musician Phil Dwyer, a longtime friend and collaborator, told the Times Colonist. “He was somewhat of a rarity in terms of a Canadian musician who wasn’t from Toronto. He established himself wherever he went by creating his own reality. It was a remarkable gravitational force that he exuded, in being able to attract people simply by his enthusiasm and passion for music.”

The son of a percussionist with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, Fraser took up drums at the age of six before moving on to piano and trombone, for which he was best known. His talent as a composer was evident early on, and Fraser later turned that skill into several prestigious teaching appointments at the Royal Academy of Music in London, England and the Banff Centre of Fine Arts in Alberta.

Fraser also held key positions in the jazz departments at both the University of Victoria and the Victoria Conservatory of Music during the early 2000s. “Jazz musician is too limiting,” Dwyer said of Fraser’s creative range. “He was a musician. He was an educator. He was a mentor. And he was a dear friend to hundreds of musicians around the world.”

Dwyer started playing with Fraser in 1982, when he was 16. Fraser, who was 23 at the time, had already established himself as one of the foremost bandleaders and musicians in the country.

As “the new guy,” Dwyer said he made plenty of mistakes, but Fraser — in what would come to be his trademark as a bandleader — never stopped encouraging him.

Fraser had formed the Vancouver Ensemble of Jazz Improvisation (VEJI), a 13-piece big band that functioned as a musical co-operative, in 1980. Out of that lineup came the Hugh Fraser Quintet, which won Fraser and his collaborators Juno Awards for jazz in 1989 and 1998.

Qualicum bassist Ken Lister, who met Fraser in 1979 when they were both students at Vancouver Community College, joined Fraser’s creative circle in 1995, and remembers his friend with fondness.

“He was the kind of guy who could enliven a room,” Lister told the Times Colonist. “Most of my memories are laughing my head off with this guy.”

Fraser’s group of collaborators and eccentrics resembled a gang more than a group — some of the first gigs VEJI played after forming were in East Vancouver lofts, with punk-rock types milling about.

During one early gig, they performed dressed in emergency-room scrubs lifted from a Vancouver hospital.

By the late 1990s, VEJI was known in jazz circles worldwide. Lloyd Axworthy, Canada’s minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, was an avowed fan, and Fraser shrewdly used that as an opportunity to secure “diplomatic tours” of Canadian embassies in the United Kingdom, South America, Central America and Australia. “I used to jokingly refer to VEJI as the Foreign Legion,” Lister said. “We would say: ‘Join up, and see the world!’ ”

Lister played with Fraser last summer at Frankie’s Jazz Club in Vancouver, in a show that was recorded for a potential new album. On the recording, which features new compositions from Fraser, the bandleader was in fine form, Lister said. “He sounds so strong. I remember he was struggling off the bandstand, but once he was sitting behind the piano, he looked and sounded great.”

Fraser talked occasionally about playing more gigs, but his health took a sudden and serious turn last week. He had been diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in 2016, but was being treated with radiation and chemotherapy.

“I never heard him sound like he was giving up,” Lister said. “I was surprised when died. He had been fighting for a long time and was always keeping the sunny side up.”

Musician Nick La Riviere was in high school when Fraser took him on as one of his first jazz students at the Victoria Conservatory of Music.

In a statement provided to the Times Colonist, the multi-instrumentalist recalled Fraser’s “bombastic, energetic style of playing,” which inspired the young trombonist to emulate his teacher when he became a professional. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him play a show where he wasn’t giving it everything he had, and he had a lot. His passion for music was contagious, and I know he’s inspired many other musicians to make it their career.”

Fraser was always adventurous — he led a 13-piece big band through treatments of Jimi Hendrix music in 2007 — and his desire to push the envelope of what jazz represents will be his lasting legacy, Dwyer said.

“There are certain people who create something where there was nothing before. He single-handedly created an entirely new music scene in Vancouver. He expanded the parameters of what was possible.

“If you were a young musician coming up in Canada prior to Hugh Fraser, you might have a certain view of what might be possible, in terms of having a career as a creative musician in this country. If you were coming up in the country after 1987, when he was touring internationally and making records, the scope of what he had proven to be possible was vastly larger and more exciting than what had existed before.”

Fraser is survived by his longtime partner, trumpeter Lorae Farrell, and his son, James.

It is yet another business that won’t be surviving the COVID-19 closures.

The six-screen multiplex first opened back in 1988. In recent years, management had seemingly figured out the plot twists of the Netflix era by screening first-run blockbusters alongside indies, classic screen gems, film festival selections, and student films, creating a community atmosphere in the process. When my son was born, my wife attended “Stars and Strollers” matinees, specific screenings for moms with screaming babies.

After an impressive 31-year run down on Brooksbank Avenue, the Park & Tilford shall be missed by many. The theatre’s demise sent me on an extended flashback into the colourful, century-old history of North and West Vancouver movie theatres.

The first-ever theatre to open on the North Shore was the Lonsdale, a grandiose, 800-seat ornate hall at 1545 Lonsdale (now an HSBC Bank), opening in 1911 to great fanfare. It would serve as an opera house, vaudeville theatre, concert hall and movie theatre until its closure in 1952.

Down the hill were two smaller theatres that opened a few months later in 1912, within a few doors of each other on West First Avenue, both featuring silent films accompanied by live music. First was the Gem Motion Picture Theatre, which only lasted a few years, and next to it was the more successful Empire Theatre, which ran until 1935.

North Van’s first Hollywood-era movie house was the Nova Theatre, at 1421 Lonsdale Avenue, which is now Jack Lonsdale’s Pub. It opened in 1938 with a showing of James Stewart’s Seventh Heaven.

In 1946, the Odeon theatre chain took over the Nova and erected a large, Hollywood-style vertical neon sign that could be seen for blocks up and down Lonsdale. Odeon ran the 640-seat theatre until 1958, when they pulled out to cash in on the drive-in movie craze of the late 1950s, opening the North Shore’s only drive-in down at 300 Pemberton Ave.

For the next 20 years, so many North Shore teenagers snuck in to the drive-in in car trunks, and over, under, and through fences, clandestinely catching everything from The Blob to Goldfinger to Planet of the Apes, that it’s hard to find anyone who actually paid admission. The drive-in screened its last outdoor picture show in 1978.

This King Kong knockoff was so terrible that kids were throwing drinks at the screen, according to North Shore News photographer Mike Wakefield.

Back up on Lonsdale, the Odeon Theatre sat dark for six years until it reemerged under the name of the Totem Theatre in 1964 with a grand opening of Fate Is The Hunter starring Canadian actor Glenn Ford.

Many North Van moviegoers remember the Totem with mixed emotions, including award-winning North Shore News photographer Mike Wakefield. In the mid-1970s at around the age of 9, he clearly recalls suffering through a low-budget King Kong rip-off called A*P*E at the Totem. The movie was so bad that the kids threw everything they could at the screen, including popcorn and drinks. A few rows ahead of Mike, a fight broke out, during which a prosthetic leg was used as a weapon. It’s a silhouette that has been branded in Mike’s brain ever since.

On Mike’s 11th birthday, his dad unwittingly dropped him off with his friends at the Totem for a matinee showing of the X-rated David Cronenberg parasite-sex-horror film Shivers. The Totem Theatre closed in 1978.

Up in Lynn Valley, there was a quirky, family-run movie house called the Cedar Theatre (or Cedar V, or Cedar View) that opened in 1953. It was located in an odd, Quonset-hut-shaped hangar-like building at 1260 Lynn Valley Rd. (now a Scotiabank), and showed everything from first-run films like Burt Lancaster’s The Swimmer to B- and C-movie double features like Devil’s Canyon and Let’s Go Stepping. Every weekend through the 1950s, kids formed huge lines snaking around the corner of Lynn Valley Road and Mountain Highway to catch double feature matinees the likes of The Lone Ranger, Tarzan and The Three Stooges.

Over in West Van, the earliest theatre was the Hollyburn, located at 1750 Marine Dr., which is now Home Hardware. The Hollyburn was owned by future West Van mayor Howard Fletcher and was built in regal style by his father-in-law, the famous builder Albert Snider, also responsible for the Lost Lagoon fountain and what is now the Vancouver Art Gallery. The Hollyburn opened in 1926 as an 800-seat vaudeville theatre complete with balcony, eventually evolving into a full-time movie house. The Hollyburn closed in the early 1960s.

The longest continuously running theatre in the history of North Shore movie houses was the beloved West Van Odeon, located at 1565 Marine Dr. in the heart of Ambleside. It opened as a one-screen, 768-seat theatre in 1948, showing films like Red River and Key Largo. The West Van landmark eventually subdivided into three very narrow theatres, and lasted until 1991, a full 43 years. It is positively etched into the movie-going memories of generations of West Vancouverites, including mine.

As a kid in the 1970s, I can fondly recall the Odeon’s crowded, dimly lit and carpeted lobby, the staccato sound of the overflowing popcorn machine competing with the anticipatory hubbub of ticket holders eager to catch JAWS, Star Wars, or Halloween, none of which I was allowed to see. On weekend matinees, if it was your birthday, they’d bring you up on stage. In 1977, a couple of West Van teens cheekily rearranged the marquee from Slapshot to Slapshit. You can imagine the reaction of many an upper crust Ambleside shopper the next morning. In 1979, West Van Secondary’s graduating class – featuring future mayor and MP Pamela Goldsmith-Jones – took their grad photo wearing togas under the marquee that read Animal House.

By the summer of 1982, I was 11 years old and had finally earned parental permission to see movies at the Odeon with friends. E.T. had landed. The film became so popular that it eventually took over all three screens. I distinctly remember my friend (future MLA and current Education Minister) Rob Fleming and I loving E.T. so much that when it was over, we got right back in line to see it again. And again. And again.

A year or two later, Beverly Hills Cop blasted into the Odeon, but alas, it was rated R. That didn’t stop me from convincing my future Smugglers bandmate Nick Thomas to go along with my scheme of purchasing tickets to Annie in Theatre 1, and then slipping into Theatre 2 to howl at Eddie Murphy at his best. We crouched low in our seats to avoid the sweeping beam of the usher’s flashlight, and loved every minute of it.

A few blocks east was the fancier Park Royal Theatres(where Whole Foods is now). With its floor-to-ceiling front glass windows, long white curtains, and lobby festooned with tropical plants, it felt like you were entering a fancy hotel.

The Park Royal opened in 1966 with pictures like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and The Sand Pebbles. In 1985, I saw Witness starring Harrison Ford at this theatre, but missed the climax due to a ruffian behind me shoving a jumbo-sized popcorn box over my head. I was with Chris Monahan, son of swashbuckling Canucks forward Garry Monahan. Chris chased the offender through the lobby to the sidewalk out front, where he laid a Slapshot-like beating on him until an usher in a bow tie intervened.

The Park Royal Theatre temporarily closed in 1993. It sat dark for four years until the second-run Caprice Theatre chain took over briefly in the late-1990s, trying to bring back the “double feature” concept, which flopped. The theatre closed permanently in 1999.

The focus for the North Shore’s film-going audience was pulled back to North Van, with modern multiplexes like the Esplanade 6 and the Park & Tilford. The Esplanade opened its doors in 1990 across the street from Lonsdale Quay and ran for 28 years, closing in 2019. The theatre drew a negative international spotlight in 1997 for a front row, execution-style shooting murder during a screening of the gangster film Donnie Brasco.

With Park & Tilford’s closure, it means that, for the first time since 1911, the North Shore has but one movie house: the fancy, boozy, reserved seating Cineplex Cinemas Park Royal and VIP, which opened in 2019, but remains temporarily closed due to COVID-19.

While we wait to once again savour the smell of hot buttered lobby popcorn, the dimming house lights and glorious wide screen, it’s important to remember that those original North Shore theatres like the Gem, the Empire, and the Lonsdale were all closed during the 1918-'19 global pandemic.

Take heart in the fact that they all reopened soon after, dancing their way into the Roaring Twenties, the talkies, and eventually the Golden Age of Hollywood.

And so as we sit at home, tapped out on Netflix, may we never again take for granted settling into our seats for the collective experience of onscreen magic, when we can laugh, gasp, cry, and cheer, together.

See you at the movies!

Since the COVID-19 pandemic brought live performances and large gatherings to a halt in March, the theatre team has been working to figure out its approach for the future. Now it’s taking its first cautious steps towards welcoming the public back inside.

article continues below

“You can’t just go from zero to 60; you have to figure it out,” said executive director Jessica Schneider. “At the same time, we can’t just wait until everything’s normal again. We can’t go without culture for that long. We can’t go without the arts.”

Schneider is quick to note that doesn’t mean the theatre will simply throw open its doors and host large shows again. With public health directives around physical distancing top of mind, the theatre team is going out of its way to keep people apart while bringing them together.

For the first stage of its reopening, the theatre will open just the Plaskett Gallery and lobby area. The area will be divided into three zones, and visitors will be allowed to book times to attend with a small group from their “bubble.” The small groups will be able to take in an artist’s talk, look at the work and then leave.

The gallery then plans to add a performance portion to the visit. The gallery is recruiting local performers of all kinds – musicians, magicians, comedians, spoken word artists and more – so that visitors can enjoy a show on their way through.

No, it won’t be like sitting down for a full-scale show in the theatre – but it’s a start.

“Any amount of time that you get a performance and some beautiful art is better than nothing,” Schneider said.

Those performers aren’t all programmed yet, but Schneider noted the theatre wants to focus on New Westminster artists in an attempt to provide opportunities for artists and economic recovery for the local cultural sector.

As the month unfolds, Schneider and her team also have their sights set on “date night” events – which are planned to give couples a chance to enjoy a glass of wine, take in a reserved dinner at a local restaurant and do some kind of neighbourhood walking tour along with their night at the gallery. Similar family adventures will be set up that include some sort of virtual “scavenger hunt” for the kids.

Schneider noted the theatre team wants to help people increase their sense of trust in the idea of going out – not just to the theatre itself, but around the community and into local businesses.

“It’s just getting people out, moving around. It’s like that escape. It’s like a vacation – you’re not just doing your errands and going home and locking your doors again,” Schneider said.

She hopes events like the date nights and family scavenger hunts can help to add some vibrancy to the community and help the business community build some momentum again.

“We’re looking at really heavy hits on the business community,” she said. “We can’t do their street festivals and everything this year, but we can sort of replace it.”

As they start up the first programming in June, Schneider and her team are also looking at how they’ll be able to use both the Massey Theatre and the Anvil Centre Theatre over the longer term.

Like the rest of the province, the theatre sector is guided by public health directives – and so far, those are still limiting gatherings to an upper limit of 50 people.

Schneider says the Massey Theatre, with more than 1,200 seats, is perfectly positioned to take on some physically distanced performances because it has more than enough room to keep people apart – even when that 50-person limit is raised to a higher number at some future point.

Schneider pointed out that many smaller venues can’t operate right now because they don’t have enough space to keep their audiences physically distanced, so it’s going to be up to large venues like the Massey to pick up a lot of smaller-scale performances – theatre, dance, musical theatre and more.

With national and international touring shows out of the picture for the indefinite future, Schneider’s focus is on B.C. artists. She foresees the Massey being able to work with many artists and arts groups that it might not typically have worked with in the past.

“I think we’ll be really fortunate in New Westminster,” she said. “We’ll have a huge variety of things you used to have to travel downtown for.”

Schneider is confident the theatre will be able to find audiences for shows again, noting there are a large number of people who’ve been missing their chance to get out and connect with live performances.

For Schneider, nothing can replace the emotions that come along with the shared experience of theatre.

“The feelings you have when you’re watching a show are personal, but they’re shared. It’s not just your feelings you’re feeling; it’s the human condition you’re feeling,” she said.

And having artists to give voice to the human experience in the midst of, and emerging from, the COVID-19 pandemic? That, too, is something Schneider can’t wait to share.

“There’ll be some beauty and some joy, and some chance to reflect what we’ve all been going through,” she said. “I can’t wait to see what artists will bring.”

Gold, the president and CEO of Toronto-based The Management Trust, said his return was finalized Monday. He has since been busy getting up to speed while looking ahead to a variety of potential Hip projects.

article continues below

""I think of it as this is like the Beatles of Canada,"" Gold said Wednesday. ""You have this massive amount of catalogue. There's tons of unreleased tracks, there's videos, there's footage, there's just a lot of stuff and there's a lot to do.

""This is where you can get really creative.""

Gold started working with the Hip in 1986 and managed the band as it built a strong following thanks to a stream of rock radio hits and classic albums like ""Up to Here,"" ""Road Apples"" and ""Fully Completely.""

The five band members: singer Gord Downie, drummer Johnny Fay, bassist Gord Sinclair and guitarists Paul Langlois and Rob Baker, quickly moved from clubs and theatres to sold-out arenas. The Hip went on to become one of the biggest bands in the country.

Gold's first run as manager lasted until 2003. The Hip continued to release albums and tour regularly until 2016, the year that Downie's terminal cancer diagnosis became public.

The Hip had one final tour that summer and capped it with a hometown show in Kingston, Ont. Downie died the following year.

Gold, 62, succeeds co-managers Bernie Breen and Patrick Sambrook, who spent the last 15 years with the band. The former ""Canadian Idol"" judge will also be working with the Downie family on the late singer's unreleased solo material.

""In the words of Peaches and Herb, 'We're reunited and it feels so good,'"" the band said in a statement. ""We are all very happy to be back working with our original dance partner and architect, Jake Gold and The Management Trust.""

Downie's brother, Patrick, also issued a statement.

""The Downie family is very happy to be reuniting with Jake. We see no better person to serve the legacy and future works of Gord Downie and of The Tragically Hip. We are truly excited for everyone, especially for the fans.""

Under Gold's management, the Hip also released hit studio albums ""Day for Night,"" ""Trouble at the Henhouse,"" and ""Phantom Power,"" during a remarkable 1990s run that locked in their status as Canadian music heavyweights.

""I think in a lot of ways it's pretty obvious for me,"" Gold said of his return. ""You know, it's part of my legacy. So when I heard that the former managers resigned, I was like, 'There's only one guy that should be taking this over.'

""I went to the guys and I said, 'It should be me.'""

A voicemail message left with Bernie Breen Management was not immediately returned.

Gold, who said he always stayed in touch with the band members and attended several shows on the final tour, described his current duties as an ""archaeological dig.""

""There's a lot of getting up to speed and at the same time trying to keep things moving forward too,"" he said.

The Hip have issued new vinyl editions of older records and released commemorative re-issues over the last few years.

Gold said one of his immediate special projects will be seeing what can be discovered for the 30th anniversary of ""Road Apples"" in 2021. He added there is a lot of unique content from the sessions for that album and throughout the band's career.

""Johnny and I were going through a lot of it last night,"" Gold said. ""Even we're discovering stuff. To put a number on (the recordings) I think would be unfair right now.

""There's also a lot of different versions where they demoed the song four different times and then it finally made it on a record, or they demoed it five different times and it never made it on a record.""

Sinclair, whose debut solo album ""Taxi Dancers,"" came out in February, recently released a new version of a popular Hip bootleg track ""Get Back Again"" as a charity single.

It's just one example of an unreleased Hip tune that may be considered for a potential fresh release in the future.

""We certainly did a demo version of it. And it is kicking around somewhere, we just haven't been able to find the actual version of it,"" Sinclair said in a recent interview. ""So it does exist. It would be great to revisit a lot of that old Hip stuff that never saw the light of day. There's quite a bit of it.""

Gold said there's much more than just music to be explored. He added the amount of Hip memorabilia — old photos, posters, T-shirts and the like — is significant.

""The stuff I love to do is to get creative and work with the guys,"" Gold said. ""You can do a lot of things, especially with their catalogue. Their catalogue is cemented in the Canadian fabric.""

Noting the sparkling descriptions present in “Masquerade,” author Wiley Ho’s story about the things left said and unsaid between two old friends at a fancy dinner, contest judge Eileen Cook commended the piece as being as “intoxicating as the Champagne served at the party.”

article continues below

Ho, a longtime North Shore resident, says her story deals with the various shades of addiction, whether it’s being lost to substance use, addicted to a certain lifestyle, or drawn to the workaholic’s curse of striving endlessly towards some vague notion of success.

In “Masquerade,” one of the characters has had good luck with getting clean and sober, and even more luck with becoming something akin to successful in the aftermath of addiction.

She’s had less luck when it comes to men.

When her longtime friend and former rehab pal shows up to a party she’s throwing, the two talk about her love life replete with the kinds of exchanges that only ever occur between the truly acquainted. Maybe it’s not the words themselves that matter but everything else – the casual gestures, sudden glances, or a moment’s pause left dangling before delivering a response – that conveys the real truth.

“At the end she answers in a way that could be interpreted as being very supportive, but could also be very destructive. I would like to say it’s the intersection between support and condemnation,” says Ho.

She recently learned her submission of “Masquerade” had won her the fourth annual BC-Yukon Short 2020, a short fiction contest put on by the Federation of BC writers.

Her piece will be published in the non-profit literary organization’s upcoming publication of its flagship magazine, WordWorks.

A professional editor, blogger and technical writer by trade, Ho is no stranger to the written word, though her shift towards the creative over the procedural is more recent.

“On the days that I do technical writing, I cannot also do creative writing. They’re both very separate parts of the brain,” she says. “One is heavy on the analytical and the procedural, and the other is about letting your imagination and your subconscious come out.”

However, she admits, her experience as a technical writer has helped her in many ways – for one thing, she doesn’t suffer from writer’s block. When you’re a trained technical writer you don’t have time to ponder because you’re too busy problem-solving and getting the job done, she explains.

“I will sit there and grind through for a few hours, even if I just keep three sentences. I do have that ability. And also, technical writing helps me hone in on precision – sometimes I do think it helps me get into the core of the story or find the themes,” she says.

Describing herself as a member of Generation 1.5 when it comes to her Taiwanese-Canadian background, Ho, whose family moved from Taiwan to Canada in 1980 when she was eight, says she’s in the final stages of putting together her debut collection of short stories.

In Sticky Rice and Grilled Cheese: Tales from a Taiwanese-Canadian Childhood, Ho hopes to explore the feeling that many who call more than one place home likely experience: a feeling of being caught in between two worlds, of feeling like you belong in many places as well as nowhere at all.

“The stories I’m telling are exploring that liminal space in between two cultures. I think it’s a very common phenomenon for new immigrants or immigrant families,” says Ho. “I think we all want to know where we come from, so I often feel caught in between worlds – when I go [to Taiwan] I’m too Western, when I’m here I feel like I don’t quite fit in either.”

Drawing a throughline between her upcoming book and her recent award-winning short story, they both contend with a different aspect of identity, whether that’s through the lens of class, ethnicity or someone’s place in the world, she offers.

In “Masquerade,” for example, the older woman who visits her friend throwing the party observes how the other guests appear to scoff at her disheveled manner and meagre attire. But there’s a freedom in that too.

“She just says, I’m just going to be myself.”",[]

Instead, she’s settling for bringing part of the world to everyone else.

Montreal-based, Deep Cove-born pop musician Maryze has released her new song “Muse” alongside an accompanying music video which features visuals of people around the world, including some from North Vancouver, expressing themselves and how they’re endeavouring to stay inspired while in self-isolation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

article continues below

Even though Maryze (born Maryse Bernard) wrote the breezy French electro-pop track earlier in the year to be released on her forthcoming debut album, she decided to release it early with a music video as a way to create and connect with far away loved ones and friends during this strange time, she says.

“When all this started happening I just decided I really love this song, it’s really fun, I thought it would be a nice time to release it and it would also be a nice time to make a collaborative music video because I’d never done that before,” says Maryze.

Her North American tour, which was slated to kick off last month, was cancelled due to the pandemic, as were a slew of Canadian festival dates and some European shows she had lined up for the fall.

Sequestered at home in Montreal as the health crisis raged on, she put out a call for people to upload video of how they were passing the time and stretching their creative muscles during self-isolation.

“At first I kind of thought I’d just be receiving submissions from family and friends, but then as it started getting shared around I started getting submissions from people I’d never met from Europe, the States, and Brazil,” she says. “Then all of a sudden there was 70 people – and I was not expecting that at all.”

The around-the-world visuals of the music video show people doing all manner of quarantine activities – from dancing around and laughing about, to dressing up and chowing down.

“It was really heartwarming and it just really reinforced that we’re all going through a very similar experience and similar uncertainties and ups and downs,” says Maryze. “Re-watching it now it just gives me such a sense of community and togetherness, despite it being a difficult time.”

In 2019, Maryze released her debut EP Like Moons followed by a month-long North American tour.

Her debut full-length album is expected to be released next year.",[]

Insurance consultant by day and poet all of the time, Me-An Laceste recently published Feeling Isolated? Explore!, a haiku collection accompanied with photographs the author mostly took herself.

article continues below

“I had never done any haiku before,” says Laceste. “I thought it would be a little bit challenging.”

Like many who have spent the last few months in lockdown amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Laceste felt burdened by feelings of helplessness and a lack of direction while she remained holed up at home.

“Every day I read the news – when I wake up in the morning and before I go to bed at night,” she says. “I started to read the news less and less.”

She’d already decided at the end of the March that her next creative project would be an attempt at haiku, a centuries’ old Japanese-style poem which is made up of two five-syllable lines and one comprised of seven syllables.

A few weeks later, during her morning prayer, she says she asked for a sense of direction and purpose, a way to give back, as the health crisis continued largely unabated.

“In my prayer I said, ‘Please let my mind wander to see what I can do,’” she says. “I stood immediately and I realized I’d write haiku about COVID.”

She had already been filling her days by taking quick walks and snapping photos of the largely absent streets of North Vancouver during the last few months, so in a burst of inspiration she put words to the pictures and eventually a full book took shape.

Across 150 haiku, Laceste recounts myriad moments – some profane, others mundane – using her charming, irreverent and, at times insightful skills with language.

“Legs propped, in sweatpants / ready for the next video call / how long will this last?” reads one haiku that anyone whose lived through the last few months can likely relate to.

Another poem, accompanied by a photograph of a note propped on her doctor’s office, reads: “Walk-in clinic closed / consult doctor on the phone / no more face to face.”

Laceste says her book has the two-fold goal of entertaining people with some of her more light-hearted haiku (“lovely walk along / Cherry blossom-lined walkway / calm in times like this”) as well as getting them to think about the more important things in life.

“We can reflect on our lives and what’s important and perhaps maybe think about what we can do during this time, or even after this time, that’s really important to us,” she says. “That really hits home to me. Because of that I’ve used this time to really spend time with my kids, even though we sometimes really get into each other’s hair.”

Laceste plans to donate any proceeds from the sale of her new poetry book to care homes on the North Shore, many of which have been hit hard by the pandemic.",[]

There have been numerous reports of a rise in anti-Asian graffiti in the wake of the pandemic, as well as people being yelled at on transit and being assaulted.

Asked on a media conference call Monday whether Vancouver might get back in the picture, Colin Smith said FIFA was focused on the original three Canadian candidate cities.

""Those are the three cities that bid so those are the three cities that we are evaluating and discussing with,"" said Smith, FIFA's chief tournaments and events officer.

Smith said the same when asked whether Chicago might be added to the 17 American cities under consideration.

""We've got 17 fantastic cities and there's a great depth there right the way across the U.S. and we're looking forward to making the selection from those 17 cities,"" he said.

The B.C. government said in March 2018 it was not prepared to have Vancouver serve as a host city because of cost concerns. B.C. Premier John Horgan reiterated that stand three months later, saying his government wasn't willing ""to write a blank cheque.""

Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium was a major part of the 2015 Women's World Cup, hosting nine matches including the final.

Chicago took itself out of the 2026 candidate city running in March 2018, saying FIFA had not been able to provide necessary assurances.

Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. were selected over Morocco to host the 2026 tournament on June 13, 2018, by the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow.

The U.S. candidate cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Washington, D.C.

Mexico's candidate cities are Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey.

The 2026 tournament has been expanded to 48 teams, up from 32, with 80 games in total. The organizing committee's blueprint is for Canada and Mexico to host 10 games each with the U.S. hosting 60, including all games from the quarterfinals on.

FIFA is looking to choose ""up to 16'' candidate cities from the list of 23 submitted by the North American joint bid. The bid group has been working under the premise of three cities in each of Canada and Mexico and 10 in the U.S. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities.

It marks the first time three countries have been selected to co-host the World Cup and the first time the tournament will be played in North America in 32 years.

Smith is holding a virtual workshop with representatives from the U.S. candidate cities on Tuesday.

His FIFA delegation met with Canada Soccer and representatives from the three Canadian candidate cities in Toronto on March 12, the date when many sports league ground to a halt due to the global pandemic.

The FIFA delegation had met with representatives from the three Mexican candidate cities prior to that. The U.S. portion of the trip was postponed due to COVID 19-related travel restrictions that looked to keep some candidate cities from attending.

The workshops will be followed by venue visits in the three countries, although timing of those remains uncertain due to COVID-19.

Smith said the initial plan was to finalize the host city selection process in the spring of 2021. That has been pushed back by the pandemic and Smith said timing on the final host city announcement won't be known until later in the year.

The notion of establishing a framework to commercialize cannabis began as a promise by the Liberal Party in the 2015 federal election campaign that led to Justin Trudeau becoming prime minister. The implementation of the policy was not as smooth as first envisioned, and the provincial governments were put in charge of setting guidelines for the sale and consumption of marijuana.

article continues below

Research Co. and Glacier Media have been tracking perceptions about legalization every six months in British Columbia. Our latest survey shows that agreement with the new rules remains high across the entire province, that some residents are starting to ponder a future when other drugs could be treated in the same fashion as cannabis, and that – in stark contrast with what we found last year – marijuana users in British Columbia are starting to acquire all of their product through licensed retailers.

As more time passes, British Columbians appear happier with the decision to end prohibition. Seven in 10 of the province’s residents (70%) agree with marijuana being legal in Canada, while 26% disagree and 3% are undecided.

These findings represent a seven-point increase since a similar survey conducted in October 2019, as legal cannabis approached its first anniversary. The groups that are more likely to voice satisfaction with the new status quo are men (75%), British Columbians aged 35 to 54 (76%) and residents of northern B.C. (80%).

In recent weeks, we have seen more talk about creating a safe supply for drugs that are currently available only through illegal means. The impact of these discussions has led to a shift in the views of British Columbians about legalizing all drugs. It must be completely acknowledged that sizable majorities of the province’s residents continue to oppose a move to place any controlled substance inside a store, but the proponents of this option have grown since late last year.

At least two-thirds of British Columbians are opposed to legalizing ecstasy (66%), powder cocaine (70%), heroin (72%), crack cocaine (73%), methamphetamine or “crystal meth” (74%) and fentanyl (75%).

Support for making some of these drugs available in a fashion that would conceivably meet the same guidelines that govern cannabis has risen over the past six months, to 25% for cocaine (up from 18%) and to 24% for heroin (up from 19%). While these are still low proportions, the fluctuation could signal the start of a trend.

Just 10% of British Columbians say they only consumed marijuana after it became legal. Identical proportions of residents tried it before October 2018 (45%) or have never consumed it in Canada (also 45%). The incidence of “legal-only” marijuana users is highest among residents aged 18 to 34 (18%) and those who live in southern B.C. (19%).

But perhaps the biggest surprise, and a source of satisfaction for policy makers, is the way in which cannabis is being sought by users. Just over half of British Columbians who have consumed marijuana since legalization (51%) say that all of their product was acquired at a licensed retailer. In October 2019, only 31% of cannabis consumers in the province were getting all of their product at a licensed retailer.

We still see 16% of British Columbians who say none of their marijuana has been bought at a licensed retailer – a proportion that climbs to 25% among those aged 55 and over. Two-thirds of cannabis consumers aged 35 to 54 (68%) are buying all of their product at a licensed retailer.

Even though the delivery of cannabis products has improved over the past six months, there are significant regional differences that are indubitably related to the presence of stores in specific areas of the province. Cannabis consumers who reside in southern B.C. and Metro Vancouver are the most likely to be getting all of their product from licensed retailers (63% and 62%). The numbers are significantly lower in Vancouver Island (29%), northern B.C. (24%) and the Fraser Valley (19%).

Finally, the issue of “drug testing” remains a priority for British Columbians, with 61% saying that companies in the province should “definitely” or “probably” be able to administer these examinations to any employee now that marijuana is legal.

After a bumpy start that featured slow store openings and hitches with delivery options, there are signs that cannabis legalization is starting to work in a better fashion. More consumers are getting all of their product through licensed retailers, and the number of “new users” has not increased dramatically. Still, the significant regional disparities suggest that more marijuana outlets will need to be authorized in order to effectively eliminate the black market.

She would like to say sorry for not appearing to be legally blind, which she is.

She would also like to say “my bad” for her lack of depth perception, which adds a — shall we say — elastic quality to her ability to socially distance while shopping.

article continues below

She would also like to ask forgiveness for her service dog’s inability to read the directional arrows on the floors of store aisles. Hers is a pre-COVID canine.

In addition, she wishes to beg pardon for her hearing loss. Ditto for her inability to read cashiers’ lips when they’re wearing masks and she’s trying to figure out what they’re saying.

Also, she expresses regret to those who glare at her when she doesn’t wear her own mask, the one that gets tangled in her hearing aids.

And, while she’s at it, she might as well show unmitigated remorse for all the other actions that cause the self-appointed Pandemic Police to huff and puff and work themselves into a self-righteous lather as she struggles to navigate this strange new world.

Underdown-Ngongo conveys all these apologies with tongue firmly in cheek and funny bone intact. She sees humour in her predicament, which is more than can be said for the pinch-mouthed shoppers who look ready to call 911 every time she unwittingly brushes too close or inadvertently walks into a Plexiglas barrier at the sales counter.

The Saanich woman has Ushers 2, a condition that causes hearing loss from birth and vision loss that begins in adolescence or adulthood and gets progressively worse.

In her case, the second half of the equation didn’t show itself until the youngest of her three children was a newborn. “I got up one night to get her a bottle and said: ‘I can’t see.’ ” That’s when doctors diagnosed her syndrome. Two weeks later, the authorities yanked her driver’s licence. That was 16 years ago.

The condition has taken away her peripheral vision and left her with only limited central vision. “If I’m looking right at you I can see your nose and your eyes, but I can’t see anything else.” It’s hard to focus on things that move, too, and hard to tell how far away things are.

So, sometimes she trips over piles of boxes. Sometimes she misses the hand sanitizer at the entrance to the store (“My kids say: ‘Hey Mom, back up’ ”). She has to pick items off the shelves and peer at them closely to ensure that she’s buying the right thing. (“Tell me what you think you bought,” her children will gleefully say when she empties the grocery bags at home. Chipotle-flavoured ketchup? Blehh!) And yes, she and her directionally challenged dog, Neva, occasionally miss those aisle arrows, causing people to bark at her (isn’t that Neva’s job?). Some of the barkers insist that her eyesight is just fine, which is news to her.

In their defence, her inability to see clearly isn’t immediately obvious, particularly if she isn’t wielding her white cane. “People say I don’t look blind until I walk into something,” she says.

And that brings us to the point she really wants to make: “Don’t be so quick to judge. You can’t tell where a person is at from looking at them.”

In these days of instant, sanctimonious outrage — the toxic scourge of our social media-fuelled time — we could all use that advice, and not just in relation to Underdown-Ngongo’s situation.

Take, for example, what has happened to her brother and his wife, who recently returned home to Victoria after working in Alberta. Before they had a chance to change their licence plates, the vigilantes struck, leaving nasty notes on their cars without having a clue who they were.

We shouldn’t be surprised by that, not in an age in which instant indignation and the condemnation of others have been elevated to virtues, and in a city with more judges than America’s Got Talent. This summer’s assumption that any car bearing out-of-province plates was packed with COVID-ridden rule-breakers followed this spring’s vilification of anyone pulling up to the ferry terminal for what appeared to be non-essential travel. (After writing about the latter kerfuffle in April, I heard from a couple who suffered disparaging glares from their fellow passengers every time they travelled to Victoria for cancer treatment. Another ferry user said she was assailed by people who, seeing the bikes on the back of her car, assumed she was going on vacation; in reality, she was going to the Okanagan to care for her gravely ill mother.)

Somehow we have made the leap from “Be kind, be calm, be safe” to “Those who appear to be heretics should be burned at the stake.”

Sorry, says Underdown-Ngongo, but appearances can be deceiving. She’s really doing her best. “I’m trying.”

The rest of us could try harder, too.

No example is better than the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in the United States, which gave us the “Patriot Act” after just 45 days of deliberation to expand government surveillance of Americans to previously unimagined levels.

In mid-April, the actions of Gabriel Wortman led to the deaths of 22 people in Nova Scotia after multiple shootings and fires. Most Canadians, at the time still under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were horrified at Wortman’s actions, which included impersonating a police officer.

article continues below

It took the federal government only 13 days after Wortman’s criminal activity was evident for the entire country to announce a nationwide ban on 1,500 types of military-grade “assault-style” weapons in Canada. Any Canadian who possesses these firearms will have two years to get rid of them. The prohibition led to many new discussions about the role that firearms play in Canada’s urban and rural areas.

We know now that the perpetrator of the 22 murders in Nova Scotia had obtained his weapons illegally from Canadian and American sources. This was not a surprise for Canadian authorities, who have consistently reported that more than 70% of the weapons used in gun-related crimes in our country come from the United States.

On the issue of firearms, Canada is decidedly different from the United States. In Canada, it is not legal for a person to own or carry a firearm for the purpose of self defence against human beings. When Research Co. and Glacier Media asked Canadians about this key precept of Canadian law, more than three in four (77%) agreed with it, while 18% disagreed and 5% were undecided.

Atlantic Canada (31%), Saskatchewan and Manitoba (29%) and Alberta (24%) boast the highest number of residents who openly question Canada’s long-standing regulations for firearms. While higher than what is observed in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, these are not proportions of voters that would sway an election, certainly not in the way American statewide and congressional races can be tilted if your candidate can adequately hold a shotgun and recite the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in a manner that panders to the base.

Fewer than one in five Canadians welcome the notion of citizens carrying firearms for something other than hunting or scaring wildlife away. Any survey measuring opinions on banning “assault-style” weapons would be met with near unanimity. The opposition reacted to the announced ban as it always has under its outgoing leader, by claiming the regulations would affect law-abiding Canadians. Lost in this unfortunate combination of inadequate polling and incapable opposition are the solutions that matter to Canadians.

In our survey, more than three in five Canadians (63%) told us that gun violence in Canada is a “very serious” or “moderately serious” problem – a proportion that climbs to 69% among women and 68% among those aged 55 and over.

Sizable majorities of Ontarians and British Columbians, who have experienced gang wars in urban areas, are more likely to look at gun violence as particularly problematic (76% and 67%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic did little to curb gun violence in Toronto, where 61 people were shot in the first four months of the year.

We asked Canadians about the effectiveness of four possible measures, and their responses outline a public that is ready for bold action. More than three in five Canadians (62%) think enacting a complete ban on handguns would be “very effective” or “moderately effective” in reducing gun violence in Canada. Most crimes, after all, are not being committed with the military-grade “assault-style” weapons that the federal government was quick to ban.

A higher proportion of Canadians deem two other measures as effective: imposing mandatory jail terms for crimes committed with firearms (74%) and introducing new outreach programs to steer youth away from gangs (also 74%).

Canadians place dealing with firearms smuggled from the United States as the most important issue that needs to be addressed. Many of the country’s residents also want to make sure gangs are not attractive to our country’s youth and believe mandatory minimum jail sentences would act as a deterrent.

Banning military-grade “assault-style” weapons is low-hanging fruit in a challenge that definitely has Canadians preoccupied and wishing for a type of government intervention that goes beyond a photo-op celebrated by poorly executed survey charity work.

True sociologists know that we learn nothing from posing the wrong questions to Canadians, and capable politicians should go beyond voicing displeasure with plans and proposals just because that is what they are expected to do. Meanwhile, Canadians are still worried about gun violence and expecting their elected officials to do better. •

""Our students have no difficulty being accepted to a university with two languages and an IB program,"" explains M. Brisebois. ""A second language opens up opportunities for students—it's one more tool in their toolbox for succeeding in life.""

We can then refer them to a registered funeral service provider that can offer them our member discount rate.""

That one phone call can relieve your loved ones from the anxiety and discomfort related to shopping around for the best funeral services rate at a time of emotional stress.

""Unfortunately, we live in denial,"" says Nicole. ""At the Society, we try to reach out to the children, who are usually in their forties and fifties, and encourage them to have the conversation with their parents.

Too many missed conversations.

It’s time to get your hearing tested. You want to fully embrace what these next years of life have to offer, not hide from them.

Now you need to decide where to do the test. You could go to Walmart or Costco, which offer over-the-counter hearing aids that cost a little less.

But do you want an over-the-counter hearing experience afterwards? Would you want an over-the-counter approach to any other important health concern?

“This is not supposed to be a quick fix; it’s a long-lasting solution to put your life back on track,” says Raphael Tayou of HearingLife Canada. “You should never compromise on your health.”

When you make a free appointment to get your hearing tested with one of HearingLife’s fully trained audiologists, this is what you can expect:

• A 20-minute discussion about your hearing concerns, medical history and lifestyle factors

• A physical ear exam to help the audiologist understand if there are any medical reasons for your hearing loss

• A comprehensive hearing exam, including tone, speech and word recognition tests to provide a thorough understanding of the condition of your hearing

• Same-day results and a counselling session on what to do next

If the need for a hearing aid is detected, the audiologist will then walk you through the various options that are available for your specific type of hearing loss. It won’t be a one-hearing-aid-suits-all option. It will be a hearing aid that’s tailored exactly to your needs and preferences. You’ll be amazed at how advanced the new hearing aid technology is, it can help you make hands-free calls from your smartphone, stream audio from your phone, stereo, TV, or other Bluetooth® enabled devices. And unlike your parents’ hearing aids, the modern iterations are incredibly discrete and sleek (unless you want to bling them up, of course.)

Afterwards, the audiologist will be there for you if you have any follow-up questions or adjustments.

“You need the right experts to give you the right treatment and after-care you deserve,” Tayou says. “We pride ourselves in being able to accompany you on your journey to better hearing. We want you to feel cared for and that you know we’re going to work towards making your life better.”

We need an all terrain stroller with big wheels and air-pumped tires. For a mom who is not so active, mainly walking the city centre streets for example, she might be better with a lighter stroller and smaller wheels that can swivel quickly and easily to help avoid obstacles.”

Active Baby has a range of strollers from lightweight, easy to fold and pack strollers, to the full size stroller with a bassinet that converts to a seat when baby grows into a toddler.

“For example, The lightweight Bugaboo Bee is perfect for when we need to travel,” July explains. “The baby jogger city tour folds easily and quickly and can fit into a small box or large bag.”

Parents with two young children on their hands aren’t forgotten either.

“At Active Baby, we have various double strollers to fit parents’ needs,” says July. “There are so many choices that it could be a nightmare to choose the right stroller, but it is very important and makes life a lot easier in the long run.”

Not sure which type of stroller would fit your lifestyle? July recommends talking to one of her staff.

“All our staff are really well trained and every one of them is a stroller expert,” she says.

Case in point: One More Szechuan’s diverse menu of excellent Cantonese, Szechuan and Thai dishes served up at its inconspicuous location in Pemberton Plaza in North Vancouver.

Opened in 2016 by husband and wife team Carrie Ho and Patrick Xie, One More Szechuan takes menu and restaurant concept cues from a Vancouver-based Szechuan restaurant with a similar name that Xie’s family, who hails fromGuangzhou, China, worked at previously.

article continues below

One year after opening One More Szechuan, business is steady (read: it’s not uncommon to have to wait for a table on a Saturday night). What draws customers is the sunny, lively vibe thanks to marigold walls, yellow pendant lamps and garage-style doors that stay open in the summer. Oh, and don’t forget Xie’s bubbly, outgoing personality, and the diverse flavours of the Asian cuisine, best served family-style.

The expansive lunch and dinner menu offers a variety of options to suit every palate and craving, whether it’s Lettuce Wraps, Moo Shu Pork or even Thai dishes (a treat for locals missing the Thai restaurant that previously occupied the space).

But for those that can take some heat, the Szechuan dishes come highly recommended. Everything is made using fresh ingredients, hand-selected by Xie’s famiy from the produce store each morning, many of which are chosen to balance the signature spice and richness. (Think crisp green and red peppers and cilantro tossed in with fried chicken morsels in the Spicy Chicken with Szechuan Peppercorn, and fresh Bok Choy sitting atop wide noodles, ground pork and Chinese pickle in the Dam Dam noodles.)

Acclaim from local food critics, and a passion for interacting with clients, has fueled Xie’s family restaurant management flame, and she would like to see even more customers walking through the doors. But Xie finds the location, nestled behind a Save-On-Foods in Pemberton Plaza, tough for business. Even the address, 1262 Marine Drive, is a bit misleading, as the restaurant is not right on Marine Drive. “I know what people like,” says Ho. “But people just don’t know we’re here.”

But once patrons find the location, they also find many reasons to come back. “We serve good food and we have good service,” Ho said. Take her word for it and give One More Szechuan a try (and don’t forget to wear your stretchy pants).

Clark, President and Founder of Pacific Spirit Investment Management. ""And that's how we define ourselves; as the go-to financial adviser for our client families.""

John and the professional team at Pacific Spirit have been offering comprehensive financial planning and wealth management advice for more than 20 years. His analogy of the family CFO refers to the value added services offered by Pacific Spirit.

""While we specialize in portfolio management and creating family financial plans,"" John explains, ""we will gladly help our clients with life’s other financial issues. For example, if a client is offered an opportunity to buy back years of pension service, we'll run the numbers and ascertain whether it makes good financial sense.""

Pacific Spirit offers its services on a fee-only basis, rather than on a commission-based method.

""This is important because it means that our advice isn't tainted by any commission bias,"" John says. ""We're not tempted to trade or purchase investments in order to generate income. In addition, it's completely transparent to the client; they receive both a fee schedule upfront and a quarterly statement showing exactly how their fees were calculated.""

Pacific Spirit also believes that it's important to combine financial planning with portfolio management.

""Quite frankly,"" John notes, ""we don't think you can effectively manage an investment portfolio without a plan in the background. How do you know where you are going and how can you make decisions without a plan?""

Pacific Spirit is an independent portfolio management company.

""This means that we can tailor our services to suit each individual client. There's no parent company promoting product through our office. We're able to find the best investment solution for our clients, whether that's stocks, bonds, or insurance products.""

Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of British Columbia, uses the analogy of the pilgrims crossing America to describe a green burial.

article continues below

""Imagine the pilgrims making their way across America,"" she says. ""When someone died, they simply wrapped the person in a blanket and buried them. There was no embalming fluid, no burial liner, zero affect on the environment. The body was left to decompose in the ground.""

With today's interest in the environment, the green burial is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. Nicole outlines four things you should know about a green burial:

1. It's completely natural

A green burial is a process that allows for the natural decomposition of human remains without the inclusion of chemicals.

""As a minimum,"" Nicole explains, ""for a burial to be considered green, the Memorial Society of B.C. requirements include a biodegradable coffin, no embalming, and no grave liner.""

Preferably, there should be plants or shrubs planted on the grave. The highest form of a green burial would include interment in a natural setting.

2. Green burials are gaining in popularity

""It's a very popular option,"" says Nicole. ""With today's interest in conserving the environment, people are thinking more and more about avoiding the use of chemicals and chemical liners in their burial.""

3. There are various levels of ""greenness""

""At the Memorial Society of B.C.,"" explains Nicole, ""we recognize that people have different interpretations of what constitutes a ""green"" burial. We're actively working throughout British Columbia to ensure that all levels of green burials are available around the province.""

4. Recyclable plots

A major benefit of a green burial in this time of land scarcity on the Lower Mainland is the fact that the plot is reusable.

""With a green burial,"" Nicole explains, ""you don't purchase the plot. You lease a small piece of land. In 25 years, that plot can be reused for another burial because your remains have decomposed into the earth as part of the natural life cycle of the planet.""

The Memorial Society of British Columbia is a non-profit, member-based, volunteer-driven organization that has been helping British Columbians with end of life planning decisions for more than 60 years. For a nominal one-time membership fee, the Society will record your wishes for the disposal of your remains as well as assist your loved ones secure a discount on funeral services with an approved funeral homes throughout the province.

We don’t get an optician who can ensure that our glasses meet our vision needs or the guidance of a fashion expert who’ll help us choose the pair that suits us best.

Enter Faranak Da Costa, a licensed optician who previously worked as a fashion stylist.

She’ll also go to care homes, or carry out group visits.

The business idea came to her because of her experience working in conventional optical stores. “No one was servicing people in the comfort of their own homes,” says Da Costa. “Customers would come in – elderly people with mobility problems, busy parents with their kids, or professionals trying to squeeze in a visit during their working day. I knew there had to be a better, more convenient way to cater to and help these people.”

Speedy Specs offers frames to fit every pocket and taste, starting at $195 for frames, lenses and coatings. There are also high-end frames from exclusive Korean and Canadian brands, handcrafted in materials like Italian acetate – not run-of-the-mill designer specs that you’ll see in every high-street optical store.

Harcourts is the first and only real estate group in the world to be selected by Apple for this recognition.

Harcourts CEO, Hayden Duncan, says the custom suite of apps developed by Harcourts has transformed the way the real estate company conducts business and is excited about the benefits they will bring to the Canadian market as the brand opens its first Canadian office in Vancouver this month.

“By nature, real estate is a mobile business,” says Duncan. “Realtors™ are on the road, meeting clients, inspecting properties and showing houses. The apps save our Realtor™s hundreds of hours per year by streamlining tasks. And they help us deliver a great client experience.”

Duncan points to e-Campaign for iPad as an example of how the technology is impacting the way homes are bought and sold.

“From the comfort of your living room, a Realtor™ can help you build your ideal marketing campaign, visually showcasing the complete range of marketing options available—and booking everything into an online calendar so you know exactly what to expect every step of the way,” he says. “The iPad also allows us to enhance home security for property viewings and communicate quickly and effectively with buyers requesting more information.”

The best way to survive any accident, of course, is to not be involved in one in the first place. But cyclists are particularly vulnerable to traumatic injury in the event of a collision with a vehicle.

While biking can be an eco-friendly and healthy way to get to work, or a pleasant way to enjoy a lovely day, cyclists can be subject to profound, devastating injuries and life-altering effects if involved in an accident with a vehicle, even at low speeds.

article continues below

Because bicycles can be hard for vehicle drivers to see, Hanson & Co recommends that you assume that you are invisible to drivers and ride accordingly.

Be careful as you approach intersections and watch for vehicles making turns. Often the driver is so busy checking for traffic and pedestrians that they just don’t see the cyclists.

Parked cars pose another danger for cyclists. Vehicle drivers have been known to inadvertently throw open their doors, not realizing that a cyclist – or even pedestrian – is approaching.

If you are involved in a cycling accident, the advice is to take similar actions as if you were involved in a motor vehicle accident. (You may want to download the free Hanson & Co app for your smartphone – hopefully you will never need it, but it will assist you if you are rattled following an incident).

Seek medical attention – and remember that cyclists often don’t realize that they have been injured until several hours after the accident. Wait for the police to respond and don’t attempt to negotiate with the at-fault driver. Be especially cautious if you think you suffered a head injury. Get an opinion from a medical professional about potential brain trauma right away.

Whether or not you have the Hanson & Co app, collecting the names and contact information of everyone involved, including any potential witnesses, is vitally important. Jot down vehicle license plate numbers and try to get photographs of the accident scene, the vehicle(s) involved and your bike and helmet, and yourself if at all possible.

Call a lawyer as soon after the accident as possible. Law firms like Hanson & Co will be able to sensitively guide you through the personal injury claim process, while keeping your best interests in mind.

“As lawyers experienced in personal injury cases,” says Jim Hanson, founding partner of Hanson & Co, “we focus on our approachability, our listening skills, and our non-judgmental attitude. We are able to help accident victims with compassion and understanding.”

If you have been involved in a cycling accident, call Hanson & Co at 604.984.7555, check the website or email the office for your confidential and free initial consultation.",[]

Whistler Blackcomb is putting a new gondola on Blackcomb and adding a string of new amenities to the alpine, including chair upgrades and a suspension bridge.

“Someone I dated led to me getting into a lot of trouble,” Kim says. “I’ve struggled with addiction and when I was in jail, I found out I’d taken fentanyl and it freaked me out. I was determined to get clean for my baby. So when I was told I could be released, I asked to stay in so I could get help through their methadone program.”

Kim’s request was granted and once clean, her social worker told her about EFry’s Ellendale Cradle program, which supports expectant and new mothers in maintaining their recovery, learning parenting skills and preparing for stable lives after a stay of up to three months.

“I’m so much better now,” says Kim, now mom to an infant daughter. “I feel safe and the staff is always around to help me. There’s no judgment, just support. It’s great for me and my baby.”

Child development monitoring and support is a unique element of the program.

“There is a significant focus on babies’ health and supporting mothers in learning what to expect with their development and helping them establish a strong parent-child bond,” says Justine Patterson, clinical director with the Elizabeth Fry Society (EFry).

Justine oversees both Ellendale Cradle and EFry’s other residential program for pregnant women and those with infants called Transitions to New Beginnings.

“Substance use and trauma are interconnected, so all our work is trauma-informed,” says Justine. “With the right support, people can build stable lives. Society needs to remove the stigma and encourage women to come forward and get help.""

While Ellendale Cradle provides recovering women with structured support and programming, Transitions to New Beginnings is a step down on the continuum of care, focusing on helping secure housing and regain independent living. Both programs only take clients who are seeking help in providing a stable, healthy home for themselves and their children.

Clothes were often bought via catalogue, or patterns were purchased. People would then painstakingly use those patterns to create handmade items for their family members, often with excess fabric sewn into the seams, so that the garment could be resized later on if a child grew.

Most people only had a few types of each garment apiece and wore and repaired them until they were given to someone else or if they were no longer usable.

article continues below

With greater industrialization increasing around the turn of the last century, it became easier to purchase clothing that was pre-made, leading to more leisure time for families, particularly women.

As the century rolled onwards and participation in capitalism became more and more a way of life, clothing for the lower and middle classes became less about simple utility and more about self-expression. Fashion, no longer just the territory of the upper class, became affordable for the masses, as shopping malls and boutiques selling cheaper clothing sprung up around the globe.

This increasing sense of trend awareness among all sectors of the population has now led to a point where more than five percent of our waste stream is made up of discarded clothing and household textiles. Not only that, but the fibres that make up those clothes are often harmful: Cotton is the most pesticide-dependent crop in the world, requiring a third of a pound of pesticides to make one t-shirt.

There are similar environmental harms in the production and disposal of rayon, nylon, clothing dyes, and other industry staples. But with this large system already in swing, what is one consumer to do?

Pavel Lalev, who is with Green Inspiration BC, knows a solution. His company operates large green bins that collect unwanted textiles from consumers, conveniently located throughout the Lower Mainland. The items are then passed on to sorting facilities that separate them into resellable, reusable, or recyclable batches with portion of the proceeds benefiting local charities. All Green Inspiration bins utilize a design that makes them completely safe for the public.

""I feel great working where I do,"" says Lalev, ""because I know we make a difference.""

So much so, that the Iran-born siblings joined forces to launch m+, an innovative boutique interior design and architectural services firm based out of Vancouver.

""What brings us to design is a sense of placing our mark on society in an everlasting way,"" says Nadi Miri. ""We really like to create spaces with a unique mark.""

Nadi says she was always ""passionate about design and geometry"", and attended the architecture school at Art & Architecture Azad university in Tehran. She credits her more holistic and big-picture design sense to her global understanding of design trends.

Ellie's path was similar. ""I gravitated to learning about the organizational thought behind spaces,"" she says. She completed her MID in interior design before she and her sister decided to join forces to create a holistic approach to interior and exterior design in the Lower Mainland.

Something the Miri sisters share is that they never limit themselves to one type of project. ""We have worked on so many types of projects, including single family houses, custom design throughout Vancouver, yoga studios, offices, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants, a juice bar, some commercial stuff,"" Nadi explains.

While some might think it would be challenging to run a business with a sibling, Nadi says,

""We meet halfway. We make compromises too. Our priority is the project – if we can create that unique healthy design, we have that in mind, so that we don't get personal.”

They describe their technique as working opposite one another: Nadi works from the outside, plotting the grounds and landscaping before tackling the exterior structure. At the same time, Ellie works on the interior of the building, planning colour schemes and the seamless movement from room to room. All the while, they consult with one another to ensure that the two facets of the project complement one another as naturally as possible. While they work, they make efforts to ensure that materials used are as environmentally friendly as possible.

The sisters are excited to expand their work, be it residential or commercial, in Vancouver, Squamish, Whistler, Maple Ridge, and Surrey.

They are confident that their winning streak together will continue, with Ellie adding, ""We are very integrative and detailed. In terms of styles and goals, our visions are very similar. It helps to have similar ideas.""

North Shore counsellor Brooke Evans of BE Integrative Counselling explains how to get started on your journey.

1. Make a list and start your search

article continues below

Think about the things that are important to you when you’re seeking support. These can be practical – like location and availability – or emotional. “What will help you feel safe and supported based on your values, beliefs, age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, spirituality and so on?” says Evans. Good starting points for your search are websites like Counsellingbc.com and psychologytoday.com.

2. Be aware of the cost-effective options

“The North Shore offers free counselling support through government and non-profit agencies – you can find out more about that by phoning the Mental Health Support Line on 310-6789,” says Evans. “When hiring a private counsellor, ask their hourly rates and check if they offer a sliding scale if financial barriers are a concern. Your counsellor should ensure you are aware of all the resources that are available so you never pay over your means.”

3. Consider therapeutic approaches

You probably don’t know whether you need CBT, mindfulness training, yoga and breath work, or a personalized combination, which is what Evans offers. “Read the counsellor’s approaches on their website and ask them to explain more when you call them,” Evans says. “The approach should feel self-empowering and your counsellor should also be able to recommend practitioners outside their own scope, for example, doctors, reflexologists and so on.”

4. Trust your intuition

“Look at the photo on the counsellor’s website: Are you going to feel comfortable developing a therapeutic relationship with them?” says Evans. “Did the counsellor make you feel safe and comfortable during the first phone contact? If not, it might not be the right fit.”

5. Be willing to put the work in

Evans believes success in therapy depends on the person’s willingness to put in the work and go through the process. She says: “This means you come prepared to feel uneasy at first because even positive change can feel uncomfortable or painful. The right counsellor can empower you to find the inner strength and wisdom to evoke the change you want to see in your life.”

Evans sees clients at Compliments Healthcare, West Vancouver Community Centre, and 302 – 566 Artisan Lane Bowen Island. Find out more at Becounselling.ca, call 604-781-3987 or email brooke@becounselling.ca.",[]

Several of the CSF high schools offer the world-renowned International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Founded in Switzerland in 1968, the IB is a non-profit foundation offering four programs of education designed to develop the intellectual, personal, emotional, and social skills in students to prepare them to live and work in an increasingly globalized world.

""All the core subjects are taught in French,"" says Laurent Brisebois, principal of l'école Andé Piolat, ""but there's also an English component, meaning that our students will be completely bilingual as well.""

According to M. Brisebois, an advantage of graduating with an IB diploma is the opportunities it could open up for students.

""It's just one more tool we can give them,"" he explains. ""Students can approach just about any university armed with an IB diploma and an ability to study and communicate in French and English. First year university students may also be able to get a few exemptions based on having the IB diploma.""

The IB diploma program is available to students aged 16 to 19 years old and is taught in over 4,000 schools around the world. In addition to encouraging a strong work ethic and organizational skills, the program is designed to foster and develop curious and engaged minds in young people.

As a local family-owned business, they’ll work on your home as if it were their own.

The values of customer service and “doing the job right” are not only reflected in the quality of work the spray painting teams accomplish, but they percolate down to each and every level of the implementation.

“We believe in delivering a superior customer service experience” Jean-Marc, co-owner of Spray-Net Vancouver Lower Mainland, said. This is just one of the main tenets that sets Spray-Net apart from its competition.

Spray-Net Vancouver offers a value-added service to homeowners throughout the Lower Mainland by delivering a quick, cost-effective and permanent exterior paint solution for your home. At a fraction of the cost of replacement, Spray-Net renews and restores everything from aluminum and vinyl siding, to stucco, aggregate, hardie board, brick, and even front and garage doors and windows.

What sets Spray-Net apart from its competitors? Karine, Spray-Net Vancouver Lower Mainland’s Operations Coordinator, says it’s because the franchise offers a “permanent solution with a 15 year warranty.”

“Most of the other paint products out there will create a finish that needs to be repainted at some point. Our coatings, stains, and spraying technique guarantee s a like-new factory finish that won’t ever peel. So for our customers, they’re not investing in maintenance. They’re investing in an alternative to replacement that will last, since they don’t have to re-paint 2-5 years down the line.”

Stemming from the family’s own past experiences with disappointing contractors, Jean-Marc wanted to fill the gap for a home improvement business rooted in customer satisfaction.

“When we came across Spray-Net it was a perfect fit,” he said. “The standards that Spray-Net brings, in terms of product quality, attention to detail and customer focus, are some of the highest in the industry.”

As one of the fastest growing home improvement franchises in Canada, it is also booming in the Lower Mainland. It continues to surpass its customers’ expectations with each home that is transformed.

Traditionally, driver education focused exclusively on learning the rules of the road and learning to operate a vehicle. But the EU Coaching Project, HERMES, uncovered a third, equally important factor in reducing crashes with new drivers: learning to control your impulses.

article continues below

“The mental aspect of driving is the most important part for new drivers to understand,” says John Jacobsen of Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy. “Impulsivity rules the developing mind, and this can lead to crashes, especially with young drivers. With this in mind, Mercedes-Benz has structured a new way to teach driving.”

Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy is the first to offer this kind of driver education in Canada. Traditional driving instructors are replaced by ‘driving coaches’, who undergo frequent evaluation and training and are monitored for consistency through the use of in-car cameras.

“You’re going to see a lot more of this kind of training in the future,” says Jacobsen. “What we focus on is managing impulsivity by helping teens become more self-aware of their mental state. Crashes don’t typically occur because of a lack of knowledge on the driver’s part. They occur because of poor or impulsive decision-making.”

Students learn to be aware of their mental and emotional state through self-evaluation. In-lesson scaling helps students track their developing vehicle-handling skills for greater responsibility behind the wheel.

“We teach new drivers how to put the brakes on their impulsivity,” Jacobsen explains. “And since we teach using Mercedes-Benz vehicles, there’s a greater incentive to learn. You’ll also notice the competitive pricing compared to other driver education programs in Vancouver.”

So in 2008, the travel consultant, who for over 30 years has been arranging trips for her personal and corporate clients, decided to combine the two passions by founding the volunteer-run travel organization, Journeys with Heart.

Journeys with Heart offers customized trips to small groups (usually under 24 people) to destinations near and far, all while supporting Lower Mainland charities. What sets Journeys with Heart apart from other organizations offering similar fundraising trips is the fact that the excursions are hosted by local personalities.

article continues below

The first journey, to India in 2008, benefitted the BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre Foundation and was hosted by renowned chef John Bishop, owner of Bishop’s restaurant. Karmali first approached the U.K.-born chef about the gig at a one of his book signings, taking place at Whole Foods, and he’s been involved with Journeys with Heart ever since, hosting one to two excursions each year.

Fast-forward to 2018 and the organization has raised $130,000 for local charities. There are four trips planned for 2018—one to Italy with former CBC-Radio-Canada personality Monique Polloni, one on a Rhine River Cruise with award winning cookbook author and psychologist Dr. Theresa Nicassio, another to Newfoundland and Labrador, and another to Israel and Jordan. Bishop will host the latter two. “(The Newfoundland trip) will be John’s eighth trip, and his trips usually have a culinary emphasis,” Karmali says.

Journeys with Heart makes a point of supporting lesser-known charities that may not benefit from as many contributions as higher-profile organizations. Two of the trips in 2018 will benefit North Shore charities. While participants of the Newfoundland and Labrador excursion will make a donation to the North Vancouver City Library, those joining Bishop on the Israel and Jordan trip will support Aunt Leah’s Place. The Rhine River Cruise will benefit the ADHD Adult Clinic at the HOpe Centre and Monique’s “Permesso Avanti” tour will benefit the Italian Cultural Centre.

Although the journeys—which in the past have also explored Bhutan, Japan and Iceland—support charities back home, Karmali ensures that local people in the regions where the adventures take place are benefitting from the visit as well. “We try very hard to give back to local charities in the countries we’re visiting,” says Karmali.

""People asking this question are generally thinking that it would be good to pay for tomorrow's cost today,"" says Nicole Renwick, Executive Director of the Memorial Society of B.C. ""And they want to save their loved ones the bother of making financial decisions after they have passed, and there are a few other options.""

article continues below

For a nominal membership fee, the Memorial Society can work with you to pre-plan, rather than pre-pay, your funeral and arrangements for the disposal of your remains.

""We've been helping people with end of life arrangements for more than sixty years,"" Nicole notes. ""We have in excess of 242,000 members around the province, making us the largest memorial society in North America.""

Pre-planning with the Memorial Society is as simple as filling in an arrangement form detailing your wishes, and then making sure your survivors are aware of your membership in the Society.

""When end of life occurs,"" Nicole explains, ""the survivor should call us first. We will then refer them to a funeral home that is registered with us and with whom we have negotiated a member discount.""

While pre-paying is an option, there are other options to keep in mind such as the CPP Death Benefit or taking out a GIC with your executor. If you do decide to pre-pay your costs here are a few points to keep mind:

· You may move away from the area where your selected funeral home is located.

· If you ask for a refund from a funeral service provider for any reason after 30 days of signing a pre-payment contract, the provider is entitled to retain up to 20 percent of your money.

· A pre-payment contract usually does not include all the costs incurred at the time of death. For example, catering, flowers, cost for death certificates etc. are not included.

· If your survivors do not know about the pre-payments, it is possible that the money will be lost.

""We can give you peace of mind through pre-planning,"" she says, ""and relieve your loved ones of stress at an emotional time, while also making sure they receive a discounted rate on the provision of funeral services.""

Typically, it was conveyed as a series of principles taught separately in classrooms and sometimes during in-car sessions while students were behind the wheel.

Today, thanks to schools such as Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy, the term defensive driving covers a lot more aspects of driving than it used to—and it’s woven into every part of the instruction.

article continues below

“Our program integrates the concept of ‘defensive driving’ within all in-class and coaching sessions,” says John Jacobsen of Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy. “We don’t teach it as a separate entity, like advanced skills for intermediate or expert drivers, because it isn’t separate. Hazard awareness and management must be part of every driver’s core driving ability.”

Defensive driving gets treated like a kind of additional, advanced skill by traditional driving schools when it should be fully embedded in all levels of training for new drivers, says Jacobsen.

“I shake my head when I hear driving schools promote ‘defensive driving courses’,” he says. “While there are a number of recognized systems for defensive driving, it really boils down to a few basic things: be aware, recognize hazards before they become problems, make good decisions, and execute your decision. These aren’t principles that should be covered in supplemental training. They must be a core part of every driver’s education from day one.”

The question of emergency vehicle handling skills is an interesting topic. Some schools dabble in teaching certain skills at the roadside which is ineffective compared to what can be achieved through participation in dedicated advanced driving courses, which are taught separately at Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy, says Jacobsen.

“Unlike effective hazard awareness and management concepts and techniques, which should be learned as part of the initial instruction, our collision avoidance courses focus on more advanced safety skills,” Jacobsen says. “Braking techniques using full brake efficiency at various speeds, proper vision skills, avoidance manoeuvres while managing weight transfer are examples of skills not typically taught in beginner courses and must be conducted at a safe dedicated training facility.”

“These courses are for drivers who have at least been in the N phase for a while,” Jacobsen adds. “Research shows that advanced vehicle handling training for new drivers can lead to problems, primarily because it can make an inexperienced driver over-confident. Too much advanced training at an early age is not advisable.”

For new drivers eager to start the Graduated License Program, Mercedes-Benz Driving Academy is an ideal starting point, says Jacobsen, because they integrate defensive driving into all their beginner courses.

For intermediate and experienced drivers, a separate closed course is available where coaches teach advanced car control techniques like cornering at a higher speed, hard braking and hard acceleration techniques.

“The mix of a teen’s tendency towards impulsivity and advanced driving techniques can be a recipe for crashes,” says Jacobsen. “Impulsivity sometimes writes cheques that their skill level won’t allow them to cash.”

“We don’t approach [stairs] as a means of vertical circulation—this building element can become the main character of any space,” says Nadi Miri, who co-founded Vancouver’s innovative m+ Architecture | Interior Design with her sister Ellie.

article continues below

“From my point of view, stairs can be very functional and practical, but the most beautiful part is the design. It can be very poetic.”

And like all great poems, the cutting edge designs the duo incorporate into their residential and commercial projects can be interpreted and enjoyed in several different ways.

From afar, you can observe others as they come and go, while from within the staircase, you can see the building from all new angles and perspectives.

Take their Sonora Residence project, for example.

The functional elements of the stairs, its open one-piece black steel structure and glass guardrails, also create a rhythm matching that of the home’s design style. The open risers allow beams of light to shine through, making the home appear more spacious, while the wood finish treads make a seamless transition from one floor to the next.

“A visually strong staircase sets the tone for the architectural language of the space,” says Ellie. “Think about the railings, the steps… what do you want to say?”

Ellie says that too often design styles are not approached holistically. This often leads to staircase design that can disrupt the space’s flow as well throw off the building’s entire design style. A common example, she says, is the use of contemporary glass railings in traditional-style homes.

“People will create stairs out of context,” she says. “They see a beautiful staircase in a magazine and just plunk it into their space, and an expert eye can see that it doesn’t tie in the entire design and that it doesn’t match the movement of the building.”
