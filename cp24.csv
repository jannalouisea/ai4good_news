Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-14,"Premier Doug Ford is launching an election-style summer tour of Ontario as the province reopens after months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Over the next eight weeks, he will be travelling to seven regions, stopping in 38 ridings, and covering nearly 5,000 kilometres to thank Ontarians and the many businesses across this province for stepping up and doing their part during COVID-19,” Ford’s office said Tuesday.

The premier will be in Cambridge on Tuesday afternoon at Eclipse Automation, a company that retooled its machines to manufacture N95 and surgical masks and other medical supplies.

He will then tour Challenger Motor Freight to “thank workers for continuing to operate throughout the pandemic, including bringing essential products across the U.S. border.”

Finally, Ford will visit Shaver Industries in Kitchener, which is making making 25,000 face shields a week for frontline workers.

The company also makes plastic dividers so golfers can share carts while hitting the links.

On Thursday, Ford will visit Essex County, where he’s said he will get his golden mullet trimmed from a local barber.

The next day, he will be back in Waterloo Region.

Liberal Leader Steven Del Duca expressed concern about the premier taking off on the hustings.

“Parents working from home are struggling with childcare and Doug Ford is nowhere to be found,” said Del Duca.

“His priorities are way out of order — he has a detailed plan to reopen pubs and movie theatres, but none to get our kids back in school this fall,” he said.

“Doug Ford should spend his summer figuring out the crisis in our schools, not campaigning for re-election.”

Even though the next Ontario election is not until June 2022, Ford’s campaign blitz is designed to boost the Progressive Conservatives’ political fortunes.

The premier had a -49 per cent approval rating this time last year — when he was loudly booed at the Toronto Raptors’ victory celebrations at Nathan Phillips Square, and Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were cheered.

But the latest Campaign Research poll for the Star found Ford now has a 39 per cent approval, a swing of 88 percentage points.

That’s largely thanks to his measured performance during the pandemic that has left Ontario in a state of emergency since March 17.

Meet the people trying to #ChangeHospitality,"['Karon Liu', 'Karon Liuculture Reportertue.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-14,"As discussions of racism are now on the forefront and more attention is paid to the precarious nature of restaurant jobs during the pandemic, those who work in the city’s hospitality industry have been emboldened to call out discriminatory practices and behaviours of their employers. Earlier this month, The Drake Hotel’s CEO Jeff Stober stepped down amidst accusations of anti-Black racism at the Toronto restaurant and music venue from former employees.

But those in the industry say a larger overhaul of accepted norms and practices is needed to make restaurants more welcoming for diners and workers alike. There’s a re-energized push to prioritize everything from mental health to a re-examination of the “customer is always right” motto during the reopening process.

“There’s always this idea that the restaurant is this rogue business and it’s a rule breaker,” said Arianne Persaud, a filmmaker and former restaurant manager at Bar Raval. “There’s so much room for people to act badly.” She remembers a time when a white restaurant owner said that he owned her as an employee. He meant it as a joke, but as a Black woman those words stuck with her for years. It’s an example of the microaggressions that people of colour encounter on a daily basis in predominately white spaces, she said.

This past month, Persaud started the Change Hospitality campaign on social media. The goal is to hold restaurant owners accountable long after they posted a black square on their Instagram feeds in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Persaud wants to hear restaurant owners detail what they are actively doing to make their workplaces safer for Black people as well as Indigenous, racialized and trans workers.

People in the industry started to use the #ChangeHospitality hashtag on social media, sharing stories of workplace trauma, explaining terms such as “psychological invalidation” and “tone policing,” as well as listing what changes they’d like to see going forward, such as paid sick leave and livable wages. Last week, chef Todd Perrin of Mallard Cottage in Newfoundland used the #ChangeHospitality hashtag in his announcement that his restaurant is doing away with the tipping model in an effort for his employees to earn a more stable income.

To keep the momentum going, Persaud started a newsletter and is working on a video project in which restaurant workers share stories of workplace discrimination. She adds that participants are being paid (the project is funded by local bakery Evelyn’s Crackers), as a way to address the emotional labour required to relive the trauma they went through. She is also continuing efforts with her Toronto Restaurant Workers Relief Fund, which has raised $25,000 so far to provide groceries for laid-off restaurant workers during the pandemic.

But truly changing hospitality for the better, she said, requires more than simply hiring more people of colour. “Putting a person of colour in charge but not changing the existing structures limits their ability to make changes,” she said. “It’s less about the optics and more about improving the marginalized person’s experience.”

Ivy Lam, general manager of Mineral restaurant, located just north of Rosedale subway station in Toronto, has been helping Persaud spread the word about the Change Hospitality campaign. She said part of changing existing structures involves safe spaces training. Just as it’s required by law to have someone trained in first aid at a workplace, Lam said she felt it was necessary for the staff to take courses through Mental Health First Aid Canada to help identify signs of coworkers going through mental distress.

“The people who are the most exploited are the people who can’t speak up or don’t have the support around them,” she said. “Being in a space where the owners are saying something racist, homophobic or transphobic makes you feel less than human.”

Lam said creating a safe space also requires open channels of communication without fear of reprisal.

“Change Hospitality creates that safe space for discussion to find ways to improve the industry rather than keeping everything behind closed doors,” she said. “Accountability goes in every direction. I’m critical of the restaurant’s owners in a respectable way because I’m being paid for my expertise in my position. When team members see that you can be critical of your superiors, it allows them to be able to do that. It’s the little things, like normalizing the idea that you can challenge your boss.”

Questioning what has been accepted as the normal is key in making permanent and positive changes, said Christina Veira, a veteran bartender, bar consultant and spirits educator. She recently hosted a two-part online seminar on bar management with topics spanning operating during the pandemic and ensuring employee and guest safety from a mental and physical standpoint.

Veira’s teachings often include discussions of intersectionality and take a closer look at how things like restaurant design can create places of exclusion, such as the choice to build gendered washrooms, only putting changing tables in the women’s washrooms or still imagining the straight, older white male as the typical fine dining customer.

“Now that people have to socially distance, there’s a realization that many tables in restaurants were too close to begin with for people of different sizes and mobility issues. How many times has that created anxiety for people in the past?”

While she’s seen drastically positive changes over the last decade as dining cultures change, she said there’s still progress to be made in unlearning what’s considered to be unspoken rules of the hospitality industry.

“‘The customer is always right’ idea implies a lot of things we know aren’t true,” she said. “I’ve heard owners tell staff that it’s always important to end things on a handshake. But if the person only wants to make comments about my body, how far do I want to try placating that relationship so that they’ll come back? It not only creates an environment not conducive to your staff but it also shows guests who you’re catering your space to.”

For Veira, making restaurants safer and more respectable places to work requires having more industry-wide standards in management.

“There’s a lack of training on skills that are management or communication related. Many people go into the industry quite young and they’re trained by someone who also got this patchwork training,” she said. “People are good at losing their minds over making the perfect omelette or polishing a fork, but will fire someone for being five minutes late or turn a blind eye around someone harassing a hostess.”

Veira, Persaud and Lam all say addressing mental health is key in making an inclusive workplace.

Event producer Hassel Aviles and Distrikt 461 executive chef and Grand Cru Deli co-owner Ariel Coplan founded the non-profit Not 9 To 5 in 2018 to promote what they call psychological safety in hospitality workplaces.

“Psychological safety is an environment where people can take risks and feel vulnerable without any negative consequences, to be able to talk pay, operations, how they’re being treated,” Aviles said. “When I worked as a server and bartender, very rarely did I feel like I could talk about living with depression without feeling I’m going to get fired.”

Mental health and self harm have always been big issues in the industry, Coplan said. The pandemic exacerbated things as people went into self-isolation, lost their jobs and are now facing the uncertainty of going back to work. The two are currently working with mental health professionals to create a digital mental health training certification program for hospitality workers in the U.S. and Canada.

“This is just the beginning and it’s a powerful time of change and opportunity. There’s such a demand and people are engaging in a larger way than we’ve ever seen,” Aviles said. “It’s so important to remind ourselves that this is about saving lives and normalizing these conversations so no one feels alone.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"Ontarians will soon be able to dine out and work out indoors, catch a movie and let their kids loose on playgrounds in much of the province as additional COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.

Premier Doug Ford said most of Ontario would enter stage three of the framework for reopening on Friday as new coronavirus cases remain low, but the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest have to wait a week.

“We need just a little more time,” Ford said Monday.

Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and outdoor playgrounds can open in Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay and a slew of other regions.

Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, Windsor-Essex and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening.

Ford suggested those regions could open up as early as July 24, so long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and Dr. David Williams, the province’s chief medical officer of health, gives him the green light.

That’s the same day Ontario’s state of emergency, in place since March 17, is due expire after yet another extension was granted Monday by MPPs.

Education Minister Stephen Lecce said as of July 27, all child-care centres across Ontario can open with up to 15 kids per room.

Lecce said that should enable them to be at 90 per cent capacity, meaning more parents can get back to work. He added schools could also reopen for students in September, although that situation remains fluid.

“We will be cautious, methodical and focused on safety to get this right, because keeping your child safe is what matters most,” he said.

“I’ll be sharing more details soon about the return to school plan, which I know is top of mind for many parents around the province. We are confident in this plan to enable parents to return to work while having the peace of mind that their children are cared for.”

Green Leader Mike Schreiner questioned the Progressive Conservative government’s strategy.

“Securing a safe place for kids to be Monday to Friday should be a higher priority than allowing people to crowd into bars and restaurants,” said Schreiner.

“We are still without a sound plan for education or new funding for child-care providers to implement COVID-19 safety protocols.”

NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the Tories need to offer more help for small businesses struggling in the pandemic, like subsidies for Plexiglas barriers and personal protective equipment for workers.

“As we prepare to move into a new stage of our economic reopening, we must remember that small businesses across the province are struggling because Doug Ford didn’t provide the kind of direct support needed to keep Main Street healthy and vibrant,” said Horwath.

The premier insisted Ontario has learned lessons from the U.S., where reopening businesses and attractions too quickly has led to a surge in cases.

“I see these numbers from Florida and they’re staggering — 15,000 people that contracted COVID in a day, that is scary. But we’re being pretty vigilant. We aren’t rushing into anything,” said Ford.

After Friday, the places in stage three can have indoor gatherings of up to 50 people, while in stage two the limit remains at 10.

Outdoor gatherings will be increased to a maximum of 100 people in the third stage.

However, some restrictions will remain. Amusement parks and water parks will not be allowed to open. Nor will buffet restaurants, night clubs, overnight camps for children, private karaoke rooms, saunas, bath houses, oxygen bars or table games at casinos.

In bars, there will be no dancing and all patrons will need to remain seated inside.

For athletes, “prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports is not permitted” in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Spectators at such events must abide by the gathering limits and physical distancing restrictions.

While gyms, fitness studios and community centres can reopen indoor facilities, similar measures will be in effect to keep people two metres apart.

Concerts, artistic events, theatrical productions, performances and movie theatres can resume with limits.

“Performers must maintain physical distancing of two metres from every other person, except from other performers where necessary for purposes of the performance,” the government said.

Similarly, “audiences are subject to the number of people that can maintain physical distancing of at least two metres and cannot exceed gathering limits of 50 indoors and 100 outdoors,” it said.

“This applies to the entire facility, regardless of the number of theatres or performance stages within the facility.”

Ford said amusements parks and multiplex cinemas could make a pitch for exemptions to the rules.

“If they come up with a plan, a proper plan that keeps people’s social distanced and in other areas and puts it forward to the chief medical officer and they approve it, then they can open,” he said.

Reach Her Via Email', 'Pwinsa Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-13,"After a weekend when Disney World in Orlando opened its doors for the first time since March, Premier Doug Ford announced amusement parks would not be making the cut for Stage 3 reopenings slated to begin Friday in most of Ontario.

Private karaoke rooms and buffets also won’t open. Dancing in restaurants and bars or gambling at gaming tables in casinos won’t be allowed.

Instead, Ontarians in 24 regions of the province would be allowed back in to a number of venues that include bars, gyms, fitness centres, movie theatres, casinos, recreational facilities, live sporting events and dine-in restaurants.

And who would be left out? The GTA’s five regions, including Toronto, as well as Niagara, Windsor-Essex, Haldimand Norfolk, Hamilton and Lambton.

We take a look in chart form at the progress we’ve made in Stage 2 and how we compare to Texas and Florida, two states that have seen cases soar since reopening.

Nearly 1,500 active cases in province

Todd Coleman, an epidemiologist at Wilfrid Laurier University, said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the province’s Stage 3 reopening plans, but he says “as we’ve seen in other countries, it is an easy infection to pass on.”

There are 1,454 active cases of the virus in the province, a quarter of what we experienced at the peak of active cases in late April.

But Coleman points out “there are possibly that many individuals who can still pass on the virus, leading to an entirely new explosive chain of transmission.”

“Remember, the daily numbers we’re seeing now are the same as the ones we’ve seen in early March, leading to peaks of hundreds of cases per day in the following weeks,” said Coleman. “If the systems set up aren’t air tight, we might see that again.”

He says that means the province should continue to expand testing so that workers coming into contact with more people on a regular basis can be tested more often. The largest number of people tested in the province was 33,492 on June 27. The number reported Monday was 20,896.

Coleman says in-depth contract tracing needs to continue and the province should issue a more explicit statement about the necessity of masks, instead of leaving it up to regions to decide if masks should be mandatory.

“As we’ve seen in other places, all the cogs need to be in place for effective prevention of further COVID-19 transmission, anything out of place could lead to further spikes in transmission,” he said.

The GTA vs. the rest of the province

New cases of the virus have held steady outside the GTA, due in part to differences in population density as well as prevalence of the disease, said Coleman.

“With the other regions being less sparsely populated and with lower prevalence (existing numbers of active cases), the probabilities of infection becomes much, much lower,” he said.

And in turn, the burden on public health and other health care resources is much lower, resulting in more in-depth contact tracing, he said.

Peel reported more cases than Toronto over the weekend — 65 confirmed and probable — most of them in Brampton.

“Case investigations are underway to determine the likely source of infection but we continue to see household clusters where up to five family members were tested on the same day and all tested positive,” said a spokesperson for Peel public health.

“In terms of ages, it’s mixed — parents and children, multi-generational families as well as young adults who live together.”

On Monday, Peel Region reported another 54 cases.

Toronto reported 120 new cases and three deaths over the previous three days on Monday, but Dr. Eileen de Villa said that overall, trends show “our new COVID-19 case reports continue to remain low.”

She also said the city’s health care capacity had been downgraded from yellow to green on Toronto Public Health’s online COVID-19 dashboard, the result of a decline in Toronto’s acute care bed occupancy rate.

Cases based on population

Windsor-Essex, which has had outbreaks of the virus among temporary workers on farms, continued to have the highest number of cases based on population in the last week, 33 per 100,000 people. Peel was second with 13. Toronto had eight per 100,000.

Those regions won’t move to Stage 3 on Friday, along with the rest of the GTA as well as Niagara, Haldimand Norfolk, Hamilton and Lambton.

But many of those regions, where cases have been low, say the delay is due to the fact that they moved into Stage 2 a week after the province gave the green light on June 12 to the 24 public health units that were the first to advance.

“Niagara has been averaging fewer than two cases per day for the past seven weeks, with a trend slightly lower over that period,” Dr. Mustafa Hirji, Niagara’s acting medical officer of health and commissioner, said in an email.

“The Province is assessing regions after they have been in Stage 2 for four weeks, which for Niagara, will be this Friday. We hope to move to Stage 3 in the next round of announcements on Monday, July 20.”

Haldimand-Norfolk also expects to enter Stage 3 soon.

“The areas being moved to Stage 3 have spent an additional week in Stage 2,” Kristal Chopp, chair of the Haldimand-Norfolk Board of Health, said in a statement.

“It is anticipated that the Province will re-evaluate the status of Haldimand and Norfolk next Monday. . . . We expect to be able to move into the next stage shortly, so long as we continue to see few new daily cases of COVID-19 in the community.”

What happens when you open too early

In his press conference Monday, Premier Doug Ford called the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in Florida on Sunday “staggering.”

The state reported more than 15,000 cases in a 24-hour period, a record, the day after visitors entered Disney World in Orlando for the first time since the park was closed in March.

Miami-Dade has become the epicentre of the virus, with cases increasing after the county’s mayor Carlos Gimenez reopened restaurants and non-essential businesses on May 18. Since then, the county’s percentage of occupied intensive care beds jumped from 22 per cent to 98 per cent Monday, according to media reports. There have been 282,435 cases of the virus in the state and more than 4,000 people have died.

Gimenez banned indoor dining on July 9, but is waiting to see if a 10 p.m. curfew and a mandatory mask order will help bring down cases before he orders further restrictions.

Texas was one of the first states to reopen in late April, allowing stores, restaurants, movie theatres and malls, as well as other venues, to operate at 25 per cent capacity. Restaurants were allowed to open with 25 per cent occupancy on May 1, but the limits were later bumped up to 50 per cent and then 75 per cent.

The state now has 264,313 cases of COVID-19, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, and has recently reported more than 8,000 or 9,000 new cases a day. More than 3,200 people have died.

In June, Gov. Greg Abbott put a hold on further plans to reopen and made masks mandatory in counties with 20 active cases. He also ordered bars to close and limited restaurants to 50 per cent capacity.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"It was all apologies Monday from two of the country’s highest-ranking politicians, who’ve been left reeling from widespread criticism that has zeroed in their on family ties to WE Charity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau came out within hours of each other on Monday to apologize for not recusing themselves from the decision to give the organization a major government contract.

The statements came after weeks of controversy following the Liberal government’s decision to award the charity a contract to deliver a $900-million program for student volunteers, even though Trudeau and his family have a long history with WE.

“The mistake that we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” Trudeau told reporters Monday morning.

“Not only has it created unnecessary controversy and issues, it also means that young people who are facing a difficult time right now getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer.”

Trudeau has faced criticism for not recusing himself from the WE Charity decision since it was revealed earlier this month that WE’s for-profit corporation paid his mother and brother a combined $282,000 in speaking fees between 2016 and 2020.

For the Liberal government — which is facing an ethics investigation, charges of cronyism from the Opposition, a committee probe and waves of public scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic — the family ties don’t end there.

Morneau also took part in the decision-making process around the WE contract, even though his daughter was working for the organization.

In the summer of 2019, Morneau also announced that the government had given a $3 million grant to WE.

Morneau wasn’t available for an interview on Monday, but in an emailed statement to the Star, he acknowledged that he should not have taken part in the decision-making process.

“I did not recuse myself from the discussions on this topic and, given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,” Morneau said.

“I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE.”

WE Charity was awarded the $19.5-million contract to administer the volunteer program in late June. The organization and the government later said they came to a mutual decision to cancel the deal amid accusations of ethics violations.

Trudeau now faces his third ethics investigation as prime minister.

During his Monday news conference, Trudeau said he was “very aware” that members of his family worked with WE but that he was “unaware of the details of the remuneration.”

He added that he would “look at any invitations” that come in to testify before a parliamentary finance committee. Trudeau said other ministers and officials will be testifying this week.

“In this situation, I should have recused myself. Canadians will make their judgments about what we were trying to do and what I should have done.”

Lori Turnbull, director of the School of Public Administration at Dalhousie University, called the apology a “low-risk strategy” for the prime minister.

“It’s kind of clever on his part, in the sense that he’s now able to pivot if he’s asked about it,” Turnbull said.

“He will be asked about it a lot and he’s able to say, ‘Yes, I took responsibility for that. I apologized and now let’s talk about something else.”

Calling the apology “guarded,” Turnbull noted that Trudeau didn’t say sorry for the actual decision, just “for the fact that he didn’t walk away from the table.

“It could be that people are quite angry about this, but it doesn’t end up showing up at the ballot box,” she said. “Or, it could be that this is the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”

Amidst the controversy, WE Charity took out full-page advertisements Monday in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail to apologize and answer “valid questions” about its involvement with the grant program.

“The past two weeks have been extremely difficult,” the ad read.

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret. It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.”

The ad was signed by Craig and Marc Kielburger, the charity’s co-founders. It suggested that the idea for WE to run the grant program originated with the public service, and that the charity did not “profit” from the original $19.5-million contract.

Read', 'Alex Boydcalgary Bureau', 'Calgary Bureau', 'Alex Boyd Is A Calgary-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"A former Alberta environment minister who was photographed then surveilled as a pair of Lethbridge police officers acted without authorization is calling the incident the “stuff of police states.”

And the province’s Opposition NDP is asking for an out-of-province investigation into the actions of the two officers who are employed by the city of Lethbridge, about two hours south of Calgary.

Sgt. Jason Carrier and Const. Keon Woronuk have been temporarily demoted after a disciplinary hearing found each of them guilty of multiple counts of misconduct.

The 2017 incident — reported on by Chat News Today on Monday — apparently stemmed from the officers’ opposition to the minister’s bid to protect more local land.

The disciplinary decision said the two men were upset because Shannon Phillips, who was then the environment minister, was pushing to turn swaths of the nearby Castle Wilderness area into a park that would not allow ATV use.

“Sgt. Carrier did not agree with the plan Minister Phillips was outlining as he, and others he knew, enjoyed outdoor activities in the Castle area and opposed potential restrictions,” according to the agreed statement of facts.

According to the statement, Carrier recognized Phillips when she arrived at the Chef Stella Diner on the morning of April 14, 2017. He was already there with two other on-duty and uniformed officers, both junior in rank, when Phillips sat down at the next table.

He said he overheard Phillips discussing her plans for the Castle Wilderness area, though, speaking to media Monday, the MLA disputed this, and said she was actually discussing the reintroduction of bison to Banff National Park.

Carrier took a photo of the meeting and texted it to Woronuk, and “invited him to attend.” The agreed statement of facts notes that the two were friends and both liked to camp and fish in the Castle, a range of wilderness on the eastern slopes of the Rockies.

When he arrived, Woronuk also took a photo of the group, the report said. While he was paying, Carrier took a selfie of himself with the minister in the background.

Outside the diner, the report quotes Woronuk as having said he “would hate to see Phillips drive away from the restaurant and there was a reason to stop her.” Carrier replied that she should receive the same treatment as anyone else “such as a soccer mom speeding through a playground,” according to the report, and that politicians shouldn’t get special treatment.

With that, both officers went to their vehicles.

Carrier drove to a parkade to do reports and monitor activity because it was “known for prostitution-related activities,” according to the agreed-upon facts. From inside his vehicle, he noticed Phillips leave the diner and walk away before noon.

Woronuk, meanwhile, had set up to surveil the diner, and watched one of the diners — the report doesn’t specify who — leave, then followed the vehicle for five blocks before losing it at a red light. He drove a few more blocks but couldn’t find the vehicle again.

Woronuk also ran the licence plate through the central police database despite being motivated by “personal and political views,” as opposed to concerns for public safety, the decision said.

Carrier has maintained that he was not involved in the official surveillance or traffic enforcement of Phillips or the other diners, the decision says.

Phillips said she believes she was tailed by a police officer that day. Phillips, who’d previously reported the photos to police, called the whole incident “very disturbing.”

“If officers in this town are going to place someone under surveillance, because they don't agree with them, what does that mean for overall community safety?”

On Twitter on Monday evening, Alberta Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer said he’d learned of the events that night, and shared in the “outrage” being expressed.

“To say it is completely unacceptable that members of the police would conduct unauthorized surveillance of any Albertan — in particular an elected official — is an understatement,” he posted.

He said that the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, the province’s police watchdog, had been ordered to conduct a review to determine if there are grounds for a criminal investigation. He added that he’d instructed his department to arrange for an out-of-province prosecutor should ASIRT require legal advice.

The events came to light after Phillips filed a complaint in 2017 under the Police Act after learning that photos of her at the diner had been posted to Facebook. This sparked an investigation by the Calgary Police Service.

According to a notice posted to the Lethbridge police website, Woronuk admitted five counts of misconduct, including using his position to his personal advantage and discrediting the reputation of the police service. He is being demoted two grades to a Constable level 1 for two years.

Carrier was found guilty of two counts, including neglecting his duties as a police officer, and is being demoted one grade to Senior Constable, Level 2, for one year.

Living with a disability is challenging enough but many in the disabled community say they have felt forgotten during this pandemic.

A lot of us haven’t thought about the fact that the way we’re experiencing the world in the midst of a deadly virus, might actually just be every day in the life of a disabled person, even before a pandemic.

But COVID-19 has posed bigger roadblocks for the disabled community. The majority is struggling with everything from equitable access to health care, financial and physical constraints to something as basic as access to crucial information that they need at this time to protect themselves from a pandemic with dignity.

In today’s episode Maayan Ziv, disability rights activist and the founder and CEO of AccessNow, a digital accessibility platform for the disabled, talks about the struggles and rights of Canada’s disabled community – and what we need to do to make inclusive and safe spaces for everyone in our collective experience.

8:05 a.m. Canadian trials have just begun for a prospective COVID-19 vaccine

5:25 a.m.: Another spike brings India near 1 million cases

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Tuesday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

11:14 a.m. Sources say Canada and the United States are likely to agree to extend their mutual ban on non-essential travel between the two countries for another 30 days.

The Canada-U.S. border has been closed to so-called “discretionary” travel like vacations and shopping trips since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold of the continent in mid-March, an agreement that’s set to expire July 21.

Officials familiar with the ongoing talks, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public, say another extension until Aug. 21 is all but inevitable.

News of the likely extension, initially reported by the Globe and Mail newspaper, comes with COVID-19 resurgent in the U.S., particularly in southern states where businesses reopened early and the wearing of face masks has become a partisan issue.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau hinted at the possibility Monday after a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Trudeau says Canada is closely monitoring what he calls a “constantly evolving” situation, but won’t say whether officials have discussed extending the border restrictions beyond the standard 30-day window.

11 a.m. Much of Ontario is moving into the third stage of reopening as the number of new COVID-19 cases remain steadily low.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said there were 111 new cases reported Tuesday with one death.

“Locally, 28 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases, with fully 21 of them reporting no new cases at all,” Elliott said on Twitter.

“With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province,” she said.

There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators.

10:45 a.m. As the federal and provincial governments race to ramp up testing for COVID-19, a Richmond Hill company is breaking ground on a rapid, cheap and easy-to-use device to detect infection.

LooK SPOT, a portable rapid point-of-care antigen test device, is the brainchild of Laipac Technology Inc., a leading GPS electrical engineering company based in Richmond Hill.

The test, which is expected to roll out in September, will be able to detect proteins of the new coronavirus from a nasal swab sample in less than five minutes with 95 per cent accuracy, according to Laipac.

“It will be the start of something big,” Diego Lai, founder and CEO of Laipac Technology, said on July 8. “We have a lot of faith in this and hope it would become something that would help a lot of people.”

With no prior training required, the test is based on a technique called lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) —commonly used for home pregnancy tests — which only takes a few minutes to produce a result after a sample comes in contact with the LFIA strip, according to the company’s website.

10:33 a.m. A union representing Ontario health-care workers says it’s planning a series of escalating political and legal actions, including brief work interruptions, in response to the province potentially extending its emergency powers.

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it’s pushing back against the province’s emergency order because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement.

Union president Michael Hurley says his members are going to start by sending their MPPs emails this week, explaining how the order damages their workplace rights.

The union says it’s also planning legal challenges and will hold rallies outside of its workplaces on Friday.

Members of the union will vote on Monday night to see if it will be necessary to have a brief work stoppage the next day.

Hurley says that while the emergency orders were acceptable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now a detriment to health-care workers and the emergency is over in most of the province.

A spokeswoman for the union confirmed on Monday that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of political action over the weekend.

10:04 a.m. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has confirmed the wearing of masks will be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England. The requirement is expected to take effect July 24.

The decision follows weeks of discussion by the government about their value during the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are not out of the woods yet, so let us all do our utmost to keep this virus cornered and enjoy summer safely,” he said. Anyone not wearing a face covering can be fined 100 pounds ($125) and shops can refuse entry to anyone failing to comply.

10:04 a.m. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is signalling she favours people in hard-hit counties staying in their areas after major coronavirus outbreaks.

Germany has loosened many restrictions on public life during the past 2 1/2 months, but local authorities will consider new restrictions if the number of infections in an area exceeds 50 per 100,000 residents during a one-week period.

Last month, a partial lockdown was imposed on the Guetersloh region of western Germany after an outbreak at a slaughterhouse. Many other German regions refused to allow people from the area to stay unless they could produce a recent negative test.

Merkel asks, “isn’t it better for the hot spot itself to say, you can only travel anywhere if you have a negative test … than if we check at every hotel in Germany whether someone from a particular county is there?”

She says it’s being discussed with state governments, which are responsible in Germany for lockdown measures.

10:04 a.m. Regional authorities in Andalusia, on the southern Spanish coast, approved a package of measures making face masks mandatory in all open or enclosed spaces, including beaches and swimming pools.

People can take off their mask only to swim. Fines can reach 100 euros ($114).

Other exceptions are inside family homes or when eating, and for children under 6 or people with health problems.

Andalusia, home to such historic cities as Seville, Cordoba and Granada, is also famed for its beaches. Like the rest of Spain, it is trying to control outbreaks of the coronavirus after ending a national lockdown.

10:04 a.m. French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to require masks inside all indoor public spaces by Aug. 1.

In an interview with French television networks marking Bastille Day, Macron says “the best prevention” for the virus are masks, social distancing and hand washing.

Macron says France’s virus reproduction rate is inching past 1 again, meaning each infected person is infecting at least one other.

Many other European nations required masks in indoor public space when they started easing virus lockdowns. France took a more relaxed attitude, recommending but not requiring masks.

Recent rave parties in France and widespread backsliding on social distancing — even within Macron’s presidential palace and other government facilities — have raised concerns.

France has confirmed more than 30,000 virus deaths.

10:04 a.m. Israel’s Health Ministry says the country has confirmed 1,681 new coronavirus cases, a record high.

Israel was widely praised for taking swift action early in the pandemic by closing its borders and imposing other restrictions to contain the virus’s spread. But since reopening the economy and schools in May following a more than monthlong lockdown, the number of new cases has steadily increased.

Health Ministry Director General Hezi Levi says the government is making every effort to try to avoid another countrywide lockdown.

“A general lockdown is without a doubt one of the tools that we try our utmost to avoid reaching for,” Hezi told Israel Radio, but says it remained an option authorities are considering.

Israel has recorded a total of 41,235 cases of the coronavirus. The country currently has over 21,000 active cases and confirmed at least 368 Israelis deaths from COVID-19, according to the Health Ministry.

10:04 a.m. A semi-official Iranian news agency says Tehran’s governor has imposed new restrictions because of a spike in coronavirus cases, ordering mosques and several businesses closed for a week in the Iranian capital.

According to the Tasnim news agency, Anoushiravan Mohseni Bandpey, the governor, said the measures would apply to mosques and women’s beauty salons, gyms, swimming pools, cinemas and coffee shops.

The development comes after Iran has been seeing a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths in recent weeks, including record numbers of deaths so far in the pandemic for the Middle Eastern country.

Health Ministry spokesperson Sima Sadat Lari says 179 more people died in Iran from the virus on Monday, bringing the country’s confirmed death toll to 13,211.

She says there were 2,521 new confirmed cases on Monday, more than half of which were hospitalized, bringing the overall number of infections to 262,173.

Iran is the regional hotspot for COVID-19, with the highest number of infections and deaths from the virus.

10:04 a.m. Austria is expanding a list of countries with banned flights to include six nations in the western Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova and Egypt.

Austria currently bans flights from eight countries and one region of Italy. The Austria Press Agency reported that only the latter — Lombardy, the Italian region worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic — is being removed from the list starting on Thursday.

The health ministry added 10 new countries in light of high coronavirus infection levels and kept the eight that were already on the list: Belarus, China, Britain, Iran, Portugal, Russia, Sweden and Ukraine. There are exceptions for flights bringing in freight, repatriated Austrians, medical caregivers or agricultural workers.

10:04 a.m. Africa’s coronavirus caseload has climbed above 600,000 as the pandemic on the 54-nation continent continues to pick up speed.

Africa surpassed the half-million case mark less than a week ago. The continent now has more than 610,000 confirmed cases. South Africa has the most cases on the continent, with more than 287,000.

South Africa’s public hospitals are already filling up, and the government on Sunday night reimposed a ban on alcohol sales to help free up hospital beds. The return of alcohol sales on June 1 was blamed for a surge in emergency admissions and an increase in the number of women and children killed.

Other countries struggling with shortages of medical equipment and personnel include Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, which has more than 33,000 cases.

10:04 a.m. The authorities in Thailand are suggesting almost 1,900 people quarantine themselves and get tested for the coronavirus after a breakdown in screening allowed two foreigners who tested positive for the disease to pose a risk to public health.

The agency co-ordinating Thailand’s coronavirus response also announced it was rolling back regulations for admitting foreign visitors to tighten up procedures.

Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesman for the COVID-19 centre, said the agency was suggesting that 1,882 people whom a contact tracing app indicated may have crossed paths with an infected member of a visiting Egyptian military team self-isolate for 14 days and get themselves tested as soon as possible. Seven people already known to have had direct contact have already been quarantined.

Officials in the eastern province of Rayong closed several schools and a mall, sealed off part of the hotel where the Egyptians had stayed and gave free coronavirus tests for people who feared they may have had contact with the infected man.

The second case involved the infected 9-year-old daughter of a foreign diplomat whose family returned from Sudan and stayed in their condominium in Bangkok.

10:04 a.m. The official opening of the Dutch parliamentary year will happen without the traditional pomp and ceremony in September due to coronavirus restrictions.

The Hague municipality and the defence ministry says King Willem-Alexander’s traditional ride in an ornate horse-drawn carriage from a palace in the city to the parliament won’t happen and appealed to the public not to visit the city on Sept. 15.

Thousands of people usually flock to The Hague to line the route of the monarch’s coach ride to parliament.

The venue of the meeting of both houses of Dutch parliament has been changed from the historic Knights Hall to a church that is large enough to accommodate all 225 lawmakers with social distancing in place.

9:30 a.m. Premier Doug Ford is launching an election-style summer tour of Ontario as the province reopens after months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Over the next eight weeks, he will be travelling to seven regions, stopping in 38 ridings, and covering nearly 5,000 kilometres to thank Ontarians and the many businesses across this province for stepping up and doing their part during COVID-19,” Ford’s office said Tuesday.

The premier will be in Cambridge on Tuesday afternoon at Eclipse Automation, a company that retooled its machines to manufacture N95 and surgical masks and other medical supplies.

He will then tour Challenger Motor Freight to “thank workers for continuing to operate throughout the pandemic, including bringing essential products across the U.S. border.”

8:31 a.m. Pearson Airport in Toronto is eliminating 500 jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Greater Toronto Airports Authority announced Tuesday. That’s a workforce reduction of 27 per cent. The changes reflect a significant decrease in global air traffic, with passenger numbers at Pearson currently at operating at 1996 levels. The job reductions will be achieved through the elimination of unfilled positions, together with voluntary departures and layoffs.

8:05 a.m. Canadian trials have just begun for a prospective COVID-19 vaccine but its Quebec-based manufacturer is already downplaying its potential impact.

Dr. Bruce Clark, president and CEO of the biopharmaceutical company Medicago, cautions observers against holding unrealistic expectations that his product — or any of the numerous vaccines in development globally — will bring the pandemic to a screeching halt.

“Whatever vaccine we get in this first round — unless it’s a miracle — it’s not going to be perfect,” says Clark, whose company began trials for its proposed vaccine Monday in Quebec City.

“It’s going to have to undergo development, it’s going to take probably years to come up with an understanding of the right vaccine, the right approach. It’s not the panacea.

“To assume that we can have, in 18 months, the solution to a pandemic that comes around once in a generation, is naive.”

So much is still unknown about COVID-19, notes Clark, including how it may manifest during the flu season later this year.

He suspects a more likely scenario is that a vaccine will offer only part of the solution, along with new therapeutics and ongoing public health interventions.

Medicago’s first phase of clinical trials will test a plant-based product on 180 healthy men and women, aged 18 to 55.

The randomized, partially blinded study uses technology that does not involve animal products or live viruses like traditional methods.

Clark notes that vaccine developers typically use chicken eggs to propagate a virus, but Medicago uses recombinant technology involving the genetic sequence of a virus, with living plants as the host.

The resulting virus-like particles mimic the shape and dimensions of a virus, which allows the body to recognize them and spark an immune response.

Clark says the plant-based approach is significantly faster and offers more consistent results than egg-based or cell-based methods.

While it takes five to six months to propagate a virus in eggs, the plant-based technique requires just five to six weeks, he says.

“In a pandemic, something like COVID, if you’re able to cut that much time off development, you have a substantial impact on public health.”

7:46 a.m. The coronavirus pandemic is weighing heavily on the financial health of JPMorgan Chase, as America’s largest financial company set aside billions in the second quarter to cover potential losses from all the businesses and consumers who are unable to pay their debts due to the slumping economy.

The results offer a glimpse into how badly the pandemic is impacting the financial health of American consumers and businesses. Last quarter, when the coronavirus pandemic had only just begun, JPMorgan set aside nearly $8.3 billion (U.S.) to cover loan losses. The bank added additional $10.5 billion (U.S.) to those reserves this quarter.

The year-over-year decline was almost entirely due to the coronavirus pandemic. JPMorgan reported its highest quarterly revenue in its history, but those gains were overtaken by the money set aside to cover potentially bad loans.

Whether JPMorgan and the other big banks have set aside enough money to cover bad loans remains unclear, but the outlook does not look good.

The coronavirus pandemic is now in its fifth month in the U.S., with infections hitting records in several states and economies shutting down again. Enhanced unemployment benefits run out at the end of the month, and at this point many consumers are upward of 90 days past due on their debts.

“Despite some recent positive macroeconomic data and significant, decisive government action, we still face much uncertainty regarding the future path of the economy,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement.

JPMorgan is the first of the big six Wall Street banks to report its results this week, with Wells Fargo and Citigroup reporting on Tuesday as well. like JPMorgan, the other banks are expected to take significant losses on their loans this quarter due to the pandemic.

7:19 a.m. China is pushing harder to make territorial claims in the regional seas and even using the coronavirus pandemic to expand its influence and take strategic superiority, posing a greater threat to Japan and the region, Japan’s government said.

The report highlighting the government’s defence priorities was adopted by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s Cabinet on Tuesday, less than a day after the Trump administration rejected outright nearly all of Beijing’s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea in a statement likely to deepen the U.S.-China rift.

The Abe government’s Defence White Paper 2020 highlights what are potential Chinese and North Korean threats as Japan tries to further increase its defence capability. Under Abe, Japan has steadily increased its defence budget and capability and purchased costly American arsenals.

Defence Minister Taro Kono recently scrapped the deployment of a pair of costly U.S. land-based missile intercepting systems due to technical issues, and Abe quickly announced his intention to revise Japan’s defence guidelines, possibly allowing Japan to go beyond its conventional defence-only role under the Japan-U.S. security alliance, including discussing a possibility of acquiring a preemptive strike capability.

The White Paper accused China of using propaganda, including spreading disinformation, about the spread of the coronavirus.

“The COVID-19 pandemic may expose and intensify strategic competition among countries intending to create international and regional orders more preferable to themselves and to expand their influence,” the report said. “We need to closely watch their move with serious concern affecting the national security.”

6:10 a.m. Britain’s government will demand people wear face coverings in shops as it seeks to clarify its message after weeks of prevarication amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to tell the House of Commons on Tuesday that anyone failing to comply with the order could face a fine. The order comes into effect on July 24, giving shops and the police time to prepare.

Many European nations, including Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece, already require masks to be worn in enclosed spaces.

Britain, which has reported one of the world’s highest numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths, had taken a more relaxed attitude, recommending masks but not requiring them — at least until now.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in the spring spent a week in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, had not been seen in public in a mask until last week. On Monday morning, he urged people to wear them. Monday evening, his government announced it would be compulsory.

5:35 a.m.: Vice-President Mike Pence travels Tuesday to Louisiana, which has re-emerged as one of the nation’s hot spots for the coronavirus only months after seeming to contain its outbreak.

The Republican vice-president was scheduled to meet with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, members of the congressional delegation and state health officials to talk about the state’s response to the COVID-19 disease caused by the coronavirus.

Pence’s visit comes as Louisiana’s confirmed virus cases, percentage of positive tests and COVID-19 patient hospitalization rates are surging — worrying public health experts about the level of virus spread in a state that previously appeared successful in combating its outbreak.

“Louisiana has been on the radar, literally front and centre, of the White House Coronavirus Task Force since the very beginning. We’ve never come off of that radar,” Edwards said. “I think that’s a big reason why the vice-president chose to come to Baton Rouge and to Louisiana.”

5:32 a.m.: China said the number of people in treatment for COVID-19 in the country has fallen to just 297, with only three new cases of coronarvirus reported, all brought from outside the country.

No new deaths were announced, leaving the total at 4,634 out of 83,605 cases of the disease.

A pair of experts from the World Health Organization were in China on Monday to make arrangements for an investigation into how the pandemic may have spread after the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

5:28 a.m.: Australia’s Queensland state is toughening the punishment for those who break coronavirus quarantine rules. Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the current fines for breaking a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for some visitors or lying about their whereabouts may not be a sufficient penalty.

The maximum penalty will now be a higher fine or up to six months’ imprisonment.

Queensland reopened its borders to all but Victoria state residents two weeks ago. Victoria is the centre of Australia’s recent outbreak, adding 270 new infections overnight to its more than 4,000 active cases.

5:25 a.m.: India’s number of coronavirus cases jumped by another 28,000 on Tuesday and are fast approaching 1 million.

The 28,498 cases reported in the past 24 hours took the national total to 906,752. Cases have jumped by 100,000 in four days.

The Health Ministry also reported another 553 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 23,727.

India has largely lifted its nationwide lockdown, and the virus has been spreading at a significant rate, prompting several big cities to impose partial lockdowns.

India is the third worst-affected country in terms of infections, only behind the United States and Brazil.

5:22 a.m.: Pakistan announced Tuesday it would resume vaccinations against polio next week, months after the drive against this crippling children’s disease was halted because the novel coronavirus had overwhelmed the country’s health system.

The anti-polio campaign would last three days, from next Monday, with the plan to have about 800,000 children vaccinated, the officials said. Police departments have received requests to ensure the safety of the polio workers.

5:20 a.m.: The British Columbia government is expected to give a financial update today on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected its residents, businesses and the economy.

Finance Minister Carole James says the pandemic has created “profound” challenges for people in B.C. and around the globe, fundamentally changing the ways people live and work.

She says the update will provide a summary of those impacts and outline the supports government has put in place and will continue to provide.

5:15 a.m.: A union representing Ontario health-care workers says it will announce “political action” this morning in response to the province potentially extending its emergency powers.

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, will be making the announcement at Hamilton General Hospital.

A spokeswoman for the union confirms that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of some form of political action over the weekend.

The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill last week that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

4 a.m.: A new poll suggests Canadians are torn on whether the federal government should turn off the spending taps to keep the resulting deficit from flooding the nation’s future.

The Leger/Association for Canadian Studies survey found 41 per cent think that COVID-19 support programs and payments must immediately be scaled back.

Forty-four per cent think the payments to Canadians and businesses ought to continue even with the $343-billion projected deficit.

The poll suggests 78 per cent are worried about that bottom-line figure, and 60 per cent think the way out of the hole is to cut government spending, while 21 per cent say raising taxes is the solution.

The poll surveyed 1,523 Canadians between July 10 and 12 and cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Monday 9 p.m.: British Columbia’s health minister says several COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna serve as a reminder of the risks posed by private gatherings.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

“When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Monday 11:40 a.m. A store employee at Square One Shopping Centre has tested positive for COVID-19, according to media relations spokesperson Ashley Shantz.

According to Shantz, the employee’s last day of work was July 8. Management from the store closed the location for “appropriate cleaning and sanitization.” The store is still closed, confirmed Shantz.

Staff who worked with the employee have been asked to get tested and report any negative results before reopening.

Shantz could not confirm which store or restaurant the employee worked at, when the mall was notified of the positive case, or which position the employee held.

“With 122 more resolved, there are 11 fewer active cases in the province,” she said.

There are 137 patients in hospital with COVID-19 with 39 in intensive care units. Of those, 21 are on ventilators.

Most of Ontario — excluding the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest — will enter the third stage Friday, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as physical distancing is maintained.

Queen’s Park says 2,723 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been at least 2,759 COVID-19 deaths in Ontario.

That difference of at least 36 fatalities is because some were not included were not included early in the outbreak since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before those people — most of whom were elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died.

The government says there have been 36,950 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario.

But as of 6 p.m. Monday, a Star count of regional public health units found 38,875 cases.

The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, which means they have symptoms, travel history or contacts that indicate they likely have the disease, but haven’t yet received a positive test from a lab.

Keep tables six feet apart, with a maximum of 50 people. Absolutely no dancing (unless you’re dancing by yourself for everyone else).

That’s the new reality at bars across the province that will be allowed to reopen Friday as part of Ontario’s Phase 3 of COVID-19 recovery, outside of the GTA and a handful of other areas.

With surges of cases in several U.S. states and Montreal that public health officials are blaming on 20- and 30-somethings gathering in crowded bars, all eyes are on these high-risk settings, with the hope that a careful approach can avoid the pitfalls of other places. And in Toronto, officials say they’re open to considering even more cautious measures.

The virus that causes COVID-19 thrives in crowded bars. It’s spread primarily by droplets, which means even if someone doesn’t seem sick, they can easily pass it on.

“This disease, its signature is that it just loves mass indoor gatherings,” said Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the faculty of health sciences at the University of Ottawa.

“You’re going to be standing near each other, you’re going to be breathing near each other, you’re going to be spending a lot of time close to strangers, in an environment where the air is not circulating.”

And after a few drinks even the most vigilant people start to slip up. “It’s a recipe for spread.”

Nightclubs are not allowed to open under Phase 3 in Ontario. This is also the approach B.C. took, along with social distancing inside bars, and capping numbers, and other measures.

It’s good that they’ll stay closed for now, said Deonandan. Bars are trickier, but if you prohibit standing, enforce distancing and minimize the number of people inside, “then you’re on the path to management.”

It would make more sense though, he said, to make rules more around capacity and space, instead of just making an arbitrary one-size-fits-all cap. Bars should also collect names and phone numbers of customers to help with contact tracing.

That’s something that’s now required in Quebec, as of late last week.

Over the weekend authorities in Montreal asked everyone who has visited any bar in the city since July 1 to get tested, as people were infected at least five bars since then across the city and the client registers weren’t yet in place to help with tracking cases.

Deonandan is not alone in being concerned. Toronto Mayor John Tory also told reporters Monday that he’s “very worried about bars,” given what’s going on in Quebec and south of the border, and the thousands of such establishments in the city. He noted restaurants do not seem to pose the same risks.

The city and Toronto Public Health are studying the province’s framework to see what moving into Stage 3 will look like in the city, said Councillor Joe Cressy, who chairs the board of health.

“As we look in Toronto to other jurisdictions, whether it’s the state of California, or Seoul, Montreal just recently, or even Detroit or Pittsburgh, this trend is being seen in real time,” he said in an interview.

“This doesn’t mean that we cannot or should not reopen bars in indoor settings, but it does mean that we need to be extremely cautious, that we need to have protocols in place to ensure and rigorously enforce physical distancing.”

Cressy, while acknowledging he does not want to sound like the dad in “Footloose,” said we need to avoid being Pittsburgh. That city successfully flattened the curve but then there was a rush on bars when they reopened.

“Because there was a sense that the light had switched and they were back to normal,” he said. This means talking to young people in ways and on platforms that they respond to, to make sure messages about ongoing risk are clearly communicated.

“The answer, then, is not to shame younger people but rather to work with them.”

Asked if she would consider even stricter measures in Toronto than what the province is planning, Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s medical officer of health, said the city’s “unique and complex circumstances” mean she’ll “consider everything that is reasonable,” based on the data, science and what’s happening in other places.

“I’m keeping my mind quite open,” she told reporters.

Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga, said it’s clear that “overlapping risk factors” combine for elevated risks in bars, and new cases are expected.

This is a situation where enforcement makes sense, he said. A bar that disregards regulations can be fined, or lose its liquor licence. This already happened earlier this month with Goldie, a bar on King Street West that lost its licence after allegedly holding a secret indoor party.

But Chakrabarti said a key difference between Ontario and the U.S., is that here cases are trending downward, and in many states they are already out of control again. Many bars south of the border reopened too soon and all at once, Chakrabarti said.

In South Korea, Seoul managed to squash a cluster at a few nightclubs in May, through the classic public health measures of testing, tracing and isolating. Although homophobia against members of the LGBTQ community who frequented the gay bars and clubs involved did complicate contact tracing.

“We are going to see cases and that’s expected, as long as we can identify them quickly and curb those fires before they become the big ones,” said Chakrabarti.

It’s all part of the “hammer and dance.” The first phase, or the hammer, was to get cases down as much as possible using blunt measures like lockdowns.

“The dance is now that we’re at this low level, a slow crawl of transmission, you’re tying to keep it in control by really aggressive contact tracing, tracking and testing,” he said.

“I do think much of Ontario’s ready for it.”

The attitudes of most people in Ontario also seem to differ from those in parts of the U.S such as Florida, added Deonandan, where more are refusing to wear masks or take the threat seriously.

“We’re at the stage of the epidemic now where it’s no longer about governments making rules and doctors holding down the fort, or epidemiologists making models. It’s entirely in the hands of the citizens to do their part.

“And it looks like Ontarians are willing, so I’m very optimistic.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reach Her Via Email', 'Sdelacourt Thestar.Ca Or Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"Justin Trudeau made a bold bid to break up with the ethics controversy consuming his government on Monday with a new twist on an old classic: “It’s not WE. It’s me.”

There was nothing vague about the prime minister’s apology for how he and WE Charity have become tangled in an ethics storm over pandemic relief. In fact, Trudeau approached near-mathematical precision on Monday with his very personal regrets for what he had failed to do in the whole mess.

“The mistake we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” he said.

Trudeau said he was sorry he didn’t excuse himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity, and also sorry he didn’t know more about the extent to which his family was involved with it.

What his apology didn’t cover was how this ended up in front of his cabinet in the first place, and the absence of red flags for him or his government — the crucial “what were you thinking” question that hangs over the entire story.

So while Trudeau’s words on Monday may have slightly cooled the ethics uproar that’s erupted in the midst of this pandemic, they won’t make it go away.

Significantly, his apology also offered no assurances for the future, and that’s important — this being his third brush with ethics investigations in his career as prime minister.

What has he learned about why this failed to set off ethical alarms from the outset? Monday’s me-not-WE apology didn’t quite cover that.

Trudeau’s regrets, for now, are intensely personal — maybe intentionally so. A larger, more expansive apology may not come until after the ethics commissioner’s inquiry.

It’s worth looking closely at how precise the prime minister was when he laid out on Monday where he’d gone wrong with WE and the proposal to have the charity handle nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief for students.

Trudeau did not say he was sorry about the idea, which he again said came from the public service, only that he didn’t officially bow out of the discussions about it.

“I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family’s history. I am sincerely sorry about not having done that,” Trudeau said, going on to cite all the ways the government had been working with other charities on pandemic relief.

“But when it came to this organization and this program, the involvement I’d had in the past and my family has should have had me remove myself from those discussions.”

Note: Trudeau is not saying that the proposal shouldn’t have come to cabinet, only that he shouldn’t have been there. The prime minister also didn’t mention Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who has been found to have his own family conflicts with WE, including a daughter employed by the charity.

It was left to Morneau to issue his own personal apology later in the day, in a separate statement, which followed the same general lines as those of his boss: not a bad idea, just unfortunately handled at cabinet.

Significantly, the finance minister hasn’t even ruled out the prospect of WE being the subject of cabinet discussions in future. “I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,” Morneau’s statement said.

The most sincere, genuine part of Trudeau’s apology came when he was talking about how all of this has affected his mother, who has been very public — including at WE events — about her lifelong battles with mental illness.

“Obviously I knew she worked with WE,” Trudeau said. “I didn’t know the details of how much she was getting paid by various organizations but I should have and I deeply regret that. What I also deeply regret is the fact that I have brought my mother into this situation in a way that is really unfair to her.”

Margaret Trudeau’s involvement with WE was definitely obvious. She and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau were together in London at a WE event in March, which is where the prime minister’s wife was believed to have contracted the COVID-19 virus that put the PM into isolation early in the pandemic.

Long before WE was picked as the favoured charity to hand out aid to students during the pandemic, in other words, it had already played a role that was a little too close to home.

Trudeau may be saving the larger, more expansive explanations for his discussions with the ethics commissioner, who will most certainly want to know more than just why the prime minister failed to absent himself from cabinet discussions about WE Charity. “It’s not WE, it’s me,” may work as a break in the heat of this controversy, but those won’t be the last words in this fraught relationship.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"When Justin Trudeau apologized Monday for his lapse in judgment about WE Charity, he delivered it with a giant bouquet of flowers — a promise to extend the 75 per cent wage subsidy for troubled companies until the end of the year.

That may or may not be enough to persuade the public to forgive him for not recusing himself from the controversial file. But even if it’s not, the $50-billion commitment could go a long way toward giving companies a lifeline as they emerge from the pandemic – as long as it’s designed strategically as well as quickly.

The move was foreshadowed last week in Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s fiscal update and has been weeks in negotiation, so let’s not be too cynical about the motivation behind the multi-billion-dollar announcement that Trudeau blurted out within seconds of apologizing for his involvement in the WE fiasco.

But there are no details available yet for how the subsidy will work, and for that, we can be plenty cynical. Trudeau had just one sentence about it in his morning news conference, and Morneau’s office would only say — with a smiley face attached — that details were not ready yet,

It’s that kind of vague policy announcement that got the prime minister in trouble with the WE file to begin with — a headline designed to fill a political need, with the fine print to come sometime “soon,” once the officials can catch up with the politics of the day.

The fine print is important here, for economics and politics alike.

Morneau and Trudeau have pinned their hopes for an economic restart on the wage subsidy. In theory, when provincial governments relax their COVID-19 rules, as Ontario’s Doug Ford did on Monday, the wage subsidy will kick in and help companies stay above water when they reopen just half way.

Ford said some regions of the province can now open up restaurants, bars and daycares, but not necessarily at full capacity because physical distancing rules remain in place.

The hope is that the federal wage subsidy will shoulder a large part of the payroll of any company that is still losing a big chunk of its revenue compared to last year, allowing firms to reopen and bring back their workers even if they’re still constrained due to pandemic rules.

But how much of their payrolls will be covered by this extension? How much money does a company have to be losing in order to qualify? And what about companies that are hoping to hire back minimum-wage workers, but can’t find any because they’re collecting the more lucrative Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)?

Without those answers, companies won’t know if it’s worth their time and effort to reopen on Friday as the premier hopes, says Perrin Beatty, the president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

“We need to get that information as soon as possible,” Beatty said. “It’s critical for tens of thousands of businesses, particularly in some sectors” such as tourism, travel, accommodation, retail and restaurants.

When it was first introduced, the wage subsidy was available to companies that could show a 30 per cent drop in revenues compared to last year. But that agreement expired at the end of June, and now, government officials and business leaders alike say the 30 per cent cut-off is too harsh — there’s no incentive for a company hovering near the threshold to make an extra dollar if it might lose its payroll support as a result.

Similarly, there’s a growing understanding within government that the CERB had its place in sustaining family finances during the dark days of the lockdown, but now it needs to be wound down and replaced as employers reopen so people will be encouraged to go back to work.

These are complex policy questions that officials and experts have been hammering away at with increasing urgency, but that the prime minister — in his haste to have some good news in the face of scandal — rolled out before his civil service had the required paperwork in hand.

That’s partly why he ended up in hot water with WE Charity. In late April, as the opposition NDP roared about the lack of financial help for students and threatened to withhold its support for COVID-19 aid without measures, Trudeau unveiled a generous $9-billion student aid package.

Along with commitments to create more summer jobs and extend emergency benefits to students was the creation of the Canada Student Service Grant — the program now swirling at the centre of the WE controversy. It’s now clear that the plan to pay students up to $5,000 for volunteer work was not nearly ready for prime time.

After winding its way through cabinet approvals, it finally saw the light of day more than two months later, only to spark an immediate controversy. While the Liberals are paying a political price for that backwards process, students continue to go without their promised support.

The wage subsidy talks are well advanced, but the economic stakes of getting the design just right are high. Let’s hope Trudeau didn’t speak too soon again.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-14,"Big number: 665 square feet, the average size of a condo unit in Toronto built in 2017, a reduction of close to half from an average of 1,144 square feet in 1997. Despite more people living in smaller spaces, Toronto still bans people from enjoying a beer in a public park.

The city of Toronto has taken to sending out a press release every Friday afternoon reminding us of the rules for having a good time on these pandemic-era summer weekends. For instance, there are rules about avoiding crowds and wearing a mask or face covering in indoor spaces. Definitely important. Good reminder. The communications also point out Toronto’s $500 fine for littering. I’m all for that. Hell, charge litterbugs more. No bonfires or fireworks? I’m in for that too. We’ve already got a plague. We don’t need wildfires.

But then there’s this: “the consumption of alcohol [is] not permitted in parks, beaches or public spaces.”

Wait, what?

Yes, in the midst of a pandemic, the city has decided that people enjoying a beer or bottle of wine outside is such a priority that this rule needs to be constantly reiterated. This continues even as public health agencies have acknowledged that transmission of COVID-19 appears far less likely to occur in physically distanced outdoor settings, like a park — and much more likely to occur in indoor settings.

To show they’re serious, the messages also point out drinking in a park or on a beach can come with a $300 fine.

It’s a frustrating display of just how uptight Toronto can be, and how slow some policies have been to adapt to a changing city.

For the last couple of decades, this city has become denser and more urban. According to data collected by the city’s planning department, between 2006 and 2016 a full 77 per cent of new housing units created in Toronto were in mid-rise or high-rise condo buildings or apartments.

And homes in these buildings have been getting way smaller. In 1997, the average new condo unit was a spacious 1,144 square feet, according to the same data. In 2017, that figure was almost cut in half, to just 665 square feet.

The city is not growing this way by accident. Planners and politicians have embraced policies to push this kind of development in the downtown core, recognizing that dense, urban living is a good thing when it comes to sustainability and economic growth.

But to keep this kind of living palatable there have to be policies and public services to match. People will buy homes without parking spaces if public transit is good. People won’t care about not having a huge kitchen if the city supports a thriving restaurant scene. And they’ll accept not having a back yard if there are great public parks they can enjoy nearby.

And enjoying a park, for some people, includes being allowed to have a beer.

This should not be a controversial thing. When marijuana became legal, Toronto gave the green light to smoking pot in parks, with some exceptions like near playgrounds or sports fields. It’s worked out OK. Many cities in Europe permit park drinking, without complete moral collapse. And the Ontario government, in its 2019-2020 budget, signalled it was for it, announcing a plan to allow municipalities to designate certain parks as places where people can drink alcohol.

So what’s the hold up? When asked about the issue on Friday in an Q&A session on Reddit, Brad Ross, the city’s chief communications officer, explained that the bylaws might help prevent rowdiness. “The issue, frankly, isn’t someone enjoying a cold beer or glass of wine — it’s the excessiveness … organized parties with cases of beer being brought onto the beach or into parks,” he wrote.

And sure, few people want their local parks to turn into liquor-soaked nightclubs, but there are other laws on the books to address those concerns. The blanket ban on booze turns the people who are just trying to enjoy responsibly into potential criminals, and means putting a lot of faith in the hope that passing bylaw officers won’t be overzealous, or worse.

Given the pace things move at city hall, Toronto may not be able to easily change these restrictions overnight, but the city could at least stop with the regular booze shaming in their communications and instead indicate there won’t be fines or enforcement efforts against responsible consumers.

It’s a good time for it. Throughout this pandemic, Torontonians have had to remember a lot of rules. It would sure be nice to relax with a park beer and forget about this one.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reach Him Via Email', 'Ekeenan Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-13,"WASHINGTON—Canadians learning about the U.S. system of government hear a lot about systemic “checks and balances.” But recent political reality is demonstrating the extent to which theoretical restraints on presidential power depend in practice on good faith and a sense of shame.

Shamelessness is the most obvious aspect of President Donald Trump’s grant of clemency to his friend Roger Stone. It’s something he’s clearly constitutionally entitled to do. But it’s also an act that crosses a self-serving line no other president — not even Richard Nixon — dared approach.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption,” Republican senator and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney called it.

Stone was convicted of witness tampering and lying to federal authorities in the Mueller probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Stone bragged publicly that he didn’t “roll” on the president, but could have. The judge summarized that Stone’s felonies were committed “covering up for the president.” Trump commuted Stone’s sentence, ensuring he wouldn’t serve any jail time.

The Stone case is the most blatant, but it’s part of a pattern in which, as Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith wrote in Lawfare, “Almost all of the beneficiaries of Trump’s pardons and commutations have had a personal or political connection to the president.”

While there are no limits on the president’s power to pardon federal convicts, using it to protect someone whose crime was committed on the president’s behalf is something the constitution’s framers feared. At the ratifying convention in Virginia in 1788, George Mason warned of a future president who “may frequently pardon crimes which were advised by himself.” The remedy the country’s founder’s envisioned for this was summed up by James Madison in response: “the House of Representatives can impeach him; they can remove him if found guilty.”

Just months ago, a Senate trial showed how toothless that idea has become. The Republican-controlled Senate didn’t just acquit Trump after he was impeached by the House, they failed to conduct a real trial: they refused to hear witnesses or allow new evidence, and their leader made clear from the start that the jurors considered themselves part of the president’s team, acting in “total co-ordination” with Trump’s lawyers.

During the impeachment process, scholars opined on how impeachment had always been a less-effective remedy than the constitution had envisioned — the two-thirds majority required for conviction in the Senate made any conviction improbable, and the transparency of the partisan alignments between congress and presidents made it progressively less effective even as popular censure. Trump’s case put an exclamation point on that conclusion, and his defiance of congress in the process further undermined even the appearance of oversight.

Meanwhile, Trump has trampled traditions of independence long considered essential norms upholding the rule of law: the well-remarked politicization of the Department of Justice and the firing of inspectors general meant to provide oversight of the administration, for instance. He has disregarded norms of disclosure of his financial matters and his administration has violated conflict of interest rules to the point of mockery.

In theory, these norms and rules are upheld by arms-length officials, independent branches of government, and the good faith and shame of the president. When officials are persecuted for trying to maintain independence, and congress has no interest in defying the president, the only remaining restraint is the capacity of the president to feel shame. That’s not a quality President Trump is noted for.

The notable contrast to this trend has been the Supreme Court. A series of decisions released in the past two months have gone against the president’s wishes — on topics including immigration, abortion and LGBT rights.

Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by George W. Bush and part of a 5-4 conservative majority bloc on the court, has been a constant in these decisions, voting with the liberal minority, including last week in shooting down the president’s attempt to keep his finances away from prosecutors. There’s been some discussion in the U.S. press about Roberts as a fifth column liberal.

Yet reading the decisions he’s written and signed onto, it’s clear he’s still pursuing a conservative interpretation of the law. In the recent abortion case, for example, he disagreed with the conclusion but cited adherence to recent precedent. In other cases, explicit escape routes were offered to the president, such as in the immigration case where the decision outlined how Trump’s goals could be accomplished constitutionally.

As some court-watchers have said, it appears Roberts, as both chief justice and deciding vote, is protecting the integrity and reputation of the court. He’s a conservative who aligns with Republicans ideologically, but the court’s legitimacy would be undermined if the public saw it as openly partisan. In the long-term service of both his goals and the institution in which he serves them, he sometimes has to “rebuke” the president, as an NPR headline had it this week.

Which is to say, despite the partisanship of his appointment, and sometimes despite his own policy preferences, he’s still trying to be seen upholding the court’s independent mission.

What he’s doing is avoiding bringing shame on himself and the branch of government he represents. It’s only so remarkable because it’s become a rare quality in U.S. government under the presidency of Donald Trump.

Reach Him Email At Pedwards Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-13,"The time might be ripe for outsiders to move into the Hamilton underworld, after the murder of long-time mobster Pasquale (Pat) Musitano, an internationally respected organized crime expert says.

“I think it might indeed be the case that someone from the outside could come in,” said criminologist Anna Sergi of the University of Essex, who has extensively studied Mafia groups in Europe, Australia and North America.

Musitano’s murder means there’s a vacuum on the streets once controlled by Hamilton’s longtime Big Three Crime families — the Musitanos, Papalias and Violis — which could be filled in part by an alliance involving GTA mobsters, Sergi said in an email interview.

Musitano was isolated when he was shot dead Friday in a Burlington parking lot, close to his armour-plated SUV. Another man who was with him was taken to hospital in serious condition. He has not been identified by police.

Musitano’s father Domenic died of natural causes in 1995 while his brother Angelo was murdered in 2017.

His uncle Tony, who had apparently retired from the underworld, died of natural causes in 2019, leaving no one ready to carry on the family name in crime circles.

Meanwhile, the Papalias are no longer a force after Johnny (Pops) Papalia was murdered by Pat Musitano’s hitman, Ken Murdock, in 1997.

Domenico and Giuseppe (Joey) Violi are the third generation of a Hamilton crime family, but they’re both in prison on drug trafficking charges that were part of a massive international case called Project Otremens.

Sergi said there are plenty of possible theories for what happens next, but no safe bets.

“Everything we have now are conjectures!,” she said, adding that the imprisonment of the Violis doesn’t mean they are necessarily out of the picture.

In Buffalo, Joseph Todaro Jr. did not reply to a request for an interview from the Star on Monday while lawyer Robert Boreanaz dismissed any connection between his client and Domenico Violi as “a complete fairy tale.”

Todaro was mentioned as a mob boss with influence into Ontario in a wiretapped conversation that was filed in a Hamilton court in the 2018 drug trafficking case against Domenico Violi.

Violi was convicted in the case, which was called Project Otremens and was part of a much broader investigation into the Mafia in New York State.

Boreanaz dismissed Domenico Violi’s recorded comments to an undercover police agent, who was initiated into the Mafia in Canada during the police operation.

“It’s irresponsible journalism for you to regurgitate this garbage again,” Boreanaz said in an email.

In the wiretap transcripts introduced in court, Domenico Violi told the police agent he had been elevated to underboss of the Todaro crime family in Buffalo and recounted a conversation with a New York mobster after his promotion: “This one guy . . . he goes, ‘Domenic, you know you made history.’ I said, ‘I made history?’ He goes, ‘Yeah, nobody ever in Canada got this position.’ ”

“I’m happy for you Dom, that’s good,” the police agent replied. “You know what? That’s gonna change a lot of things for us here. We could do a lot of good things here.”

“Big time,” Domenico Violi said.

Sergi pointed to the Violi tapes as evidence of a resurgence in the Buffalo-area Mafia after it had been written off by many authorities as dead.

“Mafia groups have a chameleonic ability to adapt,” she writes in an article in the June 5, 2018 issue of Jane’s Intelligence Review.

Sergi argues that Canadians are playing a role in reinvigorating New York crime families.

“A new alliance between Bonanno associates and the Violi family . . . is significant, as it suggests a growing prominence for Calabrian mafia — the ’Ndrangheta — within the New York families and in Canada,” Sergi writes.

Sergi said the Mafia strain known as the ’Ndrangheta has become more active in North America, especially in drug trafficking.

“In common with its growing global reach, the ’Ndrangheta Calabrian mafia is increasing its activity and influence in the region, particularly in Canada but increasingly in New York as well,” Sergi writes.

Domenico and Giuseppe Violi were 11 and 8 years old, respectively, in 1978 when their father, Paolo Violi, was murdered in the Montreal ice cream shop that had once been his headquarters.

Paolo Violi’s criminal organization in Montreal was severely damaged when undercover police officer Robert (Shotgun) Menard secretly recorded conversations between 1970 and 1976, after renting out an apartment above the ice cream shop in the Saint-Léonard district of Montreal.

Those secret recordings included telephone calls to Calabria and Sicily in Italy, and to New York and Miami.

Menard died of a heart attack in 2016 at age 82.

Two uncles of Giuseppe and Domenico Violi were also slain in a protracted war with the Rizzuto crime family in the late 1970s and early 1980s that also killed their father.

After the murders, the surviving Violis moved back to Hamilton, living under the protection of their grandfather Giacomo Luppino, police said.

The agreed statement of fact filed in the trial against Domenico and Giuseppe Violi said they associated with a New York police agent who was also “a trusted associate and then official ‘made’ member of the New York City-based ‘Bonanno’ family.” The police agent’s underworld membership “facilitated his criminal transactions with members and associates of other criminal organizations operating in Canada and in the United States,” the court papers state.

The New York police agent had “numerous discussions about multiple organized crime groups operating in the Greater Toronto Area and elsewhere in Canada and the United States,” the statement continued.

Domenico Violi welcomed the police agent into his Hamilton home, and was once handed $240,000 wrapped in a plastic yellow grocery bag, placed inside a pink and grey shopping bag, according to the statement of facts.

Sergi said in an email interview that there’s plenty of significance to the interactions between the Violi brothers and New York State mobsters.

“Their arrest singled that the Buffalo crime scene is not defunct as previously thought,” Sergi said.

The Violis and Pat Musitano were bitter enemies.

Musitano’s former hitman, Ken Murdock, told the Star a decade ago that Musitano once ordered him to burst into a coffee house in Hamilton’s east end, where leaders of the Luppino-Violi crime group met Thursday mornings, and machine-gunning them all.

Murdock said he ignored the order and eventually the scheme lost steam.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Sabrina Gamrotmississauga News', 'Mississauga News', 'Email', 'Sgamrot Mississauga.Net', 'Sabrina Gamrotmississauga Newstue.']",2020-07-14,"In the wake of the police-involved killing of 62-year-old Ejaz Choudry, the Mississauga community where the Choudry family lives has become a focal point in the call for police reform.

Not only has Choudry’s death sparked conversation about racism in policing and responding to mental health crises in the region, its impact has spread throughout the province and country.

For Peel Regional Police, that impact has come in the form of calls to defund police, implement body-worn cameras for officers and rethink how police respond to those in mental health crisis.

“It’s not just a matter of concern for one community, it’s a matter of concern for the entire city and country,” said Salman Tariq, a local resident who started the #JusticeForEjazChoudry Facebook page.

On June 20, Peel Regional Police (PRP) responded to a mental health crisis call at Choudry’s residence. His family claims that Choudry, who suffered from schizophrenia, threatened to harm himself before they called for help.

Inside Choudry’s Malton apartment, police fired a Taser and plastic projectiles before using lethal rounds. The father of four was pronounced dead on scene.

The public was quick to draw parallels between Choudry’s death and others involving racialized residents in crisis including D’Andre Campbell in Brampton, Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto and Chantal Moore, an Indigenous woman who was killed by New Brunswick police.

“It’s systematic racism. So many cases, just because of your colour, your race, you’re treated differently,” said Choudry’s nephew Hassan Choudhary at a news conference following his uncle’s death.

As outrage and anger began to intensify immediately after Choudry’s death, Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie announced she would be looking at the police budget “through a different lens” and would “explore reforming community policing.”

“There is a lot of frustration and disbelief overall on part of the general public. There is a deep, deep hurt and rage among racialized communities,” said Rabia Khedr of the Peel Council of Muslims.

Malton residents have been protesting in the streets almost every day since the June 20 death at police hands, rallying behind the Choudry and Campbell families. Some, including Choudhary, even travelled to police protests in Toronto to share their stories.

Within days of Choudry’s death Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah and the Police Services Board (of which both Crombie and Duraiappah are members) released statements offering their condolences.

For Duraiappah, the calls for “modernizing” or adapting police services is not a new concept since he took on the role of chief eight months ago.

“The current paradigm for policing is we are not mental health professionals. Under current legislation with the Mental Health Act, if there is somebody in crisis that needs to be connected, the only legislative body that can take them to the hospital is the police,” he said.

According to Peel police’s annual report, there were 6,360 calls for mental health assistance last year.

Duraiappah agreed that PRP’s framework “is already rooted in the wrong system,” and despite their several mental health initiatives, which includes the creation of a Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team composed of officers and crisis workers, the system “is not at its best.”

Camille Quenneville, chief executive of the Canadian Mental Health Association-Ontario, echoed that message by saying in a release that “it’s easy to point fingers and lay blame with police, but these tragic events are a painful reminder of how our health, justice and social systems are failing those living with mental health or addictions conditions.”

“Having 911 as the de facto crisis line is problematic to begin with, but it’s the reality,” she said.

On July 9, Peel Regional Council voted to explore different ways to reduce the role of police in mental health calls. However, a motion to reduce police involvement was not passed as, the Mental Health Act only authorizes police to transport patients to hospital or psychiatric care.

Khedr said that though police are trying to improve their services “there’s only so much that can happen at a municipal level.”

“The substantive change has to come from the Attorney General or the Solicitor General, the provincial treasury and the premier’s office,” Khedr said.

Nearly a week after Choudry’s death, the police services board green-lighted a plan for Peel Regional Police to implement body-worn cameras throughout the force, something board members said was a first step to “accountability.”

But that decision was also questioned by residents. Will police-body worn cameras stop incidents of police shootings and brutality or will they just continue to capture them?

Another aspect of policing that has been questioned is the province’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which investigates any case where there has been a death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault when police are involved.

Choudry’s friends and family have been calling for an independent public inquiry into his death, stating that the SIU “has historically failed victims of police violence and brutality.”

Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has also advocated for a transparent investigation.

“We definitely need a public inquiry. This is bigger than Ejaz Choudry. We want to make sure his death is not in vain,” said Khedr.

“Justice denied is justice delayed,” said Tariq. “We all deserve answers.”

Canadian baseball survey uncorks a few surprises,"['Laura Armstrong', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reportertue.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Laura Armstrong Is A Star Sports Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-14,"Canadian baseball fans are itching for the sport’s return — but wouldn’t mind a shorter, DH-friendly version — according to a recent survey by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

And while more than 60 per cent of respondents are missing the game and even more are longing to watch on TV, fewer will miss trips to the ballpark when the MLB season starts in 10 days without fans in the stands.

The results were compiled from a 15-minute online survey of 904 people over 12 days in June, taking fans’ temperature eight months after the Washington Nationals won the World Series.

“The weather’s getting nice and we started to think: Baseball’s likely going to be back in some form in July. Let’s get a sense of in what ways people miss the game, and then, as they’re thinking about baseball coming back, what changes they’d like to see in baseball if they had the power to do so,” said Jeremy Diamond, chair of the Canadian hall.

The breakdown of respondents: 85 per cent male, 86 per cent from Ontario, 42 per cent between the ages of 39 and 54, 63 per cent non-players, and 64 per cent living in households without children under 18.

Most common was their love of baseball, especially Toronto’s team: 91 per cent considered themselves avid baseball fans, compared to 55 per cent of the general Canadian population, while 81 per cent said the Jays are their favourite team.

Fifty-one per cent found MLB games too long, while 33 per cent picked delays, pace and length of game as the element they dislike most. A distant second in that category: baseball owners at 10 per cent.

Along with shorter games, respondents also want to see: a universal designated hitter (which will be tested this season), no leaving the batter’s box during an at-bat, a 20-second pitch clock and expanded playoffs.

The responses in several categories revealed a generational split, said Diamond.

“For the older ... cohort, Joe (Carter’s) homer, pitchers’ duels, watching (baseball) on TV, that seemed to be where the sweet spot was,” he said. “For the younger (cohort), it was Jose (Bautista’s) bat flip, high-scoring games and going to the ballpark ... When I was in my 20s or a teenager, I loved to see a 10-9 game. I love to now see a 1-0 game.”

Nearly 70 per cent have been missing their baseball TV fix, but when it comes to the social experience of watching live, the survey found 72 per cent of those from age 18 to 30 miss watching a game in person, compared to the overall average of just 53 per cent. Respondents were also more likely to watch baseball on TV alone (63 per cent) than go the game by themselves (18 per cent) when that’s an option.

Fifty-five per cent said they usually see one to five games a season in person, a number that surprised Diamond — who thought it might also surprise Jays president and CEO Mark Shapiro.

“These are people that live and breathe the game,” he said of the respondents. “They follow it. They follow it on social, they maybe play it themselves, softball or otherwise, but they only go down a couple times a year ... The average was pretty low considering it’s on the subway and on the GO train and centrally located and, all things being equal, it still is a pretty affordable entertainment option in the city versus going to a play or going to a hockey game or a basketball game even.”

What draws people to the ballpark? The top two: the sport itself, and the strategy and complexity. There’s also the food: 63 per cent picked hot dogs as their go-to ballpark snack, ahead of beer, soda, popcorn, peanuts and Cracker Jack.

This is the first survey of its kind by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in St. Marys, Ont., which reopened this month — an option for fans while the ballparks are off-limits.

“It’ll be interesting to see when it comes back, in whatever form, how many people come back with it, because it isn’t the same,” Diamond said. “You’re not going to be able to go down there. You can still watch it, but is it going to come off as exciting on TV without a crowd? Or is it just, based on our survey, bring us baseball back? ... In whatever form it comes, we want to see those guys back on the field for a couple of months, and hopefully some playoffs after that.”

How can she prepare for the future?","['Evelyn Kwong', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Starmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Star', 'Toronto Star', 'Are You A Millennial Living In Toronto Or The Gta', 'Need Help With Saving Your Money', 'Be A Part Of', 'Millennialmoney']",2020-07-13,"Editor’s note: This week features a special Gen Z edition of #MillennialMoney.

At 19, third-year nursing student Priya faces a lot of uncertainties about her future. In the back of her mind, she’s thinking about how she’ll pay off her accumulating student loans, which are especially high because of her field.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she’s been studying from her home near Milton and not from the student residences where she usually lives and pays rent.

Priya has kept her job working at a cafe throughout the pandemic, making around $1,000 a month working just weekends.

The cafe is near her family home, so before COVID-19 she took transit to and from school Friday afternoons and Monday mornings.

“When it’s good traffic, it’s about an hour one-way,” she says. Other days the commute could take an hour and a half to two hours, twice a week. “That’s around three hours of my time that I could be studying or having some time to myself between constant studying, school, classes and work,” she says.

That’s why she’s hoping to purchase a car — once she gets her licence. “Once I get my G2, I want to eventually get a car, which would cut those commute times. But that also comes with insurance and gas expenses too,” she says.

On a typical school day, she’ll pack a lunch of leftovers from the dinner she cooked the night before. “I will do all my groceries for the week with my parents when I go home on the weekend and then cook for myself all week,” she says.

Now that it’s a summer, Priya is working weekdays and weekends, but she very rarely packs a lunch for her work shifts. “I usually eat food from work, for free.”

With lockdown restrictions loosened, after work she’ll hang out with friends at home, go for food, bubble tea or coffee, or watch a movie at a friend’s house to keep costs low.

Priya wants to start saving to be better prepared to tackle her OSAP when she graduates in two years, but with the hurdles of maintaining her grades, keeping a job and commuting, she needs some direction.

We asked Priya to share her daily spending to get a better idea of her financials.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., shares some advice for Priya.

Priya is living pretty lean as a student with a part-time income of about $12,000 per year. She is doing all the right things now from a spending perspective by keeping discretionary spending low, packing lunch during the school year and cooking so she has leftovers. She’s lucky to be able to eat for free at work. Credit cards can be pretty enticing to other young people in her position as a means to supplement spending. She has done well to live below her means.

I note she comes home from school in order to work on the weekends. One way for her to boost her cash flow could be to find work closer to where she rents and goes to school so she can pick up a few hours of work during the week more easily without having to commute to work. Rent eats up 60 per cent of her income, so she doesn’t have much left to spare.

She has lots of OSAP student debt to pay back, but as long as she has at least 60 per cent of a full course load her loan should be interest-free. Any extra cash she can save in the interim should be deposited to a Tax Free Savings Account so whatever interest she earns is not subject to tax. An RRSP account would not be appropriate for her, as her income is so low that it is tax-free, making RRSP tax deductions useless for her right now. I would keep her savings in a TFSA or very conservative investment with little to no exposure to stocks. She could need her savings on short notice, so that does not lend itself well to riskier long-term investment options, despite the potential temptation.

When Priya completes school, OSAP repayment becomes a more enticing option for extra cash flow. This is because the potential return she can earn on saving and investing may not be as high as the interest rate on her OSAP loan, especially for conservative or even moderate risk investment options.

Once she gets her G2 licence and can drive on her own, she wants to get a car. I remember that dream myself. G2 licences were introduced partway through the year I turned 16, so my friends with early calendar year birthdays got full G licences and could drive on their own without a parent. But the reality is that cars can be a luxury for even those working and earning a good living, let alone a young person with student debt. These days, ride-sharing services make it easier to get around and avoid the monthly payments to have a car at your disposal.

Result: She spent less! Spending in Week 1: $156. Spending in Week 2: $30

How she thinks she did: “This was pretty light!” Priya says. A big part of why? Ever since she started this exercise of recording her spending it’s made her much more conscious. “I am really trying to be mindful of the money I spend now that I can see it right in front of me.”

Also, living at home since pandemic restrictions has shown her that eating meals at home and working more — as it’s summer and she’s closer to work — helps save a lot of unnecessary costs.

She does note, however, that outside of COVID-19 times she’d be spending at least $100 more a week. “I’d probably be going out a lot more, which means more on food and drinks with friends,” she says.

Take-aways: After reading Heath’s advice on finding a job closer to school Priya has decided to live at home and commute to school daily instead of paying rent for student residence. “Rent was getting expensive,” she says. After doing the math, spending more on commuting made more sense especially if she can live and eat at home. “It’ll also give me more time to slow down and do things I want to do.”

Another realization? “A car is such a luxury.” Priya admits that even though she’ll have to take public transit more, she probably can’t afford a car for at least a year.

Finally, it’s time that she opens up a savings account. “I was never taught this during school and it is important because I know I’ll have a lot to pay back,” she says. She’ll be asking her older siblings for advice on a TFSA and how she can start preparing to pay off OSAP sooner rather than later.

Read', 'David Ridercity Hall Bureau Chief', 'City Hall Bureau Chief', 'Francine Kopuncity Hall Bureau', 'City Hall Bureau', 'With Files Robert Benzie']",2020-07-13,"Nuit Blanche and the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon will move online this year to help minimize the spread of COVID-19, it was announced on Monday, even as the province moved to reopen most businesses later this week.

“It’s a difficult decision for us to make, but we believe that it is the right thing for us to do, based on public health advice,” said Mayor John Tory, speaking at Monday’s COVID-19 update from city hall.

Tory said that the cancellation of city-led and city-permitted outdoor special events will be extended through to the end of September, including the permit for the marathon on Oct. 18.

The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) remains scheduled for September, with a majority of the film screenings moved online.

An estimated 1.2 million people participated in the Nuit Blanche late-night arts festival last October and 26,000 people took part in the waterfront marathon, which will be replaced for this year by a virtual version, in which participants can still seek to fundraise for one of the event’s charity partners.

Tory spoke hours after Premier Doug Ford announced that businesses in 24 of Ontario’s 34 public health districts would be moving to stage three of reopening on Friday, after being mostly shut down since March, when the pandemic took hold in Canada.

Stage three means restaurants can serve diners indoors, bars can open in a limited way, and so can movie theatres, gyms and tour services — provided they abide by social distancing protocols.

In stage three, indoor gatherings can increase to a maximum of 50 people and outdoor gatherings to 100 people, but remain subject to physical distancing requirements.

Amusement parks will remain closed in stage three, and so will buffets. Dancing at restaurants and bars will not be permitted.

Toronto, York, Peel, Durham, Niagara, Windsor-Essex, Halton, Hamilton, Lambton and Haldimand-Norfolk will remain in stage two until infection rates fall further.

While daily new infections in Toronto are down to about 40 new cases a day and the number of outbreaks has dropped to 13 from 108, vigilance is necessary to prevent a second wave, said Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s medical officer of health, also speaking at the press conference at city hall.

Montreal recently suffered an outbreak traced back to a bar and California on Monday imposed a sweeping statewide rollback, closing all bars and indoor dining, after a renewed surge in cases.

“Given the increase in COVID-19 cases we have seen in other jurisdictions that have opened earlier than in the GTA, we support continuing the cautious approach we have taken so far in Ontario and the GTA,” said Tory, who praised Ford for permitting a regional approach to reopening.

Tory on Monday also announced the launch of DriveInTO, which will allow for temporary drive-in entertainment across Toronto this summer, including films, concerts and sports broadcasts, at locations including Ontario Place and CF Sherway Gardens. The programming will include material from Hot Docs and TIFF.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said public health officials will review COVID-19 data for the 10 excluded areas on Monday. Their advice could see Toronto and the other laggards move to stage three as early as July 24.

In stage three, nightclubs can only serve food or drinks to customers who must be seated — not standing — in order to reduce the opportunity for closer contact, which could spread the virus.

Earlier Monday, Tory said he expects Toronto to be only days behind other parts of Ontario.

“I don’t think it’s going to be a long, long time at all,” Tory told CP24.

Torontonians moved to stage two, with reopened restaurant patios, malls and hair salons, on June 24. That was 12 days after most other regions entered stage two.

Stage three “is coming soon to a neighbourhood near you, but it’ll be done on an appropriate, measured basis,” Tory said.

The mayor said his biggest concern is bars, where people move close to hear each other and consume alcohol that can make them be less vigilant about physical distancing and other anti-infection measures.

Coun. Joe Cressy, chair of Toronto’s public health board, echoed that concern in an interview with the Star.

“By no means do I want to be a Debbie Downer, but we only have to look at Pittsburgh” and other cities that have seen bar patrons infect each other and trigger outbreaks, Cressy said.

“The highest risk (of infections) is in indoor settings with close contact in crowds,” Cressy said.

“I think it’s fair to say that after a couple of beers many people are less likely to stay six feet apart.”

Read', 'Sheila Wangyorkregion.Com', 'Swsheila Wang Covers Municipal Politics', 'General News In Richmond Hill', 'King Township.', 'Sheila Wangyorkregion.Comtue.']",2020-07-14,"As the federal and provincial governments race to ramp up testing for COVID-19, a Richmond Hill company is breaking ground on a rapid, cheap and easy-to-use device to detect infection.

LooK SPOT, a portable rapid point-of-care antigen test device, is the brainchild of Laipac Technology Inc., a leading GPS electrical engineering company based in Richmond Hill.

The test, which is expected to roll out in September, will be able to detect proteins of the new coronavirus from a nasal swab sample in less than five minutes with 95 per cent accuracy, according to Laipac.

“It will be the start of something big,” Diego Lai, founder and CEO of Laipac Technology, said on July 8. “We have a lot of faith in this and hope it would become something that would help a lot of people.”

With no prior training required, the test is based on a technique called lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) —commonly used for home pregnancy tests — which only takes a few minutes to produce a result after a sample comes in contact with the LFIA strip, according to the company’s website.

LooK SPOT returns the test result on a smartphone, using artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology, when the strip is inserted into the device that is clamped onto the phone.

Currently, nucleic acid-based testing — PCR, or molecular testing — is the gold standard used in hospitals and assessment centres in Canada and abroad to determine active COVID-19 infection, according to Health Canada.

However, PCR testing that requires lab work may take hours, even days, to produce a result.

More than 106,000 Canadians have tested positive for COVID-19 since the beginning of the outbreak in the country as of July 9, but the actual case count is believed to be higher, as a significant number of asymptomatic people may not have been tested.

In York Region, the three assessment centres tested around 9,000 people on average every week in June and early July, according to public health statistics.

Between March and June, when the crisis was at its highest, less than half of those who tested positive for COVID-19 in the region were able to get results within 24 hours, and some of them had to wait for more than two days, according to the turnaround time for positive tests provided by public health.

LooK SPOT would offer a new type of diagnostic test that is much faster and more accessible, Lai said, noting the estimated cost was only $10 per test.

The company is currently in the process of obtaining approval from Health Canada for the new testing kit, he said.

Laipac — like many other local businesses — has taken a hit from the pandemic since its onset, the CEO said.

The company started developing LooK SPOT in April as a creative solution to the challenges that businesses have experienced amid the pandemic, said Lai.

Once launched, the medical device will be the latest addition to a long list of innovations that Laipac has developed over the past decades.

In 2018, the firm won the Innovator of the Year Award in Richmond Hill for its innovative contribution to the local economy.

Lai said LooK SPOT would provide an ideal solution for services and businesses such as clinics, medical offices, factories and farms to pre-screen people for COVID-19 in order to resume operations.

Lai has also been in talks with major airliners in Canada about the possibility of using LooK SPOT to screen passengers for COVID-19 before boarding the airplanes, he added.

“We wanted to help. Everything has been shut down, and with this device, they can reopen,” Lai said.

Lai said the Richmond Hill business is one of the first Canadian companies that is developing an antigen test device for COVID-19.

The up-and-coming method of testing has been used for rapid COVID-19 detection in other countries such as the United States and India.

Earlier in July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the second rapid antigen test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

FDA commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D., applauded the decision, noting antigen tests played an “important role” in the overall response against COVID-19 and a point-of-care test could potentially “scale up to test millions of Americans quickly.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-13,"KELOWNA, B.C.—Health officials are monitoring several cases of COVID-19 exposure in Kelowna, B.C., and say they’ve identified two more locations where people may have contracted the respiratory illness.

Interior Health says in a statement issued Sunday that a restaurant and spin studio have been added to the resort and a bed and breakfast identified on Friday in an advisory about the Okanagan outbreak.

An email from the health authority says eight positive tests for the virus are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised Friday to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

Public health contact tracing is underway, and the health authority says, it is reaching out directly, where possible, to anyone who has been exposed.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, says the statement from Interior Health.

“Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” says the statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, washing hands regularly, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority says.

Read', 'May Warrenstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'May Warren Is A Toronto-Based Breaking News Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-12,"When a few cases of COVID-19 popped up in Kingston in late June, contact tracers immediately started looking for patterns.

For months they had kept infections low, with just two discovered the entire month before. So where did these new ones come from? What could the patients have in common?

It turned out that two of them had recently gotten their nails done. That crucial clue helped public health officials quickly link the cluster back to a west-end salon, test over 6,000 people, and get hundreds more to self-isolate.

“This was classic public health work,” said Dr. Azim Kasmani, public health and preventive medicine resident physician at Kingston, Frontenac, and Lennox & Addington Public Health.

“We’re going to keep seeing outbreaks here and there, but it’s making sure that those little sparks don’t turn into big fires.”

As we emerge from months of lockdowns, the virus that causes COVID-19 could be lurking anywhere. A nail salon, a restaurant patio, a wedding or funeral. But with new infections and deaths down across Ontario and in the GTA — on Friday the province announced there were fewer active cases than there have been since before the April peak of the outbreak — we may soon be in a situation where we can proactively fan out the flames. As the epidemiologists call it: “cluster busting.”

If we can do it right.

“We’re at least trending in the right direction,” said Ashleigh Tuite, an assistant professor at U of T’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, whose spring outbreak modelling with colleague professor David Fisman showed months of social distancing would be required to flatten the curve.

We’re also in a “much better place than we were a month or two ago,” when it comes to the R number, the average number of people each person with COVID-19 will infect.

It fluctuates daily, Tuite, said, but is now sitting at or below one. Above one means infections will continue to grow, like in March and April. One is a “sustained epidemic” that’s “grumbling along.” Below one means it’s declining.

Ideally, we’ll now have the ability to focus more on place. Find where people are getting infected, and quickly test, trace and isolate individuals, whether they’ve been at a barbershop, a factory or a family birthday party.

Japan has been doing this cluster-busting successfully since the beginning of the pandemic, Tuite said, managing to avoid lockdowns. The country relies on an army of contact tracers, which they’ve used in the past for squashing outbreaks of diseases like tuberculosis.

“It makes a lot of sense,” Tuite said. “The challenge is you can’t do that if you have hundreds or thousands of new cases a day. It’s just not feasible.”

In March, public health authorities had limited options because COVID-19 was spreading so quickly unchecked.

“We went with a really blunt measure, which was basically a shutdown,” she said. “The goal has always been to have a more nuanced response that relies more on testing and tracing. I think we’re headed in that direction.”

It’s not easy but “the advantage is if you can do it, you avoid another shutdown.”

This is essentially what Kingston was able to do. By Kasmani’s count, 37 cases were identified linked to the nail salon outbreak. Once they realized the connection they made a public appeal for anyone who had been there since it opened to get tested and self-isolate for 14 days, and the salon was temporarily closed.

There have now been several days with no new cases again. One person was hospitalized related to the salon outbreak but has since recovered, Kasmani said.

He chalks up the success to good communication, existing relationships with the community and public buy-in. The medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore, streamed his whiteboard debriefs on social media, showing the spread in a transparent way that helped people understand what was happening.

The health unit had also laid groundwork to prevent outbreaks by developing a checklist, adapted from provincial guidelines for businesses, on how to safely reopen. And testing was “broad but it was also targeted” to those most at risk.

The unit also brought in a mandatory mask policy within days of the outbreak, which “isn’t perfect” but does help, Kasmani added.

P.E.I. is also in the midst of its own kind of cluster busting, trying to control the spread from six active cases all linked back to a person who entered the Atlantic travel bubble from the U.S. with a student visa.

The most recent positive case, a man in his twenties, first tested negative, P.E.I.’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Heather Morrison, told reporters Thursday. He eventually developed symptoms and retested positive. But luckily he was still self-isolating, as health authorities had asked all close contacts of positive cases to do, regardless of their test results.

“We know that COVID-19 has not gone away and it will be with us for a considerable amount of time,” she said. “We should not let our guard down and we should remain vigilant. Now is not the time to become complacent.”

The island has only had 33 cases of COVID-19 in total and no deaths.

In the Maritimes things have come full circle with new cases related to travel, just as they were back in February, said Colin Furness, an assistant professor at the faculty of information at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

“The system worked,” he said. “Public health was right on top of it, isolating, contact tracing, testing, and there no one has to say, uh oh we’ve got to pull back.

“At our best that’s exactly what it’s going to look like.”

But it’s important to also remember that COVID “thrives in marginalized populations” and that it’s “going to keep going there.”

In Toronto, the northwest corner has been the hardest hit. The Star found that those neighbourhoods also have some of the highest concentrations of residents who are low-income, racialized and living in crowded housing while working in higher-risk sectors like manufacturing.

The province’s migrant workers have also been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

Furness would like to see more investment in public health units for hiring, more proactive leadership from the medical officer of health, and what’s called sentinel testing.

That’s where people are randomly tested in a community to see how many are infected. This would ideally happen in high-risk work settings likes farms, salons and restaurants, and vulnerable neighbourhoods.

Mandatory face-covering bylaws will also “definitely help” slow the spread, he added.

Furness also said the government should tighten up what “essential travel” means, particularly as the situation in the U.S. spirals out of control with over three million COVID infections. There should be zero tourists and business travellers, he said. But special considerations should be made for international students and extended family members of Canadians.

He does still worry about a rise in cases in the fall, when everyone heads back inside. If we do really thorough sentinel testing, then “yes we’re going to keep a lid on it, but I don’t know if we’re going to do it,” he said.

Now is the time, said Tuite, to be making improvements to the system, as well as urging everyone not to let their guard down.

“The question is, in Ontario do we have the resources and the test capacity and the contact tracing capacity to do this?”

“I guess we’ll find out.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But staff fear a second wave,"['Megan Ogilvie', 'Megan Ogilviehealth Reportersat.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Megan Ogilviehealth Reporter', 'Health Reporter', 'Megan Ogilvie Is A Toronto-Based Health Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"On June 30, North York General Hospital marked a milestone: After 100 days there were no COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit.

That morning, staff gathered to quietly celebrate and reflect on the harrowing weeks of treating the sickest coronavirus patients. The hospital, at Leslie Street and Sheppard Avenue East, was among the first in the GTA to see a wave of critically ill patients with the virus; at its peak, the community hospital had 12 COVID patients in its 21-bed ICU.

Now, during this lull, staff are taking some much-needed time off, though they are not letting down their guard. There are still six COVID patients in the hospital who could require intensive care, and they know new patients can be admitted any time.

While they hope the hardest days are behind them, staff also know the break is likely only temporary. And they worry, after weeks of working flat out, about whether they have the resiliency to face a second wave.

The Star spoke with three ICU staff about the gruelling work of caring for COVID patients, their heartaches and successes and their tentative sense of relief that they made it through the first months of the pandemic.

Rina-Marie Austrie-Fletcher, 40, a registered nurse with 15 years of experience, has worked for eight years in the hospital’s ICU, three as the unit and special projects co-ordinator. A mother of two kids, Austrie-Fletcher worked hours of overtime during the pandemic and was always available to staff by phone and email. She will take her first full week off since December later this month.

Honestly, sometimes I don’t even remember what we did before COVID. Things have changed so much.

I remember the first COVID patient who came into the ICU. A young guy; I don’t think he had any underlying health conditions. Usually, the majority of our patients are in their 60s, 70s, 80s. This gentleman was in his 40s. That was the start of seeing younger COVID patients coming into the ICU and they were getting sick — really sick — quick.

Those first few weeks of the pandemic, it was nerve-racking. People were very anxious. Even though we had planned for weeks, no one knew what to expect. The virus was new to everybody, including the physicians. And we worried about taking the virus home to our families.

I remember Easter weekend distinctly. It was a very, very busy weekend with very sick patients. Many COVID patients require kidney dialysis. They need medications for their blood pressure. There is a danger of blood clots. Many are fully ventilated. Some are chemically paralyzed. Some have to be proned (positioned to lie on their stomachs). That weekend, there were so many things going on for each patient — they were so sick — I think I will always remember it and how the staff supported each other through it.

Months later, on the day we had no COVID patients in the ICU, we celebrated. We take care of our patients and we do it well, so it was important to mark the moment. We all clapped, and it was a nice feeling, a good feeling — for now, anyways.

In the back of my mind, the possibility of a second wave is always there. I know people in our unit are also anxious about it. People were separated from their families, and I know nobody wants to go through that again. I think everybody just wants to know when this is going to end.

For months, many of our staff have been working overtime. It’s tiring. Not just physically. It’s mentally tiring — you’re always thinking: “What can I do to make this person survive?” It’s emotionally tiring — some of our patients were dying without family members beside them and so we stepped in. On every level, it was a strain.

Speaking to you, I’m starting to get emotional. I haven’t really spoken about it. As nurses, we just go on with our day and do our job. I don’t know if I’ve blocked it out or I don’t want to go back to that time. But speaking about it again brings up a lot of emotions. Our staff has worked so hard through this time.

We all need a break; I have a week off later this month and I can’t wait. During the pandemic, when I did get a day off, I tried to relax with my family. I tried to take time for myself, whether it was reading a book or meditating, anything to try and detach from my work.

I’m hoping with what Toronto is implementing now — with masks and people understanding the importance of hand hygiene — the second wave of COVID won’t be as bad as predicted. Working at the front lines, seeing these patients and treating them, we know the virus is very real. Whatever we can do to minimize the spread is what we need to do. People are dying all over the world who don’t need to die from this invisible virus that we can actually stop if we were to do the right things.

During the first lockdown, when other people stayed home, nurses came into work every day. We do it because we care about people and we want to help them; it’s why we chose the profession.

But there is still fear about getting the virus. And the fear you have that you are going to give the virus to someone you love is very real, because you see how bad it can be. The ICU gets the patients who are the sickest of the sickest of the sickest and you see, first-hand, just what the virus can do.

Let’s hope and pray it’s not as bad in the second wave and that everything we are doing now will benefit us later on. We are still going to prepare; and I think we will be more prepared this time, when it happens. But this little break is nice; it’s good. It’s the lull that we all need.

Dr. Anna Geagea, 34, is a critical care physician with three years of experience in North York General’s ICU. She and other members of the ICU team started planning for COVID-19 patients in January. Even now, with cases dropping across the country, she feels as though she can’t let down her guard.

It became real for us when the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March and once we saw other big cities get hit hard. For me, the most stressful part was not knowing how bad it could be in Toronto.

In the beginning, community hospitals in the GTA had a lot of COVID patients come through. We started seeing them a bit earlier than in downtown Toronto and at one point we were one of the busiest COVID hospitals.

We were ready. We had done a lot of preparation and planning, teaching and practising. Even before we had COVID patients, we were watching each other don and doff our personal protective equipment and running through procedures. The whole time, we had been preparing for the worst-case scenarios. Thankfully it didn’t ever get to that point.

When the COVID patients started to arrive, it was almost easier than the anticipation. We were very careful; our attention was at 150 per cent, 200 per cent, constantly, to make sure we were not contaminating ourselves or putting our team at risk.

The part that was most difficult for me during that period was not having visitors come be with their loved ones. As a team, it was distressing. Usually, we go above and beyond to have family and visitors be present. We prepared for the medical part of COVID but nothing prepared us for telling families they couldn’t visit.

Despite the hospital’s visitor restrictions due to the pandemic, we tried our best to make exceptions for very sick patients to have their families at the bedside. In some cases that wasn’t possible because the families themselves had the virus or shared the same household as the sick patient.

On our hard days, our team got together to talk about our feelings, our emotions, our frustrations. Many times, we would sit down as a team and just talk about it. On one difficult day, we had two very sick COVID patients die — almost back-to-back — without their families there. I found that communicating to the families how sad we were about this helped me cope.

Another coping strategy was to find solutions to hard situations. We started to have families create videos for patients. Many families got very creative; some videos had an entire family say short messages to the patient, others had chosen specific music. When we played them, you could see some patients — even the ones who were very sick and sedated to tolerate the ventilator — you could see them tear up or react to familiar voices. That was very heartwarming.

We did have good days, often when a COVID patient was well enough to have their breathing tube come out. To liberate someone from a ventilator, those moments were encouraging; our team felt like we had achieved our goal. Some of the sickest patients who came in, when we took them off the ventilator, we had families watching on FaceTime; it was a great way to celebrate with them.

Now that things are slowing down, we are still vigilant. We know it’s not over for us. We are cautious because we know the moment we put our guard down we could have a COVID outbreak. We are still very careful.

My fear is that the end of the pandemic is not near. We gave 200 per cent of our energy in the past few months. I worry there will be a lot of burnout in our health-care system and among health-care workers. I worry if COVID continues, and we have the second or third waves, we will probably be much more tired over the long run because of the extra physical and emotional pressure it takes to always be hypervigilant and alert. I’m worried about our stamina throughout the pandemic. With another wave, we will maybe be more trained and more familiar with the virus, but we will be more tired because of our sustained and constant effort.

For now, I’m going to spend time with my family and continue to celebrate good moments with my team.

Shellisa Mohamed, 37, is a registered nurse who has worked in the hospital’s ICU since 2010. By early March, just before the Ontario government declared a provincial emergency on March 17, she knew her job would drastically change with the arrival of COVID-19 to the hospital.

During the first weeks of the pandemic, we were getting three admissions to the ICU at a time — COVID-positive patients coming straight to us from the emergency department.

That was a scary time because we didn’t know what was going to happen and everyone was scared about getting COVID themselves. We became very diligent in cleaning all the equipment in the ICU — all the workstations, the keyboards, the chairs, washing our hands non-stop. It became a lot. It took a toll on people. But the nurses, talking about it with one another, we realized everyone was feeling the same way and that helped.

Over the past month, we have been seeing fewer COVID patients. When we come into our ICU, patients are listed on a board and when you see no one requires special precautions (no COVID-positive patients), it gives you a little sense of relief … maybe things are getting better.

Still, we know that COVID-free in the ICU only means at this moment; it doesn’t mean they still won’t come. We’re still prepared.

One of my high points of the pandemic is seeing our staff stand up and say they are going to come in and help patients. Nobody ran away. Even though we didn’t know at the beginning what it was going to be like, everybody was willing to say: “I’m going to stay and take care of these patients.”

One of my low points was not having patients’ families here. That was very difficult, especially for patients dying of COVID. Every day, our social worker and nurses would set up iPads so families could see their loved ones. The hardest part was when the patient was dying and the family couldn’t come in and they watched from a screen; hearing them cry was the hardest.

We got through those hard moments by talking to each other. The hospital also offered meditation and counselling for the staff working through COVID.

As a nurse, you are used to working a 12-hour shift and when you go home you still have a bit of energy to do something else. But now, it’s different. It all takes a toll: Gowning up, going into the rooms, coming out, being cautious of cleaning and washing your hands, wearing PPE all day. By the end of the day, you are literally exhausted and all you can do is get home to get sleep to get back here the next day.

Now, some of us are starting to take days off, which is much needed. Some of my friends (outside of health care), they’ve been working from home, and not seeing anybody. But for us nurses, we are seeing the same faces; every day is the same routine, nothing changed for us. When I have days off, I like that I can literally sit in silence or go out for a walk or bike ride and enjoy the nice weather.

In the hospital, we have opened the ICU back up to visitors. It was so bizarre when there were no families or visitors these past few months. It’s really nice to have them back in the building.

An epidemiologist explains,"['Laura Armstrong', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reporterfri.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Laura Armstrong Is A Star Sports Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-19,"Editor’s note: The Star is taking a broad look at what entering the second phase of reopening after COVID-19 lockdowns will mean for Ontario. Every day, we’ll try and answer a different question about post-lockdown life. You can read a recap of all of the questions we’ve answered here.

Anyone in Ontario can get tested for COVID-19, after Premier Doug Ford opened up testing across the province late last month.

But what does that mean for the average Ontarian? Who, when and how often should you get tested?

Testing is appropriate for anyone who thinks they have a symptom or is concerned about exposure, according to Hayley Chazan, a spokesperson for health minister Christine Elliott.

A Ministry of Long-Term Care memo sent to long-term care homes licensees at the end of May said the province required continued surveillance testing of LTC home staff and “intended” for all long-term care home staff to be tested “at reasonable intervals, a minimum twice in the month of June,” though care homes could test their staff more frequently. Another memo, from the Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility, sent out June 9 to retirement home licensees, asked all retirement homes to ensure testing was done every two weeks on any individual working in the home.

There are no recommended testing intervals for the public, according to Chazan.

Timothy Sly, an epidemiologist and professor at the School of Occupational and Public Health at Ryerson University and who was involved in the management of SARS in Toronto in 2003, said testing should work on a hierarchy system, with everybody in the hospital system and long-term care homes tested once a week. There should be a hierarchy within those institutions, too, with people like respiratory therapists and triage nurses at the top.

Anyone who is dealing with the public on a regular basis, and there are more people who fit this bill in stage two, should also be getting tested regularly — if tests are available — like hairdressers, wait staff, airline attendants, and taxi and limousine drivers.

“If you look back … where’s been the real spreading events? They’ve all been institutions in one way or another, whether they’re meat-packing plants or jails and prisons, or cruise ships or (long-term care) homes,” Sly said. “They’ve been that kind of organized thing where factory workers are side by side for an eight-hour shift, breathing air 18 inches from somebody else. From a larger, community point of view, we really should be looking at strategic testing, taking advantage of the tests available to start looking for all the places that the virus might be and we don’t know where it is.”

As for the ordinary person who has been staying home for the past few months without really going anywhere? There is not much point in that person getting tested, Sly said.

Testing is one point in time; a negative test does not necessarily mean a person is free of COVID-19. That’s why Sly suggests someone who believes they know the point of infection should wait a couple of days — while isolated — before going for a test.

“If you think you’ve just run into a situation … and you think you were exposed this afternoon, don’t go and get tested now,” Sly said. “They won’t find anything. It’s going to take two or three days to find anything in your throat, so that would be a waste for a test.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Just before the patient died, they looked at their nurse and said, ‘I think I made a mistake, I thought this was a hoax, but it’s not,’” Dr. Jane Appleby said in a video posted by the news station.

Appleby, chief medical officer of the city’s Methodist Hospital, said she made the case public to make younger people aware that they are not immune.

“It doesn’t discriminate, and none of us are invincible,” she said. “This virus is very serious and can spread easily.”

“COVID parties” are get-togethers involving a person who has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, with attendees supposedly gathering as a dare. Whether such parties actually exist has been questioned, but “the thought is to see if the virus is real and to see if anyone gets infected,” Appleby said.

In this case, she said, the patient became critically ill and uttered the tragic statement shortly before dying.

Futures fell by as much as 2.6 per cent in New York. California, one of the largest gasoline-consuming states in America, announced on Monday that it would pull back on reopening efforts, the latest red flag for the return of oil demand. This isn’t just happening in America — Hong Kong imposed its strictest social distancing measures yet and Japan said a new state of emergency is possible if infections increase.

Crude’s drop was part of a broader downward move in markets, as the economic hit of rising virus cases continues to grow. European equity markets extended a global retreat.

An OPEC+ committee meets Wednesday to discuss easing record output curbs that have helped the market recover. The group is expected to stick to its plan of tapering the cuts from August even as the coronavirus rages unabated in many parts of the world. An increase in supply from OPEC+ would hit a global economy that’s still far from pre-virus levels of activity, with a range of indicators in the U.S. suggesting the recovery has slowed in the past few weeks.

“Everybody agrees it’s very early days, it’s not going to be a straight line recovery with the resurgence in cases in the U.S. in particular,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects said in a Bloomberg TV interview.

The OPEC+ committee will consider whether the alliance should keep 9.6 million barrels of daily output off the market for another month, or taper the cutback to 7.7 million barrels as originally planned. Members are leaning toward the latter, according to several national delegates who asked not to be identified.

Read', 'Zen Soothe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Zen Soothe Associated Presstue.']",2020-07-14,"HONG KONG—Huawei Technologies reported Tuesday that its revenue grew 13.1 per cent in the first half of the year compared with a year earlier, despite sanctions from the U.S and challenges from the coronavirus pandemic.

Revenue rose to 454 billion yuan ($88.3 billion) in January-June compared to 401.3 billion yuan during the same period last year. The company said its profit margin was 9.2 per cent, compared to 8.7 per cent last year.

The telecommunications equipment firm, based in the southern commercial hub of Shenzhen, is facing efforts by the U.S. government to restrict Huawei’s ability to procure technology and components from American suppliers. U.S. officials say Huawei is a security risk. The company denies that.

In May last year, Washington put Huawei on a blacklist that forbids U.S. companies from doing business with it without permission from the government. That has hindered Huawei’s access to components like computer chips and software such as Google’s Android mobile operating system.

In May, officials imposed even tighter rules aimed at limiting Huawei’s access to semiconductors by barring chipmakers that use U.S. technology in chip design from shipping to Huawei without obtaining a license.

The U.S. has also been applying pressure on countries to exclude Huawei from upcoming, ultrafast 5G mobile networks.

Huawei is awaiting a decision this week on whether it will be allowed to supply 5G network equipment in the U.K., six months after officials initially agreed that the company could have a limited role in its networks.

The company is also expecting decisions by Germany later this year.

Meng Wanzhou, the company’s chief financial officer and daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is currently under house arrest in Canada, in an extradition trial that could result in her being sent to the U.S. to face charges that include bank fraud and a violation of trade sanctions.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Alyshah Hashamcourts Reporter', 'Courts Reporter', 'Alyshah Hasham Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Crime', 'Court For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"As demand for legal aid services rises from Ontarians facing evictions, job loss, domestic violence and other issues, Legal Aid Ontario is staring down a funding crisis that lawyers say could decimate front-line services in the coming months.

“There could be anywhere from a $60 to $70 million shortfall,” said Lenny Abramowicz, head of the Alliance for Sustainable Legal Aid and the Association of Community Legal Clinics of Ontario.

“On top of the (30 per cent) budget cuts that happened last year, if that is what we are facing this year, my understanding is that we will be looking at a significant decrease in services across the board. There will be less access to justice across the province if both levels of government don’t step up and deal with this COVID-related emergency. There will be people going unrepresented across courts and tribunals across Ontario.”

Amid the funding crisis, he is expecting a “tsunami” of eviction and housing-related cases when the moratorium on residential evictions is lifted. “When CERB ends and the moratorium is lifted, it will be a one-two punch,” he said.

“We’ve got people who are just struggling to get by,” said Abramowicz, noting that many of the calls have been from people who have never used or never qualified for legal aid services before.

“It’s a perfect storm.”

The chair of Legal Aid Ontario (LAO) is also hoping the federal and provincial governments will work together to backstop the funding shortfall that has emerged as an unintended consequence of the Bank of Canada slashing interest rates by 1.5 percentage points to 0.25 per cent in response to the pandemic.

Part of the legal aid budget comes via the Law Foundation of Ontario from interest collected on trust accounts of lawyers and paralegals, and therefore depends on both interest rates and account balances.

The foundation’s contribution could drop from more than $91 million in 2019-20 to less than $30 million in 2020-21, according to letters sent to Doug Downey, the Attorney General of Ontario, and David Lametti, the Attorney General of Canada and the Minister of Justice, at the start of June. The letters, sent by the Alliance for Sustainable Legal Aid, were co-signed by the Association of Community Legal Clinics of Ontario, Criminal Lawyers Association, Family Lawyers Association, Federation of Ontario Law Associations, Law Society of Ontario, Mental Health Legal Committee, Ontario Bar Association, Refugee Lawyers Association and The Advocates’ Society.

In an interview, LAO chair Charles Harnick said Downey is aware of the issue, which he called one of the “unintended consequences” of the interest rate cut, adding “I’m confident it will be dealt with.”

Harnick would not specify the amount of the “significant diminution” in funding but said the reliance on a fluctuating and unstable income source like the interest from trust accounts has long been a challenge for planning and budgeting.

“We need to find a way to stabilize that funding,” he said.

Harnick noted interest rates also dropped significantly after the 2008 recession. At the time LAO was getting $54 million from the interest and the amount fell to $5 million overnight, he said.

“It took 10 years for that money to get back to where it had been, and then it grew significantly from that point,” he said. “What drives the revenues that come from the law foundation is economic activity, particularly real estate. If real estate is busy, lots of money is going through lawyers’ trust accounts.”

A spokesperson for Downey did not directly respond to whether the province would contribute to the urgent funding need.

“Ontario is one among many provinces calling on the federal government to provide additional funding to allow legal aid organizations such as LAO to continue delivering necessary legal aid services to its existing client base, and the surge in new clients that will require legal aid due to COVID-19,” spokesperson Jesse Robichaud said in a statement.

“We are working closely with our partners, including LAO, to ensure critical justice services continue while keeping essential workers and all Ontarians safe.”

Legal Aid Ontario’s budget was cut by 30 per cent — $133 million — last year as the federal and provincial governments sparred over who should fund immigration and refugee-related legal services. The federal government provided a top-up of $25.7 million after the provincial cuts both last year and this year “as we continue discussions on funding for future years,” said Rachel Rappaport, a spokesperson for Lametti, in a statement Friday. The current interest rate-related shortfall was not addressed in the statement.

Community legal clinics are still reeling from last year’s cuts and the new funding shortfall has the potential to further affect front-line services, said Omar Ha-Redeye, the executive director of Durham Community Legal Clinic.

“The need for support for clinics has never been more acute, in the aftermath of cuts from last year and that we are going to be in a recession if not a depression,” he said. Legal aid clinics help with issues including evictions, unemployment, discrimination, denial of disability claims, domestic violence and criminal charges. Ha-Redeye expects that many of the services will be sought by women and marginalized groups who have been disproportionately affected by the economic fallout of the pandemic.

“Without clinics being properly funded and having that stability, it is very unlikely that we’d be able to meet the needs of the community, meaning that what we are going to see is an increase in homelessness, in poverty, increase in mental health issues, increase in crime even,” he said. “By providing legal services to the most vulnerable members of our society … we are actually the safety net that prevents them from falling into those types of circumstances.”

Harnick agreed there will be an increase in demand for legal aid services in some areas, including landlord-tenant issues, but said LAO “will have the capacity certainly to manage that.”

“We don’t anticipate making any changes to services that are available to people, we are not going to be taking away services away. Where the demand is there, we will be providing services just as we have been,” he said. “We will be there for (our clients) … and it’s an important service. Lives depend on it.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, students across the country have taken the forum digital.

Seemingly overnight, waves of Instagram accounts have appeared with links for students to make anonymous submissions of their experiences with racism and sexual assault on campus.

Vanessa Patterson, 22, runs the account @UWOMinorityStory and graduated from London’s Western University in 2019.

The first story she posted, she said, was one of her own. In her first year of residence, she and a friend found a racist message written on a whiteboard: “KILL ALL N***ERS.” She said when they brought it to her residence advisor’s attention, she was scolded “for making her look bad in front of her boss” and floormates said what was written was so ridiculous it was funny.

The other stories on the feed have been submitted by students, past and present.

Patterson and her twin sister Elise have been sifting through stories and adding to the feed.

Patterson said these issues don’t just happen outside of school in the social scene. “There needs to be an acknowledgment that this happens in residence, in the classroom, on campus in clubs, as well as in the social scene.”

On Monday, the group Black at Western Alumni also released an open letter that members wrote at the end of June to the university’s president Alan Shepard.

It was sparked in response to the school addressing John Philippe Rushton, a professor who between 1977 until his death in 2012 published racist work that BWA said is still misused by white supremacists and eugenicists to justify racist acts. The school acknowledged the hurt caused, but the BWA said more needed to be done.

In the letter, BWA outlined 13 action items for the school to take, including hiring more faculty from the Black community and from other underrpresented communities and developing workshops for faculty on how to challenge the ways anti-Black racism operates within classrooms.

The group has since had an initial meeting with Shepard and anticipate more.

UWOMinorityStory is one of several similar Instagram accounts that have cropped up in the last week or so for students at other schools in Canada including McGill, York, Ottawa, Concordia, another two from Western (by the Black at Western Alumni and the Ivey Business School), Dalhousie, University of British Columbia and Appleby College, a boarding school in Oakville.

Nearly all of them have credited inspiration to the original Harvard Law and Cornell accounts in the U.S., as well as the account that brought the conversation to Canada at the start of July, @StolenbySmith about the Smith School of Business at Queen’s University.

Kelly Weiling Zou, who is going into her fourth year at Smith, started the account where students and alumni have been sharing harrowing stories of racism, discrimination and sexual violence.

In about 10 days, the account has amassed over 10,000 followers, shared over 200 posts and has 400 and counting to go through.

“I only have one year left and I desperately want to leave this school a better place than when I came in,” Zou said.

This isn’t the first time Queen’s has been at the centre of racist controversy. In 2016, students at Queen’s hosted a party where the theme seemed to be offensive costumes.

“I’m a disabled woman of colour. I’m queer,” Zou said. “A lot of these identities, even though they seem to be accepted on the front page of the Smith School of Business magazine, are not accepted in the actual space itself.”

Brenda Brouwer, the dean of Smith, said in a statement, “The experiences being shared on @StolenbySmith have exposed issues of inequity, exclusion and systemic racism in the school of business that cannot and will not be ignored.”

The dean goes on to say all staff and students will receive Equity, Diversity, Inclusivity and Indigeneity training going into the fall term and during the year.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Wanyee Livancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'With Files Kris Rushowy']",2020-07-13,"As Ontario school districts scramble to prepare for the start of a school year in the midst of a pandemic, staff at the Toronto Catholic District School Board have come up with a proposed plan that could see students alternating weeks in the classroom and at home.

It’s just one of several proposed options outlined in a draft document obtained by the Star. Board trustees are scheduled to discuss the proposed plan at a school board meeting on Thursday.

But at least one trustee says nothing less than a full return to school come September will work for families.

“Parents expect their children back in school in September, face to face, five days a week,” said Maria Rizzo, former TCDSB board chair and current trustee.

“Anything less than that isn’t good enough.”

TCDSB staff drew up two versions of the hybrid model for trustees to consider: a two-week rotation and a five-day rotation. Both require that classes be divided into smaller cohorts of students that will take turns being in classrooms.

The two-week rotation means students would be in classrooms for one week and then at home for the next week. The five-day rotation means students would be in classrooms for half of each week — say, Monday and Tuesday and alternate Fridays. (The Ottawa-Carleton school board is looking at a two groups attending two days each per week, with Wednesdays closed for cleaning.)

Core subjects like math, literacy, religion, social studies, and science would be taught in class, while French, music, and others would be taught online, according to the TCDSB document.

The TCDSB draft plan also allows for the possibility of a full return to school classrooms, as well as an online-only option.

Last month, Education Minister Stephen Lecce told school boards to prepare for three scenarios this September: online only, in-class only with strict hygiene or a mix of the two. Lecce said he expects the hybrid model will be in place this fall.

Each school district will decide which model to follow in August, taking into account the local COVID-19 situation, Lecce said last Friday.

The Toronto District School Board, running the city’s secular education system, has already voiced concerns about the hybrid model, and voted unanimously last week to support an emergency motion calling on the government to look at “creative and ambitious” alternatives to the hybrid model. The TDSB is expected to release a draft report of its fall plans to public health on Wednesday.

Any amount of remote learning will be challenging for school boards and families in the fall, said Rizzo.

The TCDSB, which provides education to about 90,000 students, leased thousands of tablets to ensure students without access to laptops at home could continue to do their school work after schools closed in March due to the pandemic, she said.

Those leases are a “considerable expense” for the board and the arrangement will not work in the long run, said Rizzo.

“That’s why it needs to be a sustainable plan to continue, not something that is a Band-Aid,” she said. “That’s what I’m afraid we’re doing.”

Rizzo wants to see the provincial government provide funding and support to school boards to ensure students and staff can be in classrooms full-time, something NDP Opposition Leader Andrea Horwath has also been calling for.

Liberal party Leader Steven Del Duca is now adding his criticism into the mix, calling for the creation of “hundreds of new classrooms” and to hire back recently laid-off teachers to staff them, according to a recent news release.

Many schools will need to find extra space for students to allow for physical distancing, Rizzo acknowledged. Some neighbourhoods, like those in York where Rizzo is a trustee, were already struggling to find space for students pre-pandemic.

“My area happens to be one of those that have overcrowded facilities,” she said.

“Not only do we need the space, but we need the resources and the money from the government because this is an emergency situation and it needs to be taken care of properly.”

RELATED STORIES Editorial Ontario must make full-time school this fall a priority

Charles E. Pascal, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, said returning to the classroom full-time as “a very high risk venture” and would require more time and careful planning.

Not doing so would amount to “playing Russian roulette with the health of our students and educators,” regardless of if schools adopted a full or mixed model of return, he said.

“We do not know as much about children and youth as asymptomatic virus carriers as some would suggest,” he said.

Pascal criticized the Ontario government’s “very tardy approach” to planning for the upcoming school year, something teachers unions have pointed out as well. Education experts have been considering the viability of the three different approaches to school in September for months, said Pascal.

At this point, staff in the education system might need until October, he said, to prepare properly and “allow the essentials to be put in place.”

Read', 'Donovan Vincenthousing Reporter', 'Housing Reporter', 'Donovan Vincent Is A Housing Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"Mario Castillo Tamayo was the first COVID-19 patient to end up in Humber River Hospital’s intensive care unit and he remained there on a breathing machine from late March to early June — about nine weeks.

At one point doctors in the hospital thought the 51-year-old was going to die because his oxygen levels dropped so low. “One of his doctors called and said my husband is ‘getting worse, and we don’t know if he will make it,’” said Castillo Tamayo’s wife, Maricar Pagulayan, 40.

The doctor added that if her husband did survive, he’d be on a ventilator for the rest of his life, she recalled.

But Castillo Tamayo pulled through — miraculously, doctors say — and is now alert, speaking, eating and getting around with a walker. He is COVID-free after testing negative multiple times.

He recalls waking up in early June after months of sedation.

“I opened my eyes. I saw many people around me at the hospital. I didn’t know who they were or where I was.

“For two months and a half I didn’t see my wife, my stepdaughter,” he said.

Just a few weeks after that glorious recovery, he’s feeling good and thanking God for his “second chance,” he said in an exclusive interview Thursday from his bed.

He left Humber River on Thursday to head across town to St. John’s Rehab at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, where he’ll remain for three to five weeks.

He’s weak and has lost some movement in his feet. He has numb feelings on his head. He’s gradually starting to move his fingers, having lost that ability likely a result of months of inactivity, doctors say.

The mechanic was at high risk for contracting the coronavirus given that he lives and works in northwest Toronto, a racialized portion of the city hit hard by COVID-19 due to factors such as cramped living conditions. His wife and her sister-in-law also tested positive for the virus around when he did. Fortunately, they were not seriously ill and needed only to quarantine at home.

The couple live in a four-bedroom home with a basement unit. They share living space with Pagulayan’s teenage daughter as well as Pagulayan’s brother, sister-in-law and that couple’s three children. No one else in the busy household had the virus — and no one at the hospital knows for sure how Castillo Tamayo pulled through, given that he was so critically ill for so long.

“I’m completely surprised. This guy was on full life support for a couple months where we were giving everything we could. And still he wasn’t getting enough oxygen,” said Dr. Jamie Spiegelman, an internal medicine and critical care specialist at Humber River, who treated Castillo Tamayo.

“None of us expected him to survive. He’s been one of our biggest success stories, and I’m glad for him and his family,” the physician said in an interview. In fact, Spiegelman said in a previous interview, “The fact that he recovered after a tracheostomy and all the feeding tubes … is a little bit of a miracle, I think.”

Born in Merida in Yucatan, Mexico, Castillo Tamayo works at the GFL recycling company on Arrow Road in North York. That’s where he met his wife Maricar, who is from the Philippines and works in administration at GFL. The couple married in 2019 after meeting in 2011 and they travel together from their Jane St. and Sheppard Ave. area home to work and back every day.

Castillo Tamayo says around March 18 he came down with a fever at work. His boss told him to go home.

The fever worsened, and on March 24 he went to Humber River Hospital near Keele Street and Wilson Avenue. There, he soon received the news that he was suffering from the coronavirus.

“It gave me a scare. I thought my life was finished,” he said.

On March 26, health still declining, Castillo Tamayo was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit, where he was intubated. From that date all the way through April, Castillo was very sick — on full life-support, completely sedated.

The medical team had to “paralyze” him with the muscle relaxant rocuronium to stop him fighting the ventilator and ensure he could get enough oxygen, Spiegelman explained.

“Once we’re happy they are sedated, we have to paralyze them. We take away all their muscular activity. The reason we do that is because a lot of patients, even sedated heavily, they still fight the ventilator. They still breathe above the ventilator, and we know when that happens their lungs get damaged,” Spiegelman said.

The medical team also proned him, laying him flat on his stomach to help him get more oxygen, a few times in early April. That’s a manoeuvre that has shown success in treating COVID but is tricky to execute when the patient is completely sedated.

“If you’re on a ventilator with all these IVs going in, it’s quite complicated to take a person who is sedated and paralyzed and flip them over safely,” Speigelman said.

The team would keep him on his stomach for about 16 hours, then flip him back for another eight hours. They watched his oxygen levels and assessed whether they needed to repeat the procedure.

“For him, it worked. He got better.”

Over the course of April, the medical team tried to wean him off the ventilator and sedation. On April 26, they performed a tracheostomy. That mean his breathing tube was switched to his neck from his mouth, a more comfortable position. It was close to the end of May before he was completely weaned off the ventilator.

“His lungs at that time, based on X-rays, were damaged. We weren’t even sure we would be able to get him off the ventilator because of how much lung damage he had from COVID,” Spiegelman explained.

But about this time, things started to turn around for Castillo Tamayo. His wife received an unexpected — and very welcome — phone call. It was a doctor, and not the one who had told her that her husband would not live. A different doctor with a very different message: “I know that Castillo will survive,” the doctor said.

“I was so happy. Fortunately God listened to me,” Pagulayan said. She had fretted the entire time her husband was in the unit, unable to speak with, see or touch him given the COVID lockdown at the hospital.

Castillo Tamayo left intensive care on June 7 and improved rapidly. His tracheostomy came out on June 16, his feeding tube 10 days later. He gradually began speaking and eating.

He recalls, about a week after he opened his eyes, someone, a specialist, telling him to say the letter A then the letter R.

“He said ‘say it stronger. Talk. Say your name.’ I said ‘Mario.’ He said, ‘Call your family. They missed you,’” Castillo Tamayo remembers. He called his wife via video chat, and later she passed the good news to family in Mexico — his three brothers, two sisters and two daughters from a previous relationship.

In terms of lasting complications, Spiegelman said Castillo Tamayo experienced significant lung disease due to the coronavirus, but his last chest X-ray showed the damage has mostly cleared.

“It is not clear if there is any lasting effect of this. But we know from the literature that patients with (lung disease from COVID) have respiratory mechanics that don’t go back to normal over months and may take years,” the physician said.

The doctor said it’s unclear why some COVID patients treated in the ICU die while others pull through.

“We don’t fully understand why. Genetics, co-morbidities (one or more additional conditions), fitness level. We don’t understand it completely at this point,” Spiegelman said.

Aside from the hard work of the multidisciplinary team at Humber River, including doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, dieticians, speech language pathologists, physiotherapists and a host of others, Spiegelman cites Castillo Tamayo’s “relatively healthy” condition as something that may have given him an edge when it came to surviving.

“The only thing against him was he was a little overweight. The big risk factors for critical illness with COVID that we’ve noticed are being overweight, especially with young people, hypertension and diabetes. Those risk factors are almost universal for everyone who becomes critically ill,” the doctor said.

Meanwhile, Castillo Tamayo is looking forward to the day he can go for walks again with his wife and stepdaughter, watch movies at home and barbecue.

He’s also thinking about when he can get back to work.

Told to “get the hell back to your country,” the Algerian man instead challenged the border agent in court — and won.

“What happened to me is inhumane and I ask that justice be served,” said the 41-year-old railroad mechanic, who was sent straight back home from Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport on Nov. 2, 2018.

It was meant to be his second visit to see his Canadian brother in Montreal, with a multiple-entry visa that’s issued a year beforehand and valid until 2025.

On paper, there was nothing atypical in the unnamed border agent’s official notes in refusing Khaniche’s entry into Canada.

The officer cited a long list of red flags, claiming: the subject requested to stay for 999 days, had not booked a hotel, bought his ticket only two days ago in cash, had little connection with his country, carried luggage that didn’t reflect the duration of the trip.

In fact, Khaniche had a round-trip ticket with a return date in less than a month, was going to stay with his brother, paid the ticket in cash because that was the only way of making the transaction in Algeria, and had a wife and two young children to go back to after the visit.

“Subject failed to satisfy the office that he was a bona fide traveller and would leave at the end of the authorized period,” the officer concluded, adding that Khaniche was “allowed to leave” Canada voluntarily.

However, according to a recent federal court decision dissecting the officer’s decision, Khaniche was refused admission and forced to leave on the same plane he flew in on. In fact, he refused to sign the form that indicated he voluntarily withdrew his request to enter Canada.

“The officer skirted the process of withdrawing the application in order to obscure a decision of inadmissibility to make a removal order that was in fact made unilaterally by the officer,” Justice Peter Pamel wrote in his judgment.

“The officer’s actions fall far below the standards of conduct applicable to Canadian government officials and constitute a clear breach of procedural fairness. No one deserves to be treated with such contempt at an immigration examination.”

Khaniche’s lawyer, Annabel Busbridge, said the case is unique because few foreign visitors would challenge border admission decisions in court, let alone pay the legal fees that accompany such a challenge.

Typically, border agents must submit an admissibility report against a visitor, reviewed by a delegate of the public safety minister, before referring the case to a federal tribunal, where the rejected person has the chance to make his arguments.

However, in this case, Busbridge said, the officer tried to disguise his decision by painting her client’s departure as voluntary when, in reality, he was being forcefully removed from Canada.

“This is a good reminder to all Canada Border Services Agency officers who work at ports of entry that there’s a duty of procedural fairness to respect. If you don’t respect it, federal judges are able to review a decision you make,” she noted.

“The judge drove home the point that Canada is a country where procedures are fair and if you’re going to remove somebody from the country, even though they are not a citizen or a permanent resident and have no right to enter, they do have a right to be treated fairly.”

Khaniche told the court that the border officer confiscated his cellphone and compelled him to reveal the password before examining its contents. He claimed the agent then removed his passport, airline ticket and other identification.

The court also heard that he was escorted by the agent and police to the flight and allegedly told to “get the hell back to your country.”

Lawyers for the government, however, argued that the case should be dismissed because Khaniche volunteered to leave and was no longer in Canada.

The complainant’s brother Ali Khaniche, 52, said he was both ashamed and angry at how his adopted country treated his sibling.

“I was upset by the way my brother was treated. They humiliated him and treated him like a criminal, as if he had done something wrong. We just wanted justice and an apology,” said the older Khaniche, a longtime Canadian citizen who works in Fort McMurray.

“I’m in my country and can’t even invite my family to visit? What happened was not pleasant. We understand the job of the border agents but they must do it properly and not discriminate.”

The court ordered the border agent’s decision be quashed and the red flag in Khaniche’s case file be voided. It also awarded the complainant $500 in costs.

The older Khaniche said his brother did not get the apology that he deserved but the legal fight was still worth it.

Read', 'Rosa Sabacalgary Bureau', 'Calgary Bureau', 'With Files The Canadian Press', 'Rosa Saba Is A Calgary-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"Canadian business organizations welcomed Monday’s extension of the federal wage subsidy, but say changes are needed to the program so that more employers can use it.

The federal government is extending its wage subsidies for companies hit hard by COVID-19 until December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday.

The subsidy covers 75 per cent of wages up to $847 weekly for employees of companies and non-profits that have seen a drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent.

The government has said the eligibility rules may be tweaked so that businesses aren’t discouraged from growing for fear of being cut off from the aid.

“We need to make sure the subsidy is appropriate for the challenges facing enterprises in actually rehiring and getting people back to work,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week.

The subsidy, which had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies as of July 6, is one of the federal government’s programs aimed at supporting the economy amidst the pandemic.

Daniel Lefebvre, vice-president of Restaurants Canada, said the extension is good news, but that he hopes to see changes to the program as well.

Lefebvre said he hopes that more businesses will be eligible. In a survey of Restaurants Canada members done in late June and early July, 44 per cent of respondents said they didn’t qualify for the subsidy.

The restaurant sector has been particularly hard hit, he said, and the subsidy has allowed many restaurants to open again.

Lefebvre also said many businesses are walking a tightrope: buoyed by the subsidy but operating at a limited capacity, they fear making just enough revenue that they won’t qualify for the subsidy anymore. “We have a lot of people that are right around the 30 per cent threshold,” he said.

He wants to see the subsidies scaled to allow for various levels of revenue loss and wage support, avoiding a “cliff” where restaurants go from having 75 per cent of their wages covered to none.

Last week’s fiscal and economic “snapshot” saw the program’s budget raised to $82.3 billion.

As the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) is slated to end in the fall, more Canadians will be looking to their employers to keep them afloat. As of July 5, 8.25 million people had received almost $54.8 billion through CERB.

In an emailed statement, the Retail Council of Canada welcomed the extension, calling it “critical to retailers of all sizes.” The council said it supports a “ramp” allowing for some wage support as revenues begin to climb again.

Dan Kelly, president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), said he’s “frustrated” that it’s taking so long for the government to release changes to the wage-subsidy program.

Like the Retail Council of Canada and Restaurants Canada, the CFIB is advocating for a scaled approach to eligibility so businesses aren’t placed at a disadvantage by making more than 70 per cent of last year’s revenue.

Kelly said such changes were promised back in May, when the government extended the program to August, but that those changes never came, and many businesses began July not knowing whether they would receive the subsidy.

“We need to know the details of who will qualify,” he said. “That all-or-nothing approach really doesn’t work.”

Kelly said he’s “optimistic” the changes will include a ramped approach to eligibility.

Read', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"WASHINGTON - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged Donald Trump to think twice Monday before imposing new tariffs on Canadian aluminum, saying the sector is emerging from the pandemic-induced production stance that prompted the White House to consider such measures in the first place.

Trudeau, who said in a news conference he had spoken to the U.S. president earlier in the day, told him that with the North American economy getting back up to speed, Canada’s aluminum smelters would soon be back producing value-added specialty products for the American auto sector.

The spectre of new tariffs emerged last month after Canadian producers, unable to shut down production and with their usual customers hamstrung by the impact of COVID-19, were forced to make a more generic form of aluminum and ship it to warehouses in the United States.

That alarmed certain U.S. smelter owners and operators, who have been urging the U.S. trade representative’s office to slap fresh levies on imports from Canada.

The pandemic “caused certain disruption in the aluminum sector that is starting to realign itself, given the economies are starting up again and manufacturing is getting going,” Trudeau said after his call with Trump.

“I impressed upon him that it would be a shame to see tariffs come in between our two countries at a time where we’re celebrating NAFTA and at a time where we want our businesses and our manufacturers to get going as quickly as possible.”

Canada has been on the outside looking in when it comes to the coming into force of NAFTA’s successor, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took shape in 2017 and 2018 before a backdrop of steadily worsening relations between Trump and Trudeau.

While Trump welcomed Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to a celebratory event at the White House last week, Trudeau kept his distance, citing the tariff dispute and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic among his reasons. A readout from Monday’s call said the prime minister “expressed regret” for being unable to attend.

The U.S. trade representative reportedly gave Canada a deadline of July 1 to impose export restrictions — the very day the USMCA took effect. That deadline has come and gone without a hint from either the White House or U.S. trade ambassador Robert Lighthizer about what happens next.

Trudeau said he and Trump also discussed the Canada-U.S. border, where non-essential travel has been curtailed since March in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. The 30-day bilateral agreement to limit discretionary cross-border travel without restricting trade or essential workers has been extended three times and is now set to expire July 21.

Since the last extension, however, the public health crisis in the U.S. has exploded.

More than 100,000 new COVID-19 cases were identified over the weekend, particularly in southern states that reopened early, with Florida emerging as the new epicentre. Canada has had 108,000 confirmed cases in total, compared with more than 3.3 million cases and 135,000 deaths in the U.S. to date.

Hospitals in major urban centres across the United States are again nearing capacity and health care workers face another critical shortage of personal protective equipment like masks and respirators.

Recent polls suggest Canadians remain unequivocally opposed to reopening the border any time soon — a predictable symptom of the accelerating crisis in the U.S., said Kathryn Friedman, a University at Buffalo law professor and Wilson Center global fellow.

But there could be other lingering foreign-policy irritants at play, she added.

“I wonder if the United States had treated our dear neighbour, friend and ally a little bit better over the last three-and-a-half or so years, if the reaction would be as harsh,” Friedman said. “Maybe people are just like, ‘Well, too bad, I don’t care if you want to open the border.’”

Friedman is among several Canada-U.S. experts, border community leaders, northern state lawmakers and others who want to see a plan for when the time comes to lift the restrictions.

“I think we have to have this conversation,” she said. “I think we have to engage the right people now, so that when the border restrictions are eased, whenever that’s going to be, they are done so responsibly.”

It’s less a question of when and more a question of how, Friedman said — what sort of controls, testing and screening measures and other tools will need to be in place even after the emergency has passed.

“I’m more concerned that the climate will change, and some relevant government officials won’t have given any thought to how this border opening is going to take place,” she said.

“We have to get our act together and really think more clearly about how we’re going to handle these kinds of situations in the future, and really use science-based data — an evidence-based, science-based approach — to health screenings when it comes to border restrictions and border policies.”

Trudeau demurred Monday when asked whether this time, Canada and the U.S. might negotiate a closure that lasts longer than the standard 30-day window.

“We will be discussing with our American partners what the next steps should be, and I think this is a situation that is evolving rapidly and we need to keep responding to the situation on the ground.”

Read', 'Martin Regg Cohnontario Politics Columnist', 'Ontario Politics Columnist', 'Martin Regg Cohn Is A Toronto-Based Columnist Covering Ontario Politics For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"Good on the Progressive Conservative government for finally going against the flow of Grade 9 streaming.

By undoing the damage from a previous PC government under Mike Harris, Doug Ford has done good. But not good enough.

This is a quick fix to a long-term problem. The premier is slowly learning the lesson that educators have been teaching for years.

The last Liberal government never got around to damning (or damming) streaming. But Ford’s Tories must do more than damage control if they truly want to help students navigate their way to a post-secondary education.

It cannot simply be a simplistic message about back-to-basics. With a calculator on every desktop, the answer isn’t merely mastering multiplication tables.

Setting the table for success means levelling the playing field. Streaming in Grade 9 punished and pushed people onto the sidelines — forcing them to choose between applied versus academic classes — closing off pathways to first-year college or university before students could even gain traction in their first year of high school.

This week’s announcement by Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce recognizes reality, even if only belatedly. Given the premier’s initial thoughts on systemic racism (nothing to see here), Ford had the good sense, on second thought, to see the writing on the wall — and on the placards on the streets — about systemic screening.

Like police carding, student labelling can be an insidious form of racial profiling. By pigeonholing people in their early teens — not just Black kids, who bear a disproportionate burden, but immigrant children for whom English is a second language — we are writing off their unrealized potential.

Pushing off streaming for later years is a good beginning — a necessary but not sufficient condition for graduation day. On its own, however, it won’t get us where we need to go.

Eliminating streaming cannot be a political or pedagogical panacea. Pooling everyone in the same class won’t magically solve the challenge of students falling behind, which is the reality that teachers face every day.

Whether streaming is the root cause of inequity or merely the symptom — and perpetuation — of different rates of student learning sparks endless debate. What cannot be disputed is that streaming is a shortcut — a quick and easy way to get slower students out of the way, so that they won’t slow down everyone else.

It is rough justice — or more precisely, injustice — because it unjustifiably holds kids back. But merely ending the inequities of streaming won’t be enough if we do not start supporting student learning with more intelligent instruction.

If we open all classes to all students, struggling kids will stumble unless they also get the extra support to help them thrive. If streaming too often amounts to giving up, the remedy is to double up — with more teachers and smaller classes, as opposed to fewer teachers and larger classes and more online learning (post-pandemic), which Ford and Lecce have long pretended is the path to success.

All that said, left unsaid in the current debate is that the university stream is overrated, while the college and trade streams are underappreciated in our society. Stripping away our racial biases reveals a slew of cultural and elite biases — by people of all colours and backgrounds — about the value of trades and other applied skills, whether acquired in colleges or apprenticeships.

Just ask our premier, who wrote about his own decision to drop out of college in his autobiography. Ford’s experience also reminds us, however, about the importance of choice.

He got into college — and then quit — because he could. Afford it, that is.

Ford had a job waiting for him in his father’s firm. More importantly, he had access to the cash that covered his tuition, which was considerably less in his day than today.

For all the lip service his government is paying to paving the way to post-secondary education, the premier must recognize the full cost equation. It’s not just about the inequities of individual streaming but the inequalities of personal cash flow.

The biggest barrier that students face to a college or university education, if they have the marks, is the money. It’s not just about admission but tuition.

That’s why a previous Liberal government promoted the goal of “free tuition” for eligible students, with grants declared upfront so that students (or parents) wouldn’t be deterred by the high sticker price of post-secondary education. The PC government’s early populist ploy to mandate a 10 per cent tuition reduction for all — rich or poor — won’t move the dial for students struggling to pay their way, given that the Tories quietly dialed back total student aid (outweighing the benefits of the gimmicky cut by burdening them with daunting debt loads).

The criticism of this week’s move on streaming is that it’s mostly messaging. The fact that Ford now gets the message — and is spreading the word — is half the battle.

But that’s just the half of it, for every student learns that words are not enough. Numbers also matter.

If Ford wants to overcome the obstacles faced by racialized students, he needs to go beyond symbolism. Now is the time to match the message with the money.

Read', 'Julie Watsonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Julie Watsonthe Associated Presstue.']",2020-07-14,"SAN DIEGO - The battle to save the USS Bonhomme Richard from a ravaging fire entered a third day in San Diego Bay on Tuesday with indications that the situation aboard the amphibious assault ship was improving.

The U.S. Navy said in a statement late Monday that firefighters were making significant progress with the assistance of water drops by helicopters.

The ship was emitting much less smoke than the previous two days, when acrid billows poured out and blanketed parts of the region.

The Navy, meanwhile, has taken precautions in case the warship sinks and potentially releases 1 million gallons (3.8 million litres) of oil on board into the harbour.

The U.S. Coast Guard has hired an oil clean-up crew to put a containment boom in place that could be ready if any oil is spilled. It also halted boat and air traffic within a nautical mile of the vessel.

On Monday, health officials warned people to stay indoors as acrid smoke wafted across San Diego from one of the Navy’s worst shipyard fires in recent years. At least 59 people, including 36 sailors and 23 civilians, have been treated for heat exhaustion, smoke inhalation and minor injuries. Five people who had been in a hospital under observation were released.

Some 400 sailors along with Navy helicopters and local and federal firefighters poured water on the carrier-like ship, which erupted in flames Sunday morning.

Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck said fire temperatures had reached up to 1,000 degrees (538 Celsius), causing the mast of the ship to collapse and threatening the central control island where the captain operates the vessel. He said there were about two decks between the fire and the fuel supplies.

Water being dumped on the vessel was causing the 840-foot (255-meter) ship to list to one side, but crews were pumping off the water.

Sobeck said it was too soon to give up on saving the 23-year-old amphibious assault ship, which has been undergoing maintenance since 2018.

“I feel absolutely hopeful because we have sailors giving it their all,” said Sobeck, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3.

The fire was first reported in a lower cargo area where seafaring tanks and landing craft are parked. It appears to have started where cardboard boxes, rags and other maintenance supplies were being stored, Sobeck said.

A fire suppression system had been turned off because it was being worked on as part of the ongoing maintenance. The system uses Halon, a liquefied, compressed gas that disrupts a fire and stops its spread by cutting off its oxygen.

Sobeck said there was no ordnance on board the ship and he did not believe there was anything toxic.

However, the flames were burning plastic, cabling and other materials, sending a haze over downtown San Diego. The San Diego Air Pollution Control District warned that concentrations of fine particulate matter could reach unhealthful levels in some areas and that people should avoid exercising outdoors and stay indoors if possible to limit exposure.

Retired Navy Capt. Lawrence B. Brennan, a professor of international maritime law at Fordham University in New York, said there is a risk of the hull rupturing, which could cause the ship to spill its oil.

“If this is a million gallons of oil that ends up settling on the bottom of the San Diego Harbor and can’t be removed safely, we’re talking about billions of dollars of environmental damage,” said Brennan, who has investigated and litigated hundreds of maritime cases.

The ship can be used to deploy thousands of Marines to shore and has the capacity to accommodate helicopters, certain types of short-takeoff airplanes, small boats and amphibious vehicles.

Read', 'Larry Lagethe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Larry Lagethe Associated Presstue.']",2020-07-14,"NOVI, Mich. - The first female to publicly say she was sexually abused by a team doctor at the University of Michigan says she hopes to inspire other women and men to come forward.

Cathy Kalahar, who played tennis for the Wolverines in the 1970s, joins hundreds of Michigan graduates who have already alleged that doctor Robert Anderson molested them. Anderson died in 2008.

Kalahar told The Associated Press on Monday that Anderson assaulted her during an exam when she was a freshman in 1973, when the school had its first women’s tennis team.

Kalahar said she told a psychological counsellor at the school about what happened but that the woman, whose name Kalahar does not recall, brushed it off as a “sexual fantasy“ she said the student was having about Anderson.

Kalahar is represented by Denver-based Wahlberg, Woodruff, Nimmo & Sloane, a law firm that is representing more than 115 clients who allege Anderson sexually abused them.

Last month, a judge said she would order the university to stop reaching out to alumni as part of its investigation of Anderson. U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts is overseeing lawsuits by people, who allege they were abused by Anderson. Roberts agreed with attorneys, who said it’s wrong for the university to communicate with people who could become plaintiffs in class-action litigation.

The university has sent emails or letters to more than 300,000 former students, asking them to share information that “may be helpful” in an investigation of Anderson being conducted by the WilmerHale law firm.

Anderson worked at Michigan from the mid-1960s through 2003. The university believes he assaulted athletes during routine physicals and injury exams. It has expressed a willingness to compensate victims outside court with the help of a mediator. But at the same time, the school is seeking to have lawsuits dismissed because too many years have passed.

President Mark Schlissel has said the WilmerHale report will be released publicly and without prior review by the university.

Following days of procrastination and mixed messages, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the wearing of face coverings will be mandatory in shops and supermarkets in England from July 24.

On the other side of the English Channel, amid signs of a slight virus resurgence in France, President Emmanuel Macron said he also wants to require masks inside all indoor public spaces by Aug. 1.

Britain and France previously took a more relaxed attitude to face coverings than many other European nations, recommending masks but not requiring them. Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece already require masks to be worn in enclosed spaces.

But with their economies reeling after months-long lockdowns, French and U.K. government leaders were anxious to try to persuade people to spend again — hopefully without spreading the virus. Weeks of indecision made way for new rules that came into view virtually overnight.

Britain’s Hancock told lawmakers in the House of Commons Tuesday that face covers can help workers and shoppers alike.

“In recent weeks, we have reopened retail and footfall is rising,“ he said. “We want to give people more confidence to shop safely and enhance protection for those who work in shops.”

People in England already have to wear face coverings on public transport and in hospital settings.

Anyone not wearing a face covering in the additional environments outlined by the government could be fined 100 pounds ($125,) and shops can refuse entry to anyone failing to comply. Children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt.

The new requirement only applies to England. The other nations of the U.K. — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — can determine their own public health policies, and Scotland already requires masks in shops.

Hancock stressed that wearing a face covering complements other accepted strategies aimed at keeping a lid on the pandemic, such as washing hands and abiding by social distancing rules.

“We cannot let our progress today lead to complacency tomorrow,” he said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in April spent a week in the hospital being treated for COVID-19, began wearing a bright blue mask in public last week. The change in policy followed.

In an interview with French television networks marking Bastille Day, France’s Macron said “the best prevention” against the virus is masks, social distancing and hand washing.

Recent rave parties in France and widespread backsliding on social distancing — even within Macron’s presidential palace and other government facilities — have raised concern lately, so the government has been weighing tougher mask guidance.

“We have signs that (the virus) is picking up a bit,” Macron said, noting that France’s virus reproduction rate is inching past 1 again, meaning each infected person is infecting at least one other.

British authorities are hoping the public will comply with the new requirement. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he believed that “Londoners by and large will follow the rules,” without too much need for the police.

“The problem is not the issue of enforcement, the problem is the mixed messages and the confused communications,’’ Khan said.

British Environment Secretary George Eustice also did not rule out the possibility that mandatory face coverings would become compulsory in offices and other workplaces in the future. He told the BBC that the government was taking “one step at a time and we’ve taken the view in this next step that we should make it mandatory in retail environments.”

A growing body of evidence suggests wearing face coverings brings some benefit in preventing the spread of the virus.

“Lack of strong evidence of their effectiveness should not be considered a problem but the evidence is accumulating that they have a part to play in reducing transmission and also in protecting the wearer,“ said Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham.

Yet for thousands of participants in a protest across town, the national homage wasn’t nearly enough to make up for missteps by French President Emmanuel Macron and his government before and during the coronavirus pandemic. Riot police sprayed tear gas and unruly demonstrators hurled smoke bombs as the largely peaceful demonstrators marched to Bastille plaza, where the French Revolution was born on July 14, 1789.

The contrasting scenes marked a Bastille Day like any other, overshadowed by fears of resurgent infections in a country where more than 30,000 people have already lost their lives to the coronavirus.

With tears in their eyes or smiles on their faces, medical workers stood silently as lengthy applause in their honour rang out over the Place de la Concorde in central Paris from Macron, the head of the World Health Organization and 2,000 other guests. A military choir sang the Marseillaise national anthem, and troops unfurled an enormous French tricolour flag across the plaza.

The battle against the virus was the main focus, as Macron sought to highlight France’s successes in combating its worst crisis since World War II. Mirage and Rafale fighter jets painted the sky with blue-white-and-red smoke, and were joined by helicopters that had transported COVID-19 patients in distress.

The guests included nurses, doctors, supermarket and nursing home workers, mask makers, lab technicians, undertakers and others who kept France going during its strict nationwide lockdown. Families of medical workers who died with the virus also had a place in the stands.

Medics in jeans or sandals strolled onto the plaza for the climax of the ceremony, and the lengthy military parade was truncated into a smaller affair closed to the public to prevent new virus infections.

In eastern Paris, meanwhile, medical workers’ unions marched to decry years of cost cuts that left public hospitals ill-prepared when the virus raced across France.

“We are enormously short of personnel,” said protester Sylvie Pecard, a nurse at the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris who described colleagues falling ill with the virus as COVID-19 patients filled its wards. “It’s because we haven’t recruited nurses. I came here 20 years ago and there were no empty positions. Now all the services are short of personnel, and it’s worse and worse.”

Other protesters chanted slogans against police violence, spoke out against racial injustice, or against Macron policies seen as favouring the wealthy, or against his decision to appoint a man accused of rape to oversee French police forces. Some protesters wore yellow vests, representing their movement against economic injustice — or face masks in the same neon yellow shade.

Riot police closely surrounded the crowd, and smoke from tear gas and firecrackers swirled around Bastille Plaza after sporadic tensions.

Demonstrators sang in support of medical workers, while the Bastille Opera house displayed a huge message of thanks surrounded by portraits of nurses and doctors by street artist JR.

In an interview with French television networks, Macron addressed the anger his presidency has unleashed, acknowledging “mistakes” in managing the pandemic and in pushing through business-friendly reforms.

“Our country is afraid. There is a crisis of trust,” he said.

He noted a new 8-billion-euro investment and hiring plan signed this week for French hospitals, but warned of “massive” unemployment and other economic problems still to come after months of virus lockdown. He announced no significant policy changes for the remaining 22 months of his term.

He said masks would be required in indoor public places by Aug. 1, but that schools should resume as usual in September. France has one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, and scientists are warning of a potential resurgence as people abandon social distancing practices, hold dance parties and head off on summer vacations.

At the main Bastille Day event, troops sported masks as they got in formation, took them off for the ceremony, then put them on again when it was over. Macron made a point of donning his before speaking to WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus. One government member panicked when she realized she forgot hers, but was saved by a colleague with a spare.

All around France, towns and cities scaled back holiday festivities to stem virus infections. For Tuesday’s annual fireworks display over the Eiffel Tower, City Hall is closing off the heart of Paris, including embankments of the Seine and other neighbourhoods where crowds usually gather on Bastille Day.

Read', 'Lauren Krugelthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lauren Krugelthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"CALGARY—Doctors are warning that soaring rates of a common, but often undetected, liver disease could impose an enormous burden on Canadian health care over the next decade if there isn’t more public awareness.

“There’s a reason why they call liver disease the silent killer,” said Dr. Mark Swain, a University of Calgary liver specialist who led a study published recently in the online journal CMAJ Open.

“It’s because liver disease broadly has no symptoms.”

Liver cells are like balloons that can fill with fat over time, especially when someone is obese, he said.

The paper notes an estimated one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 20 have this condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD.

Swain, who directs the university’s gastroenterology and hepatology division, said physicians have historically treated it as relatively benign because liver fat usually just sits there and doesn’t do much.

But about three to five per cent of those with the disease go on to develop a more problematic condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In those cases, Swain said, an immune response can trigger inflammation, which can lead to scarring or even cancer.

Swain and other researchers with the The Canadian NASH Network, a coalition of doctors focused on the disease, used trends in obesity rates to forecast the prevalence of fatty liver disease in the Canadian population between 2019 and 2030.

The study found cases of NAFLD are on track to rise 20 per cent in that time frame and that its more advanced form, NASH, is projected to rise by 35 per cent.

Cases of liver failure, liver cancer and the need for transplants are expected to rise by a total of 65 per cent to 579,000 by 2030.

Deaths are expected to double to 49,100 in that time.

“There has been a conditioning amongst many health-care professionals that it’s not of concern,” said Swain.

“We really need to be better at increasing awareness, both in the population and amongst health-care professionals and allied health-care workers, that this is an issue.”

A dollar figure for the cost-burden on the health-care system has not been calculated in Canada, but Swain expects it would be “astronomical.”

Dr. Diana Mager, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Alberta, said patients are often surprised to find out that they even have fatty liver disease. Symptoms, like a sore abdomen, don’t show up until it’s well advanced, she said.

“People walk around for years with NAFLD and don’t know they have it.”

The biggest culprits seem to be processed foods and sugary drinks, she said. Mager, who specializes in pediatric patients, said fatty liver disease has been showing up in children and adolescents.

A more wholesome diet and more active lifestyle can reverse the disease in its early stages, she said.

There’s some debate as to whether the same holds for when the disease is more advanced. But, at the very least, lifestyle changes can slow its progression, said Mager, who also chairs the Canadian Liver Foundation’s national education advisory committee.

Simply telling people to go on a diet and lose weight isn’t enough, she said.

“It’s one thing to tell the Canadian public, ‘Don’t eat this and don’t eat that.’

“But if there isn’t an availability of affordable healthy foods, then that’s a problem. You can’t expect a family, if they can’t afford to purchase those foods, to be able to consume those foods on a regular basis.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Dan Sewellthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Dan Sewellthe Associated Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"CINCINNATI—Millennials, you’re taking a big hit — again. And you’re not OK, either, boomers.

Sometimes at odds, America’s two largest generations now have something to agree on: The coronavirus pandemic has smacked many of them at a pivotal time in their lives.

For baby boomers, named for the post-Second World War surge of births, that means those who are retired or are nearing retirement are seeing their 401(k) accounts and IRAs looking unreliable while their health is at high risk.

Millennials, who became young adults in this century, are getting socked again just as they were beginning to recover after what a Census researcher found were the Great Recession’s hardest hits to jobs and pay.

“The long-lasting effects of the Great Recession on millennials, that was kind of scarring,” said Gray Kimbrough, a millennial and an economist at American University in Washington. “And now when the economy had finally clawed back to where we were before the Great Recession, then this hit at a particularly bad time as well for millennials in particular.”

Another factor: Millennials had been the most diverse generation, and the pandemic has hurt Black people and Latinos disproportionately both in health and financially. “The pandemic has shined a spotlight on massive inequality by race, ethnicity and gender,” said Christian Weller, a professor of public policy at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.

This year has highlighted America’s generation gaps, especially between the two largest generations. Both have been stereotyped as being self-absorbed — millennials as selfie-obsessed avocado toast addicts, boomers for their oversized “mcmansions” and self-indulgence. And both are feeling pandemic pain, though in different ways.

“When the generations divide, youth will know only youth; the aged will know only the aged,” Landon Jones wrote in “Great Expectations: America & the Baby Boom Generation,” his 1980 book that coined the term boomer. “And as always, the boom generation will know only itself.”

The boomers were mostly born to “the Greatest Generation,” Americans who survived the Great Depression as children and rallied together to win the Second World War. But while birth rates slowed down during the ensuing “Generation X,” the millennial generation expanded, fuelled in part by immigration.

Millennials became the best-educated generation and more open to social change, only to find that the boomers’ helped elect Republican Donald Trump president by outvoting them in 2016.

Hence the dismissive “OK, boomer!” And boomers aren’t amused.

The virus has killed older Americans more than others. It left many isolated at home for safety — and with a sense they are considered expendable in efforts to reopen the economy.

“We’ve become a throwaway generation,” said Norm Wernet, 74, an advocate for retiree causes in Ohio. “It infuriates us.”

It’s upsetting to see so many younger people going maskless around older people, Wernet said, even as federal disease experts say wearing masks helps protect vulnerable people. Boomers, he said, aren’t getting to enjoy the golden years they worked decades to reach.

Meanwhile, a string of newspaper and magazine stories have dubbed millennials “the unluckiest generation.”

Richard Fry, a senior researcher for the Washington-based Pew Research Center, says early studies of pandemic attitudes have shown that older people see it more as a health crisis, while young adults worry more about economic impact. But researchers are finding older Americans have been hit harder by job loss, too, in this recession.

Having lunch together on a restaurant deck in suburban Cincinnati, a father and son recently discussed differences in generational views of 2020.

“I’ve had friends that have been laid off. I’ve been partially furloughed along the way. I’m not accustomed to that,” said Chris Newsome, 36, a millennial who went to college under the G.I. Bill after serving two tours of army duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. That helped his finances through the Great Recession, but he’s “certainly feeling the sting” of this downturn.

“We haven’t seen something exactly like this before,” Newsome said. “We don’t really know what we’re walking into ... It’s complicated everybody’s personal and professional lives.”

Newsome, who works in job placement, said some businesses he worked with stopped hiring or shut down. His family and peers had to suddenly work from home, leaving many to manage daycare and schooling. Gbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress, said the pandemic has forced one parent in some two-income families to drop out of the workforce.

Chris’ father, Buck Newsome, 64, president of Cambridge Financial Group, said he felt the Great Recession was “more visceral for me and my peers.”

Many boomers were in peak earning years, “sailing along” toward retirement, when underlying problems with the economy highlighted by the housing bubble finally popped. But the current recession was self-inflicted, caused by shutdowns and quarantines for public health, he said.

He thinks the underpinnings remain to get the economy moving again, though that’s clouded by uncertainty. Newsome hears from many peers who got so “clobbered” in 2008 and 2009 that they have sold off.

“Emotion comes into play,” he said. “They say, ‘I can’t take that kind of hit again.’”

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, 64, had been raising alarms about insufficient retirement savings among older Americans before the current downturn. He and Sen. Ben Cardin have pushed legislation aimed at the one-fifth of Americans nearing retirement who have little or no savings.

“A lot of people are low in terms of retirement savings, particularly baby boomers,” Portman said, with recent pay cuts and layoffs aggravating that. Congress’ first COVID-19 relief package allowed people to withdraw money from their 401(k) ’s without the usual penalties, but that has further drained retirement savings.

Brian Bascom, 30, said fellow millennials — already dealing with a sluggish economy — weren’t positioned to weather job loss or furloughs. Many are carrying college debt; some had been wary about the stock market after seeing parents’ and grandparents’ savings hammered during the Great Recession.

“This may have shaped their ideals and perspectives about the investing marketplace,” said Bascom, a financial adviser with Morgan Stanley in Cincinnati. He said it’s important for his generation to trim unnecessary expenses — cutting Starbucks runs, frequent restaurant dinners or that extra streaming service.

Adding to uncertainty have been the widespread protests sparked by deaths of Black men and women at the hands of police. Ajilore sees “the same line of unequal treatment” running through the nation’s COVID-19 response. “These protests may actually benefit and give an impetus to create a more inclusive recovery,” Ajilore said.

“We’re a resilient country, and right now we’re pretty divided,” said Buck Newsome, boomer. “But if history is any indication, we’ll somehow pull this together.”

He added, laughing: “I hope I’ll be around to see it.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/life/2020/07/10/tiktok-stars-race-to-land-reality-shows.html,TikTok stars race to land reality shows,"['Taylor Lorenz', 'Tltaylor Lorenzthe New York Timesfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Taylor Lorenzthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Taylor Lorenzthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Late Monday night, a group of male TikTok stars who belong to the Gen Z influencer collective known as the Sway House charged up the streets of the Hollywood Hills. They were on their way to the Hype House to confront a fellow TikTok star, Chase Hudson, 18, about comments he had made earlier online.

Some of the most high-profile teenage influencers, including Hudson, had spent the previous several hours waging war on each other online in an event that became known as “TikTokalypse.”

They posted clapbacks on Twitter, stoked controversy on Instagram Live and shared cheating accusations using the Notes app. Top YouTubers like Tana Mongeau poured gasoline on the flames by reacting in real time on TikTok.

Shortly after the Sway House boys stepped out of their car and paparazzi crowded around, they were ushered into the 14,000-square-foot Hype House mansion and resolved the feud in private. At 1:20 a.m., TikTok star Jaden Hossler, 19, tweeted: “we talked. no fighting. it’s settled.”

The whole event felt ripped from reality TV. Feuds, cliques and rivalries have long captivated viewers of shows like “Jersey Shore,” “The Real World” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”

Now, many wonder if a new wave of unscripted shows about the lives of young influencers could captivate the next generation of viewers. “This is a TV series waiting to be made,” Hemanth Kumar, a film critic, tweeted about the events Monday night. “Who’s calling dibs on this one?”

The race is on

Over the past several months, every major TikTok collective has taken steps to pursue a potential reality show.

Wheelhouse, a production studio, is working with the Hype House to pitch a reality show billed as “the modern day Mickey Mouse Club.” The Clubhouse, another Gen Z influencer collective, is working with ICM to shop the idea of a show around, which they hope to produce using an in-house team.

Clubhouse is also working with “Jawline” director Liza Mandelup and Concordia Studio, a production company, on a potential project. The Kids Next Door house has met with production companies.

Charli D’Amelio, the most-followed influencer on TikTok, and her family are also exploring the possibility of a reality show and have signed a production deal with Industrial Media, producer of shows like “American Idol” and “90 Day Fiancé,” her agent said.

TalentX, the management company behind the Sway House, said it hasn’t signed a shopping agreement with a production company yet, but has been taking meetings. “We are having multiple conversations now around town,” said Warren Lentz, CEO of TalentX. “It’s clear there’s a strong appetite and there’s white space that a streaming platform or network hasn’t stepped into. We have come up with five or six different show ideas that we’ve been talking with outlets about. I do know other houses are having those conversations as well.”

The boundaries between the online influencer world and reality TV are porous. Reality stars often amass large audiences on social media and pivot to full-time influencer-dom. And casting directors are known to pluck potential characters from the internet and put them on the big screen.

Tila Tequila, for instance, was a Myspace star before landing her own show. “The Amazing Race” and “Big Brother” have cast famous YouTubers in hopes of tapping into their young and engaged audiences online.

YouTube itself has greenlit many shows by its homegrown stars through its YouTube Originals program. In James Charles’ “Instant Influencer,” which premiered earlier this year as a YouTube Original, contestants compete to become the next great beauty vlogger.

But so far, there hasn’t been a hit reality show centred solely on the lives of a bunch of influencers.

The show that has come closest is “Reality House,” a 2019 unscripted series featuring a group of YouTubers living together in a giant house. YouTubers Kian Lawley and JC Caylen started the show and tried to get it picked up by a TV network or streaming service.

“We did take the show out to market but were unsuccessful in selling it,” said Andrew Graham, a talent agent at Creative Artists Agency. Still, it was a hit online. “Reality House” ran for two seasons, with a third pending, and reached nearly 1 million views per episode.

And though the idea of a group of internet-famous young people with big personalities all living together in a Los Angeles mansion may seem like a natural fit for TV, Julie Pizzi, the president of entertainment and development at Bunim Murray, a production studio behind hit shows like “The Real World” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” said it’s much more difficult to pull off than one might imagine.

Pizzi said Bunim Murray has met with several influencer houses including Hype House, Sway House and Clubhouse. “The problems we have had is that often these houses are looked at more like a business,” she said. “They want to show the business of making these videos as opposed to the personalities and personal lives of the characters.”

“We’d have a hard time selling a show about these TikTokers doing their videos for TikTok, or getting deals with advertisers,” Pizzi said. “We’re more interested in their lifestyle and how they interact with each other, what the relationships are like between the different people in the house.”

Disparate management and representation is also an issue. In some houses, each influencer has their own separate management team and sometimes different agents. “Even just for a pitch it’s an enormous amount of legal work. You have to put every single person under contract,” Pizzi said.

Age, too, is a hurdle. While scripted shows starring teenagers and young adults like “Euphoria” and “13 Reasons Why” are huge successes, unscripted shows featuring a similar age range are less common.

“You don’t really want to put very young people in too mature situations,” Pizzi said. “It feels a little sensational. It’s very rare to even put an 18-year-old on a dating show.” Bunim Murray has had the most success with programming for Snapchat. “Endless Summer,” a docudrama series starring YouTuber Summer Mckeen, for instance, ran for several seasons on Snapchat.

“There’s very few homes for a show like this,” Graham said, referring to an influencer reality show. Though MTV did pick up a show about Mongeau for its YouTube channel, the company now seems to be “focused largely on reboots and proven Viacom/CBS talent,” Graham said.

“That’s where you’d think this show would go, but it doesn’t fit their current mandate,” he said. “You could take a swing at Netflix given that they have a number of unscripted formats that are working there — I’m thinking of ‘The Circle.’ Maybe there’s a world where you take a shot at a place like Amazon, but I don’t think there are a lot of homes for it.”

Some influencer collectives are moving forward on their own, storyboarding reality-type shows for social platforms and monetizing them through advertising deals. Henry Coxall, a founder of 404Haven, an influencer house soon to open in the Hollywood Hills, said the company has already hired an in-house production team to create a reality show on Twitch.

“We’ve discovered a big part of this online culture is feeling connected,” Coxall said. “People want to feel part of that story that’s occurring. We were like, how do we take our influencers’ lives and allow fans to get involved on a safe level that our talent feels comfortable with?”

Choose your own adventure

Many in the online creator space believe we’re only in the early stages of a significant shift in the entertainment landscape, and the first wave of Gen Z talent is just beginning to emerge.

“I think we’re going to see this whole field expand over the next year or two, and the rise of TikTok could be that catalyst,” said Avi Gandhi, executive vice president of digital at Wheelhouse. “I think the reality is a lot of content buyers and distributors, whether it’s traditional cable, streaming services or digital platforms, are looking to bring audiences their way. And they’re looking for stories from talent who have great audiences.”

Maxwell Mitcheson, head of talent at TalentX, said that “TikTok stars are the Lauren Conrads of their generation. Everything they do, for better or worse, garners traditional media coverage, from liking a shady comment to going to dinner with another creator.”

Though each of these content houses may be pitching its own show, influencers recognize the value of playing off each other. “A lot of people peg these houses against each other, but at the end of the day we’re all here to make content for our fans,” said Alex Warren, 19, a member of Hype House.

Lentz said that the way teenagers today consume drama is very different than watching a 30-minute linear TV episode.

“There’s this notion that got famous a few years ago of ‘the second screen,’” he said. “Today, there’s a third or fourth screen based on viewers on phones switching between different apps. They go back and forth between IG Live and TikTok and Twitter accounts, it’s almost like each fan is on their own choose your own adventure. They come up with their own narrative around these characters in each story.”

In that sense, he said, “Sway House is a TV show in and of itself. Hype House is a TV show in itself. In many ways, fans are already watching the TV show, just not on TV.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s your turn to make a statement.

It’s your time to make a difference.

Drop the nickname from your Major League Baseball team, and do it before another fan ever sits in your ballpark again.

Come on, you can be better than Washington owner Dan Snyder, who finally agreed Monday to change the nickname of his NFL team.

Snyder, of course, refused to even contemplate a name change until FedEx threatened to take the name off the team’s Landover, Md., stadium. Corporate sponsors like Pepsi and Nike and Bank of America also joined the cause.

How about making change for what is right instead of being pressured by money?

Do we really have to wait until Progressive Corp., the auto insurance giant, threatens to remove its stadium naming rights sponsorship, worth about $3.6 million (U.S.) a year, for Cleveland owner Paul Dolan and his family to react?

It took Major League Baseball’s clout to force Dolan to rid itself of the racist Chief Wahoo caricature from their uniforms two years ago before hosting an all-star game.

“This is the hardest decision we’ve had to make during our entire ownership,” Dolan told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer at the time.

Dolan also loudly proclaimed that the franchise’s nickname would stay. He was adamant about it.

Now, he finally is softening is stance, with the team sending out a statement earlier this month to reflect a change may be coming.

“We are committed to making a positive impact in our community and embrace our responsibility to advance social justice and equality,” the statement read. “Our organization fully recognizes our team name is among the most visible ways in which we connect with the community. We have had ongoing discussions organizationally on these issues. The recent unrest in our community and our country has only underscored the need for us to keep improving as an organization on issues of social justice.

“With that in mind, we are committed to engaging our community and appropriate stakeholders to determine the best path forward with regard to our team name. While the focus of the baseball world shifts to the excitement of an unprecedented 2020 season, we recognize our unique place in the community and are committed to listening, learning and acting in the manner that can best unite and inspire our city and all those who support our team.”

It’s absurd that it has taken this long.

Didn’t Stanford change its nickname from the Indians to the Cardinal nearly 50 years ago? Dartmouth changed to Big Green in 1974. St. John’s dropped the Redman for the Red Storm and Marquette dropped Warriors for Golden Eagles in 1994.

And here we are, in 2020, still arguing whether these professional team nicknames are offensive?

Why in the world would you offend somebody when you don’t have to offend them?

“I think it’s time to move forward,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona, 61, said on a conference call this month. “It’s a very difficult subject. It’s also delicate … Even at my age, you don’t want to be too old to learn or to realize that maybe I’ve been ignorant of some things, and to be ashamed of it, and to try to be better.”

Call them the Cleveland Rocks. The Cleveland Spiders. No matter what they decide, it’s time for change.

It’s also time for the Atlanta Braves to take a good, hard look at themselves. Their “tomahawk chop” chants are dehumanizing, and certainly part of the institutionalized racism in this country.

It took rookie pitcher Ryan Helsley of the St. Louis Cardinals, a member of the Cherokee Nation, to voice his complaint last year to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for Atlanta to temporarily stop the nonsense.

“I think it’s a misrepresentation of the Cherokee people or Native Americans in general,” Helsley said. “Just depicts them in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren’t intellectual …

“I feel like there are a lot of other things they could use as mascots. Using our heritage as a mascot, it isn’t the best thing. There have been schools who in the past 20, 30 years have changed their mascots. I don’t see why professional teams are so far behind on that.”

Atlanta listened at the time and cancelled the distribution of 40,000 foam tomahawks to fans before Game 5 of their NL Division Series. They also ordered the stadium to stop playing the “tomahawk chop” chant when Helsley was pitching.

Yet, they want us to believe that there’s nothing at all racist or offensive about their nickname or the “tomahawk chop” chant. The name is going to stay. The tomahawk will again be on their uniforms this year. But they will discuss the use of the chant during games, according to a letter sent to their season-ticket holders, after discussions with tribal leaders and several Native American groups.

“Changing the name of the Braves is not under consideration or deemed necessary,” the letter said in part. “We have great respect and reverence for our name and the Native American communities that have held meaningful relationships with us do as well. We will always be the Atlanta Braves.

“As it relates to the fan experience, including the chop, it is one of the many issues that we are working through with the advisory group. The chop was popularized by our fans when Deion Sanders joined our team in 1991 and it continues to inspire our players on the field. With that in mind, we are continuing to listen to the Native American community, as well as our fans, players and alumni to ensure we are making an informed decision on this part of our fan experience.”

So the nickname will stay in Atlanta. Likely, so will the tomahawks and chants. Just like Snyder until Monday, the folks in Atlanta aren’t budging, either.

That is, of course, until they get corporate pressure from Truist, the bank that has the naming rights to their ballpark, along with Coca-Cola and their other major sponsorships.

Toronto’s prized off-season acquisition has worked on shortened schedules for most of his career. Starting and then stopping organized workouts is nothing new for a guy who has been on the injured list nine times with a variety of shoulder, hip, groin, elbow and foot injuries. Unexpected delays and setbacks, at times, were the norm.

Ryu has been on the IL at least once in each of the last six years. Roadblocks like that are usually the last thing a ballplayer wants to deal with, but in a strange way they might have helped prepare him for an unusual 60-game season. The 33-year-old knows what it’s like to come in midway through the year and find ways to get the best results out of his arm.

“I think, in general, anybody who has been through a season like that, it’s going to help,” Jays pitching coach Pete Walker said Monday afternoon. “Anything they can look back on, any type of disrupted season ... But I think all these guys have done a great job, keeping themselves motivated, understanding we would be here at some point playing games.”

Ryu has experienced trouble staying on the mound over the years, but when he’s physically able to take the ball positive results typically follow. During his first four years in the league, he posted an impressive 3.41 ERA for the perennially contending Dodgers. He was even better each of the last two years with a 1.97 ERA in 2018 and a National League-leading 2.32 in 2019.

The downside to the numbers is that he averaged just 1231/3 innings over his first six seasons. His rate of 21 starts per year was at least 10 below that of a full season from a big-league starter. This year, however, Ryu will be asked to make approximately 12 outings. A revised expectation of innings for 2020 is somewhere around 70 to 80.

Even during Ryu’s 2019 all-star campaign he experienced workload issues. The client of Scott Boras was the favourite to win the NL Cy Young Award until he began to tire down the stretch. Through Ryu’s first 22 starts of the season, he posted a 1.45 ERA with a .572 opponents’ OPS. Over his last seven outings, he went 2-3 with a 5.40 ERA and .785 OPS. With a limited workload, fatigue shouldn’t be a factor this summer.

There are a few differences between normal rehab and trying to stay sharp in the middle of a pandemic. Ryu has been healthy for the last several months, unlike the times he was on rehab, but staying motivated while separated from the rest of his team and figuring out ways to return to form quickly are things he has plenty of experience with.

“As soon as I found out we were going to postpone the season, there was a period of time where I actually rested for a while,” said Ryu, who is coming off a season which he went 14-5 while striking out 163 batters over 1822/3 innings. “But as soon as I found out we were going to have a season again, I was able to ramp it back up. I’ve been working out five days a week and it has been helpful to maintain my condition.”

Ryu began that process on Monday by making his first appearance at the Blue Jays’ Summer Camp. He started an intrasquad game against an A-list group of teammates, including Cavan Biggio, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Randal Grichuk. Ryu allowed one run on three hits in the first, but kept the opposing squad scoreless while allowing just one hit over the next four frames for a solid outing.

In general, Toronto’s rotation appears to be in good shape as the season approaches. Ryu and Matt Shoemaker have been stretched out to five innings, while Trent Thornton looked sharp throwing live batting practice on Sunday. The news wasn’t as good for veteran Tanner Roark, who did not complete two of his three scheduled innings on Monday while surrendering three homers, but elevated pitch counts mean more than results at this point in camp.

The only major issue in Toronto’s rotation can be found with righty Chase Anderson, who is expected to miss the next two weeks because of a strained oblique. Anderson won’t be available for the start of the season, which means Ryan Borucki, Shun Yamaguchi and top prospect Nate Pearson will compete for the final starting job.

The starting rotation likely still won’t be a strength for this team, but it shouldn’t be as big a weakness as it was a year ago. In 2019, the Jays ranked ninth in the American League with a 5.25 ERA while also ranking 13th of 15 teams with 7111/3 innings. Both of those numbers should improve in 2020.

The Jays no longer have Marcus Stroman or Aaron Sanchez at their disposal, but they also got rid of a long list of retreads who were placeholders until the prospects were ready and additional recruits were added to the organization. They used 18 different starters last year, six of them relievers who opened the game with short appearances.

“We tried to keep them all on a five-day routine,” Walker said of his projected starters. “They kept their normal routines and I think it benefitted all of them. That was something that was really our focus during this down time, was making sure our starters got consistent work. Not taxing them or pushing them too hard, but keeping them on their routines so when the time came, they were ready to get back into their normal routine.”

By Sophie Mackintosh

Hamish Hamilton, 283 pages, $24.95

There’s no mistaking the turn science fiction and fantasy have taken in recent years toward being more overtly political in dealing with social justice issues. With that in mind, Sophie Mackintosh follows up her debut “The Water Cure” (which was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2018) with a new take on patriarchal dystopia.

When a girl in this new state begins menstruating, she is selected by random lottery to either become a wife and mother (receiving a white ticket) or be fitted with an IUD so she can enter into a career (the blue ticket of the title). Calla gets a blue ticket but finds the resulting freedom (“My time belonged to me, my life was only mine.”) to be an ambiguous blessing. After getting pregnant she has to make a run for the border, as it’s open season on wayward women like her.

The feminist message is presented in stark terms. Men are nameless, senseless brutes while, among women, there is at least the possibility of fellow-feeling. Calla’s pregnancy both turns her inward and makes her more in tune with nature: transforming her into “a warm-blooded female animal” who speaks to rocks and dirt. What is more interesting, however, is Calla’s evolving understanding of the operation of individual free will in conflict with society, and the relation between agency and responsibility.

Burn-In

By P. W. Singer and August Cole

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 417 pages, $39.98

A surprise comes right on the second page of “Burn-In.” It takes the form of an endnote.

The presence of endnotes signals what the authors have dubbed “useful fiction” meant to “aid broader engagement with the thorny issues related to technology and society that will soon become all too real.” Or which are real already, since all the technology is drawn from current research. Hence the endnotes.

The delivery vehicle for this cutting-edge messaging is an action thriller that follows the typical buddy-cop formula. FBI agent Lara Keegan is uncomfortably paired up with a new police robot named TAMS (Tactical Autonomous Mobility System) that represents the latest “meld of evolution and engineering.” Together, this odd couple must foil a gang of technoterrorists.

All SF engages to some degree with issues relating to technology and society, so the “useful fiction” label isn’t very helpful. But it does give you some idea of how the authors target hot-button political issues of the day, and “Burn-In” will definitely appeal to those who want to stay one page ahead of the headlines.

Network Effect

By Martha Wells

Tor, 352 pages, $36.50

Over the last few years the character of Murderbot has become an SF sensation. Murderbot is a security cyborg with a difference, a killing machine who loves binge-watching television dramas in his down time while making wry observations about his human charges. His adventures have been documented thus far in a series of four novellas known as “The Murderbot Diaries.” “Network Effect” is the first novel.

Though it’s a standalone work, you’d be advised to read the Diaries first. Many of the characters are recurring, including a transport ship named ART who has as much attitude as Murderbot and plays a central role in the story.

Though there’s lots of action, what makes Murderbot so engaging is his voice. Murderbot is never as interested in what’s going on around him as he is in talking to himself, and even when blowing things up or shooting bad guys he remains withdrawn. A heavy use of parentheses has the effect of reinforcing his obsessive interiority. He likes his extended human family well enough but they’re hard to relate to. It may be that ART is the only one capable of drawing him out of his armoured shell.

In “The Oppenheimer Alternative,” award-winning SF writer Robert J. Sawyer heads in a slightly different direction. As the story begins, we’re in the world of thoroughly researched historical fiction, with the scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (“Oppie”) heading to work on the Manhattan Project, the code name for America’s effort to create an atomic bomb.

From here, however, things soon spin into alternate- or secret-history territory as it’s discovered that the solar system is about to experience a catastrophic meltdown, forcing the assembled all-stars of theoretical physics to become not the destroyers but the saviours of the world.

You can always count on Sawyer, a storyteller of the first order, for a good read. “The Oppenheimer Alternative” delivers on that count, but it’s also a book that explores, on a human level, the sort of bigger questions raised by such world-changing events, both real and imagined.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Bryan Alexanderusa Today', 'Usa Today', 'Bryan Alexanderusa Todaymon.']",2020-07-13,"Benjamin Keough, the son of actor Lisa Marie Presley and the look-alike grandson of Elvis Presley, has died at 27.

Lisa Marie Presley’s manager Roger Widynowski confirmed the death in a statement to USA Today: “She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”

Keough’s father is singer-songwriter Danny Keough and his sister is singer Riley Keough, 31.

TMZ reports that Keough died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday in Calabasas, Calif.

Lisa Marie had a special bond with Benjamin, revealing on Twitter in 2012 that on Mother’s Day three years prior the two had bonded over Celtic eternity knot tattoos placed in the same location.

In 2012, Lisa Marie featured Benjamin and his siblings in a music video remaking Elvis’ 1954 hit “I Love You Because.”

Lisa Marie revealed to CMT in October 2012 that backstage at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry, people were struck over Benjamin’s resemblance to his famous grandfather Elvis. “He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage!” she said. “Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny. Sometimes I am overwhelmed when I look at him.”

When asked if Benjamin was going to have a music career, she told The Huffington Post in 2013, “He’s doing his own thing right now. I’m going to let him decide when he wants to go out and do what he wants to do.”

Lisa Marie posted a family picture on Twitter in 2019, with social media responders commenting on his likeness to Elvis Presley. “Mama Lion with cubs,” she wrote.

Read', 'Sarah Bahrthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Sarah Bahrthe New York Timesmon.']",2020-07-10,"On the list of questions you’ve probably never considered is how to describe what spitting sounds like.

Phlegmy? Yes. Wet? Sure. Stylized ... ?

That was the challenge facing director Saheem Ali in late June, during a Zoom recording session for the Public Theater’s four-part radio play of “Richard II.”

Sanjit De Silva’s character, the Duke of Norfolk, had to spit early in the play. But Ali wanted options. “Can you do it once high and sharp, and then again exaggerated and ugly?” he asked.

De Silva obliged with a pointed ejection, followed by a wracking hack.

“That’s great,” Ali said. He’d soon add the tracks to a library of hundreds of hours of audio files that the production team spent a month editing into the approximately four-hour presentation. (The serialized episodes, accompanied by interviews, will air nightly July 13-16 at 8 p.m. EDT on WNYC. They will also be livestreamed on the station’s website and then available as a podcast.)

When the coronavirus swept through the country in March, Ali, a busy off-Broadway director, had been preparing to stage “Richard II” at the Delacorte Theater as the opening production of the Public Theater’s free Shakespeare in the Park series, starring André Holland (“Moonlight”) in the title role. Holland, like a majority of the actors, is a person of colour, preparing to tackle a rarely performed history play in which the protagonist is traditionally white.

The pandemic prompted the Public to cancel its summer festival, and it looked like Shakespeare fans were out of luck. But two months later, the theatre announced that “Richard II” would go on as a radio play with a majority of the Central Park cast intact.

Then, the week before rehearsals began, George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis.

‘Chomping at the Bit to Say Those Words’

The first day of rehearsal started with a virtual town hall. Ali, who grew up in Kenya, was grappling with how — and whether — to proceed. “It was like, ‘What does an old, dead white guy from 400 years ago have to say to me right now?’” Ali said.

He discovered that a majority of the company members were eager to move forward, and the group decided to dedicate the production to the Black Lives Matter movement. Holland said in a phone interview last week that Richard’s final-act soliloquy, in which he reflects on his own humanity, had been building inside him for years and that, as a Black man, he needed to speak it.

“I’ve been chomping at the bit to say those words for so long,” he said. “They invite the audience to see a Black man becoming more vulnerable with himself.”

Ali explored how he could use auditory cues to make Shakespeare’s at times archaic text resonate in a modern setting. “It was decisions like, what does the music sound like? Is it contemporary, or is it more classical?” he said. “And with the military, is it boots on the ground, or are there tanks and helicopters?”

He hardly had a wealth of “Richard II” productions to consult. One of Shakespeare’s seldom-staged history plays, it was last done at the Delacorte in 1987, starring Peter MacNicol. The tale of a self-centred king dethroned by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, a man with the support of the masses, is rarely produced, Ali said, because it assumes familiarity with a political and social context that modern audiences don’t have.

“But radio actually provides a way to circumvent this challenge that live theatre doesn’t,” he said. “You can simply insert narration clarifying the stakes.” (Enter Lupita Nyong’o, who recorded that narration.)

A Crash Course in Audio

The WNYC audio team delivered microphones, recorders and XLR cables to the actors, who recorded at homes across the globe, some from towel-lined bathrooms and beneath blankets. The actors had to be their own technicians, responsible for checking battery levels before recording sessions.

During one, Holland had just finished recording Richard’s speech in Act 3, Scene 2, in which the king is overjoyed to set foot on his native English soil after a harrowing journey across the Irish Sea, against the backdrop of his packed Brooklyn bookcase. (He has since been visiting his hometown, Bessemer, Ala.)

“That was really great, man!” Ali said.

Holland smiled. Then, a moment later, he grimaced.

He let out an expletive and, holding up the recorder, said, “It’s dead.”

The Soundtrack of Shakespeare

The Public’s decision to pivot to radio was a first for everyone involved. When Ali was looking for audio productions on YouTube, the most recent Shakespeare radio play he could find was a 1930s production of “Julius Caesar” starring Orson Welles.

Yet he enjoyed the challenge of telling a story solely through speech and sound effects. “These are some of the greatest theatre, film and TV actors in the country,” he said. “But this format challenges them to think more broadly when dealing with sound.”

Ali said he encouraged the actors to put their stamp on their roles by speaking their lines in whatever way felt contemporary to them — which he said was very different for 92-year-old Estelle Parsons and eight-year-old Ja’Siah Young. “My nightmare is for someone to listen to this and think it sounds old-fashioned,” he said.

At one of the final recording sessions, in late June, Ali could hardly contain his excitement. He’d initially had reservations about the radio format, but now he was surprised how much he enjoyed it. “This is sounding so good,” Ali told the dozen people on the call. “I can’t wait for you all to hear it.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/07/11/why-fast-fashion-retailer-boohoo-is-making-headlines-this-week.html,Why fast-fashion retailer Boohoo is making headlines this week,"['Elizabeth Paton', 'Epelizabeth Patonthe New York Timessat.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Elizabeth Patonthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Elizabeth Patonthe New York Timessat.']",2020-07-11,"Until recently, Boohoo was one of the fastest-growing online retailers in Britain. The company is known for its $6 (U.S., or about $8 Canadian) bikinis, skin-tight minidresses and collaborations with social media and reality TV stars like the Kardashian sisters and “Love Island” personalities.

But this week Boohoo became the newest face of worker exploitation after revelations about conditions in the factories where subcontractors make its clothes.

Started by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane in 2006, Boohoo was a pioneer of the ultra-fast-fashion retail phenomenon, geared toward young women and powered by social commerce, offering cheap fashion products designed to be browsed, bought and worn on social media.

Worth more than big names like Marks & Spencer and Asos combined, the company’s brands include Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, MissPap and BoohooMAN, among others.

Kamani, 55, is a billionaire and Britain’s new king of cheap fashion, after the downfall of Topshop’s Philip Green. A one-time garment supplier to market traders and later a fashion wholesaler, Kamani spotted opportunity in selling cheap clothes online and without a middleman, setting up shop with Kane, who started out as a designer, in Manchester.

Press shy, he is the group executive chairman of the Boohoo Group, while Kane is creative director. The company rarely responds to requests for interviews from the news media.

Kamani’s son Umar, 32, is less low-key and also a key figure at the group. Alongside his brothers Adam, 31, and Samir, 24, he founded PrettyLittleThing in 2012, targeted to young millennials, with designs frequently worn by pop bands like Little Mix.

The Boohoo Group bought a 34 per cent stake in PLT for 269.8 million pounds ($462.7 million Canadian) in May from Umar, and it is seen as the jewel in the company crown. Society magazine Tatler named Umar its eighth most eligible bachelor for 2019, and he is frequently pictured on social media hobnobbing with the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Megan Thee Stallion and Kylie Jenner. He has almost 800,000 followers on Instagram.

Adam Kamani is now in the property business. Samir Kamani is the boss of BoohooMAN.

Ultra-fast-fashion players like Boohoo and Fashion Nova have emerged from, and adapted to, fashion trends driven primarily by social media. They have few or no bricks-and-mortar stores. And they cater to the Instagram and TikTok generation that wants to buy today what their favourite celebrity or influencer wore yesterday and will post about their new purchases online.

Fulfilling these shoppers’ relentless demands for new products as quickly as possible means working with factories close to home, which is why Fashion Nova sources a significant proportion of its collections from Los Angeles, and Boohoo from Leicester, England.

More established fast-fashion retailers like Zara and H&M tend to source from developing markets and came under increasing public pressure to investigate, police and invest in the factories that make their products after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013.

But newer, ultra-fast-fashion retailers have encountered a little less scrutiny thanks to a younger customer base and keeping discussion of their business practices out of the limelight.

They introduce new trends every week and are just as likely to be influenced by the clothes from a reality TV show as the clothes from the runways of New York or Paris. Prices can be even lower than fast fashion or the high street, with $5 bikinis and $15 dresses, and come with next-day delivery. Often, they will be discarded after a single wear.

It is a slick business model that has made ultra-fast-fashion retailers a force to be reckoned with even in a pandemic. Boohoo sales grew by 45 per cent to 367.8 million pounds in the period of March through May compared with last year, according to the company. Boohoo also recently bought up a number of British high street stalwarts that were on the brink of bankruptcy, including Warehouse and Karen Millen.

In June, the company board approved a package that would pay up to 150 million pounds to the company’s founders and to Kamani’s son Samir Kamani, of BoohooMAN, if they could increase Boohoo’s value by two-thirds in three years.

On Sunday, the British newspaper The Sunday Times published an undercover investigation that said workers in a factory in Leicester that supplied Boohoo were being paid as little as 3.50 pounds an hour. (The national living wage in Britain for ages 25 and above is 8.72 pounds.) The article also said that workers were working without proper equipment to protect against the coronavirus.

The Sunday Times article came several days after a report published by Labor Behind the Label, a garment worker campaign group, that said that multiple garment factories in Leicester, including other Boohoo suppliers, “were putting workers at risk of infection,” with little or no social distancing or personal protective equipment requirements and low pay during lockdown.

Leicester was the first place in Britain to have local restrictions enforced last week to tackle a surge in coronavirus cases, which may be linked to working conditions in its factories that supply fast-fashion retailers.

The town, which has a large South Asian immigrant population, has long been a centre for clothes manufacturing. Its dark factories have been described as an “open secret,” well known in both the industry and government, and were documented in a Financial Times investigation published in 2018.

Boohoo told the Sunday Times that it was investigating the claims and that the factory in the story was not a direct supplier. It also said that it would terminate its relationship with any suppliers that were found in breach of its code of conduct.

On Wednesday, the company published a further statement on its website, saying it would begin an independent review of its British supply chain, invest $12.5 million in “eradicating malpractice” in any supplier factories and step up its use of third-party auditors.

“As a board, we are shocked and appalled by the recent allegations that have been made and we are committed to doing everything in our power to rebuild the reputation of the textile manufacturing industry in Leicester,” the Boohoo statement said.

The company said it would report on its supply chain review in September, when it publishes its half-year results, with further updates in January 2021.

Asked for comment by The New York Times, Boohoo did not supply any additional information and referred a reporter to the statement on its website.

Reaction

Between the infections spike in Leicester and the fact that the allegations involved British factories, the impact of the week’s revelations about Boohoo has been considerably larger than most fashion supply chain investigations. The increase in infections and the new information have prompted both a government response and volatility in the stock market.

Priti Patel, Britain’s home secretary, described the allegations as “truly appalling” and asked the National Crime Agency to investigate “modern slavery” in Leicester’s clothing factories.

This week Boohoo’s market value plunged by more than 1.5 billion pounds in two days. Boohoo is now worth a third less than it was last Friday afternoon, before the supply chain allegations wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off its stock market value. Some retailers, including Next, Zalando and Amazon, say they plan to pull Boohoo clothing from their sites.

There was a considerable reaction on social media, led by several influencers who had formerly been faces of Boohoo brands. The company has 12 million Instagram followers and spent more than 90 million pounds on marketing last year.

In an Instagram post, Vas J Morgan, a former collaborator, said: “Slavery is slavery and my heart hurts for the families that have suffered at the hands of companies that fail to do due diligence like this. Companies that make billions off the back of hardworking people trying to feed their family.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"“Working in an industry where you aren’t properly represented or embraced, there is always a constant fight. For me personally, I think the challenge I have felt is one that is mental,” Toronto-based fashion designer Spencer Badu says.

These are some of the lessons on how to be vulnerable, voice his emotions and find a larger purpose in his identity the 27-year-old has learned amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing global protests against anti-Black racism. “Internalizing and suppressing the trauma is part of the Black experience,” he adds.

He has to deal with both the feeling of sorrow and pain from seeing his Black brothers and sisters being killed on the streets and the feeling of pressure to be creative and constantly moving toward the future and trying to inspire change.

Another huge test in the recent months — the COVID-19 pandemic — which slowed down and shuttered businesses across the country. “I’ve been on a constant grind and the pace of fashion is ruthless. We’re a small team so the work can get really exhausting.”

Fashion had always been a part of Badu’s life. Starting with a dream in his early 20s when he began sewing clothes out of his parents’ home. It’s his parents’ hard work and constant grind that convinced him to follow his dreams.

He moved out to Calgary for fashion school for two years to get out of Toronto to focus and hone in on his work. It’s there he realized he could bring something unique that could break the status quo in fashion.

In 2015, after returning to Toronto, he started his brand, SPENCER BADU. Since, his clothing line has been picked up by buyers like Hudson’s Bay and online retailer SSENSE.

He admits that though some days recently he has felt like he was drowning in hopelessness, social distancing measures gave him the silence and time for introspection to reimagine his brand. To think greater. To channel creativity in the darkness.

“I was stuck at home for two weeks questioning the role of a fashion brand during a pandemic,” he says. “I have not been inspired creatively but I’ve been trying to challenge my energy and emotions into something productive that will lead to changes.”

After some thought, Badu started sewing and selling masks to sell online — matching each purchase with a mask donation to Humber River Hospital and Michael Garron Hospital.

What he’s found is that his masks initiative made him feel more grounded — like he was part of a united community, a collective working to fight uncertainty together. “I don’t know if the industry as a whole, or financially, will be able to bounce back, but at the moment, for me, it’s been a blessing,” he adds.

Social distancing also brought Badu a sense of heightened awareness and identity. Though he was always creating his designs to challenge the status quo of fashion, he was able to hone his focus in creating his newest fashion line — a genderless uniform inspired by Black music and culture.

“A lot of my research has been based on these ideas of Black progression and evolution of Black culture through things such as music and industrialization,” Badu says. “These are the layers of research that’s guiding the next collection.”

Badu notes that most of Canada’s fashion industry and fashion education focuses on womenswear — with a focus on daywear and evening wear. In fashion school, that’s what he was trained to create. But as he found his team and the inspiration to create freely, he moved beyond to create fashion for everyone.

“From the beginning of my career, I haven’t had to conform. My friend and stylist, Bobby Bowen, and I casted models who represented us and our community, which include people from all different ethnicities with various talents, different sexual orientations and identities,” he says. “Ultimately the common thread was people who didn’t conform. We worked with people that could help tell that story.”

Now it’s about sharing his identity and vision through his craft in hopes to see more Black businesses receive sustained support and a chance at making it. “It starts with people recognizing that it isn’t a trend. You need to understand the systemic racism toward Black businesses and understand the impact that your support has for these businesses and their families and communities which are closing wealth gaps, paying for higher education and so many other things,” he says.

As a part of his identity, Badu says that he is also looking toward expanding his brand globally, remaining impactful and part of a thoughtful collective conversation, and also to be sustainable while profitable.

“It’s exhausting and draining … but suppressing our trauma has always been part of the Black experience,” Badu says. “I’m trying to use that energy in my work.”

What does he hope for his future? What are his dreams? He recognizes he’s young, still able to be creative, and has the support of people in his city and beyond.

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder.

Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing.

But honestly, give me the runway.

I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that.

But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work.

Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch.

Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth.

Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did.

It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point?

There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle.

Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context.

When is a show not really a show?

In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here!

(That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.)

After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity.

And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams.

So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course).

Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again.

Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown.

Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial.

Up close and at home

They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood.

To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets.

In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture.

They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity.

See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.”

There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping.

It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s the fantasy architect Giacomo Garziano created with Freebooter, a duplex home in Amsterdam, with a name that conjures pirates and high-sea adventures. It provides each of the two homes with 1,291 square feet of living space, plus another 1,291 square feet of outdoor spaces including balconies, terraces and garden.

The lower duplex on the first two floors includes a kitchen, dining and living space that opens to the garden, and a floor for bedrooms. The upper duplex has a living area circling the kitchen, with a sleeping floor above that opens onto a balcony and roof-top terrace.

The structure’s energy consumption is 0, resulting from a combination of 24 solar panels on the roof, high-performance wall insulation and glass walls, coupled with low-temperature underfloor heating and a natural ventilation system. Building materials include cross-laminated timber and steel.

Freebooter, complted in 2019, took about 2-1/2 years to design and build.

Giacomo Garziano, architect and founder of GG-loop in Amsterdam, answers some questions about the unique home:

What inspired your design for this home?

The project took the Netherlands’ maritime past as its starting point since the complex is situated on Amsterdam’s Zeeburgereiland (a triangular island on the east side of the city), in the proximity of the Ij River. The project’s name refers to the historical figure of the Freebooter: private freelancers who assembled teams of sailors to explore the high seas.

Why all the curves?

Freebooter is designed as a modern “ship on land,” with many references to the wind, water and sailing. The floor plan of each apartment, referencing a ship’s layout, has a main technical core with kitchens and bathrooms. Around the core the space is organic and free-flowing, with step-inclines into spaces that are designed to envelop and unfold as the inhabitants move through it.

What were the challenges in building a home like this?

On a technical level, Freebooter resulted in a celebration of contemporary craftsmanship and BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology ... high level of detailing were necessary to build these tailor-made apartments within the fixed budget and schedule. The design and engineering process took longer than the actual building time. Most of the building was created off-site and assembled on location with maximum precision.

It’s very open — how do you ensure privacy?

We conducted a simulation of the light conditions throughout the year to create the optimal shape, orientation and positioning of the louvres. The louvres are more open where circulation and living areas are, more closed where more privacy and less light was needed: bedrooms and study areas. The louvres are slightly tilted facing south and in the direction of the waterside, allowing residents to look at the Ij River ... making them feel like they’re standing on a ship’s deck.

How were the internal stairs built?

The staircases were probably the most difficult part of the construction. They were prefabricated, based on 3-D drawings, and installed last — right before the finishing phase started. The large, heavy timber balusters were maneuvred and installed by hand because we could not use a crane inside at that point.

How will the pandemic affect your work — or the future of architecture?

I believe the current pandemic represents a further evidence of the planetary burnout. The biophilic (natural materials, vegetation and light) approach we employ is the key to re-connect to nature through the built environment, as it balances the technical aspects of environmentally-conscious construction with the qualitative, lived-in experience of an organic and natural space.

I foresee more architects and urban planners will adopt the biophilic approach in the near future.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This farmhouse, originally built in the late 1800s, has a 1,200 sq. ft. apartment with two bedrooms and a separate entrance. It’s surrounded by almost 50 acres of farmland including a horse barn and paddocks.

“We purchased this property, located in a quiet hamlet halfway between Brantford and Simcoe, in 2007, to make it the new home for our valuable horse-breeding operation, and to escape the noise and congestion of the city,” said Roger Hiscock, about his estate True Colours Farm.

“We have renovated and added many updates to our home, but we particularly love its Old World charm — such as the original pine plank floors that came from trees grown and milled on the property,” said Hiscock.

“We also added a new addition with an office, a powder room, a mud room area, and added three oversized pantries in the kitchen,” he said. Additional updates include new windows; an insulation wrap and siding; new soffits, eaves and fascia; a new roof; and new back deck.

As well, said Hiscock, the apartment is a flexible part of the residence. “When our daughter was living with us, the door simply remained open all the time and the apartment again became part of the main house.”

The home is about a 20-minute drive to Brantford’s shops, restaurants, hospital, casino, golf clubs, art gallery and museum. Waterford is a five-minute drive away with schools, plus some shopping and businesses.

“We often make trips to Lake Erie with its fabulous beaches, restaurants, swimming and boating,” said Hiscock.

The unique and sprawling farmhouse exterior features a peaked covered front entrance, a side, L-shaped veranda with a second entrance, plenty of lawn space, gardens and trees, and a long side drive leading to a double-car detached garage.

The veranda entrance opens to the main foyer with a hardwood floor and a hall with a large storage room.

On one side of the foyer is the living room with a hardwood floor, a built-in bookcase, three windows, wall sconces and double French doors. On the other side is an office that could also serve as a bedroom.

The large formal dining room features a bamboo floor, a high tray ceiling with wood panelling, a chandelier and pot lights, lots of windows and a double garden-door walkout to the deck.

Highlights of the kitchen include a hardwood floor, granite counters, ceramic tile backsplash, three pantries, windows and a breakfast area. The kitchen leads to the laundry room and the unfinished basement.

Another hall off the living room leads to a newer, two-piece bathroom, another office with a hardwood floor and a mud room with access to the back deck.

The second-floor master bedroom has a broadloomed floor, ceiling fan, a dressing room and walk-in closet with built-in organizers, plus two additional closets. It has a four-piece ensuite with heated floor, marble counters, an oversized shower stall and a separate Whirlpool tub.

The secondary bedroom has broadloom, a closet and a three-piece ensuite.

The separate two-level apartment can be accessed from the main stairway or from a separate entrance. The main level features a dining room and kitchen. The second level has a living room with an electric fireplace, two bedrooms and a three-piece bathroom.

Along with the four-stall barn, paddocks and the detached two-car garage, the property has two large outbuildings, a storage shed, a large vegetable garden and hayfields.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"I recently went to see a condo, and the concierge asked to see my real estate salesperson’s “certificate” before we were permitted to access the building. Does this have something to do with new measures in place during the pandemic?

This is a common practice at condominiums. The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) Certificate of Registration is issued to individuals registered to trade as a salesperson or broker. It has no association with COVID-19 or the current state of emergency in the province.

In Ontario, individuals trading in real estate must be registered with RECO, the provincial regulator of the real estate industry. RECO administers the laws in Ontario’s real estate sector, on behalf of the government and in the public interest. The certificate helps protect consumers by providing a means of identification for registered real estate professionals.

Salespersons and brokers are expected to carry a printed card or use the MyRECO Certificate app that allows them to show their certificate on a mobile device, when requested.

Property management often request to see a certificate before allowing a salesperson and buyers access to view a property. Many residential buildings use the certificate as a security measure to verify that visitors to the unit are who they claim to be.

The Certificate of Registration also means you can rest assured your real estate rep meets the established standards for being registered and the protections that come along with that, including education and insurance.

Every real estate professional in Ontario must complete a specific education before they can become registered to trade in real estate. They must also complete additional courses every two years to keep their knowledge up-to-date.

They are also required to uphold professional standards of conduct and ethics with an emphasis on fairness, honesty and integrity. They must follow rules and regulations under the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 2002 that protect Ontario home buyers and sellers.

Registered salespersons and brokers are also held accountable for their actions in real estate transactions. In the instance that something goes wrong, RECO offers a complaint and discipline process designed to protect consumers.

Finally, as a condition of registration, all salespersons and brokers are required to have insurance coverage that protects both consumers and industry professionals, with payments held in trust and insured against loss, insolvency or misappropriation by a brokerage. Errors and Omissions Insurance provides an added layer of protection where damages and legal costs arise from errors, omissions and negligent acts that may occur while trading in real estate.

Another way to confirm a real estate professional’s registration is by visiting www.reco.on.ca and clicking on the Real Estate Professional Search bar.

Read', 'Jim Kenzie For The Toronto Star']",2020-07-10,"“Not by bread alone.”

This biblical aphorism came to mind when my editors suggested that during these challenging times, I should concentrate on more affordable “cars for the masses.”

Ah, but who doesn’t enjoy a bit of candy now and then?

As Robert Browning said (aren’t we literary today?): “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”

Hence, the Lamborghini Huracán EVO. Starts at $305,691 for the coupé, $336,258 for the Spyder.

With a boatload of options — the “Grigio Artis” (i.e., grey) paint alone was $22,400 — my tester came to $384,991.

EVO is distinguished from other Huracáns by improved active aerodynamics and more carbon fibre, in the largely aluminum tub, and throughout the interior. This and other “lightweighting” techniques carve off 40 kilograms.

It’s very fast.

It’s very loud.

Both thanks to the mid-mounted naturally-aspirated 5.2-litre V-10, with 640 horsepower at 8,000 r.p.m., and 443 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,500 r.p.m.

Climbing in requires a bit of agility, and it may take a while to find a comfy seating position.

The seats are a nice balance of grip and comfort. My right thigh got a bit stiff after a few hours; might have something to do with being pressed to the firewall...

New for Huracán is a central touchscreen. Their website claims “traditional buttons become dematerialized,” as if that’s something to be proud of. When you are rocketing off into hyperspace, the last thing you want is to be fiddling with a touchscreen trying to turn off the radio.

Then again, the car is so loud it’s difficult to hear the radio or your phone anyway. Better to focus on your driving.

This screen also picks up fingerprints more readily than most, and you can’t set it to “daytime” brightness when the headlights are on.

Which of course they always should be.

So, let’s drive.

Hint — best spend a bit of time in this car before trying anything too dramatic. The technology makes the car so forgiving that you can get in way over your head right quickly.

Because the laws of physics always apply.

Flip the aircraft-style switch cover, press the button, and the beast roars to life.

Pull back the gear-selector release, tap a steering wheel paddle shifter for the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox — there is no shift lever as such — and off we go.

The Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (for the linguistically-challenged, that’s Integrated Vehicle Dynamics) system somehow anticipates the driver’s intentions and adjusts the front-to-rear four-wheel drive torque split, four-wheel steering, torque vectoring, and traction control systems to get you around corners faster than you’d think possible.

That said, I did get a bit of front-end plowing on a local roundabout at a fairly modest speed, probably because during my late-spring test drive, the car was still sporting winter tires, having just been shipped in from Alberta.

You can select from three drive modes — Strada (street), Sport (duh...), Corsa (race) — by a switch in the six-o’clock steering wheel spoke. This is altogether too handy; you can inadvertently hit it if you’re busy at the wheel.

These settings change all those performance parameters to suit, and there’s a more noticeable delta in these settings than usual in such systems.

The dashboard display also changes to supply information relevant to that mode.

Corsa is a bit frenetic for anything but the track. (My helmet is packed and ready to go at a moment’s notice, Lamborghini...).

What’s missing is a “custom” setting; personally, I’d choose Sport for everything, but back off the transmission downshift sensitivity a notch.

The ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, active Lamborghini aerodynamics) system opens and closes flaps at the front and rear to increase or decrease downforce as needed.

It can even open one side and close the other, to optimize the car’s handling in more-or-less real time.

One of the first controls you want/need to access in any Lamborghini is the front-end lift system. When exiting a garage or entering a gas station, pressing this switch lifts the front end by 40 mm to reduce the chances of scraping any of those expensive under-car bits.

Any Lamborghini guarantees a thrill-packed ride.

But the Huracán EVO might be my favourite from the stable of the fighting bull (Lamborghini’s traditional symbol).

While not as ultimately powerful as an Aventador, Huracán’s lighter weight makes it seem more agile, more accessible.

I’d probably opt for the Spyder. Hey — it’s a nice day as I type, and since I’m already dreaming...

Anybody speeding near a school should lose their licence, that’s how strongly I feel.

(Of course, typically Toronto, it’s all about the money. Never mind slowing down traffic so children don’t get hit by cars and killed. The city is more interested in what it can get out of wallets. But I digress.)

Parents tell their kids, as I told mine, look both ways before crossing the street. You never know. But kids are kids. Sometimes they get excited and forget (which is why we have crossing guards now).

So my daughter’s about seven, and home for lunch with me, and I kiss her as she leaves to go back to school and she runs across the lawn and right in front of a car on the road. Thank God the driver had seen her coming and was ready to stop, which he did. She burst into tears when she realized what had happened.

We tell our kids, when you are standing at a stop sign or a light, make eye contact with the driver so he sees you and then you can cross. I come driving along and I have to stop at a sign and a neighbour’s little girl is standing, kitty-corner, across the road in the subdivision where we live. She waits for me to come to a stop and she looks at me and then she steps off the curb and right into the path of a car coming along the through street.

She was so busy making eye contact with me that she forgot to look both ways. She might have been 10. There’s so much to remember when you’re just starting life. Again, the driver of the other car sensed potential disaster and had slowed down enough to stop. But it was close.

There is a school in my GTA neighbourhood. It fronts on a suburban street and backs onto a busy commuter road. There are flashing yellow lights on the busy road with a 40 km/h limit, 20 fewer than normal which most people ignore anyway. The police aren’t there with radar often and when they are, they stick out like a sore thumb. When they aren’t, it’s the Indianapolis 500. Some people slow down, but not many. We need a camera.

Childhood is a dangerous time. I’m sure we can all think of close calls we had when we were little. I can think of a couple of instances when one false move would have meant you wouldn’t be reading this. My palms can actually start to sweat when I think of one in particular.

But most of us get through it, somehow. Others aren’t so lucky.

In 1962, I was a cub reporter on my first newspaper. I’m not going to name the town, except to say it’s in Ontario. I’m doing this because this story is upsetting and there might be people around who would remember it.

A 17-year-old kid parked his car, a 1957 Chevrolet with an automatic transmission, across the street from the high school, which was at the top of a steep hill. He didn’t put on his emergency brake and he didn’t turn his wheels toward the curb, which is stuff you learn in driving school, although in those days his driving school was probably his dad.

When the driver’s side door didn’t close the first time, he hauled off and slammed it shut and that caused the stem-mounted gear lever to pop out of park and snap over to drive. The car started to roll down the hill with the kid, who was walking across the street to the high school when it started to move, running to catch it and yelling for anyone around to watch out.

A 12-year-old girl was walking along a cross street at the bottom of the hill. It is a beautiful sunny morning and it is Friday and the weekend is coming and she doesn’t have a care in the world. And she freezes when she sees this car coming and a guy running behind it, yelling.

In her panic, she then starts running and runs into the path of the car and she dies when it crushes her against the porch of a house on the corner. It is an absolutely awful scene.

One thing stood out: you’ve heard of superhuman strength? It exists. In a life-and-death emergency, with their adrenalin pumping like crazy, two 10-year-old little boys who were walking behind the girl pushed that huge car off her in an attempt to help her.

As you can imagine, the 17-year-old boy whose carelessness started all this was beside himself.

How do I know? I arrived on the scene about 10 minutes after it happened. It was the police photographer’s day off and I was a two-way newspaperman — a reporter who took photographs — so they asked me to take the pictures for the anticipated inquest: the girl under a blanket in front of the house, the gearshift in drive, and so on. In return for the favour, they told me everything.

I was very upset, as was everybody. To this day, I equate schools with children and disaster and I have no patience for drivers of cars who ignore signs telling them to slow down because there are children around.

And a monetary fine mailed to their house is not good enough. Not even close. If it was up to me, and the sign said 40 km/h and they were caught going 45 or faster, they wouldn’t get a letter. A police officer would go to their house and arrest them.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hall wrote that McKellar and “other city planning experts” say we need a “more accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists, and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic.”

Nice turn of phrase.

I would like to invite Messrs Hall, McKellar, and any “other city planning experts” to join me exactly six months from the date that story appeared — that would be Jan. 29, 2021 — on Yonge Street at York Mills Road, so I can watch them ride their bicycles north to Sheppard Avenue.

No problem.

If that’s too much, let’s move a bit further south, to the Summerhill subway station, so they can pedal up to St. Clair Avenue.

Myself and the cameraman did the entire bit walking in the bike lane on Bay Street, just south of Bloor.

The bit took about two minutes.

During which, we encountered a grand total of — wait for it — zero bicycles.

None.

Lots of pedestrians on the sidewalk.

Lots of vehicles in the street.

Not a single bicycle in the bike lane.

They weren’t just being “Toronto-polite” and giving us room to do our shoot.

They simply weren’t there.

If they aren’t going to be there on a perfect summer weekend day, when are they going to be there?

Sure, you’ll see cyclists on the Martin Goodman trail, named in honour of the Star’s former president and editor-in-chief. During its 56-kilometre run along the waterfront, it has an elevation change of approximately zero metres.

Where do those people live? And where do they work? How can they commute by bicycle?

Maybe they’re lucky, like I used to be.

Back in the day, I was a professor at Ryerson. We lived in Leaside. When I taught summer school classes, I sometimes rode my Raleigh to work, cutting through Rosedale on Glen Road, which bypassed many of the area’s hills.

But like many people with young families, we couldn’t afford a house big enough for our growing brood in Leaside. So we moved to the boonies, north of Milton.

Fortunately, I was an “early-adopter” of the “work where you live” mantra. My job means I can write in my home, and electronically send my stories to the Star.

Yep. I pretty much invented the concept of “telecommuter.”

Most of us aren’t so lucky.

Most of us live “here,” and work “there.”

So it’s either transit, commuter train, or the private automobile.

The 401 is the city’s “main street” any way you look at it. It carries hundreds of thousands of vehicles every single work day.

At times it’s the busiest highway in all of North America.

Riding a bicycle is illegal on the 401.

And riding a bicycle to work is simply not an option for the vast majority of Torontonians.

In July, never mind January.

I have heard city planners praise Copenhagen, Denmark, for its bike-friendly infrastructure.

I’ve been there.

It is beautiful.

It is compact.

It is also flat.

Toronto is not and never will be Copenhagen.

Our city planners better get used to it.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter', 'Tess Kalinowski Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Real Estate For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"The kinky and the curly are obvious. But the “yaki?”

You might not understand why Vivian Kaye’s million-dollar, Hamilton-based hair extension business carries the tongue-in-cheek name, KinkyCurlyYaki.

Certainly, she says, banks and business advisers have not.

But the women who buy Kaye’s products online — 80 per cent of them in the U.S. — they get it.

“If you’re a Black woman who’s ever worn hair extensions you know what yaki is,” said Kaye, 42.

The term originates from the yak hair that was used in the past to make hair extensions and weaves. The silky texture of “yaki” hair resembles a Black woman’s hair that had been chemically straightened — a style that used to be the standard professional look for Black women.

Kaye’s company is an offshoot of her own search for naturally textured hair — all KinkyCurlyYaki products are made from human hair sourced in India and manufactured in China.

She has been overlooked by banks, business accelerators and other agencies that failed to understand her products and her market. But that has also cost them the opportunity to participate in KinkyCurlyYaki’s success.

Now she wants to share what she has learned by coaching other women, who don’t necessarily have the vocabulary, confidence and experience to parlay their ideas into a thriving enterprise.

“Any time I talk to anyone who is in a position to give money, they always ask, ‘How did you build a $1 million business and no one’s given you money to do it or to grow it,’ ” she said.

The answer is obvious: “I’m not serving an interest that would be of interest to you. The demographic I serve looks like me.” said Kaye.

“It’s almost as if no one wanted to help me just get a piece of my own self,” she said.

Black hair care is a $6 billion industry dominated by Asian manufacturers and suppliers. But they weren’t supplying the kind of textured hair that Kaye wanted.

“I wanted to look ‘presentable’ but I wanted something that would look authentic on me. What I found was that when they did have kinkier textured hair it was buried underneath the silkier textures,” she said.

“They were always selling silky hair because that was seen as beautiful whereas nappy hair or kinky hair was seen as ugly,” she said.

During a recent video chat, with her six-year-old son Xavier in the background watching TV in their Hamilton living room, Kaye appears more suburban soccer mom than the polished entrepreneur pictured on the KinkyCurlyYaki website. Her long gold painted nails are the only visible link to the beauty business.

She spent her early adult life working in Toronto but since Xavier she’s replanted herself in the Hammer close to her immigrant family who came to Canada from Ghana when Kaye was a baby.

Her dad was a mechanic. Her mother stayed home to raise four girls. After attending French immersion at Cathedral High School in Hamilton, Kaye headed to York University to study anthropology but she dropped out following a bout of depression.

Her French helped her land a series of call centre jobs and she loved the customer service aspect of the work. Eventually she made her way to a tech start-up where she was a one-woman marketing department.

When that ended, she took a job with an office services franchise company. She ran a wedding decorator business on the side.

She remembers wanting a bigger car for her business. When she slipped out to a dealership on her lunch hour, the salesman said her vehicle was worthless on a trade.

Her manager noticed she was down and he offered to go back with her.

“We went there the next day — me and my big, white, tall male boss — and literally all they could talk about was golf. And the guy was, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ll give her this for the trade-in….’ And the next thing you know I had a truck,” she said.

Even as a wedding decorator, she recognized the shocked expressions when meeting clients she had previously only spoken with on the phone.

“Racism is alive and well, the quiet racism we have here in Canada,” says Kaye.

She left her full-time office job in 2010 when her wedding decor business was doing well and she wasn’t worried about making rent on her Mississauga apartment.

Two years later at a networking event, a Black woman pulled her aside and asked about her hairdresser. Kaye had sourced her hair, going through a manufacturer to get the precise textured products she wanted. But she wasn’t thinking about selling the look.

“That woman asking me if I would tell her who my hairdresser was paid the highest compliment. She, as a Black woman didn’t know I was wearing a weave. She thought it was my own hair,” said Kaye.

That is when the light bulb went on.

When the summer wedding season died down in December 2012, the idea resurfaced. Kaye remembers thinking, “Let’s just launch the thing. Let’s just sell some hair online.”

The business took off. In 2013, KinkyCurlyYaki had done just under $500,000 (U.S.) in sales.

“This is someone who was an immigrant, a college drop out, who had no idea how to run an e-commerce business,” she says.

In 2016, after becoming pregnant, Kaye moved back to Hamilton, bought a house and ran the business from her basement. She was so busy raising her son, it took her about three months to notice that sales had passed the $1 million mark.

KinkyCurlyYaki now operates out of a 1,000 sq. ft. warehouse space in Hamilton.

“When I look back I’m really disappointed because I didn’t have access to any other resources. I wish I was more educated about taking on debt,” she says.

She had her immigrant parents’ aversion to debt and operated on cash.

“It worked for me but I think it was detrimental to the growth of my business,” she says.

Encouragement and education were scarce.

The bank that monitored the movement of U.S. funds into her account — part of the payment system Kaye was using at the time — would call to ask where all that U.S. money was coming from but never offered to help her expand.

Two years ago, she attended a pitch competition in Montreal — an event where entrepreneurs showcase their ideas to attract funders. Kaye wasn’t pitching but she noticed who was.

“White guys … were getting money for ant farms that didn’t exist. Here I had a viable product that was actually making money and I couldn’t get money for it,” she says.

She was encouraged to apply to the Canadian Technology Accelerator in New York. When she did, she says she was told, “We love you but we don’t know how to help you. We don’t understand the demographic, we don’t understand the product that you’re doing, we don’t have any connections in that industry.”

But, she adds, “I’m pretty sure if I had an ant farm they would figure out who could help me.”

“A lot of businesses like mine fall through the cracks because we don’t have the connections or the network that a lot of other people do.”

Now with COVID-19 interrupting KinkyCurlyYaki’s supply chain, Kaye has turned her attention to business coaching and mentorship through a company called Founders Fund.

It’s an offshoot of another social enterprise called, Tease Tea. Its CEO Sheena Brady and Kaye are peer mentors who connect about every three weeks to discuss their challenges and celebrate their victories.

Started last year, Founders Fund is a national membership-based, online growth accelerator, providing mentoring, leadership and grants to women entrepreneurs, who are vulnerable of slipping through the cracks.

Among its approximately 500 members, 34 per cent identify as women of colour and 31 per cent identify as immigrants. Of the $225 annual membership fee, 50 per cent goes directly into funding grants for women’s enterprise, said Brady.

In its inaugural year, Founders Fund gave about $40,000 to five companies, she said.

“(Kaye) just got what we were doing from Day 1, where a lot of people didn’t get it. We need to have successful people who have made it on the other side,” said Brady. “She’s an incredible storyteller. She’s really good at keeping people engaged and inspired.”

Kaye is passionate about the program “because there was nothing like that available to me. Because I’m part of it, other women of colour joined,” she said.

Black women don’t go where they don’t see themselves, said Kaye.

When white women tell her they don’t understand that, she asks them to think about their own discomfort when they are in a room full of men.

“If you don’t feel welcome or appreciated in that space, how do you think we feel going into all white people spaces?

“If we are welcome the next thing we know the photographer’s there taking pictures specifically of you because they want to show how diverse the event is,” she said. “Sometimes I’m willing to be that token because then I’m getting my foot in the door.”

Kaye wants to help build the confidence of “women who don’t fit into that girl boss criteria, that skinny white woman drinking lattes with her white friend and Gucci purse.

“I’m the exact opposite of that. I’m a plus-sized, Black single mother who shops at Dollarama and understands the struggle.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-14,"TORONTO - As home prices rise, a group of Toronto realtors say governments should focus economic recovery plans on housing supply — and be careful of stoking too much demand.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board says many people are going forward with their plans to buy homes, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery.

As the economy swings up, that could lead to housing price inflation, TRREB’s report to lawmakers said.

Even though the number of home sales fell during the pandemic, prices were stable because buyers and sellers pulled back in equal measure, TRREB estimated. If listings lag, it could crunch supply, said TRREB, assuming that the spread of COVID-19 continues to be contained.

Rather than focus stimulus measures on boosting home owners, the group of 56,000 realtors suggested that improving the supply of homes will keep prices affordable for buyers.

Among TRREB’s recommendations is that the city should speed up plans to add duplexes and low-rise apartment housing to neighbourhoods with single-family homes.

A version of this plan, released by the city’s planning division this month, could potentially add mid-priced housing to up to 35 per cent of Toronto neighbourhoods.

Other TRREB recommendations included postponing property taxes and allowing more flexibility in mortgage stress tests and registered retirement savings plan transfers.

Read', 'Audrey Carletonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Audrey Carletonthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-07-14,"After losing her job in the film industry at the start of the pandemic, 29-year-old Terra McNerthy found herself on a sharply reduced budget.

At the time, the Toronto-based production assistant and her partner had just started looking to redecorate their home after their roommate moved out. But on a single income, the pair couldn’t afford new furniture or plants. So, they turned to Facebook Marketplace, the social media giant’s popular secondhand shopping platform.

“We almost immediately said ‘okay we’re rearranging everything and we’re getting plants,” McNerthy says. “We very quickly acquired many plants.”

She went on to buy a couple of chairs and other household items at a low price, as a growing number of millennials are doing in the wake of COVID-19. With thrift stores and discount retailers closed and historically large numbers of Canadians unemployed, sites like Marketplace, Kijiji and Craigslist are seeing surges in use.

But what started as a way for McNerthy to fill her newfound spare time and furnish her apartment on a budget has swiftly turned into something more. After buying a number of secondhand decorative plants on the cheap, she’s taken to propagating them and reselling the seedlings on the platform. “It’s essentially like getting infinite plants,” McNerthy says. It’s become a hobby and a way to boost her partner’s income as they ride out the pandemic at home.

Toronto researcher Annie Bok says that while she’s now more financially stable and primarily uses online marketplaces to get rid of unwanted goods, there was a time shortly after graduating from school when the secondhand trading platform Bunz was the first place she looked before buying anything new.

“I would never spend money on stuff during that time,” she recalls. “I got everything I needed from Bunz. This included toiletries, things like toothpaste and mouthwash and bath stuff … I got clothes, I got makeup, I got basically anything that I wanted and needed.”

Though Bok says it’s difficult to quantify the average discount she could land by shopping via Bunz, she recalls some of the better deals she scored: A hydrating hair mask for half its $80 retail value, a $40 face powder for the cost of one public transit fare, and a $100 dress for free from a generous stranger who no longer wanted it.

For Bok and McNerthy, buying secondhand has been a saving grace through periods of financial instability. McNerthy notes that she’s also found a more eclectic assortment of items through secondhand shopping than what she could find at retailers in her price range: “There’s a lot of more interesting, unique pieces available when you’re buying secondhand,” she says.

But both say secondhand sales shouldn’t be taken lightly in a pandemic era. They both wear masks when meeting up with buyers or sellers and do their best to social distance. Bok puts items she’s selling in plastic baggies for travel, which buyers can then discard before disinfecting what’s inside.

Bok also warns first-time secondhand shoppers to be wary: It’s easy to get roped into scams or bad deals if you’re not careful. She suggests looking up the retail value of every item you purchase to make sure what you’re buying is at an equal or lower price than what its owner paid for it. “You really have to be really vigilant about checking the value of items,” she says.

And if an item looks different in person than it does online, there’s no harm in negotiating on price or walking away from the sale. Be prepared to make an e-transfer, rather than paying with cash, to avoid any confusion over making change if you negotiate a lower price than what was initially offered (this also keeps every sale contactless).

McNerthy says those selling used items should be similarly cautious about how they post: Share appealing photographs from multiple angles with clear, concise captions and key words that increase searchability. With use of Marketplace on the rise, so is competition for buyers’ attention, so market your items accordingly.

“You don’t have to be an amazing photographer by any means, but just make sure the whole thing is in the photo, make sure it’s not blurry, make sure it’s reasonably well lit,” McNerthy says. “It’s an infinite scroll of pictures. That’s what’s going to catch people’s eye as they’re scrolling.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-14,"TORONTO - The operator of Canada’s largest airport is cutting the size of its workforce by 27 per cent, including some of its management, due to a reduction of air traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Greater Toronto Airports Authority announced Tuesday that 500 positions to be eliminated, including 300 that will involve layoffs and voluntary departures.

The rest of the positions are currently vacant.

The GTAA said passenger levels at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport have fallen to 1996 operating levels since the pandemic slowed the amount of air travel.

Some of the cuts were effective Tuesday while others will take effect through the fall.

Among the high-ranking departures are two of the GTAA’s vice-presidents, whose work will be redistributed under a revamped management structure headed by Craig Bradbrook.

Bradbrook had been the GTAA’s vice-president for aviation services and is now in the newly created position of chief operating officer.

“This reduction in force is a difficult but necessary step, and one that we take with great sadness,” GTAA president and CEO Deborah Flint said in a statement.

“We are committed to maintaining our operations and the health and safety of the airport as we evolve our organization to drive our recovery. I am confident that we have a capable and resilient team and the right approach to come through these challenging times with strength.”

Among the management departures was Kim Stangeby, vice-president and chief strategy officer, who had also been GTAA’s interim vice-president for human resources.

GTAA said it will complete a search for a new chief human resources officer.

The airport operator says it’s also working with the Unifor union and Pearson Airport’s firefighter association to implement the changes while respecting their labour contracts.

The $500-a-week Canada Emergency Response Benefit is set to run out in September for millions of workers who have seen their incomes shrink or dry up entirely.

The committee’s report recommends the government provide declining CERB payments as incomes rise, rather than applying the current strict cut-off.

Senators are also calling on the Liberals to consider a guaranteed income program to make sure all Canadians have the means to meet their basic needs.

The recommendations are among several the committee makes in its review out today of the Liberals’ emergency aid programs.

Underlying many of the recommendations is a concern from the committee about what it says is a need to address a “lack of accountability and transparency” in federal spending.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-27,"The stories emerging from long-term-care facilities across Ontario are nothing short of harrowing. Nearly half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada are linked to long-term care homes.

In a recent report on five nursing homes in Ontario, details emerged of elder abuse and neglect, unsanitary conditions and severe burnout among personal support workers (PSWs) in the throes of the pandemic.

But the challenges in the way Ontario cares for its seniors extend beyond recent months. PSWs in nursing homes feel chronically undervalued by the health-care system, receiving low pay for long hours and strenuous working conditions.

The Star asked students and recent graduates specializing in senior care and public policy what they see as solutions to Ontario’s nursing home crisis.

Lamia Aganagic, University of Toronto

We’re facing a big demographic challenge in Ontario. The number of seniors in need of care is expected to increase significantly by 2030. Provincial governments in particular are facing higher costs and spending on service provisions because we’re seeing an increasing number of seniors with one or more chronic conditions. You may find that patients are not only dealing with dementia and Alzheimer’s, but also a mobility impairment or mental illness. This all impacts the care they need to receive.

One way to alleviate the challenges is to look to virtual care; care that generally happens over the phone or through video. The Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), which functions as a virtual-care network in Ontario, does this well — but the system could be expanded significantly.

Virtual care becomes especially useful when considering things like patient transfers at long-term care homes (LTC). Senior patients being transferred from an LTC home to the emergency department are at an increased risk of death because they’re exposed to a whole bunch of other things on the way, and they may end up in a state that’s worse than when they left. These transfers are often unnecessary. With virtual care, doctors could identify patients who need a consultation, then notify their regional hospital, helping to reduce unnecessary transfers. In this way, virtual care works as a kind of preventative measure by eliminating unnecessary transfers and the risks associated with them.

Sara Clemens, University of Toronto

I’ve worked as a nurse and as a health-care aide in long-term care facilities. I’ve worked as a director of care and I’ve worked in policy and research for LTC homes. Certainly, low staffing and lack of resources is a major concern for this sector. This has been a problem for decades, but it’s become especially obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We need to look at alternative models. Some of the recommendations for adequate staffing levels at these homes come from reports that are 20 years old. They’re outdated and don’t reflect our current reality. We’ve become accustomed to having fewer registered nurses in LTC homes, while we’ve seen acuity go up, meaning that people are coming into LTC homes with more illnesses, more medications and closer to death. So, although we’re seeing that individual residents need multiple people taking care of them, the number of registered nurses in these facilities have gone down.

Our government will feel the economic repercussions of this pandemic for a while, so we shouldn’t expect them to start pouring money into better funding for senior care. Instead we need to cost our solutions. We need to consider how many beds we can actually afford and then fund those beds at 100 per cent quality of care instead of underfunding more beds.

We need to look to robots and automation, and how they can be part of the solution. Our workers are overwhelmed physically and mentally. Automation that helps do certain aspects of their jobs — giving medication, assessing pain — will help staff infinitely. This way, we can stop tying quality of care to staffing levels and consider other factors that will help.

Meghan McMahon, University of Toronto

The pandemic has put a spotlight on the immediate and long-term problems facing LTC homes. There are at least three major issues we need to address in order to get back on track: pandemic preparedness, the regulatory framework and staffing levels, and investment in data and research.

We need to address pandemic preparedness in long-term care homes. We need to learn what went wrong in Ontario, what went right in other jurisdictions, and to have plans and the capacity in place to ensure the devastation that unfolded here doesn’t happen again. This means full-time pay and benefits for workers, PPE for all staff, capacity to isolate and cluster, and ways for family members to visit loved ones while maintaining safety in the home.

We also need to look closely at the legislation and regulatory frameworks that underpin this sector. We often hear criticism that senior care is the most heavily regulated sector — but it’s also underregulated in some ways. There are very few requirements, for example, on the supply and skill mix of staff in facilities. In Ontario, LTC homes are required to have a registered nurse on duty 24/7, but the rest of the staffing supply and skill mix is left to the individual facility to decide. Our staffing levels in Ontario are considerably lower than international recommendations, and this is in the context of a population that is elderly, frail and has increasingly complex care needs.

Lastly, we need to invest in data and research. We need data to help us understand what’s happening on the ground, which interventions are working for whom and where the gaps in quality care are. While we have publicly reported data on quality of care at LTC homes, we don’t have quality of life indicators. We don’t adequately capture things like resident experience or satisfaction with care. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on resident isolation has revealed the importance of assessing and monitoring these issues. If we don’t have this data, we’re hindered in our ability to design effective systems.

Research is needed to inform the design and implementation of LTC solutions, drawing on the evidence of what’s worked and what’s failed elsewhere. We have a talented health research community in Canada and their skills can be harnessed to help fix LTC homes in the future.

Aaron St. Pierre, Laurentian University

Irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several major problems facing senior care in Ontario. One of the biggest has to do with staffing and recruitment; there aren’t enough people taking care of the elderly.

In Ontario, we have a minimum wage for PSWs that’s a few dollars higher than standard minimum wage. Plenty of PSWs make little more than those amounts. So that’s one huge barrier that dissuades people, especially young people, from pursuing a career in this area. Given the work PSWs have to do — taking care of people at their most vulnerable — they deserve to make much more.

Organizations across the sector also need to think about how they recruit. Going to universities and colleges, doing the leg work to bring in more young people, would help significantly. Nursing students and even PSW students are not always aware of the jobs that might be available to them. Going directly to these places, informing students of their job options, would help resolve some of these major staffing issues.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But trauma stays.

It follows us down roadways and sidewalks, into our schools and neighbourhoods — it changes the very infrastructure of our lives.

The legacy of social trauma left by COVID-19 will do this quite literally, experts say, shaping the way we plan and build Toronto and its surrounding regions over the coming decade.

“Overall what we have to do is get our minds around the fact that it’s not the ‘things’ that matter anymore, it’s the people,” says James McKellar, a real estate and infrastructure expert at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

“And we have to begin to understand that cities are for people and that we have done a terrible job in accommodating certain people,” McKellar says.

A more comforting, accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic, would be the best therapy for COVID-19’s trauma, McKellar and other city planning experts say.

It won’t be new-subway sexy.

Rather it means wider sidewalks, safer street signals and crossings, neighbourhoods filled in with “gentle development,” better parks and hundreds of additional kilometres of bike paths and lanes.

It will also mean the eradication or fundamental alteration of the shameful long-term-care facilities we offer our elderly — places whose human warehouse horrors and pitiful staffing strategies the virus so vividly exposed.

And all together — due to the need for closer, safer communities and the overcoming of crushing government debt that COVID-19 survival required — that means a scaling down of infrastructure projects and ideas as we move toward Toronto 2030.

“I’m not saying don’t build the transit and so forth, but let’s not assume that the big problems are going to be solved by big infrastructure,” McKellar says.

“In many ways, the problems are going to be solved by a lot of small things that just make the city more livable.”

This might mean something as simple as building more playgrounds, McKellar says.

Or, says Ryerson University’s Cherise Burda, it might mean something as radical as replacing a planned subway expansion with a far cheaper dedicated bus-route strategy; so-called bus rapid transit (BRT).

BRT provides buses with their own laneways, separate from those bearing automobile traffic.

“If we’re looking at limited resources (because of COVID-19 expenditures), there’s never been a better time to look at the business case for building transit infrastructure,” says Burda, head of Ryerson’s City Building Institute.

“And I think a really good example of that is the Scarborough subway. I know people don’t want to talk about that again, but that’s a $5-billion project,” she says.

Burda says that money would be better spent on building a vastly cheaper and longer bus rapid transit network — like the one that criss-crosses Ottawa — in Scarborough and other underserved areas of the city.

The three-stop Scarborough line could take 15 years to build; bus rapid transit routes could be moving before the decade is through, and provide faster transit along poorly served corridors like Jane St., Dufferin St., Steeles Ave. W. and Finch Ave E.

“And you could do all of that for less than the cost to build six kilometres of Scarborough subway,” Burda says.

She also says the city should more seriously pursue its existing cycling plan, updated last year, which would place every Toronto resident within one kilometre of a designated cycling path.

The University of Toronto’s Eric Miller, a planning and transportation expert, says many of the things on his list of infrastructure priorities would have been there pre-COVID-19, and that the virus has only highlighted their importance.

Like Burda, he would include far more buses, with underserved neighbourhoods in the city’s outskirts at the top of the list.

“We’ve always been so fixated on, ‘Let’s build the big subway, let’s talk about spending tens of billions of dollars,’ ” says Miller, director of U of T’s Transportation Research Institute.

“But the really big impact we could have on improving travel in this region ... is much better surface transit,” he says.

This would include in particular a far greater number of buses along existing roadways in the city’s suburban regions, running with traffic-signal priority to make them move more quickly, Miller says.

For people living some distance from bus stops, which tend to be on arterial roads in the suburbs, scheduled ride-sharing programs could take passengers the “first and last mile” of their daily commute, he says.

“The importance of transit has been highlighted by COVID-19, and we have this huge question of, ‘How do we move people if we can’t crowd them onto buses?’ ” Miller says.

He says expanded and faster bus service would allow people to more easily physically distance on the vehicles, and bring more equitable transit to areas where many of the essential workers who are bringing us through the pandemic live.

“And surface transit is something you can do ... in very short times,” Miller says.

“So over the next 10 years, we could dramatically improve how we deliver surface transit, particularly to places like Scarborough and Etobicoke, not to mention Mississauga and so forth.”

Miller’s infrastructure list for the next decade would also place decent, affordable housing near the top.

“We know we have a housing problem, certainly in the city of Toronto, more generally in the region,” he says. “And we talk about it, but we don’t do anything about it.”

The virus has only highlighted the perils of this inaction.

“In these COVID-19 days, where is the disease spreading? The disease spreads first of all where too many people have to ride buses (together), but also where too many people are overcrowded,” Miller says.

Packing large or multiple families into small apartments or houses is a key disease vector, Miller says.

And these tightly housed people are often among the essential workers who are lifting us through the current crisis.

“Hopefully we’ve come to appreciate how important, how essential these sorts of workers are — who we pay minimum wage and who we don’t orient our policies toward, whether it’s housing or transportation,” Miller says.

“COVID-19 is highlighting how important these things are and how inequitable in particular these things are.”

The inequities revealed by COVID-19 have been most stark and frightening in the region’s long-term-care homes, several of which have been decimated by illness and understaffing.

“It’s been a shambles clearly. The devastation that has occurred with COVID-19 in these homes is just heartbreaking, to say the least,” Miller says.

“Clearly that system is completely broken and needs complete reinvention,” he says.

The first order of business, Miller says, would be to shift the entire long-term-care system to the public sector, where much better oversight and wage and working conditions can be enforced.

On the infrastructure side, however, Burda says the homes must also shrink in size and be enfolded within local communities.

“Rather than warehousing seniors in big facilities in remote areas, we need to think about making them part of the neighbourhood,” she says.

“More facilities, better rooted in the neighbourhood, rather than bigger facilities far away.”

However it’s done, Miller says, better long-term care is a moral imperative.

“If nothing else changes five years from now, if we don’t have a vastly superior long-term-care system for the province, then shame on all of us, we have failed miserably,” he says.

Among other infrastructure considerations, McKellar says COVID-19 trauma has almost certainly ensured people will be more comfortable gathering outside rather than indoors for the foreseeable future.

And that means Toronto should launch European-style projects to reclaim roadways from cars — either permanently or periodically — in many parts or the city.

“What you find in Europe is that on a nice day a whole area of the road gets taken over by seating,” he says.

“We’ve already said the car gets about 50 per cent of the city and we get the rest. Well, we might not be able to give the car 50 per cent any more.”

A fluid transition from cars to patio seats on the roadways might also require getting rid of sidewalk curbs, as some European cities have done, McKellar says.

“We’ve chopped the city up and said, ‘Well, even if there are no cars on the road you can’t go on the road, it’s called jaywalking,’ ” he says.

“So we’re going to have to change our attitude toward the public environment and small things. Like, on every street, do we really want those big curbs is something we’ll have to decide.”

McKellar also sees the potential to bring amenities closer to the mental comfort of our homes through a better, more intense use of the city’s school sites.

“Another example I would use is the stupidity of school sites ... we have huge assets in the school systems,” he says, noting that many of these sites could accommodate far more city services.

“We’re still in silos, where we build a library, we build a school, we build a health centre. Why can’t we start to put those things together and make it convenient for people?”

Indeed, McKellar sees such integration as a partial solution to the long-term-care crisis — especially for facilities that offer retirement-home levels of care.

“Right now, the models that we use is old people go to old folks homes, children go to daycare centres,” he says.

“Well, my mother was at a home in Calgary where the daycare centre was in the seniors home, and it brought such life and joy to those seniors.”

Burda says neighbourhoods could also become more self-sufficient and livable by supporting locally focused infrastructure like cycling lanes and “gentle” lowrise development to fill in the city’s existing residential neighbourhoods.

She says Toronto should pursue sidewalk, bike route and development projects that would place everyday needs like groceries, medical care and schools within 15 minutes of every resident.

Small-bore infrastructure projects such as intersection and crosswalk improvements that make it easier and safer to travel on foot — as laid out in the city’s Vision Zero plan — would help in this quarter-hour goal, Burda says.

McKellar says a reluctance to build things like integrated school and library nodes or smaller-scale infrastructure was often based on a desire to maximize the economic stimulus that public works could provide.

“But let’s not use (that) excuse, let’s go back and use the infrastructure we have and make it more people friendly,” he says.

“And all the new infrastructure should exemplify new ways of thinking that put people back in the equation.”

Such smaller-scale infrastructure building would also be easier on a hugely depleted public purse, as governments climb out of the fiscal canyon that COVID-19 continues to dredge.

There is a huge reserve of private capital, especially within big pension funds and the like, that is eager to fund new for-profit infrastructure, McKellar says.

“For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is heavily investing in charging stations for electric vehicles,” he says.

“There is something that is going to have a huge environmental benefit if we can entice more and more people into it. Electric buses would be another one.”

Miller says the promotion of electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them across the city and beyond would be a major step in the fight against climate change — an even more existential threat than COVID-19.

“We have to keep our eyes on what’s coming down the pike, and what’s coming down the pike is climate change,” he says of our infrastructure planning.

“We’ll be able to get our buses, but the buses may be underwater because the roads keep flooding.”

Private institutional capital could also flow into new and better data delivery if — as some expect — governments choose to regulate such systems, McKellar says.

“I think we’re coming to the point where we’re saying, ‘Shouldn’t this be a regulated utility?’ ” he says.

“And if it is a regulated utility, a pension fund would say, ‘That’s perfect for us, we’ll build a system and the government will set the rate.’ ”

Of course any infrastructure planning for the city and beyond depends on getting the virus under control.

And though people are optimistic that a vaccine or effective therapy will be found in the near future, COVID-19 could linger for years.

“Right now, we just don’t know,” McKellar says.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 2016 and 2019, the GTA added more than 325,000 jobs and only 102,000 new homes — only two per cent of which are considered affordable.

For many, the prospect of living comfortably in the city’s downtown has become a pipe dream, especially for students who find themselves increasingly unable to afford the cost of living that accompanies life within city limits.

The Star asked four urban planning students to offer their solutions to Toronto’s housing crisis. One common theme connected their visions — housing must be seen as a human right accessible to all, and not as a commodity for developers to maximize profits.

As a kid growing up in co-operative housing in Cabbagetown, I always assumed I was living in a normal apartment building. I didn’t know what “co-operative housing” meant or how it was any different than any other type of housing. When I grew older and became more interested in urban planning, I realized that, partly, this was because of the democratic decision-making structure and investments put into the housing where I lived.

To improve housing in Toronto, governments need to provide housing affordability in perpetuity and invest more in the quality of life for residents. At the co-op where I grew up, our housing had summer day camps, field trips for Easter, Halloween parties and annual Pride parties. These kinds of housing models were developed and financed throughout the 1970s to 1990s, and show how innovative a model like this is for building mixed-income communities.

We can look to models like the one used in the city of Amsterdam for inspiration, where the city requires a high percentage of low-income and moderate-income housing to be included in every new development. Not only does this make the city more affordable, but it helps to remove the stigma often associated with affordable housing — it’s just a normal way of life that the government helps facilitate. It underscores the reality that housing is a human right.

The financialization of real estate and housing poses a big problem in Toronto. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, real estate investment trusts have increasingly pursued residential and commercial property to yield financial returns to their investors, rather than focus on providing adequate living conditions for their tenants. That’s why we’re seeing renovictions, rent hikes and other tactics designed to maximize profit, and that’s why the people who play a fundamental role in our society — essential workers, including taxi drivers, grocery store workers and other service providers — are being pushed outside the downtown core.

There’s no one strategy that will solve the affordability crisis — nothing’s a silver bullet. A multipronged approach is the only way to address this.

By adopting models like community land trusts, where non-profit organizations acquire and preserve land for community benefit, we can help bring down the high costs of housing. Land trusts remove property from the speculative market in perpetuity, so it can stay affordable. The recent collaboration between housing groups, the City of Toronto and developers in the Bloor-Dufferin neighbourhood could be an interesting model to adopt moving forward, as the developers have agreed to contribute several million dollars to an affordable-housing land trust. Partnerships like these can be used to secure permanent affordable housing as part of new development projects.

To understand what’s going on today, we need to look at Toronto’s affordability crisis with a broader lens and understand the history of urban planning and housing in Canada. Right now, we’re seeing the negative impacts of decades worth of defunding and divestment from federal and provincial governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s. If we think about Canada’s colonial history, including ongoing practices of settler colonialism, and how its planning resulted in racialized segregation, we can understand why there are two sides to Toronto — one that’s highly concentrated with low-income and racialized communities living in affordable housing complexes, and the other that’s full of well-off people living in higher-income neighbourhoods, most of whom aren’t impacted by the housing crisis we so often talk about.

This is why all three levels of government need to step in. We can’t have livable affordable housing without governments that are willing to help.

A lot of our public housing stock is in bad condition. Years of defunding and divestment have led to an endless backlog of repair and maintenance needs. If we want to create better affordable housing in Toronto, we need to make significant investments in repairing and maintaining those buildings.

We also have to build affordable housing in different areas of the city. Toronto is filled with concentrations of poverty, where low-income residents are kept in secluded parts of the city. The city can create mixed-income neighbourhoods that include lower-income housing with new development projects at greater depths of affordability. People who work in lower-paying jobs downtown shouldn’t have to commute from Etobicoke or Scarborough because they can’t afford rent downtown.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how different life can be in Toronto depending on where you live. The virus spreads through clusters of low-income neighbourhoods while higher-income residents in secluded neighbourhoods mostly avoid it.

Our governments create policies that suit those who can profit from housing. We’ve seen inclusionary zoning rolled back, and regulations around rent control removed. Now, younger people who can’t afford the downtown are forced into the suburbs, creating longer commute times and offering fewer amenities. Ultimately, housing in Toronto is seen as a commodity when, in reality, we should see it as a human right.

We can look to cities not too different from our own, like New York City, for new approaches to changing the way we think about housing. Its community land trusts, for instance, are community-owned, community-operated and take land off the speculative market. They function as non-profits: all rent goes into maintenance, repairs and similar necessities that benefit the tenants.

Though they’re largely community-run, we still need the city and all levels of government to fund initiatives like community land trusts. The government is particularly helpful for land acquisition costs and with reducing property taxes on these places. Of course, New York City has no shortage of housing problems, but the models it has adopted are ones we should adopt, too. And ideally, we should expand these projects significantly.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their family lives in Toronto’s High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had to find it quickly — they were kicked out of their previous apartment when the landlord’s daughter needed a place to stay after university.

“(We) really struggled to find an apartment that fit our budget that could accommodate Jake being six-foot-two,” Amy says. “We ended up paying way more than we wanted, but we don’t plan to stay long.”

With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater Toronto Area to start their family. But recently Amy suffered health problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy.

Read more Millennial Money here.

Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 — earned by Jake who’s a software developer. “We live a very modest lifestyle, but things are still tight living on one income,” she says.

On top of the goal of buying a home within two to five years, the couple is also hoping they can start an Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their baby. They say that they’re not big spenders and make frugal day-to-day choices to boost their savings.

“We try to home cook as much as possible,” says Amy. Breakfast and dinner are almost always made at home. For lunches, Jake takes leftovers to work, but occasionally grabs a sandwich to go or heads to a restaurant with colleagues. Sometimes, with his stressful work schedule, he’ll opt for a snack from the vending machine.

At home, Amy’s schedule is also jam-packed. With the doctor’s checkups, taking the baby to free play groups, walking the dog and grabbing groceries, the errands can pile up.

On the weekend the couple have a bit more time to indulge their interests, such as geocaching — an outdoor activity using GPS to play hide-and-seek with containers marked in specific locations — and taking part in free community events with the baby.

The two want to move out of their expensive rental spot soon and hope a financial adviser can provide some clear direction on how to start.

We asked them to share everything they bought in a typical week:

The advice: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners, says it sounds like Jake and Amy are having a tough time financially with the decrease in income due to Amy’s health problem and the added stress of a new baby to provide for, coupled with a new, more expensive rental. Here’s his advice:

> Living outside the GTA could have a big impact on their cost of living. There are surrounding suburbs and towns with considerably lower real estate prices. The potential commute into the GTA is a real consideration, though. There’s a cost to that — both literal and figurative — especially when you’re raising a family.

> Amy’s health problems highlight a real risk for them. What happens if something prevents Jake from working? They’re paying health premiums, but don’t appear to have life or disability insurance — they should get on that.

> I’d also question the health premiums. They’re paying out of their bank accounts, so this makes me think it’s not a company or group plan, but rather an individual health insurance plan. I’d take a close look at what is actually being covered currently, and what could actually be covered based on the plan maximums.

> The RESP is a great idea for their little one. That said, given cash flow is tight, and their child isn’t even a year old, I’d maybe hold off for a while. RESPs provide 20 per cent government grants on your contributions up to $2,500 per year. But you can catch up on a full previous year in a future year.

> They may not have a car payment now, but they will eventually have to budget for a replacement. Especially if they move outside the GTA.

> Despite the common advice to start saving for retirement while you’re young, I’d really be focused on getting through these lean years with a newborn and hopefully getting Amy back to work and getting into a cheaper rental.

Overall, there are pros to the way they are living, Heath says. “Good on them for cutting costs with mostly home cooking. Their minimal spending on coffees and lunches will help keep their expenses low at a time when their cash flow is tight.”

The results: They actually spent more in the second week (but it was the holidays!) Spending in week 1: $611.16. Spending in week 2: $821.45.

What she thought: Amy and Jake say that despite spending more, they did “quite well” seeing as it was the holiday season — therefore gifts galore! “This week was a bit unusual for us leading into Christmastime with buying gifts for family, drinks for a Friendsmas party and extra gas for driving to our parents’ houses.”

Take-aways: Being a cautious pair, the couple says that Heath’s advice helped affirm several things they were already hoping to do. First, they’ve decided to cancel their health insurance after crunching the numbers. Also, following the advice, they’re holding off on the RESP contributions for the baby until they have more cash flow.

Another big change? They’ve moved up their timeline to leave Toronto. “We love it here, but it really doesn’t make financial sense to live here anymore, especially now that Jake has five years of post-university work experience and can apply to a wider range of jobs in less expensive cities,” Amy adds.

After doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, they say it was reassuring to find out that they’re doing a good job of limiting their spending. “It’s nice to have an expert affirm things that we felt in our gut.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a bit of time and effort, you can be — and it will almost certainly lead to a stronger financial position. Here are five ways to become money smart:

Make a date with yourself every week to work on your finances

Financially literate people spend at least 20 minutes a week learning about money matters and staying on top of their finances. They read about wealth, meet with advisers, work on their budget and pay bills.

Whether they like the subject of money or not, immersing themselves in financial learning every week helps the financially literate stay on top of financial goals.

Carve out time every week to start learning about money. There are literally thousands of free resources online, and hundreds of documentaries to watch. Start with a search about how to save more money.

Investigate lenders before committing to one

In a recent survey conducted by Loans Canada, nearly 40 per cent of respondents — all of whom were already indebted — skipped out on comparing offers from lenders.

Unfortunately, loan stacking — having multiple loans from multiple vendors — tends to be a result of not being strategic about what you borrow for, and from which lender. And that stack of debt can be tough to handle efficiently.

Comparing loan terms, rates, frequency and amount of payments allows you to make an informed decision and gives you leverage to negotiate with competitive offers. And it’s fairly easy to do through online loan and rate comparison websites.

Work your budget

A 2019 Government of Canada financial capability survey found that Canadians who stick to a budget — about half of those surveyed — are better able to stay on top of their spending. People who budget also tend to have squirreled away enough savings for emergencies and retirement plans.

One of the biggest barriers that non-budgeters say gets in the way is a lack of time. There are, however, hundreds of digital tools to speed up the process compared to even a decade ago. And if you prefer to keep your banking separate from your budget, you could use a free Google budgeting template.

Keep a pulse on your credit score

Financially literate people keep an eagle eye on their credit score to prevent fraud and to monitor their progress toward improving it. Generally speaking, a score less than 600 is suboptimal with 900 being the highest. Paying bills on time and in full and reining in your credit cards is the best way to improve your credit score.

And there are plenty of free credit score tracking services like CreditKarma.

When it comes to your personal finances, never guess. There’s just too much at stake. If you don’t know what to do about your finances, or you are just unsure, get help.

Having low financial self-awareness is dangerous and generally leads to poor money decisions. Working with a professional, even if it’s just for the short-term, can help improve your financial self-awareness and increase your financial literacy.

Emily, a registered nurse makes $69,000 a year, while Tom, an apprentice tradesman, makes $44,000. Their monthly spending adds up to around $6,000, and the $300 to $800 left over goes straight into paying off debt.

“We’re looking to buy a house ASAP,” Emily said. What’s the rush? The couple, who currently rent a home in Scarborough, just found out they’re expecting.

“Ideally we’d settle in Whitby, but our budget for homes is under $300,000,” she said. The two also say London is a good option to look at, but before real estate becomes a reality, Emily still has to pay off $12,000 in OSAP debt and Tom has to pay off $5,000 remaining of a consolidation loan from a fitness membership that went wrong.

“Hopefully we can pay it off by the middle of next year,” Emily said, adding they are eager to start their family life.

They’ve tried to be frugal to make their dreams a reality. In a typical workday, Emily and Tom pack a lunch. Emily will treat herself to a Starbucks drink three times a month while Tom buys a coffee and breakfast once a week. “Also, we both eat out from a fast-food restaurant once or twice a month.”

On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”

Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity.

On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says.

We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead.

> It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000.

> As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes.

> I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.

> Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time.

> One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave.

> Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family.

> It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.

The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91.

What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.

Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.

In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.”

Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.

Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added.

At this point in the pandemic, nine times out of 10 the reason you haven’t got your money is because the person or business legitimately can’t afford to give it to you. But clearly documented creative alternative solutions can sometimes fix this problem. Here are a few tips to help get your money back.

Agree to a flexible payment plan

Get on the same page about the person’s or business’s timeline to have the money, then offer up a more flexible payment schedule such as three monthly instalments of $250. Chances are that a little more time will prevent you from losing money and help the borrower get back on their feet. To be clear, this solution does not require you to reduce, or eliminate, the debt, which could be very bad for your finances. It’s an extension.

Now might be the perfect opportunity to barter services

Does your debtor have a skill or service that could be of value to you? Painting, safe child-minding, meal preparation, gardening, photography, digital storefront setup, chiropractic treatments and such. Could a swap of services, rather than payment, resolve the debt? Typically this works well if the debt is on the smallish side, but I’ve seen it work when the money owed is in the thousands, too; a few months rent in exchange for a clearly scoped home improvement, for example. Note that this solution only works if you can afford to go without the cash.

Exchange something of value

Taking “collateral” up front when lending money is a common practice because it protects the lender from nonpayment. But, you can still ask for it after the fact. If both parties agree, this is a straightforward trade. For example, a motorcycle in exchange for an $8,000 debt, or a gently used MacBook in exchange for a $1,500 debt. Once the ownership is transferred to you, you can decide what to do next; sell it on Facebook Marketplace or Kijiji, keep it for your personal use or trade it.

Negotiate a reasonable time for your vendors to honour your deposit or credit

Deposits for events are tricky because they are typically non-refundable. But if the coronavirus has delayed your wedding, retirement party or other large event, most businesses will allow you to rebook for a future date, thus using your deposit. The same goes for credits — flight credits, pre-booked services like monthly waxing or gym memberships — all of these should be honoured at a future date.

The challenge here is whether the vendor with whom you have the deposit or credit has the staying power to make it through the pandemic and still honour their commitment to you. My advice is to keep in contact with them, and if it’s looking like they might be headed for bankruptcy see what you can do to negotiate getting your money back … before they close their doors.

Sometimes less is better than none

I’m not a huge proponent of reducing the value of the debt, but sometimes you have to, to get at least some money back. Let this be a last resort option. Don’t offer it up until all else has failed.

When you’re dealing with debt, vagueness is a recipe for small claims court. So if you want to keep the relationship healthy with your tenant, customer, small business or friend who owes you, you’ll need to remove all emotion and negotiate clear win-win solutions.

In the rare instance, nonpayment is malicious. A good example would be the improper withholding of child support. Or theft. In these cases, do not delay in seeking legal counsel or bring it to the attention of authorities.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tim Nashcorporate Knights', 'Corporate Knights', 'Tim Nash Blogs As The Sustainable Economist', 'Is The Founder Of Good Investing. This Article Was Provided Corporate Knights Magazine.', 'Tim Nashcorporate Knightsmon.']",2020-07-13,"Pandemic Portfolio is a series from Corporate Knights and the Toronto Star that looks at companies and funds relatively well-positioned to weather the economic storm triggered by COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic is pushing every industry into the future and the investment industry is no exception.

Canadian investors are increasingly embracing the shift away from more expensive mutual funds and into lower-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to a report from the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, more than $18 billion has flowed into ETFs so far in 2020, compared to only $4 billion into mutual funds. As the stock market crashed and recovered in March, ETF investors stayed the course by investing $3 billion, while mutual fund investors panicked and sold more than $14 billion.

A big part of the growth in ETF assets has come from so-called robo advisers such as Wealthsimple, which automate the process and make it very easy for people to start investing in ETFs.

These robo advisers have only increased in popularity during the pandemic: Wealthsimple, for example, saw twice as many sign-ups in March of this year compared to last March. Not every robo adviser offers a socially responsible portfolio, but for those that do, approximately one third of new investors opt in. Up until now, most of the offerings were similar and offered a very loose definition of “socially responsible,” so I’m very happy to see Wealthsimple raising the bar.

I wasn’t impressed when Wealthsimple launched its first socially responsible portfolio in March 2016. The portfolio consisted of a mishmash of ETFs, all with different and often conflicting definitions of social responsibility. Wealthsimple itself admits that the original methodology left a lot to be desired. Thankfully, the company updated the portfolio in June by launching its own socially responsible ETFs, with lower management fees and a unique methodology.

With more than $5 billion of assets under management, it’s worth examining Wealthsimple’s new socially responsible portfolio to see whether it really lets people “invest in a better world” — or is just clever marketing?

Wealthsimple’s updated socially responsible portfolio is chiefly made up of two new ETFs: the Wealthsimple North America Socially Responsible ETF (ticker: WSRI) that includes Canadian and U.S. companies, and the Wealthsimple Developed Markets ex-NA Socially Responsible ETF (ticker: WSRD) that includes companies from Europe, Japan and Australia. Both ETFs trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and use the same screening methodology to determine which companies are allowed in. WSRI charges an annual management fee of 0.2 per cent, while WSRD costs 0.25 per cent.

Contrary to some of the ETFs in Wealthsimple’s old socially responsible portfolio, the new ETFs explicitly exclude weapons manufacturing, defence contracting, tobacco, alcohol, adult entertainment and any company found to be in violation of the United Nations Global Compact (principles covering human rights, child labour and corruption). The new funds also exclude companies related to oil, gas and coal, making them fossil-fuel free. Additionally, the top 25 per cent of carbon emitters in each industry are scrapped, as are companies with fewer than three women or less than 25 per cent female representation on their boards of directors.

According to a 2019 report from Osler, a leading business law firm, just 39 per cent of TSX-listed companies have more than one female director on their board. That means Wealthsimple’s gender screen excludes roughly 60 per cent of Canadian stocks.

Even with all those screens, Wealthsimple’s new ETFs still include a number of companies that would raise eyebrows among many ethical investors. Its North American ETF includes Amazon, which is being sued by Canadian delivery drivers claiming unfair treatment; and Facebook, which is facing a growing boycott from advertisers unhappy with the social media giant’s hands-off approach to hate speech.

The fundamental problem with the “one-size fits all” approach to ethical investing that robo advisers and funds offer is that the methodology never goes far enough for some investors — and goes way too far for others. Wealthsimple has said that the new funds will continue to improve and evolve, so we could see something like a racial equality screen introduced (pretty please). But there are currently only 233 companies in both ETFs combined and I would expect additional ethical screens to keep reducing diversification.

Does the new portfolio, as advertised, let people “invest in a better world?” Well, not quite.

It does a good job of excluding problematic companies and it does include a handful of stalwarts on Corporate Knights’ list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, including McCormick. But the portfolio has lacklustre exposure to companies whose main business is providing sustainable solutions such as renewable energy, electric cars, green buildings and energy efficiency — all themes that are outperforming with good long-term growth prospects.

For example, in the WSRD fund, just 20 per cent of the companies have a significant line of green or sustainable products or services, according to the Corporate Knights Green Flag Database.

For the time being, investors who want to invest in sustainable solutions will need to incorporate additional products such as green ETFs or community bonds if they want their investment to have a positive impact.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’re not even close to that moment when it comes to Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending, but that feeling is starting to set in.

So far, deficit spending has reached $343 billion this year covering everything from wage subsidies and unemployment benefits to money for seniors, students, rent relief and loans to business.

It may look like some politicians believe we can spend our way out of the economic shock, recession, and, perhaps, depression headed our way.

But what if tax dollars aren’t the only way to free up much needed investment dollars? What if there was a way to encourage Canadians to use their own capital to provide stimulus and support Canadian business?

Wealthy Canadians and corporations are holding cash and there are few incentives for them to invest in private Canadian businesses.

While the 2008 global economic crisis hit the big banks hardest, today’s calamity has struck a death blow to small business with little in the way of assistance coming from Ottawa.

That’s not to say a few small loan programs haven’t been helpful; they just haven’t moved the needle, and many small business owners have been reluctant to take on the risk of additional debt.

A recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found that 25 per cent of small businesses will close their doors if they sustain a 50-per-cent drop in revenue for a month.

Many Canadian business owners are already well past that point. This is a tragedy. Small businesses are the heart and soul of the Canadian economy.

If you are a successful small business owner who has built a nest egg over many years, it is unlikely you will double down during a pandemic and reinvest your savings to keep your business afloat.

If you are evaluating an investment in, for example, a tech company looking for additional capital, the risks have increased significantly.

Unlocking private capital would provide additional support from Canadians who are not only looking for a return, but are also emotionally invested in the business’s success.

We’ve seen grassroots, microscale economic support for small business in communities across the country, including from community crowdfunding platform Distantly.ca, which enables individuals to send funds directly to local businesses.

The platform was conceived to make sure Mainstreet was still open post lock down.

Businesses such as restaurants, salons and gyms, which are closing their doors daily, would benefit greatly from an incentive for Canadians to make a much bigger commitment with that support.

Small businesses have a desperate need for capital to invest in digital transformation, working capital, personal protective equipment and other modifications required to comply with new pandemic regulations.

If Canada is going to emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient, we need tax policy to encourage Canadians to invest in our small businesses.

We are not looking for anything unique or groundbreaking here. A handful of Canadian provinces have tax policy that encourages private investment in small business. New Brunswick has the Small Business Investor Tax Credit program, the most generous in the country.

If you live in New Brunswick and invest in a small business, you get a personal income tax credit of 50 per cent of your investment up to maximum of $125,000 annually. Corporations, trusts, co-ops and local economic development agencies are entitled to similar benefits upon investment. In the last five years, the program has generated almost $450 million of investment, supporting 2,200 small businesses in New Brunswick.

The federal government needs a bold, game-changing tax policy that will encourage Canadians with capital, including small business owners, to step off the sidelines and invest in small business.

We must establish qualifying parameters that encourage small businesses to grow. We must set the bar high in defining “small business,” so we don’t discourage growth.

The U.S. does this well. Section 1202 of its tax code allows for tax-free capital gains of up to $10 million or 10-times the investment if it is in a private business with up to $50 million in assets.

It’s a bold idea. That is easy to implement, were Ottawa so inclined.

As New Brunswick did, the federal government could provide an income tax credit to Canadians for investment in small- and medium-sized businesses. Business owners who double down and reinvest in their own business, could get a tax holiday on income earned, or charge no tax on dividends paid, for up to three-times the invested capital. For investors looking to back potential high-growth entrepreneurs, the program could provide tax-free capital gains — up to tenfold.

Ottawa has the power to do all of the above.

High-income earners in Canada pay more than half of their income to the government, not including municipal and sales tax.

Why not create a plan where Canadians can choose to provide private stimulus and invest in the small businesses and entrepreneurs so vital to the Canadian economy?",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And if the pollsters in the States are correct, that’s exactly what is going to happen. Biden appears to have a wide lead at this point.

Of course, a lot can happen in four months. But if the status quo holds, what would a Biden win mean for investors and the Canadian economy? Potentially, a lot.

So far, the former vice-president hasn’t unveiled much in terms of his platform. But his first major policy statement sent shock waves through the oilpatch and cheered environmentalists.

In mid-May, the Biden campaign announced that one of his first acts as president would be to rescind the permit allowing TC Energy to build the Keystone XL pipeline. That action would kill the project once and for all.

President Barack Obama rejected Keystone on the grounds that it would contribute significantly to climate change. As his VP, Biden strongly supported the move, so it’s no surprise he would act quickly to reverse Trump’s approval of the project.

That would be a huge blow to heavy oil producers and to the province of Alberta, which is investing $1.5 billion to cover construction costs to the end of 2020. That’s a lot of tax dollars down the drain if Biden indeed pulls the plug.

The Keystone XL announcement is a clear tip-off to what else we might expect from a Biden presidency. It would probably be the greenest administration in U.S. history, especially if the Democrats are able to retain control of the House and wrest the Senate from the Republicans.

The Green New Deal put forward by the party’s left wing is a smorgasbord of ideas aimed at tackling climate change on a grand scale. Some of the proposals are probably unworkable, such as upgrading every building in the U.S. to meet specific environmental standards. But it is likely that a Biden administration would promote some of its key goals, including the use of green energy at the expense of fossil fuels, and subsidizing electric vehicles and low-emission high-speed trains.

Under Biden, the U.S. would almost certainly rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and we should expect a lot of reregulation in the environmental sector, reversing the deregulation of the Trump years.

Relations with Canada should improve significantly. Biden does not believe in using tariffs as a political lever. He and Prime Minister Trudeau share many of the same views and profess to be good friends.

In other areas, I would expect a Biden government to roll back some or all of Trump’s prized $1.5 trillion (all figures U.S.) in corporate and personal tax cuts. The plan was passed in 2017, when the Republicans still controlled the House. Not one Democrat voted for it.

The cuts provided a huge boost for corporate profits but, instead of investing the money in plants, equipment and jobs as the government hoped, billions were spent on share buybacks and raising dividends. That caused a backlash that extended to Capitol Hill and is still simmering.

The Trump administration was running a huge deficit even before the emergency spending for the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office now projects a shortfall of close to $4 trillion this year. That means the cupboard will be bare if Biden takes office in January. What better way to start replenishing it than by rolling back those tax cuts?

Canada would be an indirect beneficiary if that were to happen as it would restore the tax advantage we offered to corporations before the Trump cuts.

How would stocks react to all this? If recent history is any indication, the markets would rise in the first year of a Biden presidency. That has been the pattern in every year but one since 1985. The exception was 2001, the first year that George W. Bush was in office, when Sept. 11 sent the market tumbling.

Stocks will not respond well to a boost in corporate taxes or an overaggressive climate policy. But they would get a big lift if a coronavirus vaccine is developed and an economic recovery appears to be underway if and when Biden takes office.

One thing we can say with certainty: a Biden presidency would be light years removed from the turmoil of the Trump years. That would come as a relief for a lot of people.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"It is not America’s problem alone that it cannot seem to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

It’s Canada’s problem, too.

The range of potential harms to Canada include supply-chain disruptions and renewed American protectionist sanctions against Canadian industry.

That’s in addition to the hammer-blow the prolonged pandemic has already dealt to Canada’s vast tourism, hospitality and conventions sector, deprived of U.S. business and vacation travellers.

Americans getting sicker instead of healthier — opposite to what their northern neighbours have achieved — has so far not significantly diminished the roughly $1 billion in daily trade between the two countries.

But that changes if the “rocket-ship” economic recovery that U.S. President Donald Trump promised Americans last month fails to materialize, with U.S. elections just four months away.

A promising U.S. economic rebound from mid-April into June has stopped far short of full recovery. And some sectors, notably retail, are back in decline.

Fear of infection is keeping Americans out of stores that have reopened after lockdown. So is the lack of a second round of U.S. pandemic relief cheques, in sharp contrast to the continued flow of federal income supports in Canada and the European Union (EU).

Weakness in U.S. consumer sentiment will eventually inflict damage on Canadian online retail and business-to-business sales in the U.S. market. It will also harm Canadian firms doing business directly in the U.S., including Canadian banks, insurers, retailers and property developers.

If the stall-out in the U.S. economic recovery continues into the fall, the economic pain for Canada will spread from tourism and retailing into the Canadian manufacturing, resource and agricultural sectors.

Americans buy Western Canadian livestock, B.C. timber and almost every drop of Alberta oil. Demand and prices for each have already been weakened by the pandemic.

Economic conditions in both the U.S. and Canada are deeply worrisome.

The U.S. jobless rate in June was 11.1 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent just before the pandemic, and not far shy of the peak 11.9 per cent during the Great Recession of 2008-2010.

The Canadian jobless rate peaked at about 14 per cent in the second quarter, Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, said this week. It is expected to fall back to pre-pandemic levels of about seven per cent by the end of next year.

The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by about six per cent this year. Canada’s economy will shrink by 6.8 per cent, by the feds’ reckoning, before rebounding by about 5.5 per cent in 2021.

But Ottawa’s projections for a robust economic recovery are pinned on a strong U.S. rebound. A Canadian export-driven economy tied to the U.S. market will, of course, fail to reach those recovery targets if the U.S. pandemic continues to drain America of economic vigour.

In contrast to the pandemic progress made by many major economies, the U.S. continues to report record numbers of new COVID-19 cases.

Last month, Canada’s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases fell by 75 per cent.

In the U.S., it rose by 37 per cent, reaching all-time highs of 50,000 or more new daily cases this week. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel-laureate economist, pointed out last week, Arizona, population seven million, has been reporting more new daily cases than the entire EU, population 446 million.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection-disease expert, warned this week that, at the current rate of growth in new U.S. cases, America could be reporting upward of 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that for every reported case of COVID-19, there probably are at least another 10 that have gone unreported. The U.S. already leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities.

While many countries are preparing for an expected second wave of the virus, “We are still knee-deep in the first wave,” Fauci said.

It is troubling for Canada’s economic prospects that the Trump administration is in denial about America’s failed response to the pandemic.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that “The world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.” Trump himself said this week that COVID-19 will “sort of just disappear.”

That isn’t the view in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, where COVID-19 appears to be raging out of control and hospitals are close to overcapacity with COVID-19 cases.

As to world opinion, a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that just two per cent of European respondents believe the U.S. has been “helpful” in the fight against COVID-19.

Given the resourcefulness of Americans, one has to believe conditions will improve, just as especially hard-hit jurisdictions including South Korea, Germany and New York City were able to stop the spread.

But for now, Canada needs to brace for potential disruptions in U.S. supply chains.

For example, Canadian grocers should be looking now for alternatives to California and Florida in citrus supplies. These are largely harvested in those U.S. states by migrant labour more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. Otherwise, Canadians might be hit this winter with higher prices for oranges and other citrus products, and the economy will suffer a rise in food-related inflation.

We also need to brace for a new round of Trump protectionism. With his re-election prospects gloomy, Trump has returned to launching trade disputes. Their purpose is to deflect attention from the pandemic and to show concern about a faltering economy.

That too is a worry for Canada.

Coming into 2020, there was some hope among Canadian lumber producers and the U.S. homebuilders they supply that America’s long-standing punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber might finally be lifted.

Instead, the pandemic and Trump’s renewed protectionism have turned softwood lumber talks into dead letter. And the White House is musing about a renewed tariff assault on Canadian aluminum imports.

Canada is hardly the only target of Trump’s resurgent protectionism. His latest “America First” trade sanctions are also aimed at the EU as a whole, EU member Germany in particular, and Vietnam and other U.S. allies. All that against the backdrop of Trump’s trade war with China.

Even before the pandemic, U.S. trade disputes, since ramped up, were depressing global GDP growth.

“If the U.S. cannot get a handle on the virus, and if its leadership chooses a protectionist route to economic recovery, Canada’s return to normalcy will be that much harder,” Philippe Lagassé and Srdjan Vucetic, international affairs professors at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, respectively, wrote recently.

If only a get-well card to America signed by Canadians would make a difference.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-05-18,"House-hungry millennials could be forgiven for hoping that the silver lining in COVID-19’s economic rampage is an unexpected shot at the real estate market.

With home prices set to soar at the start of this year, many would-be buyers went into lockdown feeling priced out and discouraged by heated bidding wars and bully offers.

Then COVID-19 sent Greater Toronto Area home sales tumbling 69 per cent year over year in April. Some consumers still hanging on to their salaried jobs read it as a signal that the window of opportunity was opening.

On a year-over-year basis, home prices have stalled, with the average price rising only about $1,000 in April to $821,392. Still, that was down about $90,000 from February’s average price of $910,319.

While there are some opportunities in the COVID-19 housing market, experts warn those come with risk, and timing the low point is tricky for buyers. Even if this is a once-in-a-decade chance to step on the property ladder, it may be slipping away as the economy sputters back to life.

The Star asked six experts — two economists, three real estate brokers and a mortgage specialist — if post-pandemic conditions will be first-time-buyer friendly, and whether a recovery will quickly shut down those opportunities.

Here’s what they said:

“The bottom is not falling out of the market, but it’s a better time for a first-time buyer probably than we’ve seen since 2009,” said Andrew Harrild of Condos.ca.

The year opened with bidding wars galore and homes commonly selling for 10 per cent over list price. Then in mid-March, when open houses were cancelled and condo buildings banned real estate showings, there were probably deals to be had amid the uncertainty.

But the market has since stabilized.

“You’re even starting to see offer dates creeping back in, which is certainly an indication people are feeling a bit more confident,” Harrild said.

“You’re not seeing massive discounts off the list price but you are seeing 98 per cent of list or $10,000 or $20,000 under asking,” he said.

The flip side is there isn’t much to see. Listings were down 64 per cent in April compared to the same month last year, with short supply putting upward pressure on prices and signs of pent-up demand.

“There’s a bit of confidence coming into the market,” he said.

If you are looking for a bargain you’ve got to drill down to individual neighbourhood and housing category, said Zoocasa CEO Lauren Haw.

She warned that sales statistics are skewed by the low number of sales and the mix of available properties on the market.

“Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, things are quite different,” she said.

There could be more choices for those in the market for a downtown condo. That’s where some short-term rentals have migrated to the long-term-rental and resale markets. But there are few detached houses available in good school districts.

“April-May is your crown month for family homes in good school districts and they’re not for sale right now. I continue to think when those houses hit the market we’re going to see prices rise,” Haw said.

There is some real estate excitement in the 905 communities around Toronto and that is extending to cities such as Hamilton, Peterborough, Barrie, London and Kitchener-Waterloo, markets that were thriving before the pandemic.

Now that many people don’t see themselves going back to work at the office full-time, Haw predicted those secondary cities will likely remain buoyant.

“If I am only going to commute three days a week, of course I’m going to buy a detached house in a great neighbourhood in Kitchener,” she said. But home buyers will continue to want walkable downtown lifestyles with restaurants and entertainment nearby.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said there are bargains to be had with homes selling for less than they were in March. But, he said, “There is a risk premium for trading in any financial crisis and frankly it’s justified because there are so many unknowns.”

That benefit of a sale price that is 2 to 5 per cent lower looks more substantial when you consider prices had been expected to rise as much as 15 per cent this spring, he said.

Soper also warned that the window for those savings will close as the market returns to normal, and there are signs that is already happening, with traffic up 20 per cent year over year at the company’s listings website royallepage.ca and an uptick in virtual and guided showings.

“The longer you wait the less an opportunity there will be for a cheaper purchase,” he said.

“In any market correction, buyers are the earliest to react to a potential downturn and adjust their expectations lower as far as price goes. Sellers are the last in and the first out,” Soper said.

Their usual reaction is to take their house off the market or test the market to see if they can get what they want, not let the house go at a significant discount.

“It appears that the 905 is doing better than the 416 during this recovery,” Soper said. “It may be a combination of lower average price and lower density — probably a citizenry that is somewhat less concerned about leaving their homes to transact, particularly in housing,” he said.

David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said he doubts few young adults 25 to 35 years are thinking about buying homes, with about 30 per cent having lost their jobs or the majority of their work hours since February.

“If you were in that age category and a third of your friends lost their jobs, you might be pretty reticent to take on a big mortgage because you might be next,” he said.

Several factors need to line up for buyers to take advantage of the recession, Macdonald said.

“You’ve got to be lucky enough to keep your job and we need to see big declines in house prices, which itself would be devastating to the economy because people would feel a lot poorer as a result of their houses being worth much less,” he said.

Macdonald said people who might have been saving for a house pre-COVID-19 are now likely more preoccupied with paying the rent.

“There may be people who benefit from this but in terms of allowing millennials en masse to buy single-detached homes in the GTA any time soon, I think that’s extraordinarily unlikely,” he said.

One sign the housing market could be quickly revived is that mortgage pre-approvals are beginning to pile up, said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.

“It feels like just before the spring market right now where there is a few purchases happening but not many, but it does feel like people are readying themselves to possibly buy in the next couple of months,” he said.

While part-time and hourly workers have suffered disproportionate job losses during the COVID-19 crisis, only about 10 per cent of full-time workers have lost their jobs, Laird said.

“Typically it wouldn’t be the part-time, hourly person who is looking at entering the real estate market,” he said. “It’s more typically those with longer-term, stable employment, and that group has not been nearly as badly affected,” he said.

Conference Board of Canada senior economist Robin Wiebe said there are competing factors that could hasten or slow recovery. But on balance, he said, Toronto housing fundamentals can likely sustain a comeback.

“One of the things that might go against a quick rebound in the housing market is that consumers in general are carrying high debts. Even though rates are low they may not be prepared to jump into the housing market — that’s not just young people, that’s people of all ages,” Wiebe said.

But population is a big driver of housing demand and there are reasons to think Toronto has pent-up demand based on Conference Board estimates that the city added 128,000 people last year, on top of 125,000 in 2018. That’s the equivalent of two Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) according to the Statistics Canada definition of 100,000 people, he said.

Until the shutdown Toronto also enjoyed “red hot” employment growth, rising over 4 per cent last year, and interest rates are low and expected to stay that way for some time.

That has contributed to pent-up demand and a short supply of housing. Wiebe cited Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) statistics showing there were 209 completed and unoccupied (ownership, not rental) apartments in the Toronto CMA in April. The 20-year average is 630.

Experts who spoke to the Star stressed there are still a lot of unknowns about the road to recovery.

What happens if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infection in the fall?

“A brief second wave I believe the market could manage, and people will treat it like the aftershock of an earthquake. An extended or more damaging second wave would mean all bets are off for the economy and the housing market,” Soper said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter', 'Tess Kalinowski Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Real Estate. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-04-22,"The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board has revised its 2020 forecast of 10 per cent price growth as COVID-19 sent real estate sales plunging 69 per cent year over year in the first 17 days of April.

The average selling price for homes also dipped 1.5 per cent to $819,665, according to a special mid-April market update released on Wednesday.

The board now expects home prices to finish out the year at 2019 levels, instead of the originally forecast $900,000 average.

Listing prices showed a similar drop in the first part of this month.

The board’s revised expectation takes into account a roaring 15 per cent year-over-year price gain in the first quarter. More recently though, COVID-19 restrictions have severely curtailed real estate activity, said board president Michael Collins.

“Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and, indeed, their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction. In the condo market in particular, individual condo corporations have curtailed entry for non-residents,” he said in a news release.

The board forecasts a return to housing activity if public health restrictions loosen in the summer, leading to an acceleration of sales in the fall. Some price declines could appear into the second and third quarters of the year, however.

“But these declines will have less of an effect on the overall price for 2020 because the annual share of sales will also be much lower than normal,” said a news release.

New listings went the way of sales, plummeting 63.7 per cent to 3,843 in the Toronto region between April 1 and April 17, a period that is traditionally part of the housing market’s busiest season.

When buyers get back in the market, there will be a pent-up demand for homes, said TRREB chief market analyst Jason Mercer.

“Increasingly those buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the (onset) of COVID-19,” he said.

The market update shows that detached house prices have taken the biggest hit, declining 9.1 per cent to $1.26 million on average in the city of Toronto. There was a drop in the number of homes that sold in the city for more than $2 million, bringing down the overall average, says the real estate board.

Across the Toronto region, detached houses sold for 4.6 per cent less year over year, averaging $990,543.

Even condos, which have consistently increased in value, saw a drop in the average selling price of 1.8 per cent to $578,594 in the GTA and a 2.9 per cent decline to $617,246 inside Toronto’s borders.

Those units typically attract a lot of first-time buyers, who can wait for more certainty in the market, said the real estate board.

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-04-17,"Tenants who are sheltering in place during the coronavirus outbreak will likely face a softer rental market when the lockdown lifts, says the head of development-tracking market research firm Urbanation.

Shaun Hildebrand said that while construction has slowed, many residential building sites are still operating and will inject new supply into the rental market.

There are already signs of a shift in the Toronto area’s notoriously tight rental market, he said.

There were 7,200 units leased in the first quarter of 2020, a 16 per cent year over year increase. But there was a significant shift after March 16, Urbanation reports.

The year started with a 25 per cent year over year uptick in the number of Toronto-area lease transactions. But in the second half of March, rentals were 25 per cent below the same level the year before — down 39 per cent compared to the first half of the month.

The supply of rentals dropped only 7 per cent during the same period.

“That we saw some weakness in rents already, just two weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, it just speaks to how quickly the market is starting to react,” said Hildebrand.

The changes represent a pretty dramatic shift and likely the beginning of what will be a pretty soft period for the rental market, he said.

Some 10,000 condos and 1,000 purpose-built rentals were expected to come on the market in the second quarter of this year, and while they will likely be delayed, most will be ready for occupancy later, said Hildebrand.

Residential construction sites are operating, albeit at a slower pace to allow for worker safety measures.

“On the demand side we have job losses, lower income, lower immigration. On the supply side we haven’t seen a lot of rental availability as yet but I think that will happen,” he said.

Job losses mean some tenants will move into roommate situations or back home. Hildebrand predicts fewer people will upgrade their apartment. But the introduction of new buildings means a large supply coming online at once and that can put downward pressure on rents.

Because most Toronto investment condos are owned by individuals rather than REITs or pension funds, those landlords will be motivated to rent their units and, because they bought at lower prices than condos sell for now, they will have some flexibility to lower their prices, he said.

Meanwhile, rental website PadMapper reported a 10 per cent drop in apartment searches between February and March.

Toronto remains the most expensive rental market in the country, according to PadMapper. The $2,250 average one-bedroom rent, was .9 per cent higher year over year in April. Two-bedroom rents rose 2.8 per cent to $2,950 in the same period.

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-04-14,"Royal LePage is predicting that Toronto area home prices could still rise this year, despite the COVID-19 crisis.

In its first-quarter report, released Tuesday, the brokerage says that if the pandemic recedes by the end of second quarter, prices could jump up 1.5 per cent year-over-year, to $856,263 by the end of 2020.

However, if the lockdown continues to the end of August, the company expects house and condo prices will contract by 0.5 per cent year-over-year to $851,982.

Although Toronto’s housing market had a strong first-quarter, with aggregate resale prices rising 7.5 per cent year-over-year, that won’t be enough to compensate for the loss of eight to 12 weeks in the busy spring real estate season, said Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper.

About 22 per cent of sales typically occur in the first quarter of the year.

“We’re not anticipating an immediate recovery,” he said.

Even when the economy begins to move again, people will still be wary of each other and sellers will be more hesitant to allow strangers to tour their homes.

But once consumers feel more comfortable, Soper said economic stimulus, such as low interest rates, competition among lenders and softer prices, will kick-start the market.

The “swift and violent” impacts of COVID-19 have disproportionately hit younger and part-time workers across the province, groups less likely to be in the housing market, he said.

That’s why the real estate sector will be one of the prime lifters of the economy when health protocols are relaxed, just as it was following the global downturn in 2008 and 2009, said Soper.

“It was really the entry of the first-time buyer and the housing consumer that brought the Canadian economy back after the great recession,” he said.

Soper said it may appear as if real estate prices have plummeted when the country goes back to work. There will be headlines touting dramatically lower selling prices. But those will likely be a few distressed sellers accepting lower prices that lower the overall average.

There will also be some opportunities for buyers who might otherwise have been faced with competitive offers — something that was a growing concern in the heated market of the first part of the year.

“One of the really challenging things we saw coming in 2020 before the health crisis, was the psychology of multiple defeats where you put an offer in and you lose and you lose and you lose. Eventually people either drop out (of the market) in frustration or they overpay. We should see a lot less of that,” he said.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) had been forecasting a 10 per cent rise in GTA housing prices this year before the COVID-19 restrictions stopped showings and stalled all but necessary transactions. The board has suggested that it will have a better idea of where prices and sales are heading later this spring.

Royal LePage’s report says that Toronto’s outlook is relatively optimistic compared to the national picture. It projects that Canadian home prices could grow 1 per cent if the economy starts churning again by the end of June.

Read', 'Michael Lewisbusiness Reporter', 'Business Reporter']",2020-03-05,"Variable rate mortgage holders are the big winners from the Big Six banks’ moves to match the Bank of Canada’s 50 point reduction to its trendsetting interest rate.

According to rate comparison website RateSpy.com, variable rate customers will see rates drop by half a per cent for interest cost savings of roughly $500 per year for every $100,000 of mortgage.

Those with adjustable-rate mortgages will see monthly payments fall by about $24 per $100,000, while variable-rate customers will continue to make the same monthly payment but their portion directed to principal will rise while the amount paid in interest will fall. Home backed and regular lines of credit will drop as well.

All of this follows the Bank of Canada’s decision Wednesday to lower its overnight target rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent — the lowest since the 2008 recession — due to fears of a deepening economic downturn caused by the coronavirus and after the U.S. Fed imposed an emergency 50-basis-point cut.

There had been expectations that the banks would not pass on the full BoC cut, but Canada’s largest bank, RBC, led the way Wednesday evening, announcing a 50-basis point reduction to 3.45 per cent for its prime rate effective Thursday, which is used to set the rate at which banks lend to customers with good credit.

The other big banks — Bank of Nova Scotia, TD-Canada Trust, CIBC and BMO followed suit with National Bank of Canada confirming Thursday that it will also lower its prime rate by 50 points to 3.45 per cent as of Friday.

Rob McLister, RateSpy.com’s founder, said the the lowest widely available variable rate will drop immediately to roughly 2.34 per cent from 2.84 per cent, while the 2.59 per cent rate for the lowest conventional five year fixed-rate mortgages will fall in the short term due the lower prime and downward movement in bond yields which normally signal falling mortgage rates. He said fixed rates will trend lower as economic data continues to soften, “but we’ll have to wait and see by how much.”

Many observers expect the Bank of Canada to announce another 25 point rate cut next month — possibly another quarter-point cut before the end of the year, which would bring Canada’s overnight rate to 0.75 per cent.

“The growing risk of COVID-19 to the outlook suggests that the Bank of Canada will follow today’s 50-bp cut in interest rates with an additional 25-bps cut in April,” said Stephen Brown of Capital Economics in a note. “Given lingering concerns that looser policy will boost an already red-hot housing market, however, we think the Bank is unlikely to go further than that.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-02-25,"Condos are leading Toronto’s rising luxury real estate market, which is expected to make further gains this year thanks to a low supply of listings and the return of foreign buyers, according to a Royal LePage report released Tuesday.

Luxury condo prices climbed 7 per cent in the GTA in the 12 months ending Jan. 31, to a median price of $2.4 million. By comparison, high end houses, rose only 1.2 per cent to $3.6 million in the same period.

But Steven Green, a sales representative with Royal LePage Partners Realty, said he expects this year will see another jump in prices. He is predicting luxury condos to rise between 10 and 15 per cent in the next 12 months and houses to surge between 2.5 and 6 per cent.

The lack of new listings has continued to drive up prices this month, said Green. As an example, he cited a case last week where six competing offers drove the selling price of a condo near Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue up by 36 per cent beyond asking.

“There’s no supply, so there’s five people looking to buy the same kind of product right now because they had no chance of buying this one,” he said.

Green, who has several Hollywood names among his clientele, says Toronto’s luxury market is being fuelled by the return of foreign buyers since last summer.

Property buyers from Asia and the U.S. are attracted by the city’s vibrant culture and relative safety, and have adjusted to the non-resident buyers tax introduced in 2017. Prices also came down in some areas such as Bayview Avenue and York Mills Road

“They look at real estate differently than we do. We always wanted to buy a house on the quiet street. They have changed the market and pricing for some areas because they want to be buying on the major street or close to the major street because they want the action,” he said.

Prices look high to Torontonians but Green said, “We’re still undervalued for major cities around the world.”

Empty nesters are typically looking for condos in their old neighbourhoods. Condos sell in Toronto for about $1,000 per square foot, he said. Many buyers are purchasing less square footage than they might actually like but they are purchasing for the area.

“So many people are looking for 1,800 sq. ft.-plus and that’s hard to find,” said Green.

Many of those are in Yorkville, the St. Regis at Bay and Adelaide streets and the Ritz on Wellington St. W.

Among Canada’s major cities, Montreal saw the highest year-over-year price appreciation in its luxury market in the year leading to Jan. 31 with 8.5 per cent for both houses and condos. A dearth of listings is also pushing prices there, with homeowners hesitating to list for fear of not being able to find another suitable property, said Royal Lepage. The company is forecasting the median price of luxury homes there to grow by 5.5 per cent for houses and 5 per cent for condos.

The online TV giant will start by shifting $25 million into the Black Economic Development Initiative, a new fund that will invest in Black-owned financial institutions serving low-income communities, and $10 million to Hope Credit Union. Going forward, the company will steer two per cent of its cash on hand, which currently amounts to about $5 billion, to financial organizations that directly support African-American communities.

News of Netflix’s commitment sent shares of Black-owned banks soaring Tuesday. Carver Bancorp Inc. jumped as much as 173 per cent in New York trading and Broadway Financial Corp. gained as much as 83 per cent.

Large U.S. companies have rushed to show support for African Americans following the death of George Floyd, one of several Black people killed by police in the past few months. Many businesses and rich individuals have pledged money to civil rights causes, including Netflix chief executive officer Reed Hastings, who earmarked $120 million of his personal fortune to historically Black colleges and universities. But his company wanted to propose a solution that addresses more systemic causes of inequality.

Hope Credit Union serves more than 1.5 million people in states including Alabama and Louisiana, but it doesn’t have enough money to fully support the financial needs in its communities, according to its CEO, Bill Bynum.

“We are capital-starved, just like the people in the communities we serve,” Bynum said. “Having a global voice like Netflix say it’s important to invest in financial institutions like Hope is tremendously important, not just for the capital we will use to make mortgage loans and small business loans, but for what it says.”

One employee

Netflix executive Aaron Mitchell came up with the idea of shifting money into Black-owned banks following an April dinner with leaders from different under-represented groups. Netflix has been hosting these dinners since October in an effort to improve diversity at its highest levels and inform its top executives.

Mitchell pitched the idea to chief financial officer Spencer Neumann and began conducting research, reaching out to banks and reading “The Color of Money,” Mehrsa Baradaran’s book about the racial wealth gap. After Floyd’s death, he sent his proposal to Hastings, who expedited the project.

“I have talked to a lot of companies, but this is the first company that’s actually done something about it,” Baradaran said.

Netflix hopes the move will inspire other large U.S. companies to do the same, Neumann said. The streaming service has a small cash pile relative to Silicon Valley peers Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. If every company in the S&P 500 shifted just one per cent of its cash to Black-owned financial institutions, it would translate into more than $20 billion, Netflix said.

Netflix record

Netflix has a lot of work to do on its own. The company has no Black executives among its eight top officers, and added its first Black board member in 2018. It ranked toward the bottom of the pack last year among Hollywood studios in terms of hiring women directors, according to the Directors’ Guild of America.

But the guild ranked the company first in adding people of colour, part of the progress it has made since hiring Verna Myers as its head of diversity and inclusion in 2018. She aided programs such as Strong Black Lead, which highlights projects with African Americans in lead roles. Black employees now make up seven per cent of Netflix’s overall employee base, up from four per cent three years ago. The number of Black vice presidents has tripled to nine over the same span.

“We have been on this journey now for at least the last three years,” Mitchell said. “We still have lots of work to do, but we are making meaningful progress.”

Read', 'Kurt Wagnerbloomberg']",2020-06-26,"Facebook Inc. will begin labelling all posts that include information about voting with a link encouraging users to get facts from the company’s new voting hub, and expands its prohibition on advertising for hate speech.

The new policy on voting announced Friday by chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg means Facebook will label future posts from U.S President Donald Trump, and everyone else, about mail-in ballots or other voting-related issues, regardless of whether they contain misleading information. Facebook will funnel users to a voting information hub meant to provide facts from state authorities. Users will also be able to register to vote using this hub. Facebook has set a goal of helping register four million new voters before the 2020 U.S. election in November.

“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.

The social network has been criticized in recent weeks for allowing false or misleading voting information, including posts from Trump about mail-in ballots that Twitter Inc. flagged as inaccurate. Zuckerberg has said repeatedly that he doesn’t want to remove posts from elected officials, but would rather let users make up their minds about the content.

A number of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are among those unhappy with Facebook’s history of allowing posts they say encourage voter suppression. Those groups have organized a Facebook advertising boycott for the month of July, and a number of well-known consumer brands are participating, including outdoor gear company Patagonia, Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever.

Facebook will now prohibit ads that paint anyone from a certain race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation as dangerous. The company will expand those policies to better protect immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads that say these groups of people are inferior.

The company will also label posts that it keeps up even though they violate policies, if they come from a newsworthy source, such as the president. “We’ll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what’s acceptable in our society — but we’ll add a prompt to tell people that the content they’re sharing may violate our policies,” Zuckerberg said.

“Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech,” said Luis Di Como, Unilever’s executive vice president of global media, in an interview.

“Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,” the company said in a statement. Its Facebook ban also will cover Instagram.

The Facebook advertising boycott came after civil-rights groups including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP called on brands to pull ad spending from Facebook for July. The groups said the social-media giant hadn’t made enough progress enforcing its policies on hate speech and misinformation.

Twitter was not a target of the civil-rights group’s boycott call, but it has also come under scrutiny on Madison Avenue.

Representatives from Facebook and Twitter were unavailable for immediate comment

Facebook has taken some steps in recent years to better police its platforms, adding workers and developing new technology. That has resulted in the removal of hate speech and other objectionable content.

“We acknowledge the efforts of our partners, but there is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.,” Unilever said in the statement. “The complexities of the current cultural landscape have placed a renewed responsibility on brands to learn, respond and act to drive a trusted and safe digital ecosystem.”

Mr. Di Como said Unilever would like to see a reduction in the level of hate speech on the platforms and wants independent companies to measure and confirm that progress has been made.

Read', 'Molly Schuetzbloomberg', 'Molly Schuetzbloombergfri.']",2020-06-26,"When news broke last month that Amazon.com Inc. was interested in buying Zoox Inc., observers assumed the e-commerce giant was looking to automate its delivery fleet. After all, Amazon already invested in an electric truck maker and is a major buyer of everything from planes to diesel vehicles.

But in a statement on Friday confirming its acquisition of the autonomous vehicle startup, Amazon touted Zoox for its ride-hailing ambitions. Ride hailing? Amazon?

“You say, does it make sense?” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry. “Well, does it make sense that the package delivery company sells me streaming movies?”

Zoox is a corporate investment, not an acquisition to be folded into one of Amazon’s existing businesses, the company says. Aicha Evans, Zoox’s chief executive officer, and Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer, will continue to lead the company as a standalone business.

“Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,” said Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide retail business. “We’re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.”

Amazon’s corporate development team recently told bankers they wanted to look at any autonomous vehicle startup interested in selling, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

Amazon shares were little changed Friday morning in New York, while Uber Technologies Inc. fell less than three per cent — in line with the overall market.

Terms of the deal, the latest indication of Amazon’s evolution from online bookseller to sprawling conglomerate, were not announced on Friday. But the Information reported earlier that Amazon would pay more than $1 billion U.S.

Autonomous vehicles have been a target of automakers, Silicon Valley giants and venture capital investors for years. But technical and regulatory hurdles have made getting self-driving cars and trucks on the road a longer slog than boosters had hoped.

Founded in 2014, Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. It aimed to not only build hardware and software capable of piloting cars, but to design autonomous taxis themselves.

The Foster City, Calif.-based startup wanted to build a fully driverless vehicle by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the board voted to oust Tim Kentley-Klay as CEO. He criticized the move, saying directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”

The company last year indicated it was seeking investors and potential strategic partners, a situation made more urgent by the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to layoffs that Zoox characterized as temporary.

In its statement, Amazon highlighted Zoox’s “ground-up vehicle” that “focuses on the ride-hailing customer.”

Despite its challenges, Zoox was one among a few independent companies working on credible autonomous vehicle technology, said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst. “Amazon is all of a sudden real close to being its own automaker,” he said.

The company could integrate future ride-hailing services into its Prime membership program, Ramsey added. And despite Amazon’s assertion that it was interested in Zoox because of its ambitions in ride-hailing — already a fiercely a contested market — Ramsey said Amazon would probably consider using the autonomous technology in delivery vehicles.

Bulking up in driverless technology represents an expansion of Amazon’s already sprawling interests in transportation and logistics. The company, which used to rely on delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to move packages from its warehouses to customers, in the last several years has invested heavily in its own capacity to move goods, acquiring planes, vans and long-haul trailers.

Seattle-based Amazon has also invested in delivery drones — though it didn’t meet the goal CEO Jeff Bezos set of having them flying packages to customers by 2018 — as well as sidewalk-crawling robots and autonomous carts.

Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in Aurora Innovation Inc., a self-driving startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot team. The company has also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker, and emerged as its biggest buyer, pledging to acquire 100,000 delivery vans designed in partnership with Amazon.

Read', 'Dan Healingthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Dan Healingthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"CALGARY - The engineering company hired to build the proposed Goldboro LNG export facility in Nova Scotia is withdrawing from an agreement to provide a fixed price contract for the job, developer Pieridae Energy Ltd. said Monday.

The Calgary-based company announced it has received written notice from Kellogg Brown & Root Ltd. that it is no longer prepared to enter into a lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for the project as agreed in March 2019, although it is willing to provide the services on other terms.

Pieridae is considering options including legal action in response, but has already had discussions with other firms willing to replace KBR, said CEO Alfred Sorensen.

“There are other reputable and experienced firms who have the expertise to provide these services, with some already indicating a willingness to replace KBR,” he said in a news release.

“We have had discussions with several of them to gauge their interest.”

In an emailed statement on Monday afternoon, KBR said it doesn’t comment on individual contracts but “will vigorously defend any accusation of breach of contract.”

In a report on Monday, analyst Darrell Bishop of Haywood Securities said the news represents a “fairly material setback” for the project because a fixed price contract is considered a “critical stage” before construction.

In May, Pieridae announced a delay until June 2021 to make a final decision on proceeding with the project to export liquefied natural gas from Canada’s East Coast, citing technical obstacles created by COVID-19.

Also in May, the Alberta Energy Regulator put Pieridae’s natural gas supply in question when it refused to transfer licences for production assets purchased from Shell Canada because the application would have split liabilities for cleaning up the sites, especially two gas-processing plants.

Shell and Pieridae are trying to work with the AER to win its approval.

Sorensen says the project is “solid”, however, with most of its key permits in hand, a 20-year contract with a German energy company to buy half of the LNG and a potential loan guarantee from the German government.

Read', 'Aleksandra Saganthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Aleksandra Saganthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"As pressure mounts for professional sports teams to shed racist or stereotypical names, experts believe the Canadian Football League’s Edmonton Eskimos will soon announce a name change.

On Monday, the National Football League’s Washington Redskins announced they would retire their name and logo after pressure from sponsors.

The last thing management wants is for people to be talking about the name of the team, said Marvin Ryder, an associate professor of marketing at McMaster University’s DeGroote School of Business.

“Anybody talking about the name of your team, rather than the performance of your team or the athletes on your team, that’s the wrong message. You want that to go away.”

When fans, players and sponsors start to say they feel uncomfortable with a name, a team starts to pay attention, he said.

Some sponsors of the Edmonton Eskimos also seemed uncomfortable with the CFL team’s name.

Insurance provider Belairdirect said last week it is rethinking its premier partnership with the team. A spokeswoman said the company “will need to see concrete action in the near future, including a commitment to a name change.”

Boston Pizza, another sponsor, said “as part of a larger shift in our overall marketing strategy, Boston Pizza recently ended its sponsorship of Edmonton’s CFL team.” It tweeted the statement as a response to someone asking about whether it plans to follow the lead of Belairdirect.

There are multiple reasons the issue is gaining public attention, said Ryder, noting many sports have been on a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Fans have been desperate to talk about something,” he said.

The Black Lives Matter movement has also generated momentum in the United States, he said, and prompted discussion on why teams hold on to racist or stereotypical names and mascots.

The police killing of George Floyd in America and the Black Lives Matter movement were catalysts, said Peter Cosentino, president of Toronto-based DEC Sports & Entertainment.

“It’s made people reflect and reconsider,” he said.

“The tide has certainly turned of late,” said Brian Levine, founder and president of Envison Sports & Entertainment, a Toronto-based company.

But, the decision to change a name can be long. The Edmonton team recently wrapped a three-year long review that resulted in a February announcement of its intention to keep the name after finding “no consensus.”

Under mounting pressure, the team promised to speed up a second review and provide an update at the end of July.

It’s a good sign that the CFL team started to examine its name years ago, said Levine.

“That means there’s genuine care and interest as opposed to just reflecting what’s happening and pressures, external pressures that could be new.”

The Edmonton name falls under a more nuanced area than that of Washington, he noted, meaning it may take more time to arrive at a decision as opinions in the community may vary. It’s important they speak to a wide range of voices in making their decision, he said, noting the most important stakeholder, in this case, is the community that’s affected by the name.

Both Levine and Ryder believe Edmonton will announce a name change as a result of the latest review. Cosentino said it’s hard to speculate on the matter.

Teams switch up their logos every five or so years to keep it fresh, but also to generate revenue, said Ryder. It can bring in millions of dollars as fans flock to purchase the latest iteration of a team’s jersey.

Typically, teams work closely with the sports league to change colours or logos on uniforms as the process can take 18 months to two years with uniforms being produced six to eight months ahead of a new season, said Cosentino.

But changing a name that’s been deemed offensive is a more sensitive matter than just sprucing up a logo, he said.

It’s unlikely any board room is considering these name changes as a way to sell more jerseys, said Levine, adding the logistical challenges may outweigh the pros in the short-term.

The process to decide on a new name and logo could take several months.

It includes qualitative and quantitative research, including focus groups or a contest, said Cosentino, as well as graphic representation, including colour selection.

The team will have to work with all licensees that produce goods with the team name and logo, he said, noting they’ll have to account for what materials licensees have access to when choosing a new colour scheme for the logo.

The team will also have to change signage and other materials used in the stadium.

“It’s an investment either way you look at it,” he said. “And it might not pay off in year one, but it will pay off dividends down the road.”

Due to the lengthy process, it’s likely Edmonton would announce the intention to change their name soon, but hold off on releasing a new name and rather say it will be in place by the start of the 2021 season, said Lindsay Rennie, also with DEC Sports & Entertainment.

“I don’t think they would be given the grace to have it stretched further than that.”

Optimism from Friday’s positive headlines about Gilead Sciences’s remdesivir carried over into Monday with news that the FDA granted fast-track designation to potential COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and a German company.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surpassed 10,800 for the first time on gains from various companies including Facebook, Apple and Amazon while Tesla shares surged about 16 per cent.

The S&P 500 briefly erased all losses for the year.

However, market rallies evaporated in afternoon trading as Tesla reversed course and sank 3.1 per cent while the big tech companies were at least 1.7 per cent lower.

“The early optimism has faded,” said Erik Bregar, head of currency strategy at the Exchange Bank of Canada.

The electric car company featured more prominently in currency markets than is normal unless the movements are big enough, he said in an interview.

“I can point to the U.S. dollar rallying as soon as Tesla started tanking.”

Also a factor in the afternoon selloff was a rise in infection rates in California that prompted the state’s governor to roll back most reopening measures, including a statewide shutdown of bars, cinemas and dine-in restaurants.

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 74.41 points at 15,639.41 after reaching an intraday high of 15,879.73.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 10.50 points at 26,085.80 more than 550 points from its earlier high. The S&P 500 index was down 29.82 points at 3,155.22 after surpassing 3,235, while the Nasdaq composite was down 226.60 points or 2.1 per cent at 10,390.84.

The Canadian dollar traded for 73.71 cents US compared with 73.56 cents US on Friday.

Technology was the biggest mover on the TSX, losing 2.5 per cent as Shopify Inc. and Lightspeed POS Inc. were down 6.2 and 5.5 per cent respectively while Blackberry Ltd. was off 3.3 per cent.

Energy dropped on lower crude oil and natural gas prices with Seven Generations Energy Ltd. down 5.3 per cent and MEG Energy Corp. off 4.4 per cent.

The August crude contract was down 45 cents at US$40.10 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was down 6.6 cents at US$1.74 per mmBTU.

Materials dipped slightly despite higher metals prices with Oceanagold Corp. 8.3 per cent lower.

The August gold contract was up US$12.20 at US$1,814.10 an ounce and the September copper contract was up 5.75 cents at nearly US$2.96 a pound.

Health care rose on strong gains from Aphria Inc. while the heavyweight financials sector climbed with Manulife Financial and the Toronto-Dominion Bank up 1.9 and 1.4 per cent respectively.

Monday’s trading comes before the start of quarterly earnings results with large U.S. banks.

The results are expected to be dismal because of the impact of COVID-19, but if companies beat expectations that could produce positive surprises, said Bregar.

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"OTTAWA - The federal government is for the second time extending its program to subsidize wages in companies hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, this time until at least December.

But the government is being warned it may have to move the end date into 2021.

The program is the heart of the Liberals’ promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the extension to give “greater certainty and support to businesses as we restart the economy.”

Trudeau didn’t say how the government will reshape the eligibility rules for the program that critics have said stop some employers from getting aid they need.

He promised more details in the coming days.

While some companies are back open with restrictions easing, other parts of the economy are still reeling from the effects of COVID-19.

Some sectors will only start up in the fall or even the winter and will need help into next year, said Ross Laver, senior vice-president for strategy at the Business Council of Canada. He pointed to airlines as one example where rehiring may be slow.

“I don’t think anybody expects that those industries that have been really hard-hit, that everything is going to be fine by Dec. 31,” he said.

“We need to bear in mind that some of them are going to need help for an extended period of time.”

The wage subsidy previously was to expire the first week of June but the Liberals announced an extension to the end of August in mid-May.

The government has yet to share eligibility requirements for July.

Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the extension would be welcomed by many small companies that have seen costs return faster than revenues.

He also pressed the need for eligibility rules to understand how to qualify.

“Not a single employer in Canada understands whether they qualify for the July wage subsidy and we’re in mid-July. So they need to do an awful lot better,” Kelly said.

“It sounds great to have an announcement to extend the subsidy, but businesses in order to use it really need to understand whether they would qualify and what the rules of the game are.”

The program covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits. Companies must show a 30-per-cent drop in revenues, a cliff that may discourage companies from growing, lest they find themselves suddenly cut off from federal aid.

“You don’t want people to think that you get over the threshold and then automatically lose” the subsidy, said Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Yussuff also said the extension would bring some stability to reopening phases, and likely bolster job gains seen over May and June.

Last week, Finance Minister Bill Morneau hinted at changes to revenue-reduction thresholds when he spoke about reducing “disincentives to growth” in the program.

Kelly said the government could consider a graduated approach with smaller subsidies at lower levels of revenue loss, or dropping the requirement altogether, either of which would give employers the confidence to rehire faster, Kelly said.

The Liberals originally saw the wage subsidy as the key tool in helping cushion the economic blow from COVID-19 by helping workers stay tied to their employers so businesses could get back to normal quickly once lockdowns lifted.

The pace of spending on the program has been below expectations, with $18 billion paid to 252,370 companies as of July 6.

Instead, the budget for the program dropped as more workers accessed the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for people who lost their jobs or nearly all their hours.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

The budget for that program is now at $80 billion, but it’s scheduled to end in the fall. Yussuff said the government needs to soon release details on how workers without jobs will transition to the employment insurance system, which was largely supplanted by the CERB.

The government’s fiscal and economic “snapshot” last week boosted the cost of the wage subsidy program to $82.3 billion from $45 billion, in a sign of impending changes.

Perrin Beatty, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said changes to the wage subsidy “must encourage Canadians to transition” off the CERB, and “create a positive incentive to return to work.”

The July 8 fiscal update noted that small employers make up the largest share of approved wage subsidy applications, with the largest numbers of employees covered in manufacturing, accommodation and food services.

The “snapshot” also said men may be “slightly more likely” to be covered than women although there aren’t firm numbers to rely on.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"It was all apologies Monday from two of the country’s highest-ranking politicians, who’ve been left reeling from widespread criticism that has zeroed in their on family ties to WE Charity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau came out within hours of each other on Monday to apologize for not recusing themselves from the decision to give the organization a major government contract.

The statements came after weeks of controversy following the Liberal government’s decision to award the charity a contract to deliver a $900-million program for student volunteers, even though Trudeau and his family have a long history with WE.

“The mistake that we made was on me and I take responsibility for it,” Trudeau told reporters Monday morning.

“Not only has it created unnecessary controversy and issues, it also means that young people who are facing a difficult time right now getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer.”

Trudeau has faced criticism for not recusing himself from the WE Charity decision since it was revealed earlier this month that WE’s for-profit corporation paid his mother and brother a combined $282,000 in speaking fees between 2016 and 2020.

For the Liberal government — which is facing an ethics investigation, charges of cronyism from the Opposition, a committee probe and waves of public scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic — the family ties don’t end there.

Morneau also took part in the decision-making process around the WE contract, even though his daughter was working for the organization.

In the summer of 2019, Morneau also announced that the government had given a $3 million grant to WE.

Morneau wasn’t available for an interview on Monday, but in an emailed statement to the Star, he acknowledged that he should not have taken part in the decision-making process.

“I did not recuse myself from the discussions on this topic and, given the fact that my daughter works for the organization in an unrelated branch, I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,” Morneau said.

“I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE.”

WE Charity was awarded the $19.5-million contract to administer the volunteer program in late June. The organization and the government later said they came to a mutual decision to cancel the deal amid accusations of ethics violations.

Trudeau now faces his third ethics investigation as prime minister.

During his Monday news conference, Trudeau said he was “very aware” that members of his family worked with WE but that he was “unaware of the details of the remuneration.”

He added that he would “look at any invitations” that come in to testify before a parliamentary finance committee. Trudeau said other ministers and officials will be testifying this week.

“In this situation, I should have recused myself. Canadians will make their judgments about what we were trying to do and what I should have done.”

Lori Turnbull, director of the School of Public Administration at Dalhousie University, called the apology a “low-risk strategy” for the prime minister.

“It’s kind of clever on his part, in the sense that he’s now able to pivot if he’s asked about it,” Turnbull said.

“He will be asked about it a lot and he’s able to say, ‘Yes, I took responsibility for that. I apologized and now let’s talk about something else.”

Calling the apology “guarded,” Turnbull noted that Trudeau didn’t say sorry for the actual decision, just “for the fact that he didn’t walk away from the table.

“It could be that people are quite angry about this, but it doesn’t end up showing up at the ballot box,” she said. “Or, it could be that this is the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”

Amidst the controversy, WE Charity took out full-page advertisements Monday in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail to apologize and answer “valid questions” about its involvement with the grant program.

“The past two weeks have been extremely difficult,” the ad read.

“The charity’s integrity and purpose has been called into question. It has had direct impacts on our staff, supporters and beneficiaries. We have made mistakes that we sincerely regret. It has led us to more closely examine our own internal structures, governance and organization.”

The ad was signed by Craig and Marc Kielburger, the charity’s co-founders. It suggested that the idea for WE to run the grant program originated with the public service, and that the charity did not “profit” from the original $19.5-million contract.

Perezbloomberg']",2020-07-13,"In a work-from-home world, hitting the local café for a daily caffeine fix has become a ritual of the now-forgotten past. And no matter how much kitchen brewing consumers take up, that just can’t seem to make up for the demand blow.

Global coffee consumption is set to fall this year for the first time since 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts. That’s even with a huge surge in bean buying at the grocery store amid pantry loading. Shutdowns for cafés and restaurants — which typically account for about 25 per cent of demand — were overwhelming, and it could be a while before things pick up again.

The disappearance of café culture is happening in every major region. Researcher Marex Spectron estimates globally more than 95 per cent of the out-of-home market was shuttered at some point during the pandemic. It’s the latest cruel twist of the coronavirus, which has ripped so much away from people that not even the simple pleasure of lingering over a latte is safe.

For Notes, a coffee-shop chain in London, restrictions are easing in the city, but most of its 10 cafés that cater to office workers remain closed.

“It will be a slow and staggered comeback for us as a lot of the offices in London are not coming back on until after summer, and some may even open only next year,” said co-founder Robert Robinson.

Consumers have shown they’re hesitant to dine out in droves again as economies reopen. Coffee shops, which often depend on morning commuters and afternoon breakers, have been especially hard hit. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. has lost much of its breakfast crowd during the coronavirus pandemic, while Starbucks Corp. is retooling its model, rolling out a “pickup” store format that doesn’t have any of the tables and chairs that traditionally made its cafés a popular hangout spot.

“If you feel like having a cappuccino, ordering it online doesn’t really work as coffee is all about the social aspect,” said Robinson.

A hobbled recovery for coffee demand could be devastating for the roughly 125 million globally that depend on the crop for their livelihood. Growers were already struggling through financial crisis after years of bumper harvests sparked a prolonged bear market. Citigroup Inc. predicts that futures for arabica beans could drop roughly 10 per cent in the second half of the year to about 90 cents a pound, hovering near break-even costs. Meanwhile the International Coffee Organization has warned of the dangers of child labour in producing regions as poverty increases for farmers.

Brazil’s Suplicy Cafes Especiais, one of the country’s largest café chains, was forced to postpone payments to farmers for cargoes that had already been delivered. Meanwhile, orders for new supplies will resume only gradually, chief executive officer Felipe Braga said in a telephone interview.

Suplicy operates 25 stores, the vast majority of which have been closed by COVID-19 restrictions since mid-March. A handful reopened recently amid easing lockdown restrictions, but then they were shuttered once again because not enough customers were coming through.

“Some of our franchising partners already warned us that they will close” permanently, Braga said.

Still, some shop operators are taking steps to change their business model, which could help spark some rebound.

Max Crowley’s two Bandit coffee shops in New York’s Midtown and Chelsea neighbourhoods remain “on pause,” hobbled by the closure of local offices. Meanwhile, he’s just opened up a new Hamptons location in the Town of Southampton, an enclave where many New York City dwellers fled to at the peak of the pandemic and where well-to-do residents spend summers.

“Manhattan traffic is still very light. The Hamptons is very busy. It makes sense for us. It’s where many of our customers go,” Crowley said.

There’s also some optimism the worst is over.

In Asia, the fastest-growing market for coffee, consumption at restaurants and cafés is expected to recover in the second half of the year as many countries emerge from lockdowns, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. And the USDA also predicts a rebound in global demand next year.

Still, a global second wave of infections could halt reopening plans. McDonald’s Corp. has said its pausing the resumption of all dine-in services in its U.S. restaurants as the virus flares up in areas across the country. And even if stores open, fears of contagion could continue to keep customers away. Starbucks is operating about 95 per cent of the company’s U.S. stores, but comparable sales were down 43 per cent in May.

Plus there’s the economic downturn, which generally spurs consumers to trim their dining out expenses.

The Dalgona coffee sensation — a fluffy, whipped beverage made from instant coffee that was popularized on social media — shows that consumers are trying to recreate the fun café experience at home instead. That could end up helping to rescue prices of robusta beans, used in instant varieties, to the detriment of pricier arabicas.

Robusta futures are down 13 per cent this year in London, while arabica beans slumped 25 per cent in New York.

“We believe that consumers will move down price points, and turn more to cheaper, instant coffee, as they tighten their belts amidst the gloomy economic outlook,” Taohai Lin, a consumer and retail analyst at Fitch Solutions. “Consumers will continue to embrace home brew and instant coffee, both because they will still avoid heading out to cafés, and also because it is generally a cheaper alternative.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Emily Flitterthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Emily Flitterthe New York Timesmon.']",2020-07-13,"On the last Friday of June, after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said that bars across the state would have to shut down a second time because coronavirus cases were skyrocketing, Mick Larkin decided he had had enough.

No matter that Larkin, an owner of a karaoke club in Wichita Falls, Texas, had just paid $1,000 (U.S.) for perishable goods and protective equipment in anticipation of the weekend rush. No matter that the frozen margarita machine was full, that 175 plastic syringes with booze-infused Jell-O were in place, or that there were masks for staff members and hand sanitizer for guests.

That day, June 26, Larkin and his partner dumped what they had just bought into the trash and decided to close their club, Krank It Karaoke, for good.

“We did everything we were supposed to do,” Larkin said. “When he shut us down again, and after I put out all that money to meet their rules, I just said ‘I can’t keep doing this.’”

It was harrowing enough for small businesses — the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, daycare centres and other storefronts that dot the streets and corners of every U.S. town and city — to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic.

But the resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent.

Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found. During the same period, permanent closures increased by three per cent overall, accounting for roughly 14 per cent of total closures since March.

Researchers at Harvard believe the rates of business closures are likely to be even higher. They estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners.

Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach. He added that it could take at up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses.

At the moment, 39 states continue to record growing numbers of new cases daily.

It is not clear how many of the businesses Yelp is tracking count as “small” — defined by the Small Business Administration as those with 500 or fewer employees. But the company found that, among the tracked businesses — which include restaurants, retailers and other independent, consumer-facing operations — retail businesses, led by beauty supply stores, have been closing at the highest rate since the pandemic began. Restaurants are the next hardest-hit group.

Small businesses account for 44 per cent of all U.S. economic activity, according to the SBA, and closures on such an immense scale could devastate the country’s economic growth. Collectively, such businesses are one of the largest employers in the country, said Satyam Khanna, a resident fellow at the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance at New York University School of Law who has written about the effects of the pandemic on small businesses.

So when small businesses close en masse, an entire sector of the economy suffers, Khanna said. There is lower cash flow, higher debt and more unemployment. “That leads to a big drag on the eventual recovery,” he said. “Because they are such an important source of jobs, losing them the way we are losing them now is going to make things far worse than they otherwise need to be.”

Because small businesses depend heavily on foot traffic and operate on thin margins, they are especially vulnerable to the ripple effects of a widespread shutdown.

For nearly two decades, Rich Tokheim and his wife sold sports memorabilia — hats, T-shirts, coffee mugs and other trinkets — to fans in Omaha, Neb., at their store, The Dugout. Since 2011, The Dugout has occupied prime real estate across the street from the city’s 24,000-seat baseball stadium, which usually hosts the College World Series each spring.

The 2020 World Series was cancelled in March. In the weeks that came after, other sporting events were scrapped — starting with college sports and extending to professional leagues that have struggled to relaunch their activities.

Tokheim, 58, watched his business fall off with growing unease, but it was only after a friendly chat with a retired college athletic director in May that the gravity of his situation hit home. He was already worried about the state of the virus in Nebraska and whether there was enough tracking. Then the athletic director predicted that if college football was really cancelled for the year, it would be the end of Division I sports as a whole.

“That really put me in overdrive,” Tokheim said. He negotiated an early exit on his store lease and announced a clearance sale at the store. The Dugout closed for good June 30.

The government’s Paycheck Protection Program, rolled out in April and administered by the SBA, earmarked $660 billion of aid for small businesses but stipulated that a loan would be forgiven only if most of it was used to pay employee wages for eight weeks. The rules were later relaxed, but in a sign of how many small-business owners did not feel confident that they would be on steady ground by the time repayment was due, roughly $130 billion of aid money remained untapped when the program ended in June.

Even for those who took a PPP loan, survival is no guarantee. Nick Muscari, a 38-year-old restaurateur in Lubbock, Texas, availed of one of these loans. His restaurant, Nick’s Sports Grill and Lounge, had been the culmination of Muscari’s life’s work — his years of toil as a waiter, pizza cook and manager at restaurants and bars beginning in his teenage years. Three years ago, he bought out the two partners who helped him start the restaurant in 2010. He considered it a crowning achievement, but to do so, he had to borrow money. He still owes a bank $80,000.

Muscari tried to ride out the spring lockdown that temporarily shuttered his restaurant with the help of the PPP money. But when the state’s second closure order took effect June 26, he decided to close for good.

“It had been in the back of our minds, just like, you know, if this happens again, can we make it?” Muscari said. “We were following all the rules, and people were spread out. We never had anybody catch the virus in our establishment.”

Muscari, with the business closed and its 30 employees jobless, has nothing left but his house and his car. He also expects his landlord to try to sue him for the eight years’ worth of rent he is contracted to pay on his defunct restaurant’s space.

Many small businesses are also finding it onerous keep up with constantly changing local guidelines, while others are deciding that no matter what their local officials say, it just is not safe to keep going.

Gabriel Gordon, owner of a tiny but popular barbecue restaurant in Seal Beach, Calif., decided to close permanently after studying the restaurant’s layout. He had determined that the kitchen would never be safe for multiple staff members to occupy at once while the virus was still active in the area.

“It’s essentially two hallways that are 11 feet wide,” Gordon said, describing the shape of the restaurant, Beachwood BBQ. “There are food trucks that are larger than my kitchen.”

Whatever the specific reasons may be for each closure, Justin Norman, Yelp’s vice-president of data science, said that the federal government should offer small businesses more help. Norman said Yelp was concerned about the effects of small-business closures, especially those owned by people of colour, on society. Yelp, however, also has a financial interest in maintaining a robust small business environment, because it relies heavily on advertising by businesses on its platform.

“The time is right now to inject more capital, or we may lose them forever,” Norman said.

“It’s going to make our economies worse; it’s going to make our communities worse.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To its credit, when it officially reopened its Magic Kingdom on Saturday, Walt Disney World went beyond a policy to “recommend and encourage” the face coverings as fellow Florida theme park Legoland has. They were mandatory for all guests 2 and over.

Even so, the decision to reopen the park highlights some stark international differences. On Sunday, Florida reported 15,300 new cases of Covid-19—a daily record for any state. On Monday, Hong Kong reported a multi-month high of 52, prompting its own Disneyland to close again. Note that it is no small city, with a population of around 7.5 million.

Those visiting Hong Kong Disneyland almost certainly came with their own masks, as they are nearly ubiquitous there. Many Americans eschew them and may not have had one when they showed up at the Orlando theme park. Disney World helpfully installed vending machines selling plain ones for $2 each at its gates—a sensible move and a fair price.

But Disney wouldn’t be Disney if it didn’t see a merchandising opportunity too. It will sell you a four pack of cloth masks depicting characters such as Mickey Mouse for $19.99.

The company’s shares jumped 13% Monday to $1,744.11 (U.S.) and have more than quadrupled in value in 2020. The stock has climbed in nine of the past 10 sessions, rising nearly 30% in the past three trading days alone.

In comparison, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are sitting on small losses this year and the U.S. economy has entered a recession as the pandemic put a halt to business activity around the country.

How big has Tesla gotten? Tesla’s recent surge puts its market value of roughly $321 billion above that of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest bank in America; Procter & Gamble Co., and UnitedHealth Group Inc. The electric-car maker is also bigger than Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. combined, according to FactSet data.

The rally has been driven in part by optimism surrounding the company’s coming earnings report on July 22. Some investors are expecting the car maker to deliver a surprise profit. That would make the company eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index, potentially driving even more activity around its shares. At least $1.6 trillion of mutual and exchange-traded funds track the index, according to Morningstar Direct data. A company must report an accumulated profit over four consecutive quarters to be included in the index. Tesla’s profits over the past three quarters have marked its longest run of profitability so far.

If it were in the S&P 500, it would be the 10th-biggest company in the index, slightly behind Walmart, whose market value is about $374 billion.

The rally is a remarkable feat for one of the most hotly debated stocks in the market. Equally passionate bulls and bears have pounced on Tesla—buying its shares or shorting the stock in a wager that the shares will tumble. The shares’ rapid ascent has evoked memories of the 1990s tech bubble for some investors. Others compare Tesla to a technology company such as Apple Inc. that is sure to change the world.

So far, the bulls are winning.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"OTTAWA - Statistics Canada says Canadians’ buying patterns changed so much during the COVID-19 pandemic that its measure of consumer inflation went a little wobbly.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don’t weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need “to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact” on year-over-year headline numbers.

The research was aided by data from the Bank of Canada, which targets an annual inflation rate of two per cent as measured by Statistics Canada’s consumer price index.

The bank has warned that the economic shock wrought by COVID-19 and structurally low interest rates is having a deep effect on the inflation rate, which is far below the target.

The basket of goods used to form the consumer price index has been shaken by a shift in consumer spending habits during the pandemic.

People are buying less gasoline, which usually receives a heavier weight in calculating inflation, as its price has plunged and the frequency of car travel has dropped. Canadians are travelling much less, while grocery-buying is up.

Statistics Canada is to report June’s inflation rate next week.

The Bank of Canada said in April that it expected inflation to be close to zero in the second quarter.

Beyond the end of June, the bank was less clear, citing the high level of uncertainty around the course of the pandemic.

The federal government’s economic “snapshot” last week pegged inflation at 0.5 per cent for this year, then rising back to two per cent in 2021.

The reading was based on the average of forecasts from 13 private sector economists.

On Wednesday, the central bank will release its updated outlook. Governor Tiff Macklem has described what’s coming as a “central planning scenario” for the economy and inflation, as well as related risks — such as local, but not national, lockdowns.

Read', 'Ilya Banaresbloomberg', 'Ilya Banaresbloombergmon.']",2020-07-13,"Canadian consumers are changing their banking habits to reduce physical contact with others because of COVID-19, according to a new study by McKinsey & Co.

The survey, which polled about 1,000 people in Canada, found that 26 per cent of respondents have increased their use of contactless payments and 42 per cent have decreased their use of cash.

In the U.S., only 22 per cent reduced their use of cash, McKinsey found. The survey was taken in June and asked consumers about changes they made in the previous month.

“Canadians, more than people from other countries, are looking to reinvent how they will pay,” Miklos Dietz, a senior partner at McKinsey, said in an interview. Examples of contactless payment include paying bills online, ordering pizza via delivery apps or tapping a debit card on a payment machine at the supermarket instead of using cash.

“Financial institutions need to put payment strategy quite high on their strategic agenda because the shaping of the future of the Canadian economy will be heavily influenced by what’s happening with payments in the next year or so,” Dietz said.

Online services

This digital transition may be here to stay. According to McKinsey, 16 per cent of respondents say they will use online banking services more even after the COVID-19 crisis is over, and 23 per cent say they will visit branches less often for transactions.

The latter number is higher than in France, Germany and the U.S., where between 13 per cent and 17 per cent said they’ll use branches less often after the pandemic.

The survey also showed that people wanted help from banks through the economic uncertainty. Half of Canadians want financial institutions to waive late fees on credit card and loan payments and 42 per cent want them to reduce minimum credit card payments.

As such, less mainstream banking options may appear more attractive for customers, Dietz said. “I would expect new ideas coming from all financial institutions,” he said. “I think this is an unusually good opportunity for smaller financial players, credit unions, to be ahead of the curve.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Brett Pulleybloomberg']",2020-07-13,"PepsiCo Inc. reported a stronger-than-expected spring as homebound consumers looking for comfort stocked up on snack foods — and its current-quarter forecast was even more bullish.

As COVID-19 raged across the U.S., Americans seeking out familiar flavours filled their shelves with salty, crunchy treats, driving double-digit sales growth for brands like Tostitos, Fritos and Cheetos. Even newer snacks like fruit-chips line Bare and Off The Eaten Path, a maker of black bean and chickpea crisps, saw double-digit growth. Beverage sales were one key weakness, as both in-restaurant and grab-and-go gas station sales lagged during the lockdowns.

“Consumer eating habits continue to evolve with consumers spending more time at home, which benefits the at-home breakfast, snacking and dinner occasions,” chief executive officer Ramon Laguarta said in pre-recorded remarks about the second quarter.

PepsiCo shares rose 2.3 per cent at 11:30 a.m. in New York after an earlier gain of as much as 2.7 per cent. The stock was little changed this year through Friday.

As one of the first big packaged-food companies reporting results for the spring months, PepsiCo is being closely watched by investors for a look at how consumers are responding to 2020’s upheaval. The company is well-positioned because of its high global share of the market for snack foods, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

And snack foods, it seems, carried the North American consumer through a difficult quarter. Ruffles potato chip brand saw high-single-digit growth, while oatmeal line Quaker’s organic revenue spiked 23 per cent in the quarter. The snack and beverage giant sees the trend toward more breakfast meals at home remaining strong after the pandemic subsides, and the company said it has marketing plans to retain any new Quaker customers it picked up during the quarantines.

With an increase in online grocery shopping, PepsiCo said its 5-year-old e-commerce business is projected to have $3 billion (U.S.) in sales this year, up from about $2 billion last year. While it’s not yet clear how much of the gains will be sustainable, chief financial officer Hugh Johnston said on a call with analysts “we’re prepared for it to stay large.”

Other packaged-food companies have been pummeled by Wall Street after reporting strong spring quarters, since investors didn’t see signs they could hold onto the gains. But PepsiCo says it’s optimistic it can capitalize on these new buying habits.

In fact, after reporting a 0.3 per cent slide in the latest period for organic revenue, a closely watched indicator of growth, the owner of the Mountain Dew and Doritos brands said that metric will turn positive in the current quarter, predicting a low-single-digit boost. The company said it still won’t make an outlook for 2020.

“As we look ahead for North America, we expect our overall business to perform well, assuming there is no large-scale disruption in economic activity or population mobility as a result of the recent surge in COVID-19 infections in many markets,” Laguarta said. “With this in mind, we expect our snacks and food businesses to remain resilient, albeit with some moderation in growth while our beverage businesses should deliver better performance during the second half of this year.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Simon Clarkthe Wall Street Journal', 'The Wall Street Journal']",2020-07-13,"The Black Lives Matter movement is reinvigorating a yearslong campaign to push some of London’s oldest financial institutions to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves.

City of London companies played an important role for centuries in organizing and funding the trans-Atlantic passage of African slaves and the Caribbean and American plantations where they were forced to work. Directors of the companies earned fortunes from the trade. The Bank of England, Barclays PLC and Lloyd’s of London insurance market are among those to apologize for or acknowledge links to slavery since the May killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis prompted protests world-wide.

“Britain was the most efficient and profitable slave trader in terms of return on capital largely because of the role of the City of London in providing cheaper finance, better insurance rates, better reinsurance rates and, critically, funding the construction of the shipping industry,” Hilary Beckles, chairman of a reparations commission representing Jamaica, Barbados and 10 other Caribbean nations, said in an interview.

Mr. Floyd’s death has sparked renewed calls from Caribbean governments and from Black British campaigners descended from slaves for British companies to pay reparations. They say apologizing isn’t enough and are calling for more discussion about reparations. Companies are so far resisting those calls, choosing to focus on improving workplace diversity.

On July 6, the Caricom Reparations Commission, chaired by Mr. Beckles, called for British companies to participate in a summit to discuss how they can contribute to the Caribbean.

“The City of London as we know it now would not have been without the slave trade,” Mr. Beckles said. “We are calling for a dialogue in which we say from our point of view this is what we think would be an appropriate attempt at remedy. In the case of the financial institutions of London we are looking for a development strategy.”

The City of London Corp., a centuries-old council which manages the financial district, declined to comment on whether it would participate in a reparations summit, as did spokesmen for the Bank of England, Barclays, Lloyd’s of London, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Lloyds Banking Group PLC and law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Farrer & Co. They have all acknowledged historic links to slavery.

British politicians have long resisted discussions on the issue. Speaking to Jamaica’s Parliament in 2015 on the most-recent official Caribbean visit by a prime minister, David Cameron emphasized Britain’s role in ending the slave trade. “I do hope that, as friends who have gone through so much together since those darkest of times, we can move on from this painful legacy,” Mr. Cameron said.

“Finance could be the best healer,” Darrel Blake, a former banker who leads a slave-trade money trail tour through London’s financial district, said on a June 20 tour.

The Bank of England said it wasn’t directly involved in the slave trade but “is aware of some inexcusable connections involving former governors and directors and apologizes for them,” a spokeswoman said.

Lloyd’s of London, the insurance market founded in the 1680s, said it was sorry for its role in the trade.

“This was an appalling and shameful period of British history, as well as our own, and we condemn the indefensible wrongdoing that occurred during this period,” a spokesman said.

A Barclays spokesman said the bank is “committed to do more to further foster our culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity, for our colleagues, and the customers and clients we serve.”

Mr. Beckles said commitments to improve diversity are a public-relations stunt. “That is not a sincere effort to participate in reparatory justice,” he said. “We are talking about the damage and the harm done to millions of people and the death of millions of people.”

Last year he brokered a £20 million ($25 million U.S.) reparations agreement with Scotland’s University of Glasgow, which benefited from slavery. The university is raising the money mainly through grants and donations to work with the University of the West Indies on research projects to improve health care and economic development in the Caribbean. The agreement is a model for companies to follow but no such conversations have started, Mr. Beckles said.

“We are happy to share our experience,” David Duncan, the University of Glasgow’s chief operating officer, said in an interview.

That agreement has set a precedent that makes companies wary, said Malik Al Nasir, a British citizen who has researched his family history and found he’s descended from slaves and slave traders in Guyana.

“Companies know that there is liability here,” Mr. Al Nasir said in an interview. He wants the United Nations to lead a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate and quantify slavery reparations. U.K. lawmaker Layla Moran has written to companies with links to slavery and asked them to do more.

Calls for reparations for slavery are also increasing in the U.S. in the wake of Mr. Floyd’s killing, according to Ana Lucia Araujo, a Howard University professor who studies slavery. A bill embracing the idea was first introduced in Congress in 1989 but the issue of reparations has languished for decades.

The British government abolished slavery in the 1830s, paying £20 million—the equivalent of billions of dollars today—to compensate slave owners because they were deemed to have lost property. Beneficiaries are listed on a University College London website.

The government finished repaying debt used to fund the compensation payments in 2015. Compensating slave owners was unjust according to Mr. Blake, whose ancestors, like those of Mr. Beckles, were slaves.

“My taxes have gone back to the government to replace the money that was given to the slave masters that owned my family,” said Mr. Blake, who worked at Barclays and HSBC Holdings PLC before becoming a teacher. “How ridiculous is that?”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The satellite-radio giant’s foray into the rapidly growing podcasting industry follows similar moves by media and technology companies, including Spotify Technology SA and iHeartMedia Inc. Sirius said it could pay up to $60 million more if Stitcher achieves certain financial metrics in 2020 and 2021.

The Wall Street Journal last week reported that the two companies were nearing a deal.

Sirius said the transaction, expected to close in the third quarter, would enable it to reach more than 150 million listeners.

“With Stitcher, we will expand our digital audio advertising presence and look to generate new ways for creators to find and connect with their audiences,” Sirius Chief Executive Jim Meyer said.

Stitcher runs a free podcast listening app and a premium $4.99 monthly service that lets subscribers listen to podcasts without ads. It owns podcast networks such as Earwolf, Stitcher Originals and Witness Docs, and its shows include “Freakonomics Radio,” “SuperSoul Sunday from The Oprah Winfrey Network” and “Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend.” With outside networks and shows, Stitcher distributes and sells advertising for more than 250 podcasts through its Midroll media advertising unit.

Sirius generates most of its revenue from subscriptions to its satellite-radio service but in 2018 agreed to buy internet-radio streaming company Pandora Media Inc. for $3 billion—adding a business more reliant on advertising and with podcast aspirations of its own to its lineup.

Without children in school five days a week, someone has to care for them, and working full-time while simultaneously caring for children is simply not possible — even when working remotely is an option.

Schools in most of Quebec have been open since May, while those in B.C, Manitoba and P.E.I. have partially reopened. The remaining provinces and territories plan on having students return to the classroom in the fall, though details have not been finalized. School boards are mulling scenarios such as alternating days or weeks with smaller class sizes or continued at-home learning.

The result is a significant number of workers who feel they have little choice but to leave the workforce until a semblance of stability is restored.

According to Statistics Canada’s June Labour Force Survey,the employment recovery has been “slowest for mothers with school-aged children,” with employment rising 5.2 per cent for women and 6.4 per cent for men with children younger than six. For mothers of children ages six to 17, however, women’s employment remains below pre-pandemic levels, and women with children are more likely to be working less than half their usual hours.

Pretty has kids of her own, but she says she can’t take leave as people depend on her for their wages. She’s considering enrolling her children in private school in Orillia, Ont. in the hopes they would have smaller class sizes and a safer environment. And she isn’t alone.

“I know lots of people considering taking a leave of absence,” says Pretty. “I know someone who sold a second business. I know teachers who are considering leaves of absence — they have little people at home.”

Susan Prentice, a sociology professor at the University of Manitoba who studies childcare policy, says the current situation will cause “unfathomably tough problems” for families to figure out.

“For any household that has children, a school closing is a make-or-break factor for family decision making,” says Prentice. “Women trying to do homeschooling by day and trying to do their own work at night — in the end, they manage it at the expense of their own health, by sleeping very little. You can get through a short-term period like this, but it’s not sustainable over months or semesters.”

Experts say there simply aren’t enough daycare spots to accommodate the number of school age children who may find themselves without a caregiver if parents return to work. Monica Lysack, a professor of early childhood leadership at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. says that even in the best of times, Canada only has space in licensed childcare facilities for less than 30 per cent of kids.

“Imagine being told your business could open up only at half capacity, and you have to keep going with all the same expenses,” says Lysack of childcare centres in the pandemic.

“That means parents are going to have to pay double fees, for already astronomically priced childcare ... And where are the other 50 per cent of children going to go?”

For many families, having two working parents is not optional. Prentice says that families have been able to offset flat wages in the Canadian economy through the contributions of working mothers.

“This discussion of dual earners, or 1.5 earners as we sometimes call part-time work, it’s really mothers,” says Prentice. “When children are in school, this is when mothers’ labour force participation rate jumps to its highest.”

“If [schools] open on some crazy extraordinary schedule, like two days one week, three days the next week, this will play havoc with the ability of mothers and fathers to keep their jobs. It will play havoc on children. And it immediately has huge, huge economic and social consequences,” says Prentice.

Pretty says that among the concerns she’s hearing from her employees and clients, the return to school is the most pressing.

Read', 'Angus Whitleybloomberg', 'Angus Whitleybloombergmon.']",2020-07-13,"Facebook and Google have for years operated like shop windows for news stories, plying their billions of visitors with free snippets and information from articles across the web. An antitrust tussle that’s coming to a head in Australia is set to change that.

Australia’s competition regulator will this month publish draft rules forcing the two U.S. tech giants to share revenue generated from news with the original publishers, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. A final version of the code, the first of its kind in the world, is due to follow soon after.

Between them, Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have a dominant position in the online advertising market and that has been under intensifying regulatory and political assault in the U.S. and Europe, with Australia now adding another front of attack.

Investors are sitting up, too. Should watchdogs in other markets follow Australia, it would chip away at two of the most wildly successful business models of the 21st century, built largely on content free-for-alls. Facebook and Alphabet have combined market values in New York of about $1.7 trillion (U.S.)

“This would be a major shot across the bow from a regulatory perspective,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in New York. “It could open up a Pandora’s box around monetization and sharing of data.”

‘This one matters’

In an interview, Australian Competition & Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims said he knows of several counterparts overseas who are considering taking similar steps. With traditional media hemorrhaging jobs and facing an assault from populist politicians alleging fake news, the 69-year-old is swinging the pendulum back in the publishers’ favour. To Sims, it’s about more than simply forcing businesses on his beat to play fair.

“This one matters because journalism matters,” he said. “The fourth estate is such a fundamental part of what makes our societies work.”

Traditional media companies have long complained their content is being exploited by digital platforms without due compensation. But that’s only part of the picture.

While platforms and publishers all compete for web clicks and eyeballs that can be turned into advertising revenue, they’re also allies of sorts. News stories, or even just links to them, are part of the appeal of Facebook and Google, helping them keep visitors engaged and vacuum up more data. The tech giants, in turn, direct traffic back to the publishers’ websites.

‘Fundamentally incorrect’

The nature of this relationship is central to the crackdown by Australia’s competition watchdog. “There’s no doubt the net value flow is to the platforms,” said Sims. Facebook has called such an assumption “fundamentally incorrect.”

In a 58-page submission to the ACCC last month, Facebook described news as “highly substitutable” content. Even a complete purge of stories in Australia, Facebook said, would make little difference. “News does not drive significant long-term commercial value for our business,” it said.

Australian news organizations, meanwhile, garnered 2.3 billion clicks from Facebook’s newsfeed between January and May 2020, Facebook said.

At Google, only a “very small” direct and indirect economic value comes from news in Google Search, Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said in a May blog post. Meanwhile, Google Search accounted for 3.44 billion visits to Australian news publishers for free in 2018, she wrote.

Amid the dispute, it’s not clear what the code will cost the tech giants in Australia. That’s partly because in between the baby pictures and community group posts on Facebook, it’s almost impossible to quantify the subjective appeal of news. “I would say #goodluckregulators,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst at New York-based research firm LightShed Partners, said in an email. “I have no idea how they will determine the value.”

Turning tide

Even Sims warns it will be “extremely hard,” but says “there are always ways to put numbers around things.” And in recent months, publishers appear to have gained ground in the argument.

In April, France’s antitrust regulator ordered Google to pay media companies to display snippets of articles. Then in June, Google said it would pay certain media outlets it will feature in a yet-to-be-released news service in Germany, Australia and Brazil. Terms weren’t disclosed.

Perhaps most significantly, Facebook late last year introduced a separate news section, paying the publishers whose stories were featured. Some 200 publishers were involved in the Facebook News service, some of them receiving between $1 million and $3 million a year to put articles in the section.

The ACCC’s mandatory code goes further: the watchdog’s concepts paper raised the possibility of collective media boycotts of Facebook and Google in the absence of “appropriate remuneration.”

In a statement, Google said it has “worked closely and constructively with news media businesses, the ACCC and the government as part of this process and will continue to do so.”

Facebook “will continue to work closely with news organizations, the ACCC and the Australian government to sustain a strong news ecosystem,” said Mia Garlick, the company’s director of policy for Australia and New Zealand. But she said: “A regulatory approach that lumps two tech companies together and benefits only the most powerful publishers does not do that.”

Sims says he’s skeptical of Facebook’s argument that news delivers little economic value, and expects his code to start balancing the equation.

“I’m not contemplating failure,” Sims said.

Read', 'Esha Deybloomberg', 'Esha Deybloombergmon.']",2020-07-13,"Tesla Inc.’s relentless surge continued Monday ahead of several events that include the possible unveiling of new battery technology, entry into a lucrative new market for the electric vehicle maker and the stock’s potential addition to the prestigious S&P 500 Index.

The incredible rally in the stock has left Wall Street analysts struggling to make sense of the sky-high valuation — which soared past that of Toyota Motor Corp. earlier this month and topped $320 billion (U.S.) on Monday. Tesla shares are up about fourfold just this year, despite a steep pandemic-related sell-off in February and March.

Although Tesla had kicked off this year with a strong run, its ascent has been turbocharged after reporting better-than-expected delivery numbers earlier this month, leading many to say the company may be poised to report a profit for the second quarter. Profitability is good news in itself, but in the case of Tesla, this would also mark the fourth consecutive quarter of profit, a milestone it needs to achieve to be considered for inclusion in the S&P 500.

At the current price, Tesla’s stock reflects an expectation of 2030 volume of 5 million units, which is more than ten times what the company appears on track to achieve this year, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. “We’re not saying these are assumptions that are not possible, but they are a very big leap ahead from what the company has proven to date,” the analyst wrote in a note. Jonas has a sell-equivalent rating on Tesla, with a price target of $740.

Tesla jumped as much as 16 per cent to $1,794.99 on Monday, the biggest intraday gain since March 24.

Good news abounds

Tesla late Friday said its much-anticipated “Battery Day” event will be held on Sept. 22, at its Fremont, California, factory. According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, the automaker could announce a number of “game changing” battery developments at the event.

“The technology innovations around Fremont remain the key ingredients in Tesla’s success on the battery front and we believe the company is getting closer to announcing the million-mile battery,” Ives wrote in a note to clients. Ives expects the new battery to potentially last for decades, as well as withstand all types of weather and terrain.

Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, one of the more skeptical analysts on the Street, upgraded his rating on Tesla to the equivalent of a hold from sell, saying the company is well down the path of preparing to enter the Indian market, where the analyst sees China-like potential. “We expect tangible evidence by the end of 2020, with sales in India starting as soon as 2021,” Irwin said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal will help AMC stay in business while it tries to ride out the coronavirus pandemic, which forced it to temporarily close its theaters. The company would get $300 million (U.S.) in fresh funds, and debt would be reduced by about $460 million to $630 million, AMC said in a statement, elaborating on a deal disclosed last week.

The theater chain also has a deal to restructure $600 million of convertible notes issued in 2018 to Silver Lake, which has agreed buy an additional $100 million of new first lien notes at a discount. The plan has support from investors who hold 73 per cent of the principal of existing notes.

The financing round, which the company announced in a statement, confirmed a Bloomberg report last month and bumps up UiPath’s valuation significantly from $7 billion last year.

All the remote work done during the pandemic has increased the need for automation, chief executive officer Daniel Dines said in a statement.

The company said it is now speeding up its plans for an initial public offering in light of COVID-19.

“We were thinking of IPOing at the end of 2021 or during 2022, but COVID-19 has accelerated our plans,” Allison Webster, a spokesperson for UiPath, said.

COVID-19 has heightened the critical need of automation to address challenges and create value in days and weeks, not months and years.

The New York-based company raised $225 million in a round led by hedge fund Alkeon Capital, with participation from venture capital firm Accel, Sequoia Capital, Coatue Management, Tiger Global Management LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd. and others. It has now raised than $1.2 billion to date, the company said.

chief executive officer Daniel Dines said in a statement the company would use the proceeds to grow and meet consumer demand.

The company said it has over $400 million in annual recurring revenue, a metric that measures its predictable revenue from subscriptions and returning customers.

Investors are enthusiastic about UiPath because of its strong revenue growth, said Carl Eschenbach, a UiPath board member and partner at Sequoia Capital. Changes in the global business climate this year have been a boon for UiPath.

“We think the whole pandemic that we’re facing as a world has accelerated the use of automation as people look to automate more of their processes as they’ve done in the past,” Eschenbach said.

UiPath works with a range of businesses to create efficiencies by reducing mundane tasks. It helps banks with loan processing and hospitals with data entry. Sometimes this results in the elimination of low-skilled jobs.

The mine, one of North America’s largest gold producers, milled more than 60,000 tonnes per day of ore in both May and June, partially offsetting the down time and ramp-up in production that began April 15 after the province allowed work to resume.

Yamana estimates its total gold production for the second quarter was 164,141 ounces, including Canadian Malartic and its four South American mines. Silver production was estimated at about two million ounces.

Yamana says all of the mines exceeded planned production targets in the second quarter and it continues to expect more production, improved costs and significant cash flows in the second half of 2020.

The Toronto-based company has a 50 per cent ownership stake in Canadian Malartic, with the other half owned by Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.

Yamana shares have gained about 30 per cent since mid-April, when Canadian Malartic began to resume operations. Agnico Eagle shares are about 29 per cent over the same period.

Read', 'Shelly Haganbloomberg', 'Shelly Haganbloombergmon.']",2020-07-13,"Canadian consumer confidence stalled last week for the first time in almost three months.

The Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index, a weekly composite measure of financial health and economic expectations, was largely unchanged at 46.1 last week, from 46.2 a week earlier. That ends a 10-week streak of gains.

The data could stoke concerns Canada’s recovery is slowing after a strong initial bounce back amid reopenings across the country. Policy-makers and economists have warned that repairing the damage from the COVID-19 lockdowns will be a prolonged and uneven process, with consumer sentiment plateauing well below pre-pandemic levels and households remaining cautious for some time.

The latest Nanos reading is in line with other indicators that point to a full recovery from the pandemic being a long way off. Last week, Statistics Canada data showed the labour market partially recovered in June, but that 60 per cent of jobs lost during the pandemic are still yet to be recouped.

Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 responses.

Survey highlights

Canadians’ perceptions of their personal finances remain gloomy. Only 13 per cent of respondents report being better off financially over the past year, close to all-time lows. About 37 per cent say their finances have worsened. That’s well above pre-pandemic levels, but down from 42 per cent in April.

Canadians are suddenly getting more pessimistic about the recovery. About 57 per cent of Canadians believe the economy will worsen over the next six months. That’s up from 53 per cent two weeks ago, but still well below the 80 per cent in April.

About 16 per cent of Canadians say they feel insecure or somewhat insecure about their employment, up from 15 per cent a week earlier. While that’s down about 10 percentage points from April, the improving trend in recent week for this gauge seems to have come to an end.

Real estate is the one area where positive sentiment is accelerating. The share of Canadians who anticipate price increases has doubled since May, to 21 per cent, and there are fewer respondents worried about falling property values. Still, sentiment is well below pre-pandemic levels.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does the news and information you give your time to daily reflect your lived experience and the concerns of your community?

I wish I did not have to ask these questions. Unfortunately, the reality is that although it is 2019, Canadian media still too often miss the mark in representing the diverse communities we report on and for. Study after study in recent decades tell us that women, Indigenous people and persons of colour are underrepresented both in media coverage and in the newsrooms of our nation.

I am of two minds in telling you that the Star is taking steps within its newsroom to aim to better reflect the diversity of our community. On one hand, I am disheartened that this is still an issue, one I have been following closely for some 30 years; on the other hand, I am encouraged at the seriousness of the Star newsroom’s new efforts to broaden the voices in the news.

A newsroom-wide project we’ve dubbed “Mirrored in Media” launched last month with the goal of increasing the number of women quoted in the Star to 50 per cent — a significant increase from the 25-30 per cent reported through our own and outside tracking. This initiative also aims to increase the number of people of colour quoted in the Star with the goal of establishing a benchmark and creating far greater inclusivity in news coverage.

A newsroom task force of more than a dozen journalists (of which I am part) is working with senior editor Julie Carl, who is leading this initiative at the behest of editor Irene Gentle. Both of these journalists believe passionately in the need for more inclusive coverage of our community and aspire to create a newsroom that mirrors the diverse Canada of 2019.

This is a vital matter of reader trust and engagement. Indeed, one of the eight “indicators of trust” established by the global Trust Project of which the Star is a participant, is a commitment to diverse voices and perspectives.

“If readers see themselves on our pages, they are more likely to trust us and therefore read us,” Carl said in a news release announcing this initiative, which includes ongoing daily tracking of all sources quoted in the work produced by Star journalists and freelancers and all photos published in the Star.

This initiative is part of a global effort launched by an organization called United for News, in connection with the World Economic Forum. Through this project, participating newsrooms around the world have committed to take steps to increase the voices of women in the news to 50 per cent. This has long been a goal of Canada’s own Informed Opinions, a non-profit organization that works with Canadian newsrooms to amplify women’s voices to achieve gender balance in media by 2025. (Full disclosure: I am a member of the board of Informed Opinions.)

In signing on to the United for News challenge to monitor and increase the voices of women in the news, Gentle made clear that that does not go far enough for the Star. In this community, in this newsroom, she insisted, we must make equally strong efforts to increase our inclusion of diverse voices.

I am optimistic the Star might finally achieve some success on these important goals. Across the newsroom, many reporters are now tracking their own sources and looking to databases of diverse sources to help broaden the voices in their news reports. Shari Graydon, founder of Informed Opinions, recently conducted two workshops in the Star’s newsrooms to introduce our journalists to the organization’s “ExpertWomen” database of women across Canada who are prepared to speak to the media about their subjects of expertise.

I have long believed that the everyday decisions and choices of Star journalists made in reporting and presenting stories, opinions, photos and other news and information are the foundation of greater inclusivity in the Star’s coverage. To me, this is the key to success in this critical initiative.

And clearly, many reporters are taking this to heart: “It’s been interesting to track the results — it definitely makes me think about some of the ways I find sources for my own reporting and who I talk to,” said reporter Sherina Harris, who is working with Carl on the daily tracking efforts.

On this day to celebrate Canada, it is indeed well past time that all Canadians can see themselves mirrored in media.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Digital News Report, an international survey done by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, provides some good news — and of course, some not-so-good news too — about Canadians and their trust and engagement with the news.

The topline: While Canadians’ overall trust in news has dropped 6 percentage points in the past year, Canadians still rank fifth of 38 countries for media trust, with 52 per cent trusting in Canadian news overall and 59 per cent trusting the news they use.

Across all countries surveyed, the average level of trust in the news in general is down 2 percentage points to 42 per cent and less than half (49 per cent) trust the news media they themselves use. Trust in news reached via social media is lower still both in Canada and overall.

Canadians report a more positive view of our news media and its mission than those in most other countries around the world. A majority of the 2,055 Canadians who participated in the detailed survey conducted Jan. 17-Feb. 18, believe news organizations in Canada keep them up to date, (70 per cent); help them understand the news (60 per cent); and fulfil the journalistic watchdog role of monitoring powerful people (49 per cent).

Further, the report tells us, these positive assessments of the news may well be linked to higher trust in the news.

“Put simply, we find that people are more likely to trust the news if they feel it keeps them up to date with what’s happening, helps them understand it, and holds power to account,” the report tells us.

And, increasingly, Canadians are turning to trusted news brands to counter significant concern about misinformation online. The survey reports that 61 per cent of Canadians are concerned about their ability to sort out what is real and what is fake on the internet. As well, a majority (70 per cent) have taken steps to assure the credibility of their news, by checking information against several trusted sites and declining to share news they believe might be inaccurate.

The bad news: Only 9 per cent of Canadians indicate a willingness to pay for news — even the news they trust. Given the well-documented breakdown in the advertising revenue that traditionally supported serious news, this is a concern for most news organizations, including the Star, that are building their news subscription business to fund trusted public interest journalism.

Of concern also to the news business and to democracies that require informed civic engagement is a stronger trend around the world this year to “news avoidance.” More than half of Canadians say they actively avoid the news at least occasionally and more than a quarter admitted to being “worn out by the amount of news there is these days.”

“People say they avoid the news because it has a negative effect on their mood (58 per cent) or because they feel powerless to change events,” the report states.

This exhaustive report provides considerably more data to dig into, to think deeply about and perhaps, act on. Certainly, the Star newsroom is giving careful consideration to what more it can do to build greater trust with its audience. On trust, this survey ranks the Star ninth of 16 English-language news organizations with four broadcast outlets ranked in the top four.

While the trust scores are all close overall, this middle-of-the pack place is both puzzling and discouraging to me, given the extensive amount of work the Star has done to enhance reader trust. In the past year, the Star has participated in a global trust project that resulted in eight “trust indicators” being incorporated into our website content, including transparent labelling to make clear the difference between news and opinion, and journalism and paid content.

I know the Star takes seriously its commitment to accountability and transparency — the foundation of trustworthy news. Accuracy and fairness are core to our journalistic standards. So, what more can be done to encourage greater audience trust?

That is a serious and important question: I want to know what you think and will share your insights with the newsroom and our trust committee. Please tell us: What do you think would build greater trust in the Star’s digital content?",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q. You set up a paywall on your site. How can you expect people to trust you? — UnoriginallyGeneric

A. Irene Gentle, Editor of the Toronto Star: Research has shown that Canadians are generally unaware of the financial challenges of the media industry ... At one point, advertising helped pay the bills of expensive journalism — and journalism is expensive. But Facebook and Google are taking up about three-quarters of the entire industry’s ad revenue. In other words, American tech giants are reaping the rewards of work done by Canadian media outlets, rather than the outlets actually doing the work. Also, good, responsible journalism is very expensive. It can take a reporter weeks at times to verify a key fact in a story. It looks, to the reader, like a sentence. But that sentence took multiple tools to verify and confirm.

Q. Journo student from St. Clair College here. How can we, as young journos, learn to get the public’s trust again? — cynicalPsionic

A. Diana Zlomislic, Investigative Reporter: As journalists, I think we all need to commit to being fair, impartial, accurate and transparent about our processes. When columnists provide opinion, it’s critical the reader or viewer knows that’s exactly what they’re getting. Diverse voices, even those we disagree with, are critical to free press. But the public needs to know there is a difference between opinion and reporting.

Q. With user commenting being cancelled, how do you know if parts of a story are not leaving out important details that you have overlooked? — GTA705

A. Robin Honderich, Senior Manager of Newsroom Audience Engagement: It’s always possible that a detail was missed in the production of any story. If this is the case, we provide many ways for readers to get in touch with us to let us know. Aside from our ‘contact us’ page, which provides a number of ways to get in touch but is not always easy to find, at the bottom of every article page ... is a Twitter link or email address for that staff member for extremely easy access.

Q. What are your thoughts on the era of the accusation of “fake news” that has become mainstream? Do you feel any news can be “fake” or is it all rooted in some degree of truth? — RationalSocialist

A. Brian Bradley, Digital Producer: I do believe in the big World Wide Web that some information can be “fake,” or at the very least, not corroborated, sourced, etc. The onus is on the news organization to follow practices that demonstrate the news is trusted. Is the story solid for sources, background?Who is the reporter, what have they reported? Is there an error-reporting system?

Q. I think that if you want to elicit trust in the reading public, you first need to hire writers who look like the city. Toronto is a city engulfed with multi cultures, different ethnicities. How many Black, Asian, South American writers do you have on your staff? — tuxman06

A. Angela Mullins, Managing Editor (StarMetro): You make a very good point and one we are incredibly cognizant of in our newsrooms across the country. I was largely responsible for hiring new staff in our Western Canada newsrooms earlier this year as part of the StarMetro expansion and I can assure you there was a tremendous amount of attention paid to diversity in all stripes from gender to ethnicity to race. The reporting and management staff are a microcosm of the cities in which they tell stories.

Q. What actions is the Star Trust taking to stop promoting and legitimizing those who are spreading false information? — kofclubs

A. Kenyon Wallace, Investigative Reporter: In becoming a member of the Trust Project, the Star is agreeing to follow specific disclosure standards about how we do our journalism.

While I find some consolation in the fact that recent studies tell us that Canadians trust their news more than do news consumers in other parts of the world, the overall data on trust in journalism in Canada and beyond makes clear that serious news organizations such as the Star should not underestimate public skepticism about journalism.

Increasingly, in this time when misinformation can go viral across the internet and that vile f-word epithet (f— news) has been weaponized against journalists and news organizations, those of us who take journalistic responsibility seriously must take steps to show that we are real news.

To that end, the Star announced the good news this week that it is a partner in the Trust Project, a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism.

This project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster reader trust by helping to guide digital news audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found trusted sources amidst the noise and nonsense that can be found across the Internet and especially on social media. The project is funded by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Google, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund and the Markkula Foundation.

In becoming part of this initiative, the Star joins a group of global news organizations committed to incorporating “Trust Indicators” into all digital content. These indicators are key transparency standards for news and information that help readers recognize the commitments and expertise behind trustworthy journalism.

These include a new “About Us” page that states clearly the Star’s mission, its ownership structure, leadership team and its key ethical standards. You can now find a link to that page on every piece of content on thestar.com — as well as a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a highly visible means to report an error. As the Star’s transparency reporter Kenyon Wallace told you on Tuesday, these indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about our reporters that highlight their expertise and backgrounds.

What is trusted news? Across Torstar news organizations, we define trusted news as accurate, accountable and ethically produced. Being accurate means verifying information before sharing it – and correcting mistakes when they happen. Being accountable means being transparent and open about what we do and how we do it. Being ethical means producing news and information according to ethical standards as set out in Torstar’s recently updated Journalistic Standards Guide.

All these measures are key requirements for becoming part of the Trust Project. Its Trust Indicators are well-thought out signals for readers established by international news leaders following consultations with news audiences about what they believe makes journalism trustworthy. As Craig Newmark, one of the project’s funders told the Poynter Institute’s contributing editor David Beard in an interview this week, “News outlets want to make a statement, a credible statement, that they can be trusted. We need a Better Business Bureau, the equivalent of Consumer Reports (for journalism), but the first step is for a news outlet to come out credibly and say, ‘Hey, you can trust us’.”

While the work required to incorporate all of these trust indicators across all the Star’s digital content has been extensive in recent months, I think it also bears stating that the values that provide the foundation for these trust indicators are not new for the Star, a 126-year-old news organization that has put a high value on ethical journalism and accountability to its readers for many decades. For me, that is evidenced by the fact that the Star has had a public editor/ombudsman to respond to reader concerns about accuracy and ethics since 1972.

Still, given the current often nasty environment of online misinformation and mistrust in media throughout the world, it matters much that the Star do all it can to show you its strong commitment to delivering trusted news, information and content on all platforms.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Torstar Journalistic Standards Guide

Opinion | Public Editor: Readers need to distinguish news from opinion

The Star’s internal trust committee, an ongoing initiative made up of employees across Torstar, has overseen the creation of a dedicated Trust page, a larger glossary of Star news terms, new conventions on story labelling, and a weekly trust feature looking at the various ways the Star does its journalism.

“The Star has long had a very deep commitment to responsible, public service journalism. We have a public editor, independent from the newsroom for people to voice complaints to. We are part of National Newsmedia Council, an independent body that oversees and adjudicates journalism complaints. We have a code of conduct. We have ethical discussions on what we do and how we do it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. We know this but we weren’t telling our story,” said Gentle.

In the global Trust Project, participating media organizations agree to follow certain disclosure standards, known as Trust Indicators, developed by news executives around the world following dozens of interviews with readers that sought to discern what audiences value in news.

The indicators essentially present a variety of information about the publication that readers have said is important, such as ownership structure, executive makeup, mission statement, ethics, sources of funding, and journalistic standards and policies. The indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about reporters that highlight their expertise and track records.

Participants also state any commitments to presenting more diverse perspectives, citations and references for published statements of fact, and information about why certain stories were pursued and by what means.

Lehrman likens the Trust Indicators for news to the equivalent of nutrition information.

“It’s like a nutrition label that you would get on a piece of news,” Lerhman said in an interview. “Maybe you care a lot about ethics. Maybe you care a lot about the author’s expertise. Maybe you care a lot about the organization as a whole. So, you will get all these pieces of information and you can make your own decisions about what news you want to trust.”

How does this all translate into what Star readers will experience? For starters, at the bottom of every article published on thestar.com, readers will now find links to three trust-related features: a more visible “Report an Error” button, a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a link to the organization’s “About Us” page.

In recent months, the latter two features have undergone substantial revision overseen by Public Editor Kathy English.

Behind the scenes, the Star’s development team has been working on updating and standardizing internet markup language that will help the Trust Project’s tech partners — Google, Facebook, and Bing, to name just a few — better guide audiences to trusted sources.

123,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/08/03/whats-in-a-word.html,What’s in a word?,"['Kenyon Wallace', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterfri.', 'Aug.', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-08-03,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where every week we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism.

At the beginning of this year, as part of the Star’s ongoing transparency project, we published a feature looking at how our newsroom style committee strives to maintain a sensitive, clear and consistent presentation of content.

The article, which delved into the role of the style committee and its decisions on word usage, proved popular with readers. In light of that, we thought it would be fun — and, we hope, of value — to look at the reasoning behind why the Star has made certain style decisions about specific words.

The examples we have chosen for this feature are a sampling of words — some quirky, some contentious — from the Star Stylebook, a newsroom resource providing guidance on everything from spelling, capitalization and punctuation to the use of numbers, measurements and foreign words and phrases.

We sat down with Anthony Collins and Jon Ohayon, co-chairs of the Star’s style committee, to get the goods on who is winning the name game in one Toronto neighbourhood and whatever happened to that reliable staple, the good old hot dog.

Days of blunder: The Canadian Press, the national wire service that publishes a well-respected guide on style, prefers daylight time but Star style is daylight saving time, on the grounds that it’s more commonly used. Many say daylight savings time, but that’s less common than the singular. Daylight time is convenient in headlines, though — a useful fallback(ward) position.

Flipping the bird: Canadian Geographic magazine ruffled some feathers in 2016 when it proclaimed Perisoreus canadensis to be our “new national bird” but spelled its name the American way: gray jay. We knew that wouldn’t fly, so the Star used the Canadian spelling grey jay in our coverage, relying on the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for backup. The species was recently renamed the Canada jay, so patriotic birdwatchers and word watchers can both breathe easy.

To Beach his own: It’s a decades-old debate that may never be resolved: what to call the east-end Toronto neighbourhood by the lake. Many longtime residents insist on the singular form the Beach, but others swear it’s always been the Beaches.

The Beach won out in a 2006 neighbourhood poll and that’s the name that appears on street signs along Queen St. The Star planted its flag in the Beach camp, too, in 2009, when it created a neighbourhood map of Toronto with input from readers. You’ll still see “Beaches” in the Star: in quotes, for instance, or in the name of the federal/provincial riding, Beaches—East York. But when it’s our choice, we prefer the Beach.

Tweet science: Though we capitalize Twitter, we lowercase tweet as both a noun and a verb. In the early days, around 2008-09, our archives show we capitalized tweet quite often, as it seemed exotic.

Stuck on neutral: The Star stylebook advises writers to “use gender-neutral terms such as spokesperson, chair, camera operator, firefighter and letter carrier whenever possible.”

As with any style rule, there are always exceptions: words like actress, freshman and fisherman are still so common that they’re hard to avoid (and don’t get us started on ombudsman, which many insist is gender-neutral). On the other hand, firefighter and flight attendant are so widespread that their gendered antecedents are seldom heard now. In between are phrases like business person and humankind that will sound natural to some readers and drive others up the wall. Preferring gender-neutral terms may lead to accusations of political correctness run amok, but the language is constantly evolving, and what sounds odd or stilted today may soon be common parlance.

Voyage of the God damned: The Canadian Press’s two-word style seems a bit archaic: God damn/God damned. (There’s also a note that it should be used with discretion.) Star style — goddamn — seems much less jarring and less clunky as an adjective, though we also use it with discretion and it mainly appears in quotes. Readers often remind us that God should be capitalized, though in this common phrase, we disagree.

Mike dropped

The Star follows Canadian Press style on the abbreviation for microphone, which used to be mike. In 2015, it was changed to mic. The phenomenon of the mic drop would have looked bizarre in print as mike drop and mike drop is much less prevalent online.

How the sausage is made: CP’s longtime preference for spelling hotdog as one word didn’t pass mustard — er, muster — with some readers. It always looked a little strange to us, too. So we were glad when the CP Caps and Spelling guide recently changed its entry to hot dog — no doubt avoiding many future bunfights.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after 10 p.m. last Sunday July 22, Inori Roy, a reporter in the Star’s radio room, noticed a trickle of posts on Twitter about unconfirmed reports of gunfire on the Danforth.

Within a few minutes, the trickle became a deluge. To find out more, she immediately called police, EMS and Toronto Fire Services, which told her they had received the first call at 10:04 p.m.

“The gravity of the situation really dawned on me when I heard the urgency in the voice of the paramedic I spoke to. He sounded like he was on the verge of panic, like there was as crisis,” said Roy. She ran over to the Star’s digital desk to alert editors, who instructed her to start writing a short story to be posted on thestar.com.

At the same time, Star photographer Richard Lautens had just returned to his home near the Danforth after a vacation in cottage country, when his two kids, who had gone out for dinner, came running in. They had just seen a string of police cars, sirens blaring, speeding down the Danforth.

Lautens grabbed his camera and started running. A few minutes later, at around 10:10 p.m., he was at Alexander the Great Parkette at the corner of Logan and Danforth Aves., where he saw paramedics administering first aid to two people lying on the ground. “It was just mayhem everywhere,” said Lautens. “Nobody knew what was going on.”

He snapped pictures of bystanders looking on in shock, of police interviewing witnesses and of paramedics loading victims on gurneys into ambulances. Using his phone as an internet hotspot, he quickly emailed the newsroom a couple of photos that could run with the initial story, which went online at 10:51 p.m. It reported that a man dressed in black had opened fire on the Danforth, injuring multiple people.

As the scale of the tragedy started to become clear, news editor Jason Paul, who was overseeing production at the Star that night, began making a plan to get reporters on the ground.

“As more eyewitness accounts came in, we wanted to be sensitive knowing that lives had been lost and others injured. We wanted to help readers understand what was happening but at the same time knowing this was a devastating situation for so many people,” said Paul.

He called breaking news editor Amit Shilton to discuss the unfolding situation. Shilton then started calling reporters who lived in the area of the shooting to see who could get to the scene and interview witnesses.

One of those reporters was David Rider, the Star’s city hall bureau chief, who was out walking his dog when he started hearing sirens and saw a police command vehicle heading north on Carlaw Ave. towards the Danforth. Shortly before midnight, Rider stationed himself outside the police cordon at that intersection and started interviewing people leaving the scene.

Shilton also reached Wendy Gillis, the Star’s crime reporter, who hopped in a cab and rushed to the other end of the cordon at Danforth and Broadview Ave. where she interviewed several witnesses. One of the first people she stopped on the street was an employee of the Second Cup near Chester subway station that had been a target of the gunman. The employee provided a detailed description of the shooter and recounted a shocking story of watching him fire his gun at the shop.

Back in the newsroom, digital producers Tanis Fowler and Priya Ramanujam kept the online news file updated throughout the night and started a liveblog which pulled in tweets from reporters on the scene and Roy in the radio room.

Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Gillis learned — thanks to a timely text message from a colleague — that Police Chief Mark Saunders and Mayor John Tory would be holding a press conference in just a few minutes at Danforth and Logan Aves. Gillis was about a kilometre away so she sprinted as fast as she could, arriving just as the chief and the mayor stepped up to the microphones.

Jenna Moon, the overnight radio room reporter, was also dispatched to the scene to gather colour and interview witnesses. She later met up with Gillis before heading to St. Michael’s Hospital to check on the status of victims.

Columnist Rosie DiManno also went to the scene and spoke to witnesses for a story she filed early that morning.

Sunday night’s front-page editor, Anthony Collins, stayed all night to combine the individual journalists’ reports into a comprehensive story covering as many aspects of the shooting as possible.

“At that point we were really leaning on the reporters to give us whatever kind of colour they could from the scene in order to take the story beyond a shorter police file, to really flesh out what happened,” said Paul, who also stayed at the Star throughout the night. “The goal was to set up a really great package — Rosie’s column and a thorough news story — that was available for readers in the morning.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week, we look at how the Star’s wine critic, Carolyn Evans Hammond, responded to reader inquiries about why she reviews American wines in the midst of a trade war with the U.S.

Late last month, the Star’s wine reviewer, Carolyn Evans Hammond, wrote an article in which two of the five wines she recommended were American.

Her review happened to come at a time when the Canada-U.S. trade war was reaching a fever pitch as Canada prepared to slap retaliatory tariffs on imports from its southern neighbours.

Evans Hammond discovered that her recommendations of American wines did not sit well with some readers.

“I generally enjoy your Saturday columns in the Star, but in light of the current state of Canada/U.S. trade relations, I find it curious to find you recommending two out of five wines coming from the U.S. this week,” one reader wrote to her. “Surely, you have heard the gathering talk on boycotting U.S. wine (and many other products) coming from this side of the border in response to the bullying tactics from the U.S. regarding trade tariffs.”

“Surely there are enough great wines in the world that we do not need to promote those from the U.S. at this time. Is it possible for you to discontinue the review of U.S. wines?” asked another.

One reader stated bluntly: “It’s time to stop pushing America wines in your Star column.”

While Evans Hammond says she understands the concerns of these readers, she notes her job is to recommend wines based on value for money, relative to similar wines at that price point. And that means American wines are fair game, regardless of the political climate.

Have your say

“From my perspective, I can’t not include wines because I don’t agree with a political situation going on in a region. That’s a huge kettle of fish,” she said in an interview.

Evans Hammond says if she were to start taking a nationalist stance on her reviews, she would be doing a disservice to wine consumers and producers.

“As a wine columnist, I recommend wines from all over the world based on those that offer the best value for money within the context of a respective column. It is up to individual readers whether they want to buy American wines,” she said.

“What’s important to know is this: fierce global competition in winemaking is constantly pushing quality up and prices down, so it’s a very exciting time to be a wine enthusiast. With that in mind, I try hard to keep abreast of what’s out there and to recommend only the wines I think offer the very best value for money. Then, I give each wine I recommend a score out of 100 and qualify that score with a lengthy tasting note to communicate what makes the wine special.”

The Star’s public editor Kathy English said while the emails Evans Hammond received from readers were not unreasonable given the current trade situation between the U.S. and Canada, she stressed that columnists, including Evans Hammond, are fully within their remit to choose what they write about.

“Columnists have the prerogative and latitude here to select the topics they write about, and in the case of reviewers, to select the products they review,” said English. “There are no policy issues at play here whatsoever.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week, we look at how three Star journalists created a unique multimedia feature around safe spaces in Toronto.

Asian Community AIDS Services, Chinatown. The Drake Hotel, West Queen West. Planned Parenthood, The Annex. The Palm House at Allan Gardens. Glad Day Bookshop in the Village. The 519 LGBTQ2S Community Centre.

Just some of the cherished safe spaces highlighted by 10 people in Toronto’s LGBTQ community interviewed for a multimedia feature by Star journalists Evy Kwong, Kelsey Wilson and Carlos Osorio.

The feature, published late last month just in time for the city’s annual Pride weekend, comprised text, video, audio and photographs to go inside the spaces identified by the interview subjects that give them a sense of sanctuary.

Kwong, a digital producer, says the idea for the project was formed in response to the tragic deaths of several members of Toronto’s LGBTQ community who police believe were murdered by alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

“Even though it had seemed that acceptance and inclusivity was progressing for the community, there was reason to feel more unsafe than ever,” Kwong explained in an interview. “We wanted to talk to a spectrum of people on where they felt sanctuary despite the news of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur. Where did these people feel they could be 100 per cent safe?”

With that question in mind, Kwong and colleagues Wilson, a video producer, and photographer Osorio, set out to find 10 people to talk openly about their safe spaces and identities.

It was a challenging task. With just four days before publication, the journalists had to track subjects down, meet them at various locations across the city, shoot video and collect audio, edit and type up interviews.

Kwong began by reaching out to friends in the LGBTQ community, who referred her to people they thought might want to speak about their experiences. She also reached out to more well known figures in the community such as city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam and Armand Digdoyo, an event producer, who also founded New Ho Queen, a collective highlighting the Asian queer community.

“We were in a rush, but I still wanted to ensure that we had an array of voices, because being LGBTQ is so much more than just the terms in the acronym, and we were blessed to have such enthusiastic response, even on a day’s notice,” Kwong said.

Meanwhile, Wilson and Osorio met with representatives of Pride Toronto to get feedback on the concept and to ensure they were properly representing the LGBTQ community. The response was a thumbs up.

When it came to photography, Osorio says he was aiming for “something bright and very in your face.” But he also wanted to hint at the tragedies faced by the LGBTQ community this year, so he added a dark edge around the frames of his photos to “show that all is still not well and that a bit of a cloud still hangs over this year’s Pride.”

Osorio added that a challenge for him was trying to keep the look of the photographs consistent while being in different locations.

A recurring dilemma the journalists encountered more than once during the course of their interviews was that some of their subjects told them they hadn’t fully “come out” to their families yet.

“Of course, we were immediately concerned about whether telling their stories could create lasting personal damage,” Wilson said. To address this, she says she and her colleagues were fully transparent with their subjects about what would be published.

“We wanted them to feel completely comfortable with their part in the finished product. These people are trusting you with deeply personal stories and you feel obligated to do them justice.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Toronto Star’s running tally of the false claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump — compiled by Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale — is consistently among the most-read stories on thestar.com.

Dale’s list of Trump’s mistruths now numbers more than 1,800 since the real-estate tycoon became president.

Inspired by the popularity of Dale’s work, associate editor Lynn McAuley sought a way to assess the truthfulness of claims made by Canadian politicians.

A good place to start, she thought, was question period on Parliament Hill — a 45-minute session on weekdays in which Members of Parliament for Opposition parties pose questions to the governing party (MPs representing the government are also allowed to ask the odd question). Why not fact-check the claims made by Opposition parties in the framing of their questions, as well as the answers provided by the government, in order to get a sense of how honest our elected representatives are in the spotlight?

Each session is recorded in Hansard, the official transcript of Parliament.

Five days of question period in April and May were randomly chosen to be put under the microscope by Ottawa Bureau reporters Bruce Campion-Smith, Alex Ballingall, Alex Boutilier and Tonda MacCharles, along with reporters Brendan Kennedy and Marco Chown Oved in Toronto.

Question period can see upwards of 40 questions, producing some 9,000 words in one 45-minute session. That meant the team had to check about 45,000 words over the five days examined.

“We were helped that there was duplication from day to day as opposition parties hammered away at a particular topic, such as the carbon tax,” said Ottawa Bureau Chief Bruce Campion-Smith.

Every morning, a reporter in Ottawa shared the previous day’s question period transcript in a Google Doc, explained Kennedy. Subjects were divvied up randomly or according to previous experience or interest in a topic. Claims were assessed as true, false, a stretch or a dodge.

“We really sought to be fair in how we labelled questions and answers,” Campion-Smith said. “That meant a lot of research into a particular topic and evaluating the statements by MPs and cabinet ministers.”

To check the validity of MPs’ statements, the reporters consulted government budgets, parliamentary committee reports, statements by ministers and policies. In some cases, the reporters reached out to MPs’ offices to ask for the source of their information, and then sought verification through further research.

“The toughest claims to fact check were the vague or generalized assertions, and anything that was a borderline opinion,” Kennedy said. “If an MP stated an exact number, it was usually pretty easy to determine whether or not it was accurate. But if they said that something was ‘out of control’ or ‘chaotic,’ then it was a little trickier to make an assessment.”

For example, in a preamble to one of her questions on April 30, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said that social programs across Canada are under “severe strain due to tens of thousands of unplanned immigrants” crossing the border illegally.

To check these claims, Kennedy searched news sources and government reports about social programs strained by an increase in irregular migrants. Only in Quebec, where most of the migrants arrived, and in Toronto, where many of them end up, did he find evidence of a strain on social services. To fortify this, he looked up the statistics for irregular border crossers and found that 93 per cent of the RCMP interceptions at the border since the beginning of 2017 have been in Quebec. In fact, seven provinces had a combined 21 irregular border crossings in all of 2017.

“Clearly, her claim that social programs were under severe strain ‘across Canada’ was false,” Kennedy said.

Overall, the reporters found that outright lies or false claims in question period were uncommon.

“However, that is offset by what we did find and that is the amount of dodges on the government side, the refusal to meaningfully answer a question,” Campion-Smith said. “The opposition parties are not blameless, either. On their side, there are a lot of exaggerations. So, I think people have a right to be cynical about the whole exercise when they say it’s largely driven by partisan motivations. But I think it’s also a very important part of our parliamentary democracy and the principle of holding a government to account.”

In the foreground, a black bicycle lies on its side in the middle of the road, its front wheel and handlebar bent into awkward angles. What looks like a black bag sits beside the bike. In the background, a few metres feet away, a flatbed truck sits motionless. Two police personnel stand nearby.

That’s a description of a photo published in the Toronto Star last week showing the scene on June 12 at the intersection of Bloor and St. George Sts., where Dalia Chako, 58, a grandmother who loved cycling, was hit and killed in a collision with a flatbed truck.

A disturbing image, to be sure, the publication of which was the subject of intense discussions among editors in the newsroom. There were other photos from the scene, all taken by Star photographer Lucas Oleniuk, that were even more graphic in nature that were under consideration. This week, we take a behind-the-scenes look at the factors editors considered when deciding which photo of this tragic event to publish.

Originally, in the afternoon on the day of the collision, the plan was to use a photo of the collision scene that showed a tarp lying beside the crushed bicycle. But that changed when photo assignment editor Tim Finlan flagged that the tarp was in fact covering the body of the victim. So began a discussion in the middle of the newsroom that grew to include more than half a dozen editors about whether the photo was too graphic to publish.

“On one side, we have to be really sensitive about using photos that show victims’ bodies, even if they are completely covered,” said Catherine Wallace, assistant managing editor of news. “It becomes so easy to imagine it could have been my mother or sister or friend who died in the accident. How would I feel if a picture of their body covered by a tarp was in the paper? It’s a question of dignity and respect.”

On the other hand, cycling deaths are a serious issue, one the city has been grappling with for years, Wallace noted.

“When there is a terrible accident like this one, we want people to pay attention. We want people to stop and think and say, ‘this can’t continue, things must change,’” she said. “Sometimes it’s important to be shocked and upset — for a newspaper to shock and upset people — and photographs are one of the best ways of doing that.”

As editors gathered around the photo desk to examine the image closely, they kept coming back to one question: was this the time to shock and upset people?

Oleniuk volunteered to return to the scene in an attempt to capture the gravitas of the situation without the body in frame.

The Star has chosen to publish photos depicting bodies in the past, such as the image of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, and the picture of the body of a teenage Haitian girl shot dead by police in 2010. Decisions to publish such images are made on a case-by-case basis.

Ultimately, Wallace and senior news editor Marie Sutherland decided, given the recent nature of the incident and the sensitivities mentioned above, it was not the right time. Instead, Oleniuk’s photo described above and pictured here — without the image of the body — was chosen for publication that day.

The next day, a different photo that showed the tarp over the body was published on thestar.com, with a story looking at the broader issue of cyclist safety on Toronto’s streets.

“The thing about the discussion that was so challenging, and I think the reason so many editors spontaneously joined in, is that there is no right or wrong answer in a situation like this. Both sides were right: It was a terrible personal tragedy, and it was also a symbol of a city-wide danger that we should all be paying more attention to,” Wallace said. “You can’t have hard and fast rules about photo use. You have to be open each time to considering the context. No two situations are ever, ever the same.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week, we look at how the Star handles letters to the editor.

The famous American playwright Arthur Miller once said in 1961, “A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself.”

That’s a viewpoint held by many journalists today. And among the ways newspapers allow nations — or provinces or towns or neighbourhoods — to talk to themselves is through the oldest form of reader engagement: letters to the editor.

Letters to the editor allow readers to weigh in with their opinions, thoughts or reactions concerning any issues or events in the news. In the Toronto Star, reader letters are published at the back of the A section on Sundays and during the week, in the Insight section on Saturdays, and everyday on the Letters page, at thestar.com.

The Star receives about 25 letters per day, on average, that are suitable for publication. Most weekdays, a selection of between five and eight letters are published, while a larger number are printed on Saturdays, often focusing on the week’s biggest stories.

Letters that make it to publication are chosen by editors working with the Star’s editorial board, which works independently from the newsroom, led by editorial page editor Andrew Phillips. In addition to handling letters to the editor, the editorial board is responsible for daily editorials, opinion pieces by guest writers, and editorial cartoons.

“A good letter to the editor is timely, interesting and well-written. It focuses on the issues at hand,” Phillips said in an interview. “It’s also short — letters run from about 50 to 250 words, so a premium is placed on writers who can get to the point very quickly and express a clear view. A touch of humour helps a lot, too.”

A good letter also avoids certain things.

“We don’t like letters that are abusive, that engage in ad hominem attacks on other people, that mischaracterize the arguments of those the writer disagrees with, or are defamatory. We are happy to publish letters that oppose views expressed by Star editorials or columnists, but they must stick to the issues and avoid personal attacks,” said Phillips.

In addition, editors try to publish a representative sample of letters sent in. The Star tends to lean left in its editorial positions and more letters the paper receives are from that perspective than from the right, Phillips notes.

“We look for a range of subjects and views to keep the section lively,” he said.

Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have allowed people to express their opinions without the filter of a newspaper editorial board, and this has resulted in a decrease in the number of letters to the editor in recent years. Social media also provides the protection of anonymity, allowing some users to express all manner of thoughts behind a persona that may or may not be real.

That’s why the Star will not publish anonymous letters. In fact, the editorial board asks letter writers to disclose any conflicts of interest or involvement they may have with an issue on which they are weighing in.

“For example, a person writing to oppose a transit plan should disclose that they are president of a community group fighting the plan, if that’s the case,” said Phillips. “We read letters with an eye on this possibility, and if there’s a reason to suspect some kind of involvement by the writer we may query the writer or Google the name to see if anything relevant comes up.”

Crafting a compelling letter to the editor can also take more effort than sounding off on social media, so for those readers who have found their letters printed in the Star, it’s fair to say the editorial board found their comments articulate, thoughtful, or relevant.

“Nowadays readers have many other ways of expressing their views, especially through social media, but the traditional letter to the editor still remains important,” Phillips said. “And we certainly hope that readers will continue to send them in.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-06-08,"Covering an election is a massive undertaking for media organizations, involving reporters, columnists, photographers, editors, data analysts, designers and managers from across departments working together under tight deadlines.

Ontario election night on June 7 saw the Toronto Star newsroom in full throttle as staff worked to keep readers up-to-date on the latest numbers from the polls preparing articles for thestar.com and two print editions for the next day.

“We wanted to make sure that, digitally on the night and in print the next day, our audience could find the answers to all the questions they were asking — who was winning at the riding and provincial levels and the implications for constituents and for the province,” said the Star’s politics editor Jordan Himelfarb, who oversaw the coordination of election night coverage.

“It required finding a compelling way to present the results as they came in, highlighting the most interesting and consequential races, drawing out the storylines that defined the night and that gave final shape to the campaign, and providing analysis and commentary that put the flood of information in context.”

Reporters were dispatched to be with the leaders of the four main political parties: Queen’s Park reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy were with PC leader Doug Ford in Etobicoke and the NDP’s Andrea Horwath in Hamilton, respectively. On loan to the Queen’s Park team were Wendy Gillis, who was with the Liberals’ Kathleen Wynne in North York, and Tess Kalinowski, who was dispatched to Guelph to cover Green Party leader Mike Schreiner.

At the same time, Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie held down the fort at the Star’s office at the provincial legislature putting everything together for the main news story about the night’s results. Ontario politics columnist Martin Regg Cohn wrote from home.

That was in addition to more than 40 other reporters assigned to cover results in ridings across the GTA, some covering two ridings at the same time.

“What I was looking for was not only the facts, but also context and colour. Elections are obviously profoundly important democratic moments, with far-reaching consequences, but they are also, for both voters and political players, emotional, human things,” said Himelfarb.

For thestar.com, the main feature of the night was a seat counter and a colour-coded map of the province showing which party had taken each riding in real time, fed by data from the Canadian Press.

To keep stories as timely as possible, reporters were asked to file as soon as definitive results for their ridings were available. A team of editors then quickly polished the copy, wrote headlines, added photos, published the stories online and prepared them for print.

In total, more than 50 ridings were covered by the Star and Metroland publications, resulting in 63 articles, including individual riding stories, columns, editorials and a cartoon.

Thursday was Himelfarb’s first election night as politics editor and he admits that the logistical challenges were daunting. But he said his life was made easier by the huge team effort put forward by Star staff.

“Once the polls close and we’re inundated with results, you don’t have time to be daunted. The adrenaline carries you through.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-31,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Kate Carraway brings people’s stories from the dating scene to life.

There’s something about the Star’s weekly Dating Diaries, which allows contributors to recount their best, worst, and weirdest dates in their own words, that consistently intrigues Toronto Star readers.

The feature that dives into the GTA dating scene, by freelance writer Kate Carraway, is consistently one of the most popular offerings in the Life section of the paper and on thestar.com.

Regular readers of Dating Diaries are unlikely to forget the story recounted by a woman who, after several dates and feeling she was really connecting with a man, received unsolicited photos of an intimate part of his anatomy. Then there was the diary about a woman’s first sleepover. The next morning, while she was putting on her makeup in the bathroom, the guy went and did a number two in full view. This week, Carraway lets readers in on how she gets people to open up about the intimate details of their personal lives.

How did you become a go-to person for readers and their dating experiences?

I pitched Dating Diaries as a way to get the readers’ experiences directly into (now defunct weekly) The Grid and readers really responded. I think the appeal of the column is obvious — it’s provocative, it’s voyeuristic, it’s fun, it’s educational, it’s sad and happy and embarrassing and funny, and really a vehicle for empathy. It also gives diarists an opportunity to share some very personal moments outside of the usual context of their lives, where friends might judge or where they may not have the chance to revel in something amazing or weird that happened.

Can you explain your process for turning what people have told you into first-person narratives written in their voice?

The Diarists all provide an overview of the date, at first just a short one so I can assess it. Often people submit stories about relationships, rather than dates, or almost-but-not-quite dates, or dates in which there’s no emotional turn or surprise or interest, or that serve some kind of agenda. If a date and a diarist seem like a fit, I ask for the full story, and then I dig in. The asides they might not have thought of as interesting often become the most revealing elements of the Diary. It’s the most fun kind of excavation, for me. I just keep asking questions and clarifying the details, emotional logic, and the tick-tock of the date until it’s tightly packed into the Dating Diaries form. It needs to be cogent, but it needs to maintain the diarist’s voice and experience. Sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s excruciating.

How do you find the people you write about?

Usually, people come to me via datingdiariescontact@gmail.com. It’s really not hard to find great Diarists. Usually they are readers of the column already. Often Star readers and former daters recommend the column to friends who have had an especially interesting date. If I meet someone in real life who has a crazy story I always ask them to do a Diary for me. I love talking about my work so a lot of Diaries have come from my extended network, too.

Have you experienced any backlash, and if so, how did you deal with it?

There are definitely certain themes in the Diaries that emerge again and again. I hear a lot about what kinds of dating mistakes men and women make that are thought to be demonstrated by the column. I hear a lot from older people about how dating was different when they were young, and from people who are just now dating after a divorce, or later in life, and find online dating to be difficult to navigate. A lot of people don’t like it when the “rating” that the Dater has given their date doesn’t seem to match their experience.

Why do you think these kinds of stories resonate with people?

I think people are almost desperate for reality, or what the late Tom Wolfe called “status life:” the daily, quotidian details of our existence. Not the kind of shock-value content that is all over the internet and media, but genuine and honest real life. It’s becoming popular to talk about the value of vulnerability, and I think people are understanding that more and more, but in a practical sense it’s still risky to be truly vulnerable, socially and professionally and in relationships and maybe especially in dating.

Ultimately, what do you want people to take away from Dating Diaries?

I want people to feel like they’ve engaged with someone else’s life in a real and intimate way. I want people to see outside themselves and consider what life is like for someone else, even for a few minutes. I want people to be informed and entertained and to have an opinion about it.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-24,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star is making its political endorsements more transparent.

It’s provincial election season in Ontario, and that means the editorial boards of newspapers across the province are studying the platforms of each party and keeping a close eye on their leaders in order to determine which candidate to endorse.

Political endorsements by newspapers, including the Star, are a long tradition in journalism, dating back more than a century.

Historically, the Star’s political endorsements have generally leaned left, in keeping with the newspaper’s alignment with the Atkinson principles, a set of progressive values named for former legendary publisher Joseph E. Atkinson. In the previous 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, for example, the Star endorsed the Liberals 10 times, the NDP twice and the Progressive Conservatives twice.

The Star’s editorial board, which operates independently from the newsroom, determines which party and candidate to endorse, but not without much scrutiny of the parties’ policies, vision, and the actions and temperament of their leaders.

“It’s part of our role to encourage debate and take a stand on the issues that matter to the community. We’re constantly giving our opinion on everything from subways to trade, so to remain silent on such a big choice as who should lead the province would be odd,” said editorial page editor Andrew Phillips.

He stressed, however, that a position taken by the editorial board doesn’t influence news coverage and an endorsement isn’t “telling” readers who to vote for.

“We’re just sharing our opinion as citizens and making an argument for that choice.”

That’s where editorial board meetings with the candidates come into play. Every election season, the Star invites the leaders of all the major parties to come to One Yonge St. and sit down with members of the editorial board, as well as journalists and editors from across departments. So far during this provincial election campaign, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath have met with the board. PC Leader Doug Ford and Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne have been invited. Wynne will be here May 28 at 1 p.m. Email questions to electionquestions@thestar.ca.

The idea is to see how the leaders react to tough questioning and how they defend their positions.

“Leaders who rely too much on canned talking points don’t come across as very impressive,” said Phillips. “You want to see someone actively considering the arguments and responding intelligently when their positions are challenged. Leaders are going to have to deal with unexpected situations, and having a dozen journalists quiz you on your positions is a pretty good test of how well they’re going to be able to handle that.”

This year, the Star decided to increase transparency by live streaming these meetings on thestar.com. Readers are encouraged to send in questions, which the editorial board poses to the candidates.

For the editorial board meeting with Horwath, which took place last Wednesday over the noon hour, readers sent in more than 100 questions. Many questions covered the similar subjects, so the editorial board chose a few to represent readers’ main concerns.

“The live stream gives readers an opportunity to engage with whatever the politician is saying, and to respond, comment or ask more questions in real-time. The idea is to help readers feel they are involved in the conversation,” said the Star’s social media editor Evelyn Kwong, who relays reader questions to the editorial board.

Phillips notes that the live stream also invites readers into a key part of the way the Star’s editorial board examines the choices in the election campaign.

“Readers often wonder how we go about making up our minds on which party to support at the end of a campaign, and live streaming opens the doors on one of the main tools we use to decide — direct access to the party leaders,” he said.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-18,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Morgan Campbell approaches stories for his Sports Prism series.

A few weeks ago, sports reporter Morgan Campbell received a direct message through Twitter from a publicist representing Canadian boxer Adonis Stevenson. How would Campbell like a sit-down interview with the light-heavyweight world champion?

It was a chance to gain some insight into what was going on in Stevenson’s head before his high-profile bout against Badou Jack to defend his WBC light-heavyweight title at the Air Canada Centre on May 19.

The publicist hinted that the interview might touch on Stevenson’s past, so Campbell wanted to make clear that he would explore it. “Sounds like Adonis’ team has come to grips with the fact that at some point, people are going to write about the pimping and the jail time,” he wrote back.

When Stevenson was a teenager growing up in Montreal, he was a member of a gang that ran prostitutes and forced them to hand over their money. Gang members were eventually caught, and Stevenson went to prison for 18 months. While Quebec media have reported on Stevenson’s history with the law, it is lesser-known in Toronto.

The publicist agreed to set up the interview.

Campbell immediately thought the interview could be a good jumping-off point for a feature as part of his Sports Prism project, a weekly series on thestar.com and in the Toronto Star that explores the intersection of sports and other areas of society, such as health, race, science, and business. The idea is to use sports as a prism through which to view societal issues.

Topics covered since the series launched seven weeks ago include how African-Americans make up a small percentage of Major League Baseball players, how a new Canadian minor-league basketball circuit is attempting to develop a lucrative following, and how former NFL legend Eddie George sees the NCAA business model ripe for a makeover.

“For whatever reason, so many of us are addicted to sports. If that’s the starting point, I just look for ways to take advantage of that to tell a different kind of story,” said Campbell, who has been a full-time reporter at the Star for 14 years. “Sports are a good way to view these issues for the same reason that they put vitamins in gummy forms: it tastes better.”

For the story on Stevenson, Campbell felt the boxer’s past presented an opportunity to not only look at how Stevenson had changed his life, but also the lasting harm of misogyny and prostitution.

“The last thing we need in sports writing is another story about the redemption of a troubled athlete and how he’s redeemed because he’s good at sports. There are a lot of those stories and they’re not always true,” Campbell said, noting that in Stevenson’s case, the boxer had to undergo a lot of personal change before he could put himself in a position to excel in sports.

The challenge with this story, Campbell explained, was to address Stevenson’s past so as not to make it seem like his convictions were recent, while also being sensitive to the victims of these crimes.

“Prostitution is still here, and there are people who get out of the industry, but there is lasting harm,” he said.

That’s why Campbell reached out to advocates for sex workers and to shelter staff who could speak about the challenges of recovering from the trauma inflicted by pimps and gangs.

“You can talk about Stevenson’s personal evolution, but you also have to respect the fact that there were victims involved and they have scars from that time in their lives as well. I can’t tell one side of the story without the other,” he said. “To do it any other way does a disservice to everyone involved in the story, including Adonis Stevenson, and a disservice to the truth.”

On that score, Campbell views his role as a messenger whose job it is to convey full, unvarnished stories about people and issues impacting society.

“The best thing to do with unflattering news is to meet it head on,” he said. “If I write a puff piece about Stevenson, all I’ve done is sugar-coated some really unsavoury stuff about him, and kind of erected myself as a barrier between the audience’s understanding of who this person is, where he’s coming from, and what he is now.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-11,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Debra Yeo approaches her coverage of reality TV.

“If it bleeds, it leads” is a common expression in journalism credited to journalist Eric Pooley, who wrote the phrase in a 1989 New York Magazine piece entitled “Grins, Gore and Videotape — The Trouble with Local TV News.”

There’s no doubt that “bad” news often features prominently in coverage, and has done so throughout the history of journalism. But it’s also the case that not all news is bad news. Besides informing and educating readers, news can, and should, entertain. Editors at the Star make a deliberate attempt to balance the bad news with content that is lighthearted, fun, and entertaining.

Case in point: deputy entertainment editor Debra Yeo’s coverage of reality TV. Since 2004, Yeo has been bringing readers news, previews and opinions about wildly popular reality shows, such as The Voice, So You Think You Can Dance, and Survivor, among others. These days, she focuses on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise as well as The Amazing Race Canada.

This week, we sat down with Yeo to find out how she brings a critical eye to the genre.

How do you view your role in covering these types of TV shows?

When it comes to The Bachelor franchise, in particular, I usually say I have a love-hate relationship with the shows. I am both a fan and a critic. When I recap episodes, I am reporting what happened but in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek way.

What do you say to critics who might view reality shows as something unworthy of coverage in a serious newspaper?

I say that they don’t have to watch the shows or read what I write. I know reality shows can be silly, but in my 33 years of practising journalism, I have had more response from readers about my Bachelor stories than anything else I have ever written. Reality shows can touch us in a genuinely emotional place. I have cried watching Bachelor proposals and Amazing Race eliminations, or performances on shows like American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. These shows also sometimes confront real-world issues. Think about Rachel Lindsay being the first Black Bachelorette a couple of seasons ago, or the scandal on Bachelor in Paradise when a sexual encounter between two contestants got out of hand. The woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it because she was blacked out on booze and prescription drugs. That raised the issue of consent since the woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it, although I don’t think Warner Bros. dealt with it as thoroughly as they should have.

Reality TV is known for its sometimes-torqued drama, contrived social situations, and high emotion. How do these factors influence the way you cover shows?

That is where the love-hate relationship comes in. Take the most recent season of The Bachelor, for instance, in which ABC claimed to show unedited footage of Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumping his fiancée, Becca Kufrin. I found it cruel that the producers allowed Kufrin to be blindsided on camera and wrote about that.

What do you do to ensure you don't lose your sensitivity when covering these shows and the contestants, who, after all, are only human?

Every once in a while I have to step back and remind myself that even though the shows are formulaic and heavily produced, there are real people and emotions at play. Sure, some of the contestants sign up to get famous, but others are just ordinary men and women who want to find a wife or husband. The most powerful reminder of that was when I interviewed Brittany M., the “villain” on the most recent season of Bachelor Canada. I asked her why she hadn’t fought harder to clear her name with Bachelor Chris Leroux after the other contestants accused her of being mean to them, and she started to cry. In her real life, she prides herself on helping empower other women, so it really hurt her feelings that the other contestants thought she was out to get them. It was a reminder that, yes, make fun of the silly things people do and say on the shows, but try not to attack them as people.

You have a no-spoiler rule. How does this align with the Star’s desire to be transparent?

I try to come at these shows from the perspective of being just another viewer who happens to write about them. If I already know what happened, I won’t be writing the recaps from an honest place. There are instances where I do get advance knowledge, like when I attended a Women Tell All episode taping in Toronto, but even if I hadn’t signed a non-disclosure agreement, I wouldn’t have wanted to spoil the episode for other viewers. The same goes for the day I just spent shadowing The Amazing Race Canada.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s a way to bring readers a more fullsome picture of the trajectory and drama of a case that daily reportage of a trial often does not allow.

In order to do this, reporters need access not only to the players — police, lawyers and relatives of victims and the accused — who can provide a human angle, but also to court records that clearly lay the case out, such as the application record (essentially a massive collection of evidence), exhibits from the preliminary hearing that didn’t come out at trial, and Information to Obtain a search warrant, if used by police.

Despite the open court principle — the idea that Canadian courts are presumptively open to the public — reporters often are forced to file an application before a judge in order to access what are already public documents. Star lawyers believe the proper interpretation of common-law suggests these documents should be made available to the public when requested, without having to take the onerous, time-consuming and expensive step of going before a judge.

But that’s just what reporter Amy Dempsey had to do recently while reporting on the disturbing story of the death of an entire Mississauga family — Bill Harrison, his wife Bridget Harrison, and their son, Caleb.

Mississauga mom and her spouse found guilty of first-degree murder in killing of ex-husband

“I have no law degree, no legal training, but the Star cannot afford to hire a lawyer every single time we are denied documents — it is too common and too expensive,” she said.

Back in August 2013, Dempsey was assigned to write a weekend feature about the unusual and disturbing coincidence that all three members of the Harrison family had been found dead in the same Mississauga home between 2009 and 2013.

Up until Caleb’s death in the summer of 2013, neither Bill’s nor Bridget’s death had been ruled a homicide. But that changed shortly after police found evidence that suggested Caleb, a 40-year-old father of two, had been murdered.

For her first story, Dempsey told the story of the Harrison family’s custody battle with Melissa Merritt, Caleb’s ex-wife, and a series of unfortunate events that had befallen the family. That first story in 2013 had the headline, “Three deaths, one home, and a mystery — what happened to the Harrisons?”

Merritt and her common-law partner, Christopher Fattore, were later charged in all three deaths (though Merritt was not committed to stand trial on Bill’s death, while Fattore was committed to stand trial in all three.)

“If the allegations proved true, it meant that police, coroners and pathologists had somehow missed two homicides. How did that happen?” asked Dempsey. She was determined to find out. “This was more than a whodunit. It was a story of mistakes made by the authorities meant to protect us, and two potentially avoidable deaths.”

At the conclusion of the trial earlier this year, Fattore was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb and Bridget. He was found not guilty in Bill’s death. Merritt was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb. A mistrial was declared on her charge in Bridget’s death after the jury could not reach a verdict. Both are appealing the guilty verdicts.

After the trial, Dempsey began work on what would become an 8,000-word feature called “Improbable Cause” published last month, that uncovered disturbing mistakes made by police, coroners and pathologists during their investigations into the deaths.

In order to tell the story fully, Dempsey needed access to records filed in court. But getting the records, which are public, would prove a challenge. First, she had to file an application in Brampton court and had to serve all interested parties — the court, the Crown, Merritt’s defence, Fattore’s defence, and a third party she can’t name due to a publication ban.

Then, once everyone had been served, Dempsey had to appear before a judge four times over a period of several weeks to make legal arguments before a decision was made.

Among the documents she found was a full transcript of Caleb Harrison’s 2010 police interview that took place hours after his mother’s body was discovered (the jury was presented with a significantly redacted version). The full transcript proved that the Harrison family had expressed concern about Merritt and Fattore from the day Bridget was killed. “I would ask where Melissa and Chris were, personally,” Caleb told the officer.

The documents also confirmed that no homicide detectives had investigated Bridget’s death, a fact that was only hinted at during trial.

The revelation of these and other details were only possible because Dempsey went to court — a step journalists might increasingly have to take.

“As financial challenges continue to confront media organizations, it’s important that more journalists go to court on their own, as Dempsey did, to argue for the release of records that serve the public interest,” said Bert Bruser, the Star’s newsroom lawyer.

It was 1:30 p.m. and reporter Jenna Moon was monitoring the Toronto police twitter account. As soon as she saw the tweet, she says, she knew this was big and immediately ran to alert her supervisor, Ed Tubb, an assignment editor on the Star’s breaking news team.

Tubb asked Moon to write a short article with what little information she had. While she did that, Patrick Ho, the rewrite editor on the digital team, began monitoring breaking news channels for the latest information, while the Star’s team of web editors prepared to push breaking news alerts on all of the Star’s digital platforms.

Coroner officially identifies victims of Yonge St. van rampage

“They were all on the story within 30 seconds of seeing that tweet — there was a lot of controlled yelling in the newsroom,” recalled Tubb.

Moon’s first story on the incident explaining that police said there were between eight and 10 pedestrians struck by a white van was posted online at 1:41 p.m.

Tubb, fellow assignment editor Amber Shortt and their manager, breaking news/enterprise editor Amit Shilton, dispatched reporters Victoria Gibson and Tamar Harris to the scene.

“It’s tough in the first hour, when we don’t know yet know the extent of what’s happened. The first thing is to get reporters on the scene fast,” said Tubb.

In addition to those in the Star newsroom, Metroland and StarMetro reporters responded. Metroland’s Andrew Palamarchuk and Aaron D’Andrea, were among the first reporters on scene. One shaken witness who said he briefly followed the van told Palamarchuk: “This is not an accident.”

“You look back now and yes, it’s pretty obvious,” said Patrick Ho, who kept the breaking news story up-to-date online Monday. “But amid the first minutes of a developing story, we need to make sure. For all we know, without verification, it could have been a case of medical distress.”

At the south end of the 2.2-kilometre stretch of Yonge that had been cordoned off by police, Gibson and Harris interviewed witnesses and police officers, sending their files back to the Star and posting what they were learning on social media.

Star reporters Jesse McLean and Moira Welsh also went to the scene, walking south from Finch on sidestreets and behind buildings on Yonge, interviewing witnesses who were in shops and restaurants when the rampage began. Welsh spoke to a woman who worked in a restaurant close to Finch who gave her an account of a young woman lying on the sidewalk with two men performing CPR on her.

Star photographers René Johnston, Steve Russell and Lucas Oleniuk were dispatched to different areas of the scene. In Johnston’s case, he rushed to Yonge and Sheppard from another assignment at High Park. Coincidentally, Johnston knew that area of North York well because his grandfather used to live close by. Johnston raced on foot toward North York City Centre, which is just north of Mel Lastman Square, where according to initial reports several people had been hit. Sadly, this proved to be true.

Yonge St. had been closed to traffic, so to get close, Johnston entered the area from the west via Beecroft Road, which runs parallel to Yonge, and ran east to the Starbucks on the northeast corner of the square. From there, at 2:23 p.m., he snapped a photo of firefighters and police placing an orange tarp over the body of a victim. A single shoe and some items of clothing rest in the foreground. The picture ran as main art on the front page the next day.

Kathy English, the Star’s public editor, said that it is imperative the Star gets it right, even when news is breaking fast.

“In any breaking news situation, so much misinformation circulates,” English said. “There was a lot of speculation about terrorism. These are the kinds of situations where we have the opportunity to show the role of real news. We take that responsibility very seriously — giving readers facts, not rumours.”

As the team on the scene scrambled for information, the digital desk was in overdrive looking for photos on social media and keeping thestar.com and other platforms up-to-date. It was a difficult task given the abundance of unconfirmed information being reported on social media, and the fact that the number of dead and injured kept changing.

“We did our best to comb through social media, particularly Twitter to find photos we could use but that proved difficult,” said deputy digital editor Sabrina Melchiori. “An abundance of caution was necessary to avoid the spread of misinformation.”

About 5:30 p.m., CBS News reported that sources had identified the suspect in the rampage as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill. As soon as she heard this, the Star’s social media producer, Evelyn Kwong, searched LinkedIn, found a profile she thought could be Minassian’s and saved his photo.

“We had a LinkedIn account with a guy that said he went to Seneca, but we didn’t have anybody who knew him who could confirm that his photo is him. That was the problem. We had both these things but no independent confirmation linking the two,” explained Shilton.

Reporter Harris was dispatched to Richmond Hill to see if she could locate Minassian’s home in an effort to confirm his identity. Meanwhile, crime reporter Wendy Gillis worked sources to confirm what the CBS network in the U.S. was reporting and that the photo from LinkedIn was in fact Minassian. Once it was confirmed, a breaking news alert email at 7:48 p.m. told Star readers that a police source had identified the suspect as Minassian.

In the evening, reporter Mitch Potter stitched together the main story, drawing in the work of 21 reporters.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-04-20,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star covers breaking weather news.

Taped to the glass about halfway up a window in the Star’s radio room is a memo titled, “How to write a weather story.”

It’s a handy guide the Star’s radio room reporters turn to whenever apocalyptic weather hits the GTA, like last weekend when our surroundings became something that looked more like a scene from the Disney movie Frozen than crocus season. The guide, written by one of the Star’s digital producers Natasha Grzincic, lays out who to call in the event of bad weather, what websites and social media accounts to monitor, and when to update the story for the website. It also contains some general suggestions about writing style (conversational! It’s the weather after all!).

“The idea is to write about how the weather affects people, while making sure we are providing them with information that is accurate and up to date,” said Grzincic, who was in charge of thestar.com on Sunday.

The job of reporters who work in the radio room is to keep readers up-to-date on breaking news, including traffic problems, public transit delays or flight cancellations. Weather conditions can play a role in how the city runs, so it’s imperative Star reporters get information fast and get it right. The ice storm of April 14 and 15 provides an opportunity to take a look at how we do that.

It started on Saturday morning, before the real deluge of freezing rain and gusting winds arrived. Weekend staff reporters Tamar Harris and Ben Spurr were assigned the task of updating an existing Canadian Press wire story published on thestar.com that forecast the inclement weather. Harris checked with Environment Canada, which was warning that the ice storm could be “historic” in some parts of southern Ontario, and surveyed the websites and Twitter feeds of GTA universities and colleges to check for closures.

Spurr then updated the story with information the TTC had released about service changes as a result of the storm, and called Toronto Police and the Ontario Provincial Police for the latest updates on the number of collisions in the city. He reached out to Toronto Raptors owner Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment to confirm rumours that the tailgate party in Maple Leaf Square, also known as “Jurassic Park,” for that evening’s playoff game, would be cancelled.

Meanwhile, Star photographers Andrew Francis Wallace and Bernard Weil filed photos showing the effects of the storm.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alexandra Jones arrived for her shift, and immediately checked Environment Canada’s website to get an up-to-date forecast, and continued to check road conditions with police.

“At the start of my shift on Saturday, there had been over 200 collisions reported by the OPP. By the end of my shift, there were over 550,” she recalled.

When she finished work at midnight, Jones passed the file to radio room reporter Bryann Aguilar, who was working the overnight shift. Early Sunday morning, his updated story, which included warnings that freezing rain and heavy rain were headed Toronto’s way, was published online.

At around 9:30 a.m. Sunday, Annie Arnone, the morning radio room reporter, updated the story to include comments from a Toronto Police spokeswoman who urged the public to stay indoors if possible and to drive slowly if going out.

At 10:45 a.m., Mayor John Tory held a media briefing, during which he explained that many streets had not been plowed because of concerns that large amounts of slush on the sides of roads would increase the risk of flooding. This necessitated another update, with the mayor’s comments leading the story.

“I think I updated the same file six or seven times in one shift, which is crazy,” said Arnone.

During the day, photographers Weil and Rene Johnston braved the outdoors trying to capture numerous photos.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alanna Rizza, arrived for her shift, and immediately started working on a round-up of the effects of the storm, including the number of vehicle collisions, TTC delays, flight cancellations and power outages.

“A challenge was that the number of people affected by the ice storm kept changing. Initially, we reported that about 7,000 customers in Toronto were without power, but that number kept growing throughout the evening,” Rizza said.

To keep on top of the power outages, Rizza monitored Toronto Hydro’s website, which provides regular updates through a map.

Barry Brimbecom, the assignment editor over the weekend, said the key to good weather coverage is ensuring readers have all the necessary information to plan their lives.

“We need to tell readers where the streetcar tracks are frozen, if their flight might be cancelled, or where the highways are closed,” he said. “We can help keep people safe, too. When the police are telling anyone who can that they should stay home, I want to know that — and the Star provides that link between them and our readers.”

This week, we look at how one Star reporter looking for an Ontario court file found roadblocks every where she turned.

Reporters who cover Ontario’s justice system have long lamented the lack of transparency they can encounter while navigating the courts.

Courts are supposed to be open to the public — and that includes bail hearings, trials and appeals, as well as records filed in cases. (While the courts are presumptively open, there are certain aspects of procedures that are subject to publication bans, it should be noted).

But whether it’s obtaining copies of documents, exhibits, or transcripts, the reporter’s job of keeping the public apprised of what goes on in our courtrooms can be a challenging, and often frustrating, task.

Case in point: reporter Tamar Harris’s recent trip to the Oshawa courthouse to cover the court appearance of two Durham Regional Police Service officers facing assault charges.

Cst. James Edward Scholtes and Cst. Thomas Broadfoot were each charged with assault causing bodily harm, obstruction of justice and obstructing a peace officer after they pulled over a vehicle in Oshawa on April 26, 2017. According to the Special Investigations Unit, an arm’s length agency which is called in to investigate reports of police involvement in deaths, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault, the officers arrested the 35-year-old passenger and took him to the police station. A short time later, the man was taken to hospital by ambulance suffering a serious injury.

Harris was dispatched to the Oshawa courthouse on March 22, 2018, when the lawyer for the officers was making a court appearance, in an effort to learn the name of the alleged victim (the SIU doesn’t typically release victims’ names).

Harris arrived at 9:30 a.m. and went straight to the courtroom to wait for the officers’ appearance. She was also hoping to see the court file in order to find out the name of the alleged victim. The case came before the judge two hours later, at 11:30 a.m., but went on recess shortly after. After the recess, Harris approached the court clerk and requested to see the file. The clerk said she’d have to wait until the next recess, as there wasn’t time to allow her to see the file.

Harris returned to her seat and waited through the next block of appearances by others charged with various offences unrelated to the police officers’ case. After these cases were heard, Harris again approached the clerk to ask to see the file, but was told she would have leave the courtroom immediately because the court was going on recess again. At this point, Harris had been at the courthouse for more than three hours.

“It’s essential to have the file on hand when writing the story,” Harris said in an interview. “Having that file means you have all the official information and can, perhaps most importantly, fact-check properly. Making sure we get a story right is the most important part of doing our job as journalists, and having that documentation is key to that.”

When the courtroom opened back up an hour later, Harris approached the clerk again with a request to see the file. This time, the clerk allowed her to see it, but only for about three minutes, as the judge was returning any moment. Luckily, that gave her just enough time to find the alleged victim’s name, but nothing else. She was told she would have to wait until the file was returned to the file room at the end of the day before she could get a paper copy.

Harris spent the next hour doing research and pulling files on other cases while she waited for the police officers’ file to be delivered to the file room. At around 4:30 p.m. she started to get worried, knowing that the file room closed half an hour later and the file still hadn’t been returned. At 5 p.m., the file room closed, and Harris wasn’t able to get a copy.

“I don’t think we should accept a system where a journalist can spend eight hours in a courthouse and not get a copy of the file they went there for,” Harris said. “In the end, it is detrimental to freedom of information if a public document is not publicly accessible.”

Brian Gray, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General, said the duties for court staff when Harris was there “were particularly lengthy that day as there were hundreds of matters addressed in the relevant courtroom.”

He said it was “unfortunate” that the file had not yet been returned to the administration office before it closed but that it was open for the reporter “to return to the court, or send a representative, to obtain a copy of the file the following morning.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-04-06,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star covered the recent Ontario budget while cut off from the outside world.

Readers will often come across the word “lockup” in media coverage of provincial and federal budgets, but it’s a term that is rarely explained.

In essence, a budget lockup is the government’s way of providing journalists with details in advance of the document becoming public when the Minister of Finance speaks to the House later that day, usually around 4 p.m. The idea is to give journalists time to review the budget, ask questions of bureaucrats, and write their stories before the embargo is lifted.

But here’s the catch. Because budgets contain information that could influence the financial markets, at least in theory, no details can be made public until after the markets close. That means no communication with people outside once the lockup begins.

This week we sat down with Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie to find out what it’s like inside the lockup and how journalists deal with the challenges of reporting on the budget’s contents — which impact all Ontarians — without the benefit of contact with the outside world.

This year’s budget document is over 300 pages. Given the huge amount of information it contains, how do you choose which aspects will be most relevant to readers?

While we have a budget sked before we enter the lockup, it evolves during the day. The Star’s Queen’s Park Bureau as well as beat reporters, editorial writers, and columnists are also part of our contingent. We annually enlist the assistance of a Scotiabank economist who helps us in deciphering the sometimes impenetrable numbers in the massive document. The first thing I do every year is read the finance minister’s speech to the Legislature, where we glean the themes of the budget. I bring my noise-cancelling headphones and a playlist of jazz pianist Bill Evans and repair to a quiet corner to read it closely. I am looking both for information and compelling quotes for the main budget story. That’s the overview of our coverage and contains elements that will be explored more deeply in the various sidebars. If it’s interesting enough to be noteworthy to each other it’s probably going to be useful information for Star readers.

Are there any budget lockups that were particularly memorable for you in your nearly 18 years of covering provincial politics?

Probably the most eventful budget of the approximately 30 federal and provincial lockups I have been at was in May 2014. There was a minority Liberal government at the time so Premier Kathleen Wynne needed support from either Tim Hudak’s Progressive Conservatives or Andrea Horwath’s New Democrats. While we knew the Conservatives would not back the Liberals’ fiscal plan, the NDP had propped up the minority Liberals in the 2012 and 2013 budgets. But in 2014, we learned — after getting into the lockup — that Horwath was skipping the traditional opposition leaders’ press conferences because the New Democrats were going to vote against the budget. That meant we were having an election. Luckily, our colleagues who had not yet entered the lockup knew this so that message could get to the Star newsroom. But we were marooned all day in an essentially meaningless lockup knowing we were being plunged into an election.

Given that you are forbidden to talk to anyone outside the lockup, can you give us a sense of how it works and who you can talk to?

We have the entire day to study the budget and have press conferences with the finance minister and the opposition leaders in the lockup. That is for the stories we publish when the embargo is lifted after the minister rises to address the Legislature. There are no phones allowed in the lockup so we are cut off from the outside world. We can query Ministry of Finance bureaucrats about aspects of the budget, but only on a not-for-attribution basis. All political questions are directed to politicians. They turn on the Wi-Fi at 4 p.m. so we can file our stories, but until then we are in an Internet-free Twilight Zone.

What’s it like in there? Is it utter chaos? Coffee cups everywhere? Do you talk to other media or does everyone keep to themselves?

There are around 150 journalists from nearly every major newspaper, wire service, TV network, radio station, and online outlet in the province. Each news organization has its own assigned table with its logo on it, equipped with electrical power bars and microphones for the press conferences. All of the budget documents and news releases are placed on your chair before you arrive at 8 a.m. It’s a very social place — it can be like old home week catching up with colleagues from different media outlets — but everyone is busy and has work to do so it’s seldom too distracting. Usually a hot meal is served — lasagna and roasted chicken are past favourites. There is lots of coffee and tea to keep us awake and large carafes of refreshing cucumber and lemon-infused water to keep us hydrated.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This week, we look at how Freedom-of-Information legislation can allow governments to shield information from the public.

A great many public-interest stories that have appeared in the Toronto Star were the result of Freedom-of-Information requests made by journalists to government ministries, organizations and agencies.

Readers will often see phrases like “according to documents obtained through a Freedom-of-Information request,” or “documents uncovered through access-to-information legislation reveal ...” in stories about decisions our institutions make behind closed doors.

But what doesn’t get reported is the usually painstaking process journalists go through in an attempt to get the information. First they have to figure out exactly what to ask for. This is often followed by months-long — or sometimes years-long — delays and fights over the often high fees charged.

The high cost of accessing public records is a barrier to democracy, experts say

$32,000 and a 3-year wait: Star reporters share what it’s like trying to access public documents in Canada

Freedom-of-Information legislation gives members of the public who pay a $5 fee the right to ask municipal, provincial and federal governments for almost any kind information these institutions hold, with some exceptions. There are usually further fees for the time spent searching for the requests and making copies.

Requesters unhappy with the cost, the amount of time the request is taking, or the responsiveness of the government, can appeal to provincial and federal information and privacy commissioners for assistance. But this process can add months to an already slow process.

Journalists who use the system regularly have been complaining for years that the Freedom-of-Information system is broken, but little has been done by governments that has made it more accessible.

The recent travails of city hall reporter Jennifer Pagliaro, during her quest to uncover information from the City of Toronto about the controversial Scarborough subway extensions, show the lengths the media, as representatives of the public, have to go through to get information that is the property of the public.

In mid-2015, Pagliaro requested emails, memos, and other documents from the time council voted to scrap a light-rail line fully funded by the province to when council made the decision to build a subway instead.

“It’s so hard to get at the truth with issues like the Scarborough subway. There is so little evidence to justify building it and also a lot of misinformation. That makes it difficult to know if politicians are spending our money wisely,” Pagliaro said. “Are they doing it based on the facts or because of political motivations? Freedom of information laws are one of the ways we try to shed light on issues like a controversial subway project.”

City staff told Pagliaro that her request would cover thousands of emails and asked her to consider narrowing the requested search, which was for “Scarborough subway” and “Scarborough LRT.” She did not change her request. A month later, the city told Pagliaro its estimated fee for the information was $1,755, and that it needed a nine-month extension because staff whose records she had requested were too busy. (At the City of Toronto, staff whose records are requested must do their own searches, as opposed to Freedom-of-Information co-ordinators who do this at other government institutions.)

Pagliaro paid the $877.50 deposit (50 per cent of total fee estimate, as is required by law) but at the same time appealed the fee and the delay to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

During the appeal process, the city lowered its fee estimate to $1,485 but requested an additional year to fulfil the request.

After nearly a year of back-and-forth discussions with the commissioner’s office and waiting for a resolution, the commissioner ruled the city could have four more months to respond to Pagliaro’s request and that the fee estimate was reasonable.

Despite that ruling, however, the final batch of records was delivered to Pagliaro two weeks late. In all, it took nearly two years to get all of the records requested.

Among the revelations contained in the records: Prior to council’s July 2013 vote to approve the multibillion-dollar Scarborough subway, former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat tried but failed to convince her colleagues behind-the-scenes that the fully-funded seven-stop light-rail line was still the best plan.

“It concerns me that a system purporting to be designed to allow access to public information was set up to be incredibly onerous on the person seeking that information,” Pagliaro said. “The result is often legislated secrecy.”

The Star’s managing editor Irene Gentle adds the issue is bad enough for members of the press, “But this system is meant for everyone. The government is asking citizens not used to the system to try to navigate it with months or years of delays, mounting costs and appeals. The cost is public information remaining secret. That’s a dangerous thing.”

This week, we look at how the Star’s Growing Pains series was conceived with the goal of presenting solutions to challenges that come with Toronto’s increasing density.

A North York school that students can see from their apartment balconies but can’t attend. A cluster of modern waterfront condos in Etobicoke surrounded by traffic-clogged roads. Cars, trucks, streetcars and buses competing for space along crawling downtown streets during rush hour.

These are just a few of the challenges of living in an increasingly crowded city that the Star has explored in its Growing Pains series — a weekly examination of the impacts density is having on our ability to live, work, play and get around in Toronto.

Spearheaded by Doug Cudmore, senior editor in beats, bureaus and columnists, the project grew out of a newsroom discussion involving several editors and reporters late last year about how the Star could highlight the city’s housing issues. Common themes emerged from the discussion, such as affordability and livability. But the team decided to focus on density, and how the city deals with it, as it is one of the issues that most impacts our quality of life.

The team decided to highlight how various Toronto neighbourhoods were being affected by increasing density — and ways to make things better.

But where to start? Various beat reporters, namely Education Reporter Andrea Gordon, Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr, Real Estate Reporter Tess Kalinowski and City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro were asked to help map out potential areas of coverage.

Former intern reporter Alex McKeen (now a reporter for Metro News in Vancouver), helped kick off the series with a story that delved into census data to identify areas that were intensifying rapidly. She compared the number of people per hectare in each census tract between 2011 and 2016. What she found was some neighbourhoods, such as Liberty Village and Humber Bay Shores, were intensifying at rates many times the city’s average. Her research culminated in a story earlier this month on how developments are popping up across the GTA, often without sufficient access to transit, parks and schools.

Cudmore says he believes a lot of the problems facing Toronto aren’t due to density per se, but rather the fact that the city has a tendency to address density in “easy, profitable” ways, such as building more housing, while pushing the harder planning challenges further into the future.

“Think of the great upheaval we felt this winter as the city closed King St. W. to through traffic,” Cudmore says. “We have to get those overstuffed streetcars through, in large part because we suddenly built a dense neighbourhood in Liberty Village, but we didn’t quite build the transit capacity to deal with them. That’s not likely just going to be a one-off.”

When it comes to figuring out which services need to be addressed, the team relies on beat reporters who have spent months or years building contacts and observing changes in their areas of coverage.

To show how density is impacting how we educate our children, Education Reporter Andrea Gordon delved deeper into the Yonge and Sheppard area, where residents had been complaining for years about how their kids couldn’t go to the most nearby school. She wanted to give a first-hand look at the situation, reporting earlier this month of children in a North York highrise condominium who can look out over McKee Public School next door but can’t attend. That’s because the school is at 110 per cent capacity (the school has doubled in size to almost 800 students in the last 10 years).

Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr knew residents of Etobicoke’s Humber Bay Shores, made up of modern condo towers close to Lake Ontario, had been advocating for a new GO Train station nearby. He wrote a story published last weekend on the need to help alleviate its roadways that are clogged with traffic every weekday morning due to a poorly planned transportation network.

“Issues like municipal zoning bylaws and appeals at the Ontario Municipal Board may sound boring on their face, but they have a dramatic effect on the daily lives of citizens,” Spurr says. “I think what we were trying to get at with this series is how small decisions taken — or not taken — by local leaders can snowball and create huge problems for residents years down the line. The local government then needs to go back in and try to fix a problem that wouldn’t have been nearly as severe if collectively we’d exercised some forethought in the first place.”

Cudmore echoes Spurr’s assessment.

“One of the goals of this series is to tie together a few strands of urban frustration and to show readers that they were related,” he said. “The other was to look for solutions and give them some air; for instance, Andrea’s piece spelled out clearly how funding regulations meant that some kids might never get a chance to go to their neighbourhood school. There are changes that can be made on those fronts.”

Cudmore stresses Growing Pains isn’t about NIMBYism or fighting density.

“It’s the opposite of that. But if we don’t address the details of density, it’s a change that might not last.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-03-09,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star spent more than two years attempting to confirm that Toronto police use the controversial Stingray cellphone data-catching device.

Two and a half years ago, an adjudicator for the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario upheld a decision by the Toronto Police Services Board to neither confirm nor deny that the force had acquired cellphone data-capturing devices known as IMSI catchers, or Stingrays.

That decision came following a Freedom-of-Information request made by an unidentified citizen in an attempt to find out if the police had purchased the technology.

In his ruling, Information and Privacy Commissioner adjudicator Donald Hale wrote the disclosure of this information “could reasonably be expected to reveal investigative techniques which are either in use or could likely be used in law enforcement.”

Four months later, in an interview with the Star, Ontario Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish said it was not apparent to him that the public interest was given full consideration by the adjudicator. “Were we to have another appeal, I think it could lead to a different conclusion, let me put it that way,” Beamish said at the time.

That remarkable response prompted Star reporters Wendy Gillis, Kate Allen and Jayme Poisson to file their own Freedom-of-Information requests (later reduced to one) asking for confirmation of whether or not Toronto police use the technology.

This, despite the fact a Toronto police spokesperson had told the Star in 2015: “We do not use the Stingray technology and do not have one of the units.”

IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, or Stingrays, work by imitating cell towers thereby forcing phones within a certain range to connect to them. The devices are controversial because they are indiscriminate in targeting mobile phones. This means unique identifying cellphone data from innocent citizens in the vicinity of the police’s target is also collected.

“I think all three of us were picking up on the fact that there was this technology that police may — or may not — be using that could suck up a ton of personal data alongside the information they needed,” said Gillis in an interview. “It seemed unbelievable that they would be able to do this and not tell the public about it, meaning there could be no oversight or rights safeguards.”

But getting clarity would become a two-year saga for the reporters.

Police initially missed the 30-day deadline that institutions are given to process Freedom-of-Information requests, so the reporters appealed arguing a missed deadline was a “deemed refusal.”

The police eventually responded by saying no responsive records existed and closed the file.

The reporters appealed again, this time to the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

In the police response to the Commissioner, it was revealed that no electronic search had actually been conducted. The force had made inquiries with its legal, purchasing, telecom and intelligence departments and apparently confirmed that no records existed. However, they had not done an electronic search because they said they would get a “system error” resulting from too many hits, effectively crashing their computers, and that this would “unreasonably interfere with the operations of the police.”

The adjudicator called this justification “untenable” and ordered the police to do a further search.

The reporters then negotiated more narrow wording for their request with the Toronto police Freedom-of-Information co-ordinator in an attempt to speed up the process. This essentially reset the clock on the request, meaning police would be granted another 30 days to respond to the “new” request.

Finally, two years after their initial request, the reporters received an answer. Documents showed that Toronto police used the technology in five separate investigations since 2010.

The reporters published their findings on March 5. In the story, Mark Pugash, director of communications for Toronto police, was asked why police initially said they did not use the technology and did nothing to correct the record. He responded: “We should have.”

“Part of the problem is that secrecy begets secrecy. In this case, there was no established procedure or expectation that the public would be told about this,” said Gillis. “There is generally a lack of understanding about this tool, and what it is capable of — in part because we don’t know the extent to which it’s being used — that reduces the pressure on police to disclose this information in the first place.”

143,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/03/02/the-red-tape-behind-the-bruce-mcarthur-tapes.html,The red tape behind the Bruce McArthur tapes,"['Kenyon Wallace', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterfri.', 'March', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-03-02,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how judicial red tape almost stymied reporting on two court appearances of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

When the Star learns about an individual charged by Ontario police with high-profile crimes, reporters will often contact the Ministry of the Attorney General, police and court record offices to find out if the accused has any prior convictions.

In the case of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, the Star did just that and learned from the ministry that in 2003, McArthur had been convicted of one count of assault causing bodily harm and one count of assault with a weapon in relation to an incident two years prior. He was handed a conditional sentence of two years less and day and put on probation for three years.

The Star reported this in January. In early February, legal affairs reporter Jacques Gallant asked the ministry if there were any audio recordings from McArthur’s 2003 case. Gallant was curious to know what arguments were made by McArthur’s lawyers, the Crown attorney prosecuting the case, and whether or not McArthur spoke in court.

That seemingly simple request began what was to become a convoluted and frustrating odyssey through red tape as Gallant attempted to report on the proceeding.

Initially, the Ministry of the Attorney General told Gallant that staff at Old City Hall courthouse could find no recordings related to McArthur from 2003. Then, a week later, on Feb. 16, the ministry emailed Gallant to say that in fact there were recordings — one from January 2003, in which McArthur entered a guilty plea, and one from April 2003 for McArthur’s sentencing hearing. To access them, Gallant would need permission from the presiding judge and a court order. He was told this is judicial policy for recordings made prior to April 15, 2013. Since then, the introduction of digital recording devices has made recorded in-court proceedings easier to share with the media.

A ministry spokesperson said the ministry “recognizes that Ontario’s court system is based on the fundamental principles of openness and accessibility.”

In this case, because the presiding judge had retired, Gallant had to ask the local administrative judge at Old City Hall for the order. That judge wasn’t available for another five days.

On Feb. 21, Gallant finally got his day in court to ask for the recordings. The judge didn’t know if there were any publication bans on the 2003 proceedings and delayed her decision while court staff checked.

Later that day, once it was confirmed there were no publication bans, the Crown said he could prepare a draft order that night for the judge to sign the following day.

On Feb. 22, Gallant was told he could go to the courthouse to listen to the tapes or receive copies. The option he chose would have to be specified on the court order. He asked the Crown for copies, figuring it would be more convenient, and signed an agreement that he would not disseminate the recordings or let anyone else listen to them.

At around 2:30 p.m. that day, Gallant got word his request had been granted. He jumped in a cab and raced to the court reporters’ office at Old City Hall. Once there, he had to wait half an hour while copies were made.

But instead of providing the recordings of the 2003 McArthur proceedings on CD, the court reporters’ office gave him two cassette tapes. Gallant would need a Sony BM-246, a special tape recorder used in court, to listen to them.

“It’s like this massive machine straight out of the ’80s. We certainly did not have one of those at the Star and I wasn’t really sure where we’d get one,” Gallant said.

Trying another approach, Gallant’s editor, Matt Carter, sent out a mass email to Star staff asking: “Does anyone in the newsroom have a standard, 1980s-style cassette player on hand? (Or in their car?)”

“Colleagues started coming forward with cassette players caked in dust that had literally been sitting on their desks for years,” said Gallant.

After about half an hour, a working cassette player was found. However, Gallant said the voices on the recordings sounded like chipmunks and were unintelligible.

By then it was 6 p.m., just three hours from deadline and editors were keen to get the story if there was compelling material on the recordings.

Free audio software found on the internet proved to be the ticket. It slowed the audio on the tapes so Gallant could understand what was said in court.

Gallant began furiously transcribing. By 8:30 p.m. he had filed a story about McArthur’s first court appearance in 2003. The story revealed, among other things, that McArthur himself went to police shortly after he attacked a man on Halloween 2001.

The next day, Feb. 23, Gallant transcribed the recording of McArthur’s second 2003 court appearance — the sentencing hearing. The tape revealed the Crown’s reasoning for wanting to bar McArthur from the Gay Village and stay away from sex workers. The story also included a quote from McArthur apologizing.

“Courts are supposed to be open to the public. Yet even as a journalist who regularly covers courts, it was very difficult to get access to these recordings,” Gallant said. “I can’t imagine what a member of the public would have to go through to get access to this kind of a record.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
144,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/02/23/how-the-stars-editorial-cartoonists-turn-inspiration-into-funny-sometimes-cutting-social-commentary.html,"How the Star’s editorial cartoonists turn inspiration into funny, sometimes cutting, social commentary","['Kenyon Wallace', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterfri.', 'Feb.', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-23,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s editorial cartoonists turn inspiration into art.

On the afternoon before Valentine’s Day, Theo Moudakis sat down at his desk in his home office and instead of drawing, as one might expect the Toronto Star’s editorial cartoonist to do, he started writing poetry.

“Roses are red, I’m serious, dude, slide over close, I wanna collude,” was one poem Moudakis came up with. Here’s another: “I forgot to buy candy and flowers, my sweet, I’ve got an idea, I’ll send you a tweet.”

If you haven’t guessed, these were just two of four poems featured in Moudakis’ “Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards” editorial cartoon published on Feb. 14. The first poem accompanies a drawing of Trump with his arm around a bare-chested Vladimir Putin, while the second is written above a picture of Trump on his mobile phone next to his wife, Melania Trump, who is giving her husband the death stare.

The cartoon, a sequel of sorts to Moudakis’ first Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards cartoon last year that featured a similar theme, is a recent favourite of the artist.

“No cheap shots, nothing nasty, just funny,” says Moudakis, who has been creating editorial cartoons for the Star since 2000. “And it got enough people upset without it turning into an actual controversy. The laugh is always the cartoonist’s most lethal weapon.”

Indeed, Moudakis says it’s better to be funny than controversial. “Controversy is overrated. You don’t really want the entire city mad at you. Getting a good laugh always makes for the best cartoon.”

That’s not to say some readers won’t find editorial cartoons controversial or distasteful. In fact, controversy can and does play an important role in editorial cartoons. As the Star’s public editor Kathy English wrote in a November 2014 column, “editorial cartoons are visual commentaries, intended to make a point and make us think. Quite often, the best of them also offend and even infuriate some readers.”

As a commentator, Moudakis, who contributes most of the Star’s editorial cartoons, which appear on the editorial page, has licence to not only express his opinions about any given topic, but also to poke fun at, mock, scorn, taunt, and tease his subjects. Politicians in particular have long found themselves ripe for skewering by the editorial cartoonist’s pen.

“In the end, cartoonists aren’t journalists. The rules are different for us. We’re the only ones at a newspaper who don’t deal in facts or fairness, but I make sure to spread the unfairness around evenly,” he says.

Where does Moudakis find inspiration? Keeping up-to-date on the latest news is half the battle. His days start early, usually around 5:30 a.m. with a scan of morning news shows, newspapers and websites. By 8 a.m., he’s at his desk sketching ideas by hand, trying out wording and refining the message he wants to send.

“This is the most challenging and really the most thrilling part of the day. There’s nothing like nailing a good idea,” says Moudakis, who quit art school to become a cartoonist.

When he has something he thinks has merit, Moudakis will run it by his boss, editorial page editor Andrew Phillips, for feedback. Moudakis will then draw the final version of the cartoon on paper with a marker, scan it into his computer, and colour it digitally. He’s normally finished by 2 p.m.

In the case of the Trump Valentine’s Day cartoon, however, he started a day early in order to come up with four good poems.

“The poems done, I was free to leisurely draw everything the next morning, including all that hand-lettering,” he says. “It was one of those cartoons that was an absolute joy to do from beginning to end.”

Patrick Corrigan, who usually contributes the Star’s Saturday editorial cartoon, has a similar process, and says he looks for storylines with long shelf lives, due to the fact that he works ahead a few days.

“Over the years I’ve become patient if an idea is slow in coming,” Corrigan explains. “It’s like finding a parking spot downtown. Sometimes you just gotta go ‘round the block a few times.”

Corrigan says he gravitates towards social issues, trends and local politics.

Last Saturday’s cartoon, for example, humorously combined two current news events — Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party shakeup and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games — to make an observation about the turmoil facing the PCs. The cartoon featured several skiers flying uncontrollably off a long “Ontario PC Jump.”

“I was trying to lend a satirical take on their hapless process, so it was a natural fit to show them flying head over heels off the Olympic ski jump,” says Corrigan, who first joined the Star in 1983 as a staff illustrator.

At the end of the day, the job of an editorial cartoonist, says Corrigan, is to speak truth to power in an irreverent, satirical fashion.

“In other words, we hope to make the deserving subject choke on their morning oatmeal when they open their paper.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-16,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s sports department handles the demands of covering the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

At 9:51 p.m. last Sunday, Toronto Star sports editor Dave Washburn watched as Canada clinched its first gold medal in the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Washburn immediately alerted the news desk of the monumental achievement — a gold medal in the figure skating team event.

Knowing that the Canadian team had a good chance of winning a medal, Washburn had earlier asked senior editors if a later print deadline was possible. Normally, the final print deadline on Sundays is 11 p.m., but this time Washburn was able to secure an extra half-hour.

At 10:10 p.m., columnist Rosie DiManno, on assignment in Pyeongchang, South Korea — where it was around noon the next day — filed a 1,000-word piece on how Patrick Chan’s and Gabrielle Daleman’s free skate performances lifted the Canadian team to the top of the podium.

DiManno’s story was quickly edited by the sports desk and sent online at 10:37 p.m. It was laid out for the newspaper and went to press at 11:12 p.m.

The adrenalin-fuelled rush to get the story in the paper is illustrative of the situations Washburn (working in Toronto) and his team in South Korea — columnists DiManno, Bruce Arthur and Dave Feschuk, along with reporter Kerry Gillespie and photographer Steve Russell — have faced daily as they work to keep Star readers up to date on the Games.

Keeping a close eye on developments and anticipating outcomes played a big role in ensuring the Canadian figure skating team’s gold medal made it into print.

“We knew on Saturday night the Canadian team was in prime position to win gold, but the expected end time was going to be right after our one and only Sunday print deadline,” said Washburn in an interview. “On Sunday night, we were able to push back the print deadline, which gave us an extra half-hour. When you’re dealing with tight deadlines and not knowing what can happen in the games, those extra minutes matter.”

Preparations for the games — getting accreditation for journalists, finding accommodations close to events and determining arrival and departure dates — started a year ago with the help of both the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee.

To know which athletes to watch closely, the team focused on past performances and popularity. For example, the team knew figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir would be popular competitors given their history of medal wins and on-ice chemistry.

Washburn says he is also relying on the knowledge of beat reporter Gillespie, who covers amateur sports for the Star, in guiding the newspaper’s coverage. For example, Gillespie recommended following speedskater Kim Boutin, who took the bronze in the women’s 500 metres, and Alex Gough, who took the bronze in women’s singles luge.

“We want to make sure we’re at events when there’s a good chance of us hitting the podium,” Washburn said.

A few days before the Games began, Washburn started working overnight shifts. And since the opening ceremony, Star web editors have been working day and night to update thestar.com in real time.

The 14-hour time difference between South Korea and Toronto wreaks havoc with work hours and sleeping patterns for all involved in the coverage.

Print media, by its nature, is not as immediate as television, which affords opportunities to go behind the scenes of the drama to tell stories that aren’t suited to live TV.

“Our columnists are some of the best at that. Having the ability to make you chuckle, make you shed a tear perhaps — maybe even make you angry,” Washburn said.

For example, earlier this week, Arthur wrote an article about speedskater Ted-Jan Bloemen’s emotional response to his Olympic gold medal victory. In the crowd, his wife was also crying, but because she had just learned of the loss of a friend’s baby.

To extend the Star’s coverage, a few reporters in Toronto write a daily roundup of the quirkier goings-on at the Games — gleaned from wire services, Star reporter dispatches and photos. This is labelled “Olympic Notables” and is published on page 2 of the sports section each day. Topics have included the eating habits of athletes, funny or odd utterances by competitors and those covering them, and interesting fashion choices.

“We want to give our readers not only the latest Olympic news to the best of our ability, but also provide insight regarding athletes and events so that they come away from our coverage feeling like they have a better, fuller picture of what’s going on,” Washburn said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-09,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau balances the demands of covering three major political parties.

Since Patrick Brown resigned as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives over sexual misconduct allegations just over two weeks ago, the troubles facing the party have been top stories in the Toronto Star every day.

The upheaval rocking the official Opposition — which has also seen Rick Dykstra resign as party president in the face of sexual assault allegations, and investigations into suspect membership lists and questionable party spending in the Brown era — has made for a busy time for the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau.

Add to that the PC’s rush to elect a new leader ahead of this summer’s provincial election at a time when the sitting Liberals are set to table their 2018 budget, and readers might wonder how the bureau is able to juggle covering all three parties thoroughly and fairly.

“Adrenalin and caffeine help,” says Robert Benzie, the Queen’s Park bureau chief, who along with fellow reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy, and columnist Martin Regg Cohn, work to hold Ontario’s elected officials to account and keep the public informed.

In the race to replace Brown, each of the leadership hopefuls — Christine Elliott, Doug Ford and Caroline Mulroney — have their supporters and detractors keenly observing how much press their candidate is getting.

“Any one of them could be the next premier of Ontario, so we have to take them all very seriously,” said Benzie in an interview, noting that he strives for equal coverage of all candidates. “It’s early days yet, but for example, there’s a leadership debate next week and we will cover it. It doesn’t mean that every candidate will get exactly the same number of words in the story, but we try to give them equal time.”

The fact that all three leadership candidates have greater-than-usual name recognition hasn’t affected how the bureau is covering the leadership race, says Benzie, but it has generated intense reader interest.

“Christine Elliott is a known commodity given that this is her third run at the leadership, and her late husband, Jim Flaherty, ran twice before. Caroline Mulroney is the eldest child of a very famous Canadian political figure, and Doug Ford is a well-known Toronto councillor and brother to the late ex-mayor of Toronto Rob Ford,” he said. “So you have three big names in a race and that is always interesting.”

How does the bureau cope with balancing the demands of covering the PC party with the demands of covering the other two major political parties?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Liberals and the New Democrats have been content lately to go to ground and let the turmoil in the PC party, currently led by interim leader Vic Fedeli, consume the headlines.

“It’s an old political axiom that when your opponents are pouring gasoline on themselves and lighting a match, you stand back,” said Benzie. “I think Mr. Fedeli has done a good job in terms of making changes from the Brown era, but if you’re the Liberals or the New Democrats, you just want to say stand back, and let the Tories do their thing. Then, after the dust settles, come in and shoot the wounded.”

The Star’s trust committee periodically hears from readers who perceive the newspaper’s political coverage as biased in favour of the Liberals. Since 1987, the Star’s editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, has endorsed the Liberals in every provincial election, except in 1999 when the newspaper endorsed Howard Hampton’s NDP. But any suggestion that this affects how the newspaper’s Queen’s Park reporters do their jobs is nonsense, says Benzie.

“I used to work for the Toronto Sun and the National Post and I’m the same reporter that I was then. I didn’t care about the editorials at those outlets and I don’t care about the editorials at the Star,” he said.

Ferguson agreed: “I used to cover Queen’s Park for The Canadian Press during the last months of Bob Rae and the beginning of Mike Harris’s government. No one called me a Liberal hack back then.”

Ferguson points out that he spent all of September, October and November of last year covering two political corruption trials involving the Liberals — the byelection bribery trial in Sudbury and the gas plants trial in Toronto. He added the Star was one of the few media organizations to attend the gas plants trial every day.

Rushowy, who joined Queen’s Park a year-and-a-half ago, stressed that bureau reporters do their best to get voices from all three major parties in stories, as the parties all have elected representatives at Queen’s Park.

“We try to give readers as many viewpoints as possible,” she said.

At the end of the day, says Benzie, it would be detrimental to the Star’s ability to cover politics if any reporters were seen to be leaning toward any party.

“You don’t want anyone thinking you’re a Liberal or Tory or NDP hack, because then the other two parties won’t talk to you,” he said, adding he does not vote in any elections. “We take this place seriously and because we do, we are taken seriously.”

This week, we present highlights of the Star’s recent Ask Me Anything on Reddit.

One of the primary goals of the Toronto Star’s trust project, launched last May, is to be more transparent about how we do our journalism.

Hence the decision to hold an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit, an online news aggregation and rating website where users can post content and discuss a wide array of topics.

Over a two-hour period last Tuesday, a group of Star reporters and editors responded to more than 60 questions from readers.

What follows is a sampling of the questions and answers from the AMA. Some have been shortened for space, but you can read the full text on reddit.com.

What is the top municipal story in Toronto that nobody’s talking about? — Zombie_John_Strachan

Columnist Edward Keenan: The thing about this question is that if I thought a story was the top one in the city, I’d be talking about it — and I assume the same goes for most editors and reporters. So finding the pressing issue everyone’s ignoring is hard, since we wouldn’t ignore it if we knew about it and thought it was very important. That said, I think that the dire lack of affordable housing in the city, and the desperate inability of Toronto Community Housing to fill the gap for the poorest in the city, remains an under-discussed story. It does get talked about, but it’s a crisis.

How does Daniel Dale stay sane going from covering Ford to covering Trump? — Knowitall99

Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale: It’s actually so much fun. Obviously exhausting and often ridiculous, but what more can you ask for as a journalist? The stories are both important and entertaining, you’re able to hold powerful people accountable, readership is super high, and you’re not putting yourself at physical risk the way journalists are in a war zone or disaster zone ... So there are moments when I just want to nap, but I mostly love it.

I’m very curious as to how you go about correcting an error that has already been published, and how often you see mistakes and how they’re handled. — RJJouranls

Public Editor Kathy English: Once we verify an error we correct on the platform the mistake was published on as promptly as is possible. The goal of a correction is to provide the correct information and make clear a mistake occurred. We logged about 1,100 corrections in print and online in 2017. Most of the mistakes are from online platforms.

What was it like last week at the Star when the Patrick Brown story broke so late in the evening? Are people woken up, called back from home, etc.? — LesterBePiercin

Queen’s Park Reporter Kris Rushowy: Our Queen’s Park bureau chief, Robert Benzie, was at home with his kids when he got a call about Brown’s 9:45 p.m. press conference, and raced over to the Legislature. He was up well into the night filing updates. Reporters don’t get a lot of wake-up calls, but when there is big news on our beats, we work — late nights, early mornings, holidays, you name it.

Do you have any strategic initiatives to avoid enabling loud-mouthed, extreme, populist election candidates by covering their shenanigans? We’ve seen this issue a lot with the Fords and Trumps of the world. — sunlightjunkieRiverdale

City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro: This is tough. Look at the Ford example. In 2010, Ford was a councillor known for politically incorrect statements on the council floor who few believed could ever be mayor. Our bureau chief, David Rider, was one of the first mainstream media reporters to start paying attention to his campaign and realize he had a base of support that could make him a contender. To me, that’s something our readers should know about … Turns out, he knew before many that Ford could win and he was right.

The Star seems to be working with the CBC more and more, especially for investigative projects. What are the benefits of working together? Do you think these partnerships will happen more frequently? — Soshane

Investigative Reporter Diana Zlomislic: In the past few years, we’ve actually been joining forces with more news media outlets across the world for big investigations like the Panama Papers. Reporter Robert Cribb and editor Lynn McAuley created our investigative co-production team as a way to share resources on big stories. This is the future, we think: news organizations working together more on large projects.

Just wanted to ask, directed broadly at all of you, if you think there’s a real future for young people looking to get into journalism? I’m in my final year of J-school now and I’m pretty disillusioned. — friendsfromgr8

Reporter Fatima Syed: I totally get the disillusionment but don’t let it overcome you! There are multiple opportunities in the industry right now for a young journalist, ranging from freelancing to stints at places like the Star. There are risks in everything but keep hustling. Pitch stories everywhere, apply to places like the Star who accept a wide range of interns of all levels of experience every year.

Things are definitely changing with people looking towards more digital stuff. The main takeaway is just learn as many skills as you can now as a young journalist ... It’s hard, and at times disheartening, but not impossible. Take it from a girl who applied three times before she got the Star internship.

What’s a story that you’ve published that went against your personal beliefs? — TorontoJD

Photographer Steve Russell: Wow, what a great question. I think we cover stories all the time that may go against my personal beliefs. It’s strange because sometimes covering a story or watching a story develop I might change my belief!

What is the role of print media in society in 2018? How do you envision the future of the Toronto Star 10 years from now? — SheerDumbLuck

Managing Editor Irene Gentle: In terms of news organizations like the Star, print is just one of the platforms we publish on. Its legacy is really the journalistic values it has ingrained in us — things like responsible reporting, checks and balances, such as our public editor, Kathy English, our membership in the national news-media council, and our daily talk about journalistic ethics as it pertains to news we cover … Now we take those same principles and apply them to the different platforms. We look to make a difference, to produce solid investigative and accountability journalism on many platforms … That is the how I see the Star in 10 years — the platform matters less than the work that is produced.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-01-26,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s style committee strives to maintain a clear, consistent and sensitive presentation of content.

Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”? Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv? Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang? Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

These are just a few questions tackled recently by the Star’s style committee, whose role is to ensure consistency in editorial style across all Star platforms. (See how the committee dealt with these questions in the fact box at the end of this article).

Words are powerful, and that’s why members of the style committee, made up of editors and reporters, take their job seriously.

This involves being a resource for the newsroom, keeping the Star’s stylebook up to date with contemporary terms and conventions of usage, and weighing in on style-related questions and concerns raised by readers, often relayed by the public editor.

What does the word “style” mean in the context of the Star’s various platforms?

Anthony Collins, the Star’s style chief and co-chair of the style committee, describes style as a set of rules about the language the Star uses, encompassing everything from spelling and capitalization to how we treat numbers and measurements, and the word choices we make when we report on sensitive issues.

“Style is important because it makes our writing clearer, more accurate and more consistent, all of which promote trust in our journalism. It also ensures we’re up to date with language change, while being respectful of the communities we serve, and helps give the Star its distinctive voice,” said Collins in an interview.

Star style is informed by a broad range of sources, including The Canadian Press, which publishes both a stylebook and a capitalization and spelling guide that are used by various media outlets. Other considerations come from the developing use of terms or phrases by the public and feedback from readers.

Sometimes a style is adopted to make stories easier for readers to find. For example, the Star’s style guide uses the spelling Al Qaeda rather than al-Qaida because the first spelling is more common and makes our stories easier to find online.

Style decisions are also made by the newsroom’s top editors, such as in the move to use Daesh instead of ISIS, mainly because the Islamic State is considered neither Islamic nor a state.

Because of the Star’s broad readership, the newsroom is constantly trying to strike a balance between using language that is easily understood by most of our readers, and using terms that are considered up to date and respectful by specific communities, Collins said.

For example, last year, public editor Kathy English announced the Star had decided to capitalize “Indigenous” in all cases, and “Black” in reference to Black people, identity, culture and community. This came about after the style committee had received many passionate and thoughtful arguments in favour of making these changes as a mark of respect. The committee consulted widely with individuals and community groups and then rewrote two sections of the Star’s stylebook.

“I believe decisions as small as changes in newspaper style can have a major effect on marginalized communities and the way they’re seen,” Collins said. “Look at the way the conversation has changed around mental illness, for example. Not using ‘schizophrenic’ as a careless metaphor, or choosing to say ‘die by suicide’ instead of ‘commit suicide,’ can help lessen the stigma. Social justice is one of the Star’s guiding principles and I think our language use should reflect our philosophy.”

A hard-and-fast rule isn’t always the answer in many cases. For instance, Star style dictates that gender-neutral terms are preferred for occupations, such as firefighter and flight attendant, but the term “actress” is still used when it comes to award show nominations.

Then there’s the sheer practicality that comes with a clear and consistent style, says the Star’s style committee co-chair Jon Ohayon. If editors and reporters are confused about what terms and spellings to use, when to convert measurements to metric, or what currency to use, time can be wasted. A lack of consistency can also make it hard to find previous stories or photos in the Star’s archive or online — and also lead to an impression of carelessness.

“For example, it would look sloppy or ridiculous to have a headline that says ISIS on one story and one that says Daesh on another, or to have two different spellings of a city, country or person on the same page,” said Ohayon.

“Without style, we would be a mess and that leads to a loss of trust.”

What did the Star’s style committee decide?

1. Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”?

In the Star, it’s The 6. We found that was the most common and clearest way to write it.

2. Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv?

We follow The Canadian Press style (which adopts the Ukrainian rather than the Russian spelling). It’s Kyiv.

3. Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang?

We follow The Canadian Press and The Associated Press and spell it Pyeongchang. Definitely not Pyongyang.

4. Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

It has an ombudsman, currently Susan Opler. Many offices use ombudsman as a gender-neutral term, derived from Swedish. The Star follows the preference of the office in question.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-01-19,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Opinions Editor Scott Colby curates a wide range of viewpoints from contributors across political, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Everyone has an opinion.

Scott Colby, the Star’s Opinions Editor, confronts this truism every day.

Colby will receive, on an average day, between 10 and 15 opinion pieces from members of the public covering a whole host of topics. Those hoping to get published run the gamut of the professional world, from politicians, academics, and economists, to lawyers, businesspeople, and health-care professionals. He also hears regularly from non-profit groups, agencies and students.

His job is to sort through the submissions, choosing pieces that provide readers with thoughtful commentary on public interest issues. And that’s in addition to handling opinion pieces from the Star’s regular staff and nonstaff columnists that appear on the page opposite the Editorials page.

This week we sat down with Colby, who’s been the Opinions Editor since May 2016 and an editor at the Star for 20 years, to find out how he presents a wide range of opinions on issues of the day.

How are the opinion pieces you edit, also known as “op-eds,” different from those written by Star columnists?

An op-ed is an old-fashioned name for an opinion piece, or column. Op-ed is an abbreviation of the phrase “opposite the editorial page.” Historically, newspapers publish an editorial page that is home to editorials, an editorial cartoon and letters. The opposite page of the same spread contains columns and other opinion pieces. An op-ed is no different from an opinion piece from a Star columnist in the sense that they are both articles of opinion on a timely topic. Columnists have the prestige of being a regular contributor whose writing and arguments are considered to be of a consistently high standard and they’ve earned the right to express their opinions in that paper up to three to four times a week. They also get a logo.

What makes a good op-ed in your opinion?

I tell people I am looking for three things in a good op-ed: the topic must be timely, it must be well written, and it must be well argued. There is a distinction to be made between well written and well argued. You can have a nicely written article that essentially doesn’t saying anything or make a point. Where I think many writers miss the mark is they don’t understand that an op-ed needs to have a thesis; it needs to be an argument about an issue. We are not looking for a press release in disguise.

How do you solicit op-eds and what do you look for?

When I solicit op-eds it’s because I’m looking for a commentary piece, or pieces, on a specific topic, such as NAFTA or Indigenous issues. In such cases, I am looking for an excellent writer and a person with expertise, or even a newsmaker directly involved in the issue. Soliciting op-eds can take quite a bit of time, which is a rare commodity these days. When I started this job, for example, I felt we needed to hear directly from Indigenous writers and leaders, as opposed to well-meaning supporters, so I reached out. We’ve published op-eds from Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, Grassy Narrows Chief Simon Fobister, and Indigenous academics at Trent University. We also want our Opinion page to reflect the changing demographic of the city and country, so having diverse voices is important. Like all mainstream media, we can do a better job, but we believe it is vital to publish diverse voices and we continually aspire to provide them for our readers.

Many of the opinion pieces the Star publishes express views that are counter to the newspaper’s more social-justice leanings. Is this deliberate, and if so, why?

We strongly believe the Opinion page needs to be an open-minded venue. It is an excellent forum for debating the important issues of the day. To be clear, we will never intentionally publish anything that is hateful, insulting or bigoted. But I frequently select commentary that I don’t necessarily agree with, or that puts forward an opinion that contradicts our own editorials. If the author makes a compelling case on a timely issue, it benefits everyone when we publish those views to contribute to the debate. It’s important to listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to understand where each side is coming from. When we can really listen and understand, hopefully we’ll learn something about their motivations, for instance, that might make us more sympathetic, or it might expose something less innocent that deserves scrutiny.

We are not interested in being an echo chamber where readers only listen to the people they agree with. I love it when we can publish a page that contains opposing views on the same topic, as long as both pieces are well written and well argued. For example, earlier this month we published two op-eds taking different stands on the minimum wage increase, one by Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the other by Premier Kathleen Wynne.

What message do you have for those readers who may view the op-ed pages as a pulpit for politicians to spread positive PR messages about themselves?

We receive a lot of op-eds from politicians and we reject most of them on the basis that they are essentially glorified press releases. When it comes to op-eds, we hold politicians to a higher standard than the public. Their op-eds must be saying something new and adding to the understanding of an important issue. We are vigilant in preventing the Star’s opinion pages from becoming an extension of a politician’s PR department.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-01-12,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we focus on how Jacques Gallant, the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, keeps tabs on what goes on in Ontario’s justice system.

There is an aphorism often quoted by lawyers and the journalists who cover legal proceedings: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.”

That saying, which originated more than 90 years ago from Gordon Hewart, lord chief justice of England, is constantly in the back of Jacques Gallant’s mind while he navigates the complex world of Ontario’s courts and tribunals.

As the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, Gallant takes readers inside the justice system, highlighting precedent-setting cases and rulings that impact the public, and pointing out problems, such as delays in cases coming to trial.

To find stories, Gallant talks to lawyers and members of the public about cases they are involved in, checks with the various colleges that regulate health-related professions, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, to find out which of their members are facing disciplinary hearings, and mines CanLii, a free online database containing most Canadian court decisions.

But keeping readers enlightened about the goings-on of our legal system relies on the assumption that the courts and tribunals are by default open to the public, as they should be. In practice, however, Gallant has found this is not always the case.

“The courts are supposed to be presumptively public, which means that anyone should be able to walk into a courthouse and request to view the file from a court case,” said Gallant.

But on numerous occasions, Gallant has encountered courts and tribunals that seem to have secrecy as their default setting — meaning Star readers, and by extension the public, aren’t able to get a full picture of what is going on in these public institutions.

“In my own experience, I’ve dealt with courthouse staff across the GTA who give me strange looks when they find out I’m not a lawyer, but rather a journalist,” Gallant said. “I’ve had to wait weeks to get access to even the most basic of court documents, known as ‘the information,’ which lists the charges an accused person is facing as well as their next court date.”

Indeed, early last year, the Star launched a legal challenge against the provincial government to end the secrecy surrounding the province’s tribunal system, which handles accusations around human rights abuses, police misconduct, and environmental offences. The Star’s case is ongoing.

Gallant said accessing court exhibits, even in cases that are no longer active and for which higher courts have ruled that exhibits should be public, is also often difficult.

“Documents such as these are crucial in order to accurately and fairly report on a legal matter,” he said.

Case in point: when reporting on the ongoing case of Dr. Javad Peirovy, a Toronto doctor found by the College of Physicians’ discipline committee to have sexually abused four female patients, and who is fighting in court to keep his medical licence, Gallant had trouble accessing documents related to the case.

In 2016, the discipline committee ruled to suspend Peirovy for six months, rather than revoke his licence. The college disagreed with this ruling, and appealed the decision by its own committee to the Divisional Court.

At the time, in order to provide readers with a full picture of the case, Gallant sought to obtain Peirovy’s arguments at Divisional Court for why Peirovy should retain his licence. As it turned out, this was not an easy task.

When Gallant asked the Divisional Court for Peirovy’s official response to the appeal, a court official told him the file was with the judges and could not be accessed.

So Gallant reached out to Peirovy’s lawyer, who would not provide the official response either.

Gallant then had to reach out to the Ministry of the Attorney General to make his case that the file should be made available to him. The ministry, in turn, contacted the court, and a few days later Gallant was told he could now view the file at the Divisional Court.

“If not for (the ministry’s intervention), I would not have been able to report a complete picture of the Peirovy case,” Gallant said.

The college ended up winning its appeal, but Peirovy then appealed to the Court of Appeal. A decision has yet to be released.

These types of situations — where public documents are not readily accessible to the public — discredit the legal system, Gallant said.

“For the Canadian justice system to retain its credibility, it needs to be open and transparent,” he said. “The public needs to be assured that the justice system is working, and reporters act as their representatives in court.”

151,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2017/09/29/readers-need-to-distinguish-news-from-opinion-public-editor.html,Readers need to distinguish news from opinion: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Sept.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-09-29,"Do you have a clear understanding of what is news and what is opinion in the Star?

Perhaps this distinction is not totally evident to you. Based on many conversations with readers, it is clear to me that one of the key sources of misunderstanding about the Star and its journalism is a considerable measure of confusion about how to distinguish between news and opinion.

As a Star reader you have a right to know if what you are reading in the Star is news – verified information based in the impartial reporting of facts – or opinion – a column or editorial based on the personal interpretation and judgments of facts.

The Star’s statement of principles has long expressed this core value, stating that, “Sound practice demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion.

“All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate.”

While the Star has long strived to make this distinction clear in the newspaper through the use of various design elements (such as a columnist’s “logo”) intended to denote a piece of opinion journalism, my communications with readers over the past decade tell me these devices are often inadequate for those who don’t understand our design shorthand.

Further muddying these waters is the fact that “opinion” logos, which include a journalist’s photo, are sometimes used on news stories too. How is a reader supposed to distinguish news from opinion?

Discerning news from opinion within the Star’s digital world — on the website, mobile apps and social media postings – is even more of a challenge for readers. Here the Star too often falls short of its own principle. Many days, opinion columns expressing strong views about controversial issues are presented in a similar manner as news stories, within news sections of those digital platforms, with no signposts to indicate that what you are reading is not the news but in fact someone’s opinion about the news.

The clearest way to tell readers that an article represents a writer’s views is to label it as opinion. The Star is now taking steps to do a better job of this on all its platforms.

The Star’s trust initiative , launched in May to look into how the Star can foster greater reader trust and develop journalistic and technological tools to bridge the trust and media literacy gap, identified the need to differentiate news from opinion as a priority issue. This group spent much of the summer looking at how to more clearly and consistently signal to readers on all platforms — including the Star’s social media feeds — when articles are analysis or opinion.

I expect the Star will soon move forward on recommendations to provide stronger signposts to readers about whether they are reading news, analysis or opinion and also give readers clarity about the definitions of various sorts of content.

This is vital at this time of diminishing trust in journalism when the sheer volume of opinions and conjecture about the news can overwhelm the real reporting of verified information.

Indeed, as news organizations around the world grapple with a crisis of trust in journalism, the need to guide audiences to a clear understanding of how to distinguish news from opinion has emerged as a significant indicator of journalistic trust. Several ongoing global trust projects have fixed on the need to do a better job of this.

“One of the most common themes from users is that they are tired of blurred lines between fact and opinion,” Joy Mayer, head of the Trusting News Project, wrote recently in an article reporting on the project’s research into reader feedback on the credibility and trustworthiness of news.

The Trust Project at California’s Santa Clara University has identified the need for labels on content to identify news from opinion as a trust indicator. That project aims to create tools for readers to recognize trustworthy reporting and for platforms such as Google to identify and feature high quality journalism.

A working group of the California-based project has set out clear definitions for various types of content and recommends that news organizations be transparent in sharing those definitions with readers. Both its definitions and recommendation for transparency are aligned with the recommendations of the Star’s trust committee.

That group defines news as articles, “based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources…News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author.”

Opinion articles “advocate for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author/producer’s interpretation of fact and data. Opinion pieces may include reported facts or quotes, but emphasize the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions,” it states.

My opinion: these are smart recommendations critical for enhancing trust in journalism.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2018-01-19,"As the Star reported this week, the Toronto District School Board says it never discussed the implications of allowing an 11-year-old girl to speak to a barrage of reporters after she had made false allegations that her hijab had been cut.

It was “not part of the conversation,” TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star on Tuesday.

In the interests of transparency, I think it only fair that the Star disclose that there was never any conversation in our newsroom about whether to publish the girl’s name and photographs of her taken at the school board.

The Star has no explicit policies on interviewing or identifying children. Its relatively vague guidelines on children are expressed in our standards manual in a section on privacy: “Children and teenagers — particularly those under the age of 16 who may not fully understand the implications of speaking to the media — command a special sensitivity,” it states.

Family offers ‘sincere apologies’ for 11-year-old girl’s false hijab-cutting story

TDSB did not discuss implications of letting 11-year-old face media over hijab story

Attack on girl wearing a hijab didn’t happen, police say. Why did TDSB let the 11-year-old face the cameras?

As well, it advises that photographers “should be sensitive when photographing children under 16 without permission of a parent or guardian.”

In practice, I know that the newsroom often debates and discusses issues related to children in the news and is particularly sensitive to this when children are victims of crime.

So why didn’t that conversation happen here in this case? Why was no consideration whatsoever given to the possibility of shielding this child’s identity from public view?

The answer is simple and, to me, understandable: This girl’s speaking before media at the school board offices, with school board officials and her mother present, provided sanction for the Star and other media outlets to identify her.

As editor Michael Cooke told me: “The girl was put forward by responsible and caring adults, including her mother. That was enough for me.”

Parental permission to identify children in the news is indeed a significant factor in any judgment call on this issue and is generally the standard stated in those ethics codes that provide specific guidelines on covering children, including Britain’s Editor’s Code of Practice.

In a statement to the media Wednesday, the family said it chose to make the story public, “horrified that there was such a perpetrator who may try to harm someone else.” The mother made clear that at that time, she too believed her daughter’s story. The family has declined the Star’s requests for interviews and expressed its “sincere apologies to every Canadian.”

After Toronto police reported Monday morning that investigators had determined the attack did not happen, the Star decided not to name the girl. I believe that is the right decision and further, that we should consider removing her name from last week’s news reports so this story is not connected to her online identity for the rest of her life. Whatever happened — and it would seem this child told quite a lie — we must remember that she is just a child.

Had that public event at the girl’s school — in effect, a press conference with her mother and her speaking to media — not occurred, it’s likely the initial story would have been limited to reporting what Toronto police had said in the news release that first alerted media to what then was presented as a shocking story for our community. That release, which did not provide the child’s name, reported that an 11-year-old girl was walking to school when she was approached from behind by a man who pulled the hood off her jacket and then cut her hijab with a pair of scissors.

“This is being investigated as a hate crime,” stated that news release, which also included a detailed description of the man.

While the girl’s story was found to be false, this was not “fake news” as some critics have charged. The breaking news reports were based on information from reliable sources: an official police news release about a hate crime investigation involving a child, and an invitation by the school board for the media to talk to the girl with her mother presiding. On the face of it — based on what those valid sources said at that time, and the rush to condemnation by politicians at all levels of government — this was real news.

And now that we know it is not true, all of the institutions involved — including the media — are left to ask ourselves what lessons can be learned here. For my part, I hope this sparks deeper conversation in the media about specific rules on covering and naming children in the digital age.

On that, I was alerted this week to a 2004 Journalism Studies article by Romayne Smith Fullerton, an associate professor at Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies, entitled “Covering Kids: Are journalists guilty of exploiting children?” (Full disclosure: the faculty awarded me a teaching fellowship and I’m now teaching a graduate course on critical issues in media literacy.)

Smith Fullerton examines how media might better assure that children’s stories are told in a responsible, ethical manner and raises the uncomfortable idea that parents might not always know what is best for their children — or fully understand the implications — when it comes to putting them forward to the media.

As she states, in making a strong case that children deserve special care and attention by the media, “few journalists or media outlets rigorously or systematically consider what coverage may mean for children and very few have detailed protocols about interacting with minors.”

Smith Fullerton contends that the media should consider more rigorous consent protocols similar to those required by academic researchers who interview children. She acknowledges the difficulty of this for newsrooms, particularly in breaking news situations.

I agree that the detailed protocols demanded in academia are likely unworkable in the newsroom. But I am aligned with her greater point that “media outlets need to develop valid, respectful and specific procedures for covering children,” and we have some responsibility to make sure parents understand the implications of media coverage of their children.

Children are vulnerable sources and the implications of any news coverage involving them should always be part of the conversation.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-12-01,"Folks: This is Journalism 101 — be skeptical. “If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out,” states an age-old adage preached to generations of journalists.

Believe nothing at face value; verify what sources say; check and double check. That is what we call due diligence in journalism. This is a core value of the Star’s journalistic standards.

I am not the first journalist to say that the Washington Post provided journalists and readers at large alike with a textbook example this week of due diligence at work in journalism.

Call this the triumph of real reporting.

The Washington Post’s report about a woman who came to Post reporters with what turned out to be a fabricated story about having been impregnated when she was a teenager by Alabama’s Senate candidate Roy Moore, deserves all the accolades it has received for ultimately exposing a scheme to deceive and embarrass that news organization and, in so doing, showing why journalistic standards matter.

As the Post reported, a woman approached its reporters to share a dramatic story about an alleged affair with Moore that led to an abortion when she was 15. Had it been true, this would have indeed been big news.

Here is what bears understanding here. Real reporters do not simply publish what anyone tells them, no matter how dramatic the story presented. Real reporting demands that journalists always take steps to verify what sources tell them, check out the reliability of all sources, seek documentation to back up what sources tell them, ask questions, go back and ask more questions.

The Post reporters were straight with the woman about their fact-checking process, even as the woman pushed them to give their opinion about Moore and whether the story could bring down his candidacy.

In checking out the woman’s story, inconsistencies emerged. Further checking of public records and internet searches uncovered information indicating the woman quite likely worked for Project Veritas, an organization that aims to discredit journalists and mainstream media outlets by trying to trick them into publishing hoax stories and admitting to biased reporting.

But, here, the Post turned the tables and exposed the attempted sting with a first-rate investigative sting operation of its own, in which it confronted the woman with the facts while a hidden camera captured it all on video. Then, the Post published its tour de force report detailing its meticulous reporting about how it discovered the truth about the woman and Project Veritas.

That report also serves as a master class in the journalistic transparency today’s media environment demands. The Post explained its standards to readers, telling them why it had secretly photographed the woman and why it reported her previous off-the-record comments. “We always honour ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, the Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. . . . We can’t honour an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.”

All of this was journalistic rigour writ large, a prime example of what reporters and editors at serious news organizations like the Star do daily in meeting the standards required by the law and our longstanding ethics policies. While it is disconcerting that individuals and organizations would seek to trick the media into publishing false information — and journalists quite rightly fear being taken in by such hoaxes — we believe that the strong standards of due diligence in which we hold our journalists provides significant protection against our publishing such blatantly bogus information.

“This is how good journalists do their jobs and how they don’t get taken in by hoaxes,” Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and an expert in media law, said in an Associated Press report of the thwarted hoax. “It’s such an important lesson.”

Indeed, as Post writer Callum Borchers, who covers the intersection of media and politics, wrote this week, journalistic vetting — the essence of what we do — prevented a false claim from being published: “A Project Veritas plot designed to embarrass the media by exposing recklessness demonstrated the media’s care instead.”

In a world in which a previously unimaginable amount of misinformation and disinformation go viral every day, trustworthy journalism from journalists and news organizations that hold themselves to high professional standards and do the real work of reporting to verify facts matters more than ever.

The lessons learned here are important reminders for journalists and citizens alike: Just because someone says it’s true, does not make it so.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-09-15,"Journalism’s history of undercover reporting is fraught with contradiction.

On one hand, some of the most celebrated reporting of the past century or so resulted from courageous reporters who went undercover to expose injustices and wrongdoing.

On the other hand, is the fact that journalism’s core value is truth. How can lying to get a story be reconciled with that value?

Like so many ethical issues in journalism, this is not a black and white issue. Journalist’s first obligation is to seek truth and report it. But there are some circumstances when truth can only be discovered by means of deception. In such cases, the overriding value is the public interest.

Did the ends justify the means of the Star’s Sara Mojtehedzadeh going undercover for a month at Fiera Foods, one of Toronto’s largest industrial bakeries, to expose working conditions for precarious workers who rely on temp agencies to find work? In my view, this was most certainly justified.

The Star’s journalistic standards guide makes clear that undercover reporting is a tool of last resort, to be used following extensive consideration at the newsroom’s highest level: “Undercover reporting, photography and surveillance video should be used rarely and a case must be made that the story to be uncovered is of high public interest,” the policy states.

In practice, approval for undercover reporting is given only when reporters and senior editors have determined that the story could not be obtained by other means. Here, editor Michael Cooke and managing editor Irene Gentle made the judgment call to allow Mojtehedzadeh to go undercover. They concluded there was indeed no other way to get this information, and most important, that this was a story of strong public interest.

Mojtehedzadeh had spent many months investigating temp agencies, seeking information about injustices to some of our community’s most vulnerable workers. In reading through hundreds of Ministry of Labour reports and court documents on workers’ injuries she found numerous references to heath and safety violations at Fiera Foods Company and Marmora Freezing Corporation, one of its partner companies.

She also discovered three deaths had occurred at Fiera or in affiliated companies. The most recent happened last year when 23-year-old Amina Diaby, a refugee from Guinea on her first job in Canada, died when her hijab was pulled into a machine as she worked on an assembly line near the conveyer belt. Diaby was hired through a temp agency and had been working at Fiera Foods for two weeks.

“We looked at all of the information and concluded that my going undercover as a temp worker was the only way to get this story. We couldn’t just ask precarious temp workers to tell us what is happening inside the factory,” Mojtehedzadeh told me this week. “In past, I have had cases of temp workers who were fired for speaking up to the Star and I did not want to put anyone at risk of losing their job.

“All of the injury data and the deaths made it clear there was a strong public interest here in the health and safety of temp workers.”

Fiera Foods has also benefited from public funding, having received some $4.7 million dollars in government loans and grants. In response to questions from the Star, the company said that health and safety is a “core principle.”

Following publication of the Star's investigation, Fiera Foods this week was fined $300,000 after pleading guilty to charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act related to Diaby’s death. As well, the company told the Star it has hired auditors to examine its health and safety practices and temp agency contracts.

If you have not read this investigation by Mojtehedzadeh and Brendan Kennedy, who came into the project to provide further reporting, I hope you do so. Like many readers, I was stunned at what was revealed about the work conditions for these vulnerable workers, both through the undercover reporting and the more “classic” means of obtaining information.

Arguably, undercover reporting is itself a classic reporting technique. In the 2012 book, Undercover Reporting, the Truth about Deception, author Brooke Kroeger argues that undercover work embodies a central discipline of good reporting: “the ability to extract significant information or to create indelible, real-time descriptions of hard-to-penetrate institutions or social situations that deserve the public’s attention.”

The New York University journalism professor has compiled an online public database on undercover reporting that provides many example of outstanding undercover reporting (including some past Toronto Star investigations) and numerous thought-provoking articles about the ethics of journalistic deception.

Star editor Michael Cooke believes strongly that “undercover reporting has a long and noble history and is often courageous work that takes perseverance.

“Look no further than Nelly Bly,” he said, referring to the legendary reporter who went undercover as a patient in a New York insane asylum in the late 1800s.

“Her sensational account of the dreadful conditions and treatment of the patients got action, fast. So Bly made life better for the mentally ill,” Cooke said. “And that’s what it’s all about … trying to make life better.”

155,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2017/06/09/reader-trust-and-responsible-reporting-with-anonymous-sources-public-editor.html,Reader trust and responsible reporting with anonymous sources: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-06-09,"An important reader question about trust in the Star: “I am curious what steps a journalist might take to verify what they are told by a confidential source. I can understand the need for confidential sources in the media, but, as a reader I generally put a little less faith in what is attributed to an anonymous source. How would you generally, decide if a source who wants to remain confidential is reliable?”

The Star’s policy on anonymity states that, “The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names.” When that is not possible and confidential sources — individuals who are not named in the Star — are used in reporting information deemed to be of public interest, the Star’s reporters must take steps to determine the reliability of these sources. This is responsible reporting. In all cases, reporters, and most often their editors too, know the identities of sources granted anonymity in the Star.

Given the ongoing debate about the use of confidential sources in covering Donald Trump’s administration, I have asked the bureau chiefs of the Star’s three Canadian political bureaus to provide their insights on the reader’s question as it pertains to the Star’s political and government coverage. Here are their thoughtful responses.

Bruce Campion-Smith, Ottawa bureau chief

“First off, a confidential source is generally someone we know very well and have a track record with and built on a relationship usually over years. We’ve assured ourselves that they are in a position to know the information they are giving us and that they have a track record of playing straight. Remember the trust cuts both ways. Not only do we have to trust them but they have to trust us.

The source has to absolutely be in a position to know what they are talking about. No second-hand information or gossip. A bottom line is that any information gleaned this way must be fact-based. We don’t allow someone to anonymously trash another individual. That’s just a cheap shot.

Typically, our sources in Ottawa tend to be government officials who cannot speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the information they are passing. To be found out would put their job in jeopardy. These could be whistleblowers or other insiders whose information may reveal truths that the politicians are attempting to hide.

We have to be alert to the motives of the source in providing the information. Usually the passing of information works to their favour in some way too, perhaps by building profile of a story. But we need to do a gut check to understand their motives.”

Robert Benzie: Queen’s Park bureau chief

“In political reporting, granting anonymity to a source is often a necessity in order to get them to say anything beyond boilerplate talking points. As we have seen from The New York Times’ superb reporting on the current president, off-the-record sources are essential to understanding what is going on in the White House.

These people sometimes risk their jobs and reputations to speak to the Star. Yes, their motivations are not always altruistic — though we do hear from whistle-blowers in politics — but the insights can be invaluable. There are many important stories that would never have been exposed without allowing people to speak on background.

Toronto Star readers should trust the confidential sources they see in the Star because Toronto Star reporters do. I do think we need to explain in stories why we are giving sources the right to withhold their names.”

David Rider: City Hall bureau chief

“When thinking about whether to use a confidential source I consider whether the information is of sufficient public interest to justify giving somebody anonymity.

How trustworthy is the source? I never use a confidential source unless I know and trust them from past experience. Anybody who has steered me wrong in the past cannot be trusted with a cloak of anonymity.

Even if I trust them, what are their motivations? What they are saying might be true but I have to have a good sense of why they are doing it to feel comfortable with keeping their identity secret. For example, I will never quote an anonymous source throwing political muck at somebody else. I see this in print often and I cringe because that is essentially helping somebody be a vandal, taking shots without putting their name behind it.

Is there any way I can get the information without using a confidential source? If so, even if it means waiting a day or a two, I will wait.

I don’t pretend that I look at this checklist every time I consider use of a confidential source, but all these considerations go through my mind. People put themselves in peril trusting me to keep their identity confidential and readers trust the Star to provide them information that is reliable and important. I don’t take any of that lightly.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2017/02/17/the-facts-about-fake-news-public-editor.html,The facts about fake news: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Feb.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-02-17,"There is nothing new about critical readers expressing their concerns about what they read in the Star in strong words. My in-box, and those of most other journalists here, is evidence of that.

What is new in recent weeks however is the fact some of those critics are increasingly hurling a new term of insult our way to express disdain about what they read in the Toronto Star: Fake News.

We are seeing this degrading label now in emails, in Facebook and Instagram comments and in tweets directed at the Star and its journalists.

“Go report some real news and stop contributing to fake news,” one such reader told Daniel Dale, the Star’s Washington correspondent.

“Sounds like an alternative fact to me. Fake news,” said a reader who disagreed with a report on road tolls written by David Rider, the Star’s City Hall bureau chief.

“More fake news from the Toronto Star. Sad,” said a reader critical of a Washington Post wire service report about President Donald Trump’s first week in office.

“Sadly, your biased, incorrect and fake news is the reason your newspaper is struggling,” another told me. “Readers want facts.”

Here are the facts: The charge of “fake news” is now being thrown at the mainstream media, by largely partisan critics, as an all-encompassing derisive epithet, largely devoid of its original, and accurate, meaning.

The new U.S. president and his followers have clearly co-opted these words in their campaign to delegitimize the press and discredit legitimate reporting that seeks to hold the new administration to account — as journalists should and must in upholding their responsibilities within a democracy.

Want more facts? Fake news is not news you happen to disagree with. And nor is it news from responsible news organizations that includes mistakes, made honestly and corrected honestly in line with the journalistic commitment to accuracy and fairness. Unfortunately, I have seen this insult used in regard to the Star’s journalism in both of these circumstances, in some cases from people I would have expected to know better, such as a university journalism professor and a former newspaper publisher.

While real fake news is a matter of legitimate concern, the distinction about what is and is not fake news matters much in this troubling time when we face an assault on truth and daily debate about facts and “alternative facts” in what is increasingly coming to be regarded as a “post-truth world.” Easy, derisive labels that allow critics to dismiss outright information they disagree with, or news reports they regard as substandard, seem to me to be dangerously reductive.

So, what is fake news?

To answer that accurately, we must look to Craig Silverman the Canadian journalist who first wrote about the phenomena of fake news for BuzzFeed News in November. Silverman, who has achieved global recognition for this important work, exposed the reality of fraudulent news, deliberately created and shared, largely on Facebook, to gain advertising dollars. Much of what he discovered was pro-Trump fake news that cast his opponent, Hillary Clinton, in a negative light with clearly false information.

Silverman’s reporting provided a fascinating look into the digital media universe and the ease with which wholly made-up “news” could be spread – and seemingly, believed. This “ecosystem” of fabricated information presented as serious news continues to be a significant concern in discerning the credibility of news sources.

But, almost as soon as the term “fake news” became part of our lexicon it was co-opted by Trump for his own ends, casting aspersions on the credibility of legitimate news organizations committed to ethical standards of journalism.

Who could forget Trump, during a televised press conference refusing to take a question from a CNN reporter, telling him, “You are fake news.” Or, his many tweets labeling the New York Times’ carefully sourced journalism as “fake news.” He was at it again this week, tweeting Thursday about “FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ‘sources.’’’

Silverman is clear about how he defines fake news: “My definition of fake news has three criteria: it has to be 100-percent false – not a news article or partisan site that gets a few facts wrong; it has to be created consciously to be false; and there has to be an economic motive,” he said this week at an event at University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.

Silverman, now media editor of BuzzFeed News, is well aware that the term has been exploited by critics of legitimate news and will likely continue to be. “I think the term fake news has almost been rendered meaningless at this point,” he said.

Indeed. I have yet to see any validity in any of the “fake news” charges lobbed our way. While it should go without saying, I think it’s safe to say, the Toronto Star is not in the business of fake news. While this news organization’s work does sometimes fall short of its own journalistic standards, to suggest that the Star would deliberately publish false information is wrong. We don’t make stuff up.

And, that’s a fact.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2016/09/30/when-does-star-report-race-of-suspects-wanted-by-police-public-editor.html,When does Star report race of suspects wanted by police?: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Sept.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-09-30,"A reader’s good question about the Toronto Star’s reporting of the race of suspects wanted by police raised relevant points demanding further inquiry.

“I am curious about the application of the Toronto Star’s policy on naming the race of suspects,” the reader, who works in the field of human rights law, told me last week. “The description of yesterday’s sexual assault suspect does not mention his race (he appears to be white), in contrast with an earlier story identifying a suspect as black.

“Admittedly, I am more than curious – the ways in which race and suspects are reported can feed into stereotypes about race, propensity and crime,” said the woman, who preferred not to be named in this column.

She is right of course. The media’s depiction of race can have a significant impact on the perception of race in our community. Particularly when it comes to depictions of race and crime.

The Star has long decreed that “no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story.”

Our policy on racial references makes some exception in the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large. In such cases, the policy states, “there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose.”

This reader pointed out two descriptions of suspects published recently in the Star. As she indicated, a Sept. 18 report of a man wanted for sexual assault made no reference to race in stating that, “The suspect, shown in a security camera picture, is described as about 25 to 35, 5-foot-9 to six feet tall, with medium build and brown hair. He was wearing a red gold shirt, navy blue shorts and brown thong sandals.”

On July 30 however, the Star published a report that did include the race of a suspect wanted in connection with a shooting in Christie Pits Park that left several people injured. “Police have released a photo of a suspect, who was participating in the fitness class, police say. He is described as a black man, 25 to 30-years-old, five-foot-eight to five-foot-nine with short cornrows that were visible from beneath his baseball cap.” The Star did not publish the full description of the man’s clothing, as provided by police, nor did it include the fact that police considered the suspect to be “armed and dangerous.”

The first article in the Star was accompanied by a photo of the suspect — clearly a white man. The second article did not include publication of the suspect photo released by police – likely because it was a blurry, poor quality image.

As I told this reader, generally, the descriptions of suspects published in the Star come directly from police news releases. Still, I told her, there is a strong need for the Star to be consistent about how it reports these sensitive matters, regardless of what information police provide to reporters.

The Toronto police force has its own policies on when it might include the race of suspects in its news releases.

“Our policy is clear: where we have a picture in which a suspect’s face is clearly visible we will not attach a racial descriptor to it,” spokesman Mark Pugash told me. “We want to go with the best possible evidence and a good clear photo is always best.

“If there is no clear picture, we will go with the description given to police by witnesses or victims,” Pugash said, adding that the security camera images of the suspect sought in the July 30 article did not provide a clear image of the suspect.

In such cases when photos are not available or of poor quality, police news releases may well state that a suspect is white, black, brown or use other racialized descriptors that could aid in a member of the public identifying the suspect. Indeed in looking through the archive of police news releases, you can find all such descriptions.

Like the Star, police policy calls for avoiding vague descriptions of suspects. “The information we put out has to enable someone to recognize someone,” Pugash said.

Of course, much of this is subjective. What police regard as a full description may not rise to the level required by the Star. The Star’s newsroom must always be aware of our own policy and values in determining whether there is justification in reporting the race of suspects and not automatically include such information simply because police have put it in a news release.

Certainly, as a news organization committed to equal dignity for all, the Star bears considerable responsibility to guard against reinforcing unfair racial stereotypes.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2016/04/22/accuracy-is-the-foundation-of-trust-public-editor.html,Accuracy is the foundation of trust: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'April', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-04-22,"On the walls of the Atkinson Foundation, two floors above the Toronto Star’s newsroom, hangs a painting that provides vivid evidence of this organization’s longtime commitment to credibility.

It depicts a Norman Rockwell-like idealized view of the newsroom of the “Evening Star” in 1899, when the legendary Joseph E. Atkinson was at the helm as publisher and proprietor. It shows about a dozen journalists – men in waistcoats, bowties and eyeshades – sitting at wooden tables, pencils in hand, with newspapers and books strewn about. A lone woman in a long dress, her hair in a topknot, walks among them carrying a stack of papers.

On the wall hangs a poster adorned with gold stars and words that proclaim the mission of “A Paper for the People”: “Brightness, Accuracy, Enterprise.”

I had an opportunity to see this piece of art only recently. Given my role for the past nine years as “guarantor of accuracy” on the many platforms on which the Star publishes these days, it delighted me so to see this image that paints a picture of the importance of accuracy all those 117 years ago, when Atkinson was building his newspaper.

I thought about it this week on reading a new study on what makes people trust and rely on the news. The central finding of this report, done by the U.S.-based Media Insight Project, a collaboration of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, was unsurprising: Accuracy is the single most critical reason why people trust a news organization.

“Accuracy is the paramount principle of trust,” the study states. “Eighty-five per cent of Americans rate it as extremely or very important that news organizations get the facts right, higher than any other general principle.”

The study also found that transparency (defined as the idea that news organizations explain the way they gather and report the news) is very important to building trust. So to is “balance,” defined as “reporting that provides different views.” Readers also highly value timeliness (that a news report provide you with the latest news and information), and clarity (that a report be concise and gets to the point.)

Indeed, all of that does not sound a whole lot different from the imperative that the 1899 Evening Star provide brightness, accuracy and enterprise.

This study does reveal information important to today’s media business facing a revenue squeeze as advertisers spend more with digital giants such as Facebook and Google: When readers trust a news organization they “engage” with it in ways that matter to the future of the news business.

“Those news consumers especially concerned with trustworthiness are also the most likely to report that they take valuable actions — such as paying for news, spreading news to friends, and following the source on social platforms.

“Trust is an important differentiator for building an audience.”

While the report’s central thesis seems to me to be old news, there is much interesting research in the report about how audiences gauge the trustworthiness of news on new digital platforms, including websites, apps and social media.

It tells us that the rise of social media, in particular, has contributed to public distrust in media.

“When it comes to trust, many people who receive news from these social media platforms consume it with skepticism,” it says. “Social media news consumers do not generally trust the news they see there.”

I have been following media credibility studies since 1985 when I was a reporter for the Star sent to API for a professional development seminar. On our agenda that week was a then brand-new research report done by the American Society of Newspaper Editors titled, “Newspaper Credibility: Building Reader Trust: A National Study.”

I have never forgotten what I took away from that illuminating session: the reality that if journalists mess up such basics as spelling names correctly readers really do wonder what else we got wrong.

A multitude of studies have since made clear that the media has a deepening credibility problem. This report again finds low levels of confidence in all media.

As with many previous studies, it also points to a time-honored means of building trust: publishing corrections when we are wrong.

“Several people said that owning up to mistakes and drawing attention to errors or mistakes can show consumers that a source is accountable and dedicated to getting it right in the long term,” it states.

As “Kimberly,” one of the women interviewed for this report, stated, “We all make mistakes. If an outlet is wrong and is transparent about it and they screwed up, if they say I messed up and take ownership that makes me trust you more.”

Indeed, trust matters. Always has, and always will.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
159,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2016/03/11/publishing-and-unpublishing-in-the-digital-age-public-editor.html,Publishing and ‘unpublishing’ in the digital age: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'March', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-03-11,"The Toronto Star has been more than a newspaper for some time, having evolved in the past 20 years from providing news on paper to become a multi-platform digital news and information organization.

The Star now publishes its content in the paper, on its website, thestar.com; on its new tablet app, Star Touch; and also on its mobile app. While not all content is always published on all these “platforms,” all content can potentially be published in any of these ways. That fact applies to articles written by staff and also to content submitted for publication by readers.

Given this reality of multi-platform publishing, I was quite surprised to receive three requests in recent weeks from readers seeking to have their published letters to the editor removed from the Star’s website. One of the letters was published in 2010, another in 2011 and the third, last month. All expressed views on matters of public concern.

Two of these readers contend that they did not know the letters they submitted for publication would not only be published in the Star’s print editions but also online. Now, they tell me, they do not want these letters — and their names — coming up in Google searches. One letter writer suggests that online publication of her letter violates her privacy rights.

While hardly a week goes by that someone does not ask the Star to make information about them that was published previously on our website disappear from the Internet, these recent requests to delete letters to the editor are a new twist.

The Star generally does not delete what it publishes online — what is known as “unpublishing.” Our policy is clear and firm: “The Star does not unpublish content from our websites or archives, except in some rare circumstances.” Those “rare circumstances” are generally legal reasons and always demand consultation with the Star’s editor, managing editor and newsroom lawyer.

Unpublishing for rare reasons is indeed rare: In nearly nine years in this role, I can count on one hand the number of times when we have removed published information.

Like most other news organizations, the Star’s unpublishing policy is rooted in the view that the website — our digital archive of what’s been published — is a matter of public record and that it is unethical to make content simply disappear because someone does not want to see an article in which they are named turn up in a Google search.

It is worth knowing also that in this time when news and information is shared widely on social media, commented on, and cached on the web, it is virtually impossible to make words or images disappear entirely from the digital realm.

Clearly the long lifespan and easy accessibility of digital news and information has created new issues for news organizations and sources. The Star has given this issue serious consideration. It does take steps to update online articles and correct any inaccuracies in a transparent way. If we report on people charged with crimes and those charges are later dropped or those named were acquitted, we will note the outcome of the charges in bold type at the top of the article, understanding that a report of a criminal charge is a grave concern to the person involved.

So what about these unusual requests to unpublish letters to the editor that were submitted – and signed — by readers eager to see their views expressed in the Star. Indeed, given that the Star publishes about 12 to 15 of more than 100 letters submitted each day, most readers see it as somewhat of a coup to have their letter selected for publication.

I have spoken about this with the Star’s letters editor and the editorial page editor who is responsible for the Letters page. We all agree we cannot see any valid grounds for unpublishing published letters.

While these people seeking to have their letters taken down may well have since altered their views as expressed in those letters, or, as one of them told us, faced some professional repercussions for having expressed political views, I don’t think the Star can simply make those letters disappear as if they were never published.

Nor can I accept the argument that those letters were submitted for publication in the newspaper and the Star did not make clear that they could be published online as well — or that this is some sort of privacy issue because explicit permission to publish online was not sought and given. Given that the Star has been publishing readers’ letters online for many years now and this news organization is publicly transparent that it publishes on many platforms, I cannot see the need to state this explicitly or obtain explicit approval.

Indeed, we operate in a multi-platform digital age in which publishing has long since moved beyond printing words on paper.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2015-10-02,"In the days before a badly written book about a guy named Grey became a global bestseller, I would often refer to the “shades of grey” in journalistic ethics.

While one can’t go there these days without evoking smirks about the sexually explicit 50 Shades of Grey, the fact remains that many aspects of journalistic ethics are not a black and white matter.

And certainly the most intriguing and challenging ethical dilemmas of journalism often involve those many shades of grey.

My job, indeed that of all journalists, would be so much easier if journalistic standards and ethics were always a clear-cut matter of “Thou shalt do this, Thou shalt not do that.”

It is rarely that simple.

The reality of the complexity of journalism ethics in our ever-evolving digital era is the guiding principle of an important new ethics initiative presented last week at the annual Online News Association conference held in Los Angeles and attended by more than 2,000 journalists from across North America.

The “Build Your Own Ethics Code” project, led by veteran journalist Thomas Kent, standards editor of The Associated Press, involved more than 20 journalists working together for more than two years and soliciting input from many more journalists throughout North America.

The initiative is rooted in the premise that beyond a few fundamental and unassailable principles, journalistic ethics cannot be cast in stone and that policy and practice can — and does — vary across news organizations and among individual journalists.

That doesn’t mean anything goes. Or, that journalists should just make their own rules as they go along. After establishing four fixed points of journalistic values, the “BYO” ethics project provides a digital tool that guides journalists to customize their own codes of conduct based on a range of “building blocks” to consider in ethical decision-making.

First, the important fixed points of journalistic ethics. These are non-negotiable – indeed “black and white” fundamentals of all journalism, the core of every one of the dozens and dozens of journalistic standards code I have looked at in recent years.

These are:

Tell the truth. Journalists are honest, accurate, truthful and fair. We give people opportunity to respond to critical allegations, correct our errors, clearly distinguish fact from opinion in all content and “do not distort or fabricate facts, imagery, sound or data.”

Avoid conflicts of interest. Journalists avoid any conflict of interest that undermines our ability to report fairly. And, the ethics guide states, “disclose to your audience any unavoidable conflicts or situational factors that may validly affect your judgment of our credibility.”

Community. Respect our audiences and those we report about. The guide states: “Consider how your work and its permanence may affect the subjects of your reporting, your community and, since the Internet knows no boundaries, the larger world.”

Professional Conduct: Don’t plagiarize; keep your promises to sources, readers and your community.

Beyond those basics, the project encourages thought and discussion to determine where we stand as news organizations and as individual journalists on more than 40 specific issues including confidential sources, covering children and how we handle information gathered on social media.

“We started with the recognition that the journalism profession encompasses ever more people, philosophies and technologies,” Kent says. “There are many definitions these days of a ‘journalist,’ making it more important than ever for journalists to be clear about who they are and what they stand for.

“We believe the best hope for convincing all journalists to adopt and live by an ethics code is to give them ownership and flexibility in creating one.”

Steve Buttry, a Louisiana State University journalism professor and a well-travelled newsroom journalism trainer who was involved in the project from the outset, says the BYO code recognizes that journalists are rarely unanimous in our views on ethics policies and practice. He sees great value in the debate and discussion this new tool enables.

“As I’ve said many times, good ethical decisions don’t come from good rules but from many good conversations about ethics,” Buttry wrote in a recent blog post about the online ethics project.

While this initiative is geared to journalists, I think it is instructive for our audiences as well. It is well worth checking out to learn more about the many shades of grey of journalism ethics.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2014-01-24,"In journalism, the truth of images matters every bit as much as the truth of words.

Just as fabrication is the cardinal sin of those who write the news, manipulating pictures is the zero-tolerance transgression of those who photograph the news.

As a reader, you must know with all certainty that what you see published in the newspaper and online is indeed what the journalist’s camera saw.

This core ethic of photojournalism has been the subject of much discussion in newsrooms around the globe this week after The Associated Press announced it “severed ties” with a Pulitzer Prize-winning freelance photographer who digitally altered an image he captured in Syria last year.

As the Star reported Thursday, the AP said photographer Narciso Contreras told editors he manipulated a digital picture of a Syrian rebel fighter taken last September, using software to remove a colleague’s video camera from the lower left corner of the image.

While the Star is an AP client and uses its photos daily, it did not publish this photo.

Contreras was part of the AP team awarded a Pulitzer last year for powerful news images of the war in Syria. All of his photos have now been removed from AP’s publicly available archive.

While some judge the news service’s reaction to be overly harsh, arguing that the photo altering did not alter the meaning of the image, it was a clear violation of the AP’s ethics code regarding the truth and accuracy of images. And while I imagine it wasn’t easy to reveal this ethical breach to the world, the AP’s transparency and accountability here is commendable — a model for media organizations on owning up to journalistic lapses.

Taras Slawnych, the Star’s visuals editor, agreed totally with the AP’s call on this ethical transgression: “The Star would never do that to a news photo,” he told me. “The integrity of photos has to be there. If you cross that ethical line and alter what’s real in an image you lose credibility.”

The Star’s ethics policy holds our visual journalists (those who shoot still photos and video) to the same standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency as all other Star journalists. While the code says that digital manipulation is permissible to improve technical quality (colour, contrast and basic sharpening), it makes clear that “any alteration or enhancement that renders a photo inaccurate or misleading is forbidden.”

While news photos in the Star “document reality,” sometimes feature stories are accompanied by “photo illustrations” that take creative liberties with images. The Star’s policy stipulates these must be labelled as such so readers clearly understand the image has been constructed.

I have no doubt all of the Star’s staff photographers understand and hold true to this professional ethic. So too do the Star’s photo editors know that electronic manipulation of news photos is verboten.

But, given that the Star and news organizations everywhere increasingly publish photos obtained from many outside sources, including social media, “citizen journalists” and “handout photos” from sources, there’s greater need to ensure the authenticity of photos before publishing them.

“There is always a chance that a submitted photo is not truthful. We must take steps to verify and ask ‘is this image real, is it truthful?’” Slawnych said, noting that today’s electronic tools make altering images easier than ever.

So how do these standards square with the controversy over a handout real estate photo of a Mississauga mansion up for auction published recently in the Star? As Susan Pigg, the Star’s real estate reporter, wrote last week, the “show-stopping photo” was taken with a wide-angle lens that appears to double the length of the home’s cobblestone driveway. The photographer hired by the real estate agent also acknowledged to Pigg that the photo is a “blending” of a few different exposures to capture the home in its best light.

While such electronic manipulation is common practice in advertising and marketing, and also some magazines, it is not in line with the Star’s photo standards, Slawnych told me. Still, like Slawnych, I don’t have concerns of a significant lapse on the Star’s part here.

I think most readers will understand that handout MLS listing photos are advertising and marketing tools — not photojournalism — and what you see is rarely exactly what you get. As Pigg so aptly put it in her story about the photo controversy: “those glitzy real estate photos are meant to sell a dream, and a home.”

But, given that this photo was published in the Star’s news pages to illustrate a story about the auction of the monster home, I am concerned that there was no photo credit included to indicate it was a handout marketing photo. While this was an unintended omission, readers needed that to clearly understand this glossy image was a realtor’s photo intended to enhance reality.

For the Star, the reality is that both words and images must document truth, however unvarnished.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2013/09/06/if_star_misspells_your_name_we_will_correct_public_editor.html,"If Star misspells your name, we will correct: Public Editor","['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Sept.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-09-06,"In journalism schools across Canada this week, many a freshman student will learn one of the foremost lessons of the J-school classroom: Get someone’s name wrong and you get a failing grade.

In the decade I taught at Ryerson University’s journalism school my students understood that no matter how brilliant their reporting and writing, if they messed up a name, they got an automatic F on that assignment. That’s a common policy of most journalism schools.

In the Star’s newsroom, we don’t hand out failing grades for misspelled, mixed-up names. But we do publish corrections.

If the Star gets a given or surname wrong, whether in the newspaper or online, we always correct. That is a fundamental undertaking of the Star’s corrections practice.

Getting names right has long been considered “the bedrock measure of accuracy” in journalism. Correcting when we make mistakes matters greatly both to those whose names we get wrong and to readers.

Every media credibility study I’ve looked at indicates that readers link credibility with basic accuracy and believe that getting names right is a significant indication of the overall accuracy of the journalist and the news organization.

We well know it’s a fact that if we get your name wrong you’ll wonder what else we got wrong. That’s why double-checking names must be the most basic of fact-checking for journalists.

But even the most careful journalists can make mistakes with names. Of 198 corrections published in the Star in the first half of this year, 58 were for wrong names. That’s 29 per cent of all corrections and tracking upward from last year when 100 of 415 newspaper corrections (just under 25 per cent) were for incorrect names.

We also made 316 online-only corrections in those six months, a great many for incorrect names.

I can’t imagine anyone here would disagree that’s too many incorrect names making it into the Star. Clearly, the Star could enhance its accuracy record considerably by making even more concerted efforts across the newsroom to ensure all first and last names are stated and spelled correctly.

I can assure you no journalist sets out to mangle someone’s name. A recent Canadian research study, “Verification as a Strategic Ritual: How journalists retrospectively describe processes for ensuring accuracy” found that the newspaper journalists interviewed about their methods of verifying information before publication all reported that they always took steps to ensure their subjects’ names were correct.

“An almost universal practice among participants is asking sources to spell their own name to ensure correct spelling, either at the beginning or the end of the interview,” stated the study published in February’s Journalism Practice.

As the study states, these journalists said they regarded an mistake in someone’s name as “a very visible error that can have implications for professional credibility.”

The Star’s error-tracking data leads me to two conclusions about how and why journalists get names wrong: Some do indeed fail in the basic requirement to verify the name and its spelling with the source. More often, they make mistakes when inputting names to their computers — your basic “typo” that’s subsequently not caught in their self-editing and the overall newsroom editing process.

Most mistakes in the Star start with writers. Our error data indicates that of the 198 corrections overall from January through June, 139 errors are classified as writing errors by reporters (100), columnists (19), freelance writers (16), editorial writers (2) and letter writers (2).

With newsroom restructuring resulting in fewer copy editors in the newsroom (and indeed in every newsroom throughout North America) there’s a strong case to be made that every writer must learn techniques to become their own best editor.

In coming weeks, I’ll be working with the newsroom to put together training sessions to help writers better catch their own errors and ensure that all writers have access to accuracy checklists. Such checklists have been proven to make a considerable difference in minimizing errors in names and other such basic facts. Simply reading our work back to ourselves doesn’t work in catching many errors — especially typos — because as Joseph T. Hallinan writes in Why We Make Mistakes, “By and large, we see what we expect to see.”

Whatever steps the newsroom and individual journalists take to minimize mistakes, some errors are inevitable given journalism’s deadline driven realities.

That’s why I make this pledge to you: If the Star gets your name wrong, we will publish a correction.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2013/04/19/disclosure_and_conflict_of_interest_in_opinion_columns_public_editor.html,Disclosure and conflict of interest in opinion columns: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'April', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-04-19,"Writing recently about the unfairness of tax havens for the rich, freelance Op-Ed columnist Linda McQuaig cited an estimated $8-billion annual revenue loss to Canadians from tax havensLinda McQuaig cited an estimated $8-billion annual revenue loss to Canadians from tax havens.

McQuaig told you the number came from Canadians for Tax Fairness. What she didn’t tell you is that she is a member of that group’s advisory board.

Is that information that should be disclosed to readers? Is this a conflict of interest, as a reader who brought this to my attention suggested?

I don’t see a conflict issue here. McQuaig is a monthly opinion columnist for the Star, not a reporter. As such, she has wide latitude to express views informed by her own extensive expertise, interests and involvements.

Unlike news reporters who, according to the Star’s policy manual, must be seen to be “fair-minded fact-finders” and should not be “both actors and critics” on public issues, columnists — especially freelancers — have more leeway for involvement in public issues.

Still, there is a need for columnists and other Op-Ed writers to be transparent and make clear to readers any personal involvement in issues they write about.

Certainly McQuaig’s longtime interest in economic justice is no secret. A prolific author, she’s written nine books on politics and economics, including six national bestsellers. As her column credit note states, her most recent book, co-authored with Neil Brooks, is called The Trouble with Billionaires: How the Super-Rich Hijacked the World and How We Can Take It Back.

Nor, I am assured, was the writer attempting to hide her role with the tax fairness group. She simply overlooked mentioning her connection to the group that she is loosely affiliated with and in which she has no financial interest. And online the article linked to the organization’s website where McQuaig is listed as a member of the national advisory council.

Still, Editorial Page Editor Andrew Phillips decided the column should include some acknowledgement of McQuaig’s involvement with the group. To that end, the credit note at the end of the column has been amended to make that fact clear.

“Full disclosure is always best,” said Phillips, who like me does not regard this as a conflict issue. “If anything, adding a note here is an excess of caution.”

I think that was the right call. As was a similar call Phillips made this week for fuller disclosure on an online Op-Ed article exploring the Toronto casino debate written by Clyde W. Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.

Barrow’s piece was critical of a University of Toronto, Martin Prosperity Institute study of the economic impact of a downtown casino in Toronto. Following a reader complaint that the article did not make clear Barrow’s past involvement with the casino industry, and upon further questioning of the author to determine the extent of any such involvement, the credit line on the article was amended to tell you: “He has conducted market feasibility studies for companies considering building casinos in New England.”

Op-Ed writers are not meant to be unbiased bystanders. They write to express informed views rooted in their own expertise and experience. They express their own views, not those of the news organization.

It is up to you to assess the positions put forth in Op-Ed pieces. But to do so, you must be given any relevant information that might help you gauge the credentials and biases of those given space to provide their perspectives on newsworthy public issues. The Star can’t know all the affiliations of all Op-Ed writers and expects them to disclose any interests they have in a subject.

“Op-ed writers aren’t supposed to be objective or to have no stake in the subjects they’re writing about,” Nicholas Goldberg, Los Angeles Times editorial page editor, said last fall in an interview with Media Matters, a media monitoring website.“When a writer does have a particular relationship to his subject that is not immediately apparent to the reader, it is important to disclose that so that the reader can evaluate the argument intelligently.”

Media Matters interviewed Goldberg and other U.S. editorial page editors after reporting that the Wall Street Journal had failed to disclose that 10 Op-Eds it published during the U.S. election campaign were written by advisers to presidential candidate Mitt Romney without any disclosure of that vital information.

A former New York Times editor called such an egregious failure to disclose “shameless.” Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, said: “Not disclosing is inexcusable.

“We are pretty careful here to disclose any affiliation,” he added.

Clearly, in this digital age of radical transparency, great care must be taken to assure the fullest disclosure possible.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
164,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2013/05/03/whats_fair_is_clearly_defined_at_star_public_editor.html,What’s fair is clearly defined at Star: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'May', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-05-03,"“What’s fair” may well be journalism’s eternal question, long the subject of academic conferences, scholarly articles and noble journalistic navel-gazing.

In the literature, “fairness in journalism” is generally an abstract notion, difficult to define; it is considered “complex,” “illusive,” “paradoxical,” “subjective.”

In the Star’s newsroom, what’s fair is neither abstract nor subjective. The core standard of fairness here is clear and concrete: any subject of potentially harmful factual allegations must be given opportunity to respond.

As Bert Bruser, the Star’s lawyer, tells some journalist in the newsroom almost every day, getting the other side is “the essence of fairness” in line with the legal requirements of responsible journalism as they have evolved in recent decades.

In last week’s column I told you about an egregious lapse of the Star’s standards of accuracy and fairness that resulted in the Star publishing false allegations about MPP Margarett Best. Proper due diligence was not done here.

While the reporter had attempted to reach Best, at no time did he state explicitly that he was working on a story that would report she was vacationing in Mexico while on medical leave from Queen’s Park. Had he done so, it’s quite likely he would have learned that was flat-out wrong and the Star would not have published the story.

In light of this serious lapse, the newsroom is taking steps to ensure that everyone fully understand due diligence and fairness. In coming weeks, Bruser, along with Kevin Donovan, the Star’s award-winning investigations editor, will lead mandatory training sessions for all reporters.

Donovan and his “I-team” are standard-bearers for the degree of due diligence fairness demands. Having talked extensively about this with him and Bruser, I expect many reporters have much to learn from them about the extent they must go to ensure they meet the standards of fairness laid down by the law and the Star’s policies.

I-team exposés of wrongdoing most often put their subjects in a negative light. But it is standard operating procedure for I-team reporters to make certain those subjects are given every opportunity to respond to harmful allegations before publication,

These reporters routinely make contact with the subjects of their investigations early in their reporting, often sending emails that lay out the explicit details of what they are looking into and what they hope to learn.

“Everyone is entitled to give their side of the story. I preach that on a daily basis,” Donovan told me this week. “Telling a person or organization about an allegation gives them the opportunity at the start to tell you that you have it wrong, partly wrong, or mostly right.

“Calling last minute doesn’t cut it. I often inform people or organizations on Day 1 of my investigation,” Donovan said. “People need to be told precisely what it is you are calling about.

“It is the fair and responsible thing to do.”

It is also the degree of diligence required to meet legal standards of fairness. Canada’s 2009 Supreme Court ruling on “responsible communication in the public interest” stipulates that “it is inherently unfair to publish defamatory allegations of fact without giving the target an opportunity to respond.”

That’s a clear definition of fairness, but not really new. As Bruser reminded me, this standard was expressed forcefully in law some three decades ago when the Toronto Sun lost a libel suit brought by then cabinet minister John Munro after the Sun reported wrongly that Munro had been involved in illegal stock trading.

Ontario Supreme Court Justice Mr. John Holland stated then that when “the paper has the goods on the person targeted in the story, it is basic and necessary that the person be confronted with the story so that his reaction be obtained.”

Justice Holland aptly pointed out that getting the other side could indeed cause a story to be “discarded,” preventing publication of an incorrect story. Certainly that would have happened with the Best story.

Through the years, Donovan, working closely with Bruser on many Star investigations, has come to understand the value of reaching out early to those he is investigating and being explicit about the allegations he is pursuing.

Doing so makes for “a better, more responsible, more solid story,” Donovan said.

In my books, that’s fairness in journalism.

165,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2013/02/22/too_simplistic_to_blame_twitter_for_journalistic_lapses_public_editor.html,Too simplistic to blame Twitter for journalistic lapses: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Feb.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-02-22,"By now, I would expect that all journalists invested in their future in journalism have let go of any silly notions that Twitter is merely a medium for sharing the trivial and the titillating.

That attitude is so 2010. Back then, when I wrote about “the Twitter transformation,” I told you that some news veterans were disdainful of the then relatively new digital tool that allows real-time sharing of information in 140 characters or less.

Certainly within the “twitterverse” you can still find the trivial (yes, some do still share what they ate for breakfast) and the titillating. And too much that is mean-spirited. But hasn’t that always been the case for any medium of communication?

For journalists and news organizations, Twitter is now a vital tool, especially when news breaks. It allows journalists to tell you almost instantaneously what we learn, whether on the scene or by connecting directly to participants and witnesses.

Yes, instant news does bring real risks of getting it wrong. I’ll get to that. But I do so believing Twitter is an important medium for journalism. What’s at issue is figuring out how to use it in a way that’s aligned with journalistic values of verification, accuracy and transparency.

These questions will be explored in Toronto next week in a “J-Talks” session, sponsored by the Canadian Journalism Foundation. Headlining the panel is Andy Carvin, NPR’s senior social media strategist and author of the recently released Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution. As the Star’s Michelle Shephard writes in today’s World Weekly section, Carvin became known as “the man who tweets revolutions” when he tweeted thousands of daily, first-hand, live reports from citizens at the heart of the Arab Spring.

The J-Talks session also features two other veteran journalists: digital pioneer Mathew Ingram, senior media writer for GigaOM, and Esther Enkin, the recently appointed ombudsman for CBC English services. I am moderating the session.

Entitled “The Twitter Effect: Is Journalism Still Able to Get it Right?” this panel came about in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting tragedy when much false information circulated within mainstream news websites and social media. Most egregious: many reported the wrong shooter, naming Ryan Lanza when it was actually his brother Adam. (Happily, due to the newsroom’s diligence, the Star did not report this erroneous information.)

Then, as was the case in just about any major breaking news story in recent years, many journalists and news organizations gave readers false information in the rush to report at Twitter speed. Sometimes that wrong stuff was reported on Twitter first, other times by mainstream means first. In all cases, it was amplified in the echo chambers of Twitter.

And each time, Twitter took the blame for the downfall of journalistic standards.

I think blaming this new medium is too simplistic.

Certainly journalists must figure out how to reconcile the conflict of reporting breaking stories in real time with the essential journalistic value of verification, which means “getting what happened down right.”

But, as the J-Talks panellists tell me, we need to do that within the reality that getting what happened down right when news breaks has always been somewhat messy.

Even when journalists reported for a daily news cycle, we understood the truth of the now clichéd statement that “news is the best available version of the truth.” In the chaos of reporting breaking news on deadline, that meant we sometimes didn’t have everything right when it came time to publish. We updated in next-day stories and published corrections.

Now that the news cycle never ends and Twitter can mean reporting on minute-to-minute deadlines, what should verification in journalism entail?

Does it mean telling you only what we know with absolute certainty? Or can it mean being transparent with you about what we are unsure about but trying to verify? Do we need a more effective corrections process for real-time news?

These are critical questions as journalism evolves and embraces new tools, particularly for legacy news organizations such as the Star where credibility matters much. Long-held standards of verification have served readers well here.

Those standards boil down to a simple dictum, still well worth a tweet for thought: “When in doubt, don’t report.”

166,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2012/02/10/does_correct_spelling_matter_to_journalists.html,Does correct spelling matter to journalists?,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Feb.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2012-02-10,"Duz acurit spelling mattur 2 U?

In this digital age of texting, tweeting and time-stressed journalism, has proper spelling gone the way of hot type?

As language evolves, should spelling too? Should the language of texting become common parlance? Are u ok with “1” for “won,” “L8r” for “later,” “UR” instead of “you’re”? A heart for “love?”

In a provocative essay published in this month’s Wired magazine, entitled “It’s Tyme to Let Luce” writer and professor Anne Trubek argues against the “outdated dogma” of standardized spelling. She contends it’s time to “loosen our idea of correct spelling.”

Language evolves, she said, “and spelling evolves, too, as we create new words, styles and guidelines.

“Consistent spelling was a great way to ensure clarity in the print era,” she said. “But with new technologies, the way that we write and read (and search and data-mine) is changing, and so must spelling.”

While Trubek presents a compelling argument for the “terrible mess” of the English language and its many inconsistencies in spellings, and tells us that the notion of consistent spelling is a “fairly recent invention” (albeit, an invention dating back at least to the 1770s), I can’t imagine the conventions of proper spelling disappearing from journalism any time soon.

Certainly, spelling does matter at the Star. Our readers remind us constantly that spelling matters.

Misspellings and typos in the newspaper and online can provoke more passionate reader indignation than just about any other journalistic transgression. Sometimes disproportionately so.

“You subject your readers to multiple spelling mistakes,” a reader recently told me in an email criticizing the Star for misspelling “anesthesiologist.”

“Your newspaper is supposed to be a model, not a source of mistakes which are careless and avoidable,” he wrote. “Journalism is not only about what you write but how you present it to the reader.

“This is totally unacceptable for any type of publication, spell checker or no spell checker.”

This week, a reader who identified himself as “a retired professor living in Portugal” emailed me about a Star sports blog in which the possessive “its” was misspelled as the contraction “it’s” three out of four times in the piece. Another reader wrote this week to point out that a reporter wrote “sighting” when she meant “citing.”

In recent weeks, readers have pointed out that the Star wrote about a movie “premier” instead of a “premiere” and referred to the “forward” of a book instead of the “foreword.”

Clearly homonyms — those words that sound the same, but have different meanings and spellings — are a challenge. To sometimes hilarious effect (not affect!), the Star has confused stationary and stationery, fazed and phased, principal and principle, aide and aid, pored and poured. These commonly misspelled words always need double-checking.

Is this just niggling nitpicking? Trubek believes the reason we have rules or rather, “arbitrary contrivances” governing spelling is simply “snobbery.” She argues that new technologies, such as smart phones and tablets, are “speeding the adoption of more casual forms of communication.”

But certainly people expect more from journalists than the casual newspeak of texts and 140-character tweets. As my son, 19, chided me in a message he texted in response to my hastily typed, error-ridden text message: “Nice grammar. I thought U were an editor.”

Media credibility studies consistently tell us that spelling errors erode journalism’s credibility. We know public trust depends on journalists getting the details right.

I don’t see how any journalist can buy into Trubek’s argument that correct spelling no longer matters.

As Mallary Jean Tenore of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies aptly concluded in an online report about Trubek’s essay, “journalists value accuracy.”

“We want to get our facts straight and spell words right — not just to avoid corrections but to offer as much clarity as possible to the reader,” she wrote.” Once you start using misspelled words — even if they’re commonly accepted in the world of text messages and instant messages — you lose a segment of your audience that may not be as familiar with these words. “

Even Wired published a rebuttal to Trubek’s piece written by one of its own copy editors.

“What exactly is it about digital media that demands the abolition of spelling rules?” Lee Simmons wrote. “Are we saying that professional news sites should spell words in any way that strikes their mood or fancy?”

In her essay, Trubek asks: “Who shud tell us how to spel?” answering with, “Let’s make our own rules.”

But she also seems to undermine her own thesis: “Standardized spelling enables readers to understand writing, to aid communication and ensure clarity. Period.”

Indeed. That’s why accurate spelling matters.

167,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2012/01/27/public_editor_online_corrections_essential_for_credibility.html,Public editor: Online corrections essential for credibility,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Jan.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2012-01-27,"The news from the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, headlined in the top spot of the breaking news lineup on thestar.com’s home page Tuesday morning, declared: “Town council votes itself 43 per cent raise.”

Almost immediately, online commenters began to weigh in on news about the controversial pay hike debated for months throughout the town: “They have got to be kidding, a 43% raise,” said one. Echoed another, “What were they thinking, taking 43%.”

Not long after, reporter Kate Allen, who had filed this news to the web in haste, realized she had erred and misunderstood the actual numbers councillors had voted on. In fact, it was an 18.6 per cent raise for councillors and 16 per cent for the mayor. Allen informed her editor, Dave Beer, and the online story was changed. So too was the “updated” home page headline, which now told a different story altogether: “Whitchurch-Stouffville councillors back down on massive pay raise.”

If incorrect information is published online and subsequently changed, did a mistake actually occur? Should readers be told what was initially wrong? Or, in the digital news universe, do updates replace corrections?

Reader Val Dodge, who read the two online versions of the Star’s report — and sent me screen shots of both — told me he was “disturbed” the Star had not acknowledged the original error.

“I think it is incumbent upon the Star to openly acknowledge online errors, especially ones as egregious as this one,” Dodge said. “It may be acceptable to silently fix a misspelled word or misplaced punctuation, but silently changing a headline so that it means the exact opposite of its original wording is far beyond what I would consider acceptable.”

This reader is correct. What happened here was not acceptable.

The Star’s accuracy and corrections policy applies to all content on all platforms. It says that errors, in print or online, must be corrected clearly, promptly and prominently. It also states, “Building trust in the digital world demands that the Star is seen to be transparent.”

In this case, readers needed to be clearly informed in an online correction that the first report was wrong. As David Cash, CAO and town manager of Whitchurch-Stouffville, said in an email: “The town is very concerned about this error as it immediately generated a number of comments on the website that left people with incorrect information, which further perpetuated the error.”

I knew nothing of this until I received Dodge’s email. The original story had been changed in the newsroom and the public editor’s office was not informed — as we should have been.

For almost 40 years now, since the creation of its “Bureau of Accuracy” the Star’s public editor (long titled the ombudsman) has had responsibility for determining and publishing daily corrections.

Like much else that is necessarily changing as newspapers evolve to become fully digital, the Star’s centralized print-centric corrections process must also evolve to reflect the reality of 24/7 publishing in which every journalist in the newsroom can easily amend/fix/update/correct/publish online content.

Digital content is published, updated and amended (necessarily) around the clock. That means everyone in the newsroom must take responsibility for ensuring that the Star is as vigorous about correcting and acknowledging online errors as we have long been in print.

Star Editor Michael Cooke sent a note to the newsroom this week to make this clear to all.

In recent months, I’ve grown increasingly concerned about the Star’s level of transparency about online errors, having come across far too many examples of the newsroom “fixing” stories without acknowledging mistakes.

I know no one likes making mistakes. And certainly, some journalists are reluctant to own up to errors. But we owe it to our readers to be clear about what we’ve corrected online, lest we create confusion about what is accurate.

Not all journalists agree. Some contend that mistakes online are rectified when a story is republished with corrected information. They suggest that the very ease of online publishing means there is little more need for actual corrections that tell readers what was first wrong.

That’s not the view of reputable news organizations that understand the vital importance of credibility. I’ve spent considerable time learning about online corrections policies of various newsrooms around the world including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, NPR and the BBC.

The New York Times strives to correct and acknowledge online errors regardless of how little time the inaccurate information was online. “The policy is to correct and be transparent about what was corrected when an error is made regardless of whether it’s been online for five seconds, five minutes or five hours,” public editor Arthur Brisbane told an ombudsman conference last spring.

All the organizations I consulted share the conviction that transparency demands we should not “scrub” digital content, that is, just fix it and hope no one notices.

Because, of course, someone always notices.

168,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2011/01/28/english_to_err_really_is_human.html,English: To err really is human,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Jan.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2011-01-28,"Among the more comical mistakes published in the Star recently was a typo that transposed two letters in a word to turn the “marital bed” into the “martial bed.”

Many readers wondered if there was some sort of Freudian slip in misspelling “marital” as “martial” in the first paragraph of a Jan 18 article about the perils of adultery in the marriage bed.

“The bed they practised their martial arts in? Bed for a court martial? I can't believe an editor let THAT one slip by!” commented W.J.R. Halyn.

Why do journalists make such silly mistakes? How indeed does an error that jumps out at readers slip through the Star’s editing process?

In search of greater insight and understanding into these persistent reader questions, I turned to two recently published books that delve deeply into the psychology and philosophy of our innate fallibility: Why We Make Mistakes, by Joseph T. Hallinan, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, and Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz, also an award-winning journalist.

Though neither of these journalists writes specifically about media errors, their compelling insights into the nature of human error help explain how mistakes are made and why being wrong is inevitable in any endeavour in which mere mortals are involved.

Journalists are well aware that typos, grammar gaffes, misspellings and inaccuracies mar a news organization’s credibility and annoy its readers. I know that most writers take great care to double-check their work and editors aim to catch errors before they are published.

But, who among us — journalist or reader — has not had the experience of checking our work and missing our mistakes?

Hallinan, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, tells us this is the human condition. His cites research indicating that even the most careful readers do not read every single letter, in every single word, in every single sentence.

That reality helps explains an error in his former newspaper that referred to a competition of British jesters who would be riding on unicorns. In fact, as the Journal’s subsequent correction noted, the clowns were to ride unicycles.

“For anyone interested in mistakes, the corrections columns of newspapers often make delicious reading,” he notes.

Unicorn, unicycle, marital, martial. All too often, it is all the same to the human eye.

“It’s tempting to attribute mistakes like this to simple carelessness,” Hallinan writes. The reality is more complex however. Most people skim and miss some details.

And, he adds, “the more skilled we are, the more likely we are to skim.” That explains why even highly skilled editors miss mistakes.

“We see only what we expect to see,” Hallinan says. “Overlooked mistakes are so common that researchers have given them their own designation: they are called ‘proofreader’s errors’

“These humdrum errors reveal some interesting quirks about the way human perception works. Perception, above all, is economical. We notice some things and not others.”

As well, as something becomes more familiar we tend to notice less, not more and “we come to see things not as they are but as (we assume) they ought to be.

“We are blinded by the effects of habit and hubris and hobbled by a poor understanding of our own limitations. We don’t see all that we observe, and yet we sometimes ‘see’ things we don’t know we’ve seen.”

Schulz expresses a similar idea about how we look but do not see in Being Wrong, an engaging philosophical examination of the inevitability of human error.

“To be blind without realizing our blindness is, figuratively the situation all of us are in when we are in error,” she writes.

If this is so, should we simply give up and accept the inevitability of what readers perceive to be journalistic carelessness?

Of course not. While typos rooted in human error may indeed be somewhat inevitable in any publication, we can aim to minimize them. Both of these writers contend we must understand our innate fallibility to devise better methods to see clearly and catch our mistakes.

“It helps to second-guess, to play devil’s advocate with yourself,” Hallinan writes. “We all think we are above average. In this conceit lies the seeds of many mistakes.”

Hallinan points to professions such a pilots and anesthesiologists that have minimized life-threatening “human error” by devising checklists that acknowledge the possibility of mistakes and enhance awareness of what can go wrong.

Similar measures in newsrooms include accuracy checklists and production systems that assure all copy is read over by fresh eyes before publication. The reality is that such measures are often skipped in the rush to deadline and mistakes make it into print.

To minimize human error, Schulz suggests we need to be humble and know that what can go wrong often will go wrong: “If we want to try to eradicate error, we have to start by assuming that it is inevitable.”

Indeed, mistakes happen.

169,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2010/05/01/english_who_decides_whats_news.html,English: Who decides what’s news,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorsat.', 'May', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2010-05-01,"“How did Céline Dion’s backyard merit a front-page photo,” reader Michelle Guilmette asked this week. “Is there nothing else newsworthy out there?”

The day before, reader Bill Archibald emailed to inquire why the Star had devoted time and space to the story of Ludwig the cat who went missing at Pearson airport. Why, he asked, is a lost cat news?

In any given week, readers of the Star are apt to ask some variation of the essential questions at the heart of those emails: What is news? Who decides what the Star pays attention to — and what it ignores. What runs on Page 1 and on the home page of thestar.com?

Readers are quick to weigh in on what the Star covers as well as what it doesn’t cover.

I often hear from those of you who are disappointed that the Star did not cover an event in which you have a particular interest. For example, this week a reader wondered why he could not find news about the Princess Patricia’s Regiment anniversary celebrations in the Star.

Another longtime reader, a 70-year-old man who told me he was sexually abused in his childhood, wrote an impassioned letter imploring the Star to provide more coverage of the serious questions raised in the final report (released last December) of Ontario’s public inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Cornwall.

The Oxford Canadian Dictionary defines news as “information about important or interesting recent events.” There’s broad scope in that for judgment about what is “important” — information you need to know — and what is “interesting” — stuff you might want to know.

Deciding what’s news is the core work of the media. As the renowned journalist and media critic Walter Lippman once said: “All the reporters in the world, working all the hours of the day, could not witness all the happenings in the world.”

Journalism is, by necessity, the art of selection, of deciding what matters and how to present that to audiences. While the Internet and the emergence of “citizen journalism” and social media have made it easier to connect and communicate within our global village, leading some to argue that journalism’s role as a “gatekeeper” is not necessary, there’s a case to be made that the barrage of accessible information makes the editor’s job of selection more vital.

The Star’s senior editors strive to provide a mix of what they believe readers need to know and what you might want to know. Clearly, on any given day, their news judgment won’t be in accord with that of all readers — or even all Star journalists. “Why is that news?” is a sentiment as apt to be expressed in the newsroom as in the public editor’s email box.

Indeed, such was the case with Thursday’s Page 1 play of Céline Dion’s $20 million new estate. For my part, I’m with reader Keung Lui who wrote: “I am happy for Céline and her 8-year-old son that they could afford a $20 million play house. But is this so-called news worth the front page of the Toronto Star? Don’t you have some real and more important news to report?”

How do journalists decide what is news? Is news simply determined by an editor’s whim, as expressed by the oft-cited cliché of the powerful editor who declares, “News is what I say it is.”

Textbook definitions of news that aim to teach aspiring journalists how to develop “news judgment” are of little practical use in the daily, and increasingly online, hourly, fray of deciding what’s news. For example, few editors ever consciously consider what one text tells us: “News is information about a break from the normal flow of events, an interruption in the unexpected” (practical translation: Dog bites man: not news. Man bites dog: news).

Stanley Walker, the famous editor of the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune defined news as the three W’s — “women, wampum and wrongdoing” (practical translation: sex, money and crime). That’s sexist, to be sure. How far off is it, though? Consider how those universal elements figure in many important and interesting news stories.

Journalism textbooks define the factors of newsworthiness as the impact of information on citizens, whether conflict and controversy are involved, timeliness, the prominence of those involved and proximity to the audience.

Novelty and oddity also factor in. Many successful editors, striving to appeal to readers, have long defined news as that which makes a reader say, “Gee whiz!”

For most journalists, deciding what’s news is instinctive, rooted in experience and their perceptions of what readers want. Practical factors such as space, reporting resources, the mix of hard news and softer features, the number of events competing for attention, as well as the availability of compelling photos to illustrate the news, are also at play.

All these theories aside, there is one overriding consideration that helps explain the daily puzzle of what is news: What’s newsworthy on a “slow news day” is far different than what you’ll read when a natural disaster happens or a parliamentary scandal breaks.

It’s a safe bet that Céline Dion’s water-park would not have made such a splash on the day a tsunami struck or there was a tidal wave of earth-shaking news.

170,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2009/11/07/english_in_defence_of_the_right_to_offend.html,English: In defence of the right to offend,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorsat.', 'Nov.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2009-11-07,"C olumnists occupy a privileged perch in journalism, having the freedom to express their opinions on issues that matter to them.

The considerable distinction between news reporting and columnists' opinions in the Star is often not clear to readers, however. That's sometimes because the Star doesn't clearly indicate when an article is an opinion column. But there's also much misunderstanding about the scope of Star columnists.

Simply put, news is the unbiased, fair reporting of facts, gathered and verified by reporters. Columns are expressions of opinions about facts.

Among the most frequent subjects of complaint to the public editor's office is that some columnist or another at the Star is ""biased,"" ""unobjective"" or ""unfair."" The reality is that opinion columnists can indeed be biased, unobjective and yes, sometimes, unfair.

That's the nature of opinion journalism. Opinion columns are a columnist's arguments for a particular point of view. And vigorous argument is not necessarily fair and balanced, as you should expect the news to be.

As Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, told me in an email discussion about whether public editors should weigh in on the fairness of opinion columns: ""I think it is virtually impossible to judge the `fairness' of arguments made by a newspaper or those it licenses to offer their own opinions.

""Argument is almost by definition unfair, in the sense that one marshalls facts to support a conclusion, emphasizing some and de-emphasizing or ignoring others. Someone who disagrees with the conclusion almost always thinks that has been done unfairly.""

Columnists at the Star have wide latitude in articulating their opinions and the manner in which they express their views – however outrageous those views may seem to some. If I had a loonie for every time a reader told me he or she considered an opinion column in the Star to be ""unfair"" or ""offensive,"" I could escape dreary November and be sunning on the Mediterranean right now.

Instead, I'm in Montreal today, attending the annual conference of the Canadian Media Lawyers Association, also called Ad IDEM – Advocates in Defence of Expression in the Media. I tell you this because the core mission of this organization – standing up for the Charter right of freedom of expression given to all Canadians – is at the heart of a newspaper columnist's right to express opinions that some may find offensive.

As Justice Ian Binnie said in last year's Supreme Court ruling on fair comment: ""We live in a free country where people have as much right to express outrageous and ridiculous opinions as moderate ones. ... Public controversy can be a rough trade and the law needs to accommodate its requirements.""

Star columnists are guided by these legal freedoms, which include the obligation that opinions expressed in columns be based on fact. Like all journalists, opinion columnists must also abide by laws regarding libel and hate speech.

Columnists speak for themselves, not the newspaper (the views of the Star are expressed on the editorial page). That doesn't mean ""anything goes.""

The Star's columnists are subject to editorial oversight and this news organization's ethical standards. It's not unusual for columnists to alter what they have to say, or the manner in which they say it, at the behest of astute editors offering wise second thought.

Still, I'm often asked: ""Why did the editor let that in the paper?""

My answer: Generally, editors give columnists wide latitude in expressing their personal opinions in recognition both of the right to freedom of expression and journalistic traditions of what makes for a compelling column.

As Poets, Pundits and Wits, a collection of newspaper columns, tells us, columnizing is a ""self-indulgent"" occupation, and columnists have licence to be ""rude, reckless, silly and prejudiced.""

That same view was expressed by the recently deceased William Safire in a note to the New York Times' A.M. Rosenthal when Rosenthal became a columnist: ""As you cultivate the garden of controversy, burn the bridges of objectivity. Show me an even-handed columnist and I'll show you an odds-on favourite soporific.""

It's the right and the role – arguably, even the responsibility – of columnists to poke and provoke, enrage and offend. In doing so, the best columnists can make us think and reach our own conclusions about issues that matter to us.

Readers often ask me to weigh in on the ""fairness"" of opinion columns. I don't think it's fair to offer my opinion on a columnist's opinion. I do tell these readers that they have the right to express dissenting opinions through letters to the editor or online comments.

Certainly, I don't always agree with the opinions published in the Star.

But, as a defender of the right to free expression, I must defend the right to offend.

Energy Minister Greg Rickford on Tuesday announced Susanna Zagar, a long-time bureaucrat, as the new chief executive officer of the OEB.

Lynne Anderson, who was appointed to the board by the previous Liberal government in 2017, will be the OEB’s new chief commissioner.

“I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,” Rickford said in a statement.

“Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario’s energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB review panel,” he said.

In the wake of the Tories’ cronyism scandal last summer — when Premier Doug Ford’s then chief of staff resigned suddenly amid a furor over patronage postings — the government has moved to make appointments less partisan.

The province says reforms at the OEB are aimed at “enhancing transparency and accountability” and “pursuing greater efficiencies” by “reducing regulatory burden.”

Zagar, a former senior civil servant at Queen’s Park, has most recently been chief strategy officer at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.

Also being appointed to the OEB are: John Knubley, a former federal deputy minister; business owner Gerald Moncrief; former media CEO Glenn O’Farrell; energy expert Marie Oswald; and business consultant Allison Duff.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"If you watched in disbelief as Donald Trump commuted the sentence of convicted felon Roger Stone — his unjust reward for thwarting the justice system to protect the president — you weren’t alone.

It’s not just Americans or Canadians who were shaking their heads over the injustice of it all.

In Beijing’s leadership compound, and in Huawei’s halls of power, they likely had a similar reaction last week. And a pointed question:

Why should Canada’s earnest claims about the impartiality and integrity of the justice system — not ours, but America’s — be taken seriously by China, or us, if Trump now treats it as a joke?

Which raises another question: If many Americans no longer have faith in their own system, and China clearly doesn’t, why are we putting the Canadian justice system — and the lives of our fellow citizens — on the line?

When the Mounties arrested Huawei’s Meng Wenzhou in transit at Vancouver airport at America’s request, China responded by ransoming the “two Michaels” — diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor — on trumped-up charges. While Canada saw only injustice at the trading in human lives, Trump jumped at the opportunity for horse-trading — musing publicly about a quid pro quo where he would drop the case against Meng if China acquiesced to a trade deal on favourable terms.

Washington later walked back Trump’s incriminating talk. But in the months since, the U.S. has never gone beyond mere finger-wagging over China’s actions.

Between offering to release Meng and announcing the release of Stone, the president has dropped any pretense of legality in the justice system over which he presides. In so doing, he has only deepened China’s political conviction that a judicial conviction in Trump’s America is a matter of political expediency, not impartiality — with Canada acting as an accessory.

Canada has limited leverage with China, but we are not without options — in both Beijing and Washington. With extradition cases, Canada’s justice minister has the legal right to intrude or upend it at anytime, though this has never been done for blatantly political reasons (notably foreign bullying), lest our justice system be held hostage again in future.

But we must also admit that the administration of justice has already been brought into disrepute by this case, which is utterly unlike any other. It involves a powerful defendant and two superpowers jockeying for position in a bipolar world while Canada — a mere middle power — tries to triangulate on behalf of two powerless Canadians.

Watching our citizens interrogated in harsh conditions while Meng lives in the lap of luxury — bankrolling a private security force to satisfy her bail conditions regarding the risk of flight — offends our sense of justice. Quite apart from the asymmetry between Meng and “the two Michaels,” she enjoys privileges not afforded to — or affordable for — ordinary Canadians lacking her money and means.

In light of those inequities, Ottawa could convey to the Chinese that it will instruct Justice Department lawyers to challenge Meng’s bail conditions on the grounds of security (never mind reciprocity). The crown could cite the case of former Renault boss Carlos Ghosn — who overcame strict bail conditions in Japan to flee to his native Lebanon — arguing that it has given Canada cause to reconsider (that it might give China pause to recalibrate can be left unspoken).

Would a judge agree? If China remains convinced that our judiciary abides by political agendas, perhaps a quiet signal that we are considering such a move could serve as a perfectly justifiable — and just — thought experiment.

We must admit, however, that a middle power like Canada has limited leverage with the Chinese. The same cannot be said of the Americans, who are both powerful and vulnerable.

Ottawa would be well within its rights to give the Americans an ultimatum quietly at first, publicly if necessary, framed as a choice for them to make — leaving the ball very much in their court (if not a court of law): Canada must now consider Meng’s release, due not to Chinese actions but American inaction.

That Trump mused last year about releasing Meng for a trade deal — imperilling the “two Michaels” by signalling that Canada was in cahoots on a contrived case — was itself indefensible. What’s truly unconscionable, however, is that the president has said almost nothing consequential since then about China’s pressure tactics.

Imagine for a moment that an American diplomat were arrested in China in retaliation over the Meng case: Trump and Congress would be taking dramatic measures, escalating until China chose to de-escalate.

It would surely impose painful sanctions against China — as it has on Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and others with whom it has grievances, rightly or wrongly. Beyond empty words — few and far between — what has Washington done to make China pay for its transgressions against Canada as we act as America’s jailer?

If China’s rulers can violate international norms with impunity, while an American president flouts his own judicial system with alacrity, what — and whose — rule of law is Canada upholding? Why take the heat for the Trump administration if it is unwilling to generate heat on our behalf?

Time for Ottawa to send signals to both Beijing and Washington: The Chinese and Americans cannot fight their grudge match to the last Canadian.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"A majority of Ontarians support a mix of online and in-class schooling for kids this fall — but feel strongly that teachers must use live video-conferencing when students are learning from home, says a new poll.

The Campaign Research survey, conducted for the Star, also found that 71 per cent of respondents think educators should be mandated to use livestreaming if online learning continues, with the highest level of support in the Halton and Peel Regions.

“The public is nervous, but feeling safe” with the government’s slow reopening during the pandemic, said Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis.

However, he added, people are “still wary about full-on school ... but that could change in a month. If we get down to 50 cases a day, then people might change their mind.”

The poll comes as school boards and the provincial government face pressure to safely open up schools full-time to help working parents — especially women — return to or remain in the workforce as restrictions are eased during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The province has told boards to make plans for three scenarios — online only, in-class or a mix of the two.

Campaign Research polled 1,434 people across Ontario last week, using the Maru Blue opt-in online panel. The equivalent margin of error for a random sample of this size is plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

Among those surveyed, some 51 per cent supported the hybrid model, 18 per cent preferred in-class and 11 per cent supported online only. About 20 per cent did not have an opinion.

As for online learning following the March shutdown of schools, almost 20 per cent said kids’ experience was excellent or good, with 26 per cent characterizing it as fair or poor. Some 55 per cent were unsure.

But just 20 per cent of respondents said the quality of education during the extended shutdown was excellent or good, with 45 per cent calling it fair, or poor. Just over one-third did not have an opinion.

At the legislature on Monday, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said “people can’t go back to work unless their kids are back in school and back in child care. While the premier spent last week ignoring pleas from parents frustrated by the lack of plans for September, school boards across the province spent their last week scrambling to try to put a school year together and calling on the premier to reverse his decision to send kids back to school part-time this fall.”

She also said without an overarching plan, there will be a patchwork of different models and kids should have access to “quality public education that’s pretty equal around the province.”

Premier Doug Ford said with “the best advice that we have from the chief medical officers right across this province we decided to let each school board make a decision, and we gave them three different criteria that they can work with.”

Trustees in Toronto have raised concerns that kids need to be in class full time, and have urged the province to come up with creative solutions — such as finding extra space so schools can have more, smaller classes to accommodate as many students as possible.

Boards had asked the province for local flexibility for this fall, Ford said, and “what I’m hearing from parents is that it’s a good plan. What I’m hearing from school board trustees is, ‘Thank you for giving us the option, rather than forcing options down our back.’”

Ford added that “every jurisdiction is a little different and what applies up in Kenora doesn’t necessarily apply in Hamilton or in Toronto.”

Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh is not the problem — you are.

That’s the message conveyed to Halton Police Chief Steve Tanner in a heated Twitter exchange.

But he dismissed me.

Tanner — and his counterparts in the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police — are offended by Singh telling the country what virtually every Black, Indigenous, person of colour (BIPOC) is already publicly stating: Corey Hurren, the 46-year-old man accused of crashing into the Rideau Hall gate on July 2 to enter the grounds where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lives, would’ve been treated very differently by police if he wasn’t white.

Singh noted if a person could potentially kill the prime minister or show up with weapons at the PM’s residence and leave in handcuffs without any violence, why would a person be killed in his own home? (Mississauga resident Ejaz Choudry, 62, was fatally shot by Peel Regional Police during a mental health crisis at home last month).

“That to me is what systemic racism in policing is all about, that difference,” Singh told The Canadian Press.

Singh’s right.

He’s reiterating what the Black Lives Matter movement has been pointing out all along: We deserve to be treated with care, too; no one needs to suffer or die in police custody.

Tanner trolled Singh, tweeting: “A situation safely resolved and you choose to somehow make it an issue about racism? I suppose you openly believe the accused should have been killed by the Rcmp then. Politics at an all time low.”

Clearly, Tanner is clueless when it comes to matters involving both race and social media. He flips the script, accusing Singh of politicking, while making inflammatory comments and tagging the press.

Wouldn’t it be prudent for police chiefs — of all people right now — to appear diplomatic, empathetic to civilians, especially BIPOC, in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police?

He might as well just tweet it: Blue Lives Matter more.

This OACP statement demonstrates peak 2020 gaslighting: demanding an apology from Singh for not applauding the Rideau Hall suspect’s successful de-escalation and arrest.

Again, they’re missing the point.

Yes, this was good policing — Singh never said it wasn’t. He merely stated facts: BIPOC suspects deserve to be treated the same way as white suspects.

But for Tanner, that’s onerous given he’s overseeing the safest and whitest region in the west GTA.

RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki is equally one-dimensional.

Lucki and Brian Sauvé of the National Police Federation released a statement —without explicitly naming Singh — asserting “speculation” is damaging an “important national dialogue with all stakeholders seeking solutions to societal issues.”

The white cops with all the weapons and power are centering themselves as the victims here, and they aren’t looking for solutions. They want a scapegoat and it’s the dude with the turban.

Cops aren’t listening.

Even if they try, the message is being delivered by white journalists who view the world through the same Eurocentric lens; predictably pathetic in its overt bias toward Hurren, who’s facing 22 charges.

Singh never suggested the accused should’ve been killed in that interaction with RCMP. Again, BIPOC should be afforded the same level of care as Hurren. That’s all.

Tanner could have added something constructive to the conversation but chose what he knows best: his whiteness.

It was echoed by Bell Media’s mediocre article, advancing the story solely off of Tanner’s tweet without providing any context.

Who the hell is Tanner and why should anyone care what he thinks? Where was the reaction from Halton taxpayers — especially BIPOC — to his unabashedly pro-white sentiments?

A nut graf on Halton’s municipalities and demographics, namely wealthy white people and cops from other GTA regions?

Milton is the fastest-growing community in Ontario and sixth overall in Canada, 2016 Census data shows. In white policing circles, Milton is dubbed “Brampton West” due to the infiltration of Black and brown people in recent years, many from Peel.

Tanner’s hyper-vigilance on Twitter is disappointing; it’s degrading to BIPOC, civilians, his own racialized officers whose humanity he fails to acknowledge.

He just sees himself in uniform; white and blue.

Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-07-12,"OTTAWA—The federal Conservatives want Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to testify before a parliamentary committee about his government’s controversial decision to enlist WE Charity to administer a $900-million student volunteer program.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre laid out the demand Sunday amid growing pressure on Trudeau and Liberal cabinet ministers to explain the genesis of the sole-sourced deal with WE, which was announced late last month before being cancelled days later.

“He needs to explain where exactly the idea came from,” Poilievre said during a news conference on Parliament Hill in which he acknowledged the rarity of prime ministers appearing before parliamentary committees.

“Did the WE organization call him and suggest it? Did it come through the staff in his office? Did it come out of his own head? Did members of his family who had been paid by the organization suggest it to him. We need to hear directly from him on these questions.”

Trudeau announced the Canadian Student Services Grant on June 25, saying tens of thousands of students having a hard time finding summer work due to COVID-19 could volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

But the program came under immediate scrutiny after it was discovered that WE had been chosen to administer it. Trudeau said federal public servants had recommended the organization and that it was considered the only one capable of delivering the program.

Trudeau nonetheless faced accusations of cronyism and allegations of a conflict of interest over his past connections with WE. Those allegations have only grown after revelations his wife, brother and mother have been paid a combined $300,000 for appearing at a number of WE events.

The prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau have both confirmed they did not recuse themselves from the cabinet vote that approved giving the contract to WE. One of Morneau’s daughters has spoken at WE events while another does contract work for the organization.

Morneau’s office has denied any link between his daughters’ work and the WE agreement. The Conservatives and NDP have nonetheless asked ethics commissioner Mario Dion, who is already investigating Trudeau over the deal, to also look into a potential conflict of interest by Morneau.

The government and WE terminated the deal on July 3, which had promised the organization up to $19 million in payment depending on how many students participated. The federal employment and social development department has since taken over the program.

Poilievre said it is essential the prime minister appear before the finance committee personally to answer questions about the deal given that the controversy involves him personally and the House of Commons has been largely suspended due to COVID-19.

“Now there are two ways that this can be done,” Poilievre said. “Either the prime minister can agree voluntarily to show up and attend and respect the invitation of a parliamentary committee. That is what he will do if he has nothing to hide.

“Or Parliament can compel him to appear. Something that would take longer, but could be done — and should be done — if the prime minister hides from accountability.”

Such a move would need support from the Bloc Québécois and NDP to even have a chance. Poilievre had yet to present his plan to the other parties on Sunday, but said: “If the opposition parties are interested in getting to the truth, they will vote in favour of that motion.”

The Bloc did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday while NDP finance critic Peter Julian was noncommittal.

“New Democrats believe in getting to the bottom of this and the more answers we get (including from Trudeau and Morneau) the quicker we can get those answers for the Canadian public,” he said in a statement. “Canadians want answers and they need to know this won’t happen again.”

Even if the opposition parties agree to order Trudeau to appear before the committee using their superior numbers in the House of Commons, there is no guarantee it would happen, said University of Ottawa parliamentary expert Philippe Lagassé.

While the House of Commons can compel a member of Parliament to appear before a committee, Lagassé says that MP — in this case the prime minister — would likely ask the Speaker to rule on whether the request is appropriate or not.

“The House can say: ‘In this case, we really need to hear from this person and therefore we’re going to force them to appear,’” Lagassé said. “But that would require a ruling from the Speaker in all likelihood because there would be some differences of interpretation.”

None of which addresses when Parliament would have a chance to address the issue, Lagassé said, given that the House of Commons is only scheduled to sit a total of three days between now and Sept. 21.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"OTTAWA—WE Charity hired 465 people to help administer the federal government’s student volunteer grant program. And then a political scandal hit.

The charity organization laid off 450 contract workers across the country last week and told them not to speak about their work with WE. The charity told the Star that the 15 other new hires were given full-time positions within the organization.

The workers were hired as contractors — some fixed-term, others “independent” — to deliver the Canada Student Service Grant, the Liberal government’s $900-million program to pay students for volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially said WE was selected to run the program because it was the “best and only” organization capable of doing it.

But as the government faced persistent questioning about Trudeau and his family’s personal relationship with WE, and the decision to give the charity $19.5 million to administer the program, the Liberals and WE announced a mutual decision to nix the deal.

Now hundreds of people caught in the middle of the unfolding political scandal are out of work as the global pandemic stretches on.

“While we were hopeful that we might continue to work with a number of these individuals, the circumstances we are facing as a result of the (program) made this impossible,” WE Charity wrote in a statement to the Star on Saturday. “Due to the transition of the (program), we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to end the contracts for those hired in that capacity.”

WE said that, since handing the program back to the government, the charity “did not take any of the funds that were allocated to pay for the work to date or remaining work.

“All sunk costs and remaining payments to staff and vendors are being paid for by WE Charity.”

Two sources told the Star that WE originally indicated it would honour the contracts, most of which were set to end Aug. 31, according to the organization. But on Tuesday, the sources said, WE let them go. The organization told the Star that workers were given additional compensation based on how long they had worked with WE.

Asked about the confusion over WE honouring the full contract, the charity said: “We apologize if any of our communications with these employees felt incomplete.”

One of the clauses of the termination agreement with WE instructed its former contractors not to speak to the media about their work with the charity.

“The clauses in the contracts for fixed term and independent contractors related to intellectual property and maintaining confidentiality are standard across the organization,” WE wrote in a statement.

The WE deal has become a significant political scandal for Trudeau and the Liberals. While questions were immediately raised about the prime minister’s participation in WE-hosted events, and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau’s connections to the charity, it was revealed last week that WE’s for-profit corporation paid Trudeau’s mother and brother a combined $282,000 in speaking fees between 2016 and 2020.

On Friday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was drawn into the scandal after his office admitted that his daughter was employed by the charity.

Neither Morneau nor Trudeau recused themselves from cabinet’s decision to award the contract to WE. Trudeau is now facing his third ethics investigation as prime minister, and the opposition NDP is urging ethics commissioner Mario Dion to launch a similar probe into Morneau.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"On his rudimentary-looking website created in the 2000s, nestled among flaming GIFs and links to online gaming sites and Bruce Lee shrines, Corey Hurren listed “other sites of interest” in a fiery-red, all-caps font.

The websites peddled conspiracies related to extraterrestrial life, debunked 9/11 claims and discussions of mind control. The sites included whatreallyhappened.com and theforbiddenknowledge.com, but also one of the most well-known far-right conspiracy sites, InfoWars.com.

Minutes before Hurren is alleged to have crashed his Dodge pickup through Rideau Hall’s pedestrian gates in the early hours of July 2, a COVID-19 conspiracy meme was posted on his social media accounts. At the time, it seemed the Canadian Forces reservist’s turn toward conspiracy theories was relatively recent — potentially accelerated by the endless online hours of the COVID-19 lockdown.

But the 46-year-old Manitoban’s old personal website reviewed by the Star suggests Hurren — who was arrested near Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s residence on the Rideau Hall grounds, accused of carrying multiple firearms — was drawn to conspiracy-peddling websites and “alternative news” outlets going back almost two decades.

As Hurren now faces 22 charges and a potential national security investigation, a more full but still incomplete portrait is emerging.

He is a former artillery soldier in the Canadian Armed Forces turned committed Ranger — the reservist unit that helps patrol Canada’s vast northern and remote regions.

To his friends and acquaintances in Swan Valley, Man., he is a likeable, “down to earth” family man who spent years behind the counter at the local co-op store and was active in community events.

In his younger years, though, he frequently changed jobs — he took courses in policing and web design, and worked as a bouncer, a taxidermist and delivery driver — and struggled with finances.

And he is someone who appears to have been sucked into some of the darker corners of the internet.

Around 6:30 a.m. on Thursday, July 2, a black Dodge Ram crashed through the pedestrian gate at Rideau Hall, the viceregal grounds home to both Canada’s head of state and head of government.

An armed man emerged from the truck and proceeded on foot towards a greenhouse on the property. Just before 7 a.m., RCMP officers intercepted and started talking to the man. After almost two hours of “de-escalation,” according to the Mounties, the suspect was arrested “without incident.”

Hurren was charged the following day with 22 offences, mostly firearm-related and none of which have been proven in court.

But one of the many unanswered questions about that morning is what threats Hurren is supposed to have made.

After initially reporting that the suspect was non-threatening and just wanted to “speak” to Trudeau, Global News released a report detailing a two-page note Hurren is alleged to have had with him. The Star has not been able to independently verify the content of the note.

According to Global, Hurren said he feared Canada was turning into a “communist dictatorship” under Trudeau, and that the suspension of Parliament during the COVID-19 pandemic was preventing government accountability.

The note also reportedly expressed fears Hurren, a father of two who runs a popular sausage making company called Grindhouse Fine Foods, wouldn’t be able to get back on his feet after the pandemic ends.

“I still don’t necessarily see this as an ideologically-motivated attack. Just because you believe in conspiracy theories doesn’t mean that’s why he ended up doing what he did,” said Jessica Davis, a security consultant and former CSIS analyst, in an interview with the Star.

“His motivation really does seem quite mixed. And that’s pretty common these days. Gone are the days, and I don’t even know if they really existed, where we had individuals who were motivated to conduct violence just for a single reason, just because personal motivations or just because of political motivations. I think now we’re seeing that bleed over between the two.”

Reached Friday evening, Hurren’s lawyer, Michael Davies, said “I have no comment. Thank you.”

The Star attempted to reach out to Hurren’s family. A woman who identified herself as Hurren’s younger sister said they weren’t prepared to comment as emotions were still too raw.

Talk to people across the picturesque Swan River Valley region of western Manitoba and the reaction to last week’s gate-crashing incident in Ottawa is almost universally one of shock.

To locals, Hurren was the friendly guy who spent years behind the meat counter at the co-op store in Swan River, the guy who became something of a minor celebrity for his spicy sausage recipe, and the guy who gave back to the community. He is said to have devoted a lot of time to the Bowsman Lions Club — helping out at pancake breakfast fundraisers and updating the club’s Facebook page with fresh content — and the local red-uniformed Canadian Ranger patrol group.

“I know his mother very well. His wife and kids are nice people. I’m actually in shock,” said Mel Edmunds, a Bowsman resident.

“It’s mind-boggling. Totally out of character.”

Stuart Walmsley, a councillor with the Municipality of Minitonas-Bowsman, recalled that Hurren had approached the municipality on a couple of occasions to raise concerns about road repairs.

“He was always very respectful, courteous and grateful,” Walmsley said.

“I never ever felt he would be a threat to anyone . . .What was the tipping point? I have no idea.”

In the same way that social media offers clues about his state of mind leading up to the attack, older posts provide a glimpse of the beliefs he’s held.

In 2015, his wife posted an article he had written describing why he was “proud to be called an ‘Old Stock Canadian.’ ” Raised in Birch River, Hurren described helping his father farm the land and raising bison.

“Our family history records also show many generations of proud men in uniform and their Canadian military service records,” he writes.

“We are the people who built this country, defended this country, and made it one of the most desirable places on the planet to live. That is also why people still want to come here and start a better life. If some of you still think it is an insult to be called an ‘Old Stock Canadian’ then I think you are wrong. It is a title and a heritage that you should be proud of.”

In late 2002, Hurren filed for bankruptcy, federal records show, declaring $63,281 in liabilities, and $2,300 in assets (mostly household furniture and a 1978 Yamaha motorcycle that he described as “not running”).

Hurren spent 11 years working at the Swan Valley Co-op until he resigned in September 2019, said general manager Colin Peters. It is not clear why he resigned. But during this time, he perfected his own spicy garlic-jalapeno sausage recipe that he would bring to market under the brand GrindHouse Fine Foods.

A January 2018 profile in the local Swan Valley Star and Times newspaper said his “Ring of Fire” sausage was “flying off the shelves.” But the global pandemic arrested Hurren’s success, forcing him to put his business on hiatus.

“As some of you may already know, things have been on hold with my GrindHouse meat products due to the logistics of the COVID-19 situation,” Hurren wrote in a recent Facebook post last May.

While the pandemic had stalled his meat business, it did not stop his involvement with the Canadian Ranger patrol group, which he joined in May 2019. The Department of National Defence confirmed Hurren was employed in Operation Laser, the Canadian Armed Forces’ response to COVID-19, and was considered to be on duty the morning of July 2.

Hurren was drawing an equivalent salary of a Canadian Armed Forces member, a military source confirmed, complicating the financial concerns he reportedly detailed in his note.

According to Hurren’s social media accounts, the Ranger patrol helped with crowd control as recently as last month during a high school graduation parade.

But Hurren’s social media posts also showed that he was becoming increasingly worried — and paranoid — about the impact of COVID-19.

In April, a link to the book “How to survive a pandemic: Life lessons for Coping with Covid 19” appeared on his Instagram page.

Last month, a meme depicting an emergency broadcast alert that permitted citizens to commit “any and all crime, including murder” for 12 continuous hours appeared on Hurren’s feeds. “So how long until this gets broadcast and the sirens start?” the post reads.

Just minutes before the truck crashed through Rideau Hall gates, one of Hurren’s accounts reposted a COVID-19 conspiracy theory, “Event 201.” Event 201 was a tabletop exercise run by Johns Hopkins University in 2019, envisioning how the world would react to a global pandemic. But conspiracy theorists have seized on it, as well as its connection to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to suggest without basis that COVID-19 was planned.

According to Bill Gade, a councillor with the Minitonas-Bowsman municipality who started a GoFundMe page for Hurren’s wife and children that has raised over $10,000, some local residents have been reflecting on whether there was anything they could’ve done to intervene.

“If you came here and lined up everyone in town, no one would be sad to see Corey today. No one is mad. They’re hurt. There’s not that anger here. There’s a feeling we failed to help our friend when we should’ve.”

Read', 'Alex Boutilierottawa Bureau', 'Ottawa Bureau']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA—The RCMP’s brass and union are pushing back against suggestions that the Rideau Hall break-in would have ended with violence if the suspect wasn’t white.

In a joint statement released Friday evening, RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki and Brian Sauvé, the head of the Mounties’ newly formed union, called speculation that the incident last Thursday would have had a “different outcome” based on the suspect’s race “disheartening.”

“This creates an abstract and negative distraction from an evolving and important national dialogue with all stakeholders seeking solutions to societal issues,” Lucki and Sauvé wrote in a statement posted to the RCMP’s website.

“In fact, it may only further distance some of Canada’s communities from the vast majority of dedicated and caring police officers who respect all people and keep their communities safe.”

RCMP officers arrested Corey Hurren on the grounds of Rideau Hall after a black Dodge Ram truck plowed through the pedestrian gate on the morning of July 2. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family live at Rideau Cottage, not far from where Hurren was arrested.

According to the RCMP, Hurren had four firearms in his possession that day — including a restricted handgun and a prohibited rifle. Police have also charged him with uttering threats.

Coming at a time when the national police force is facing criticism for systemic racism and is under scrutiny for several violent incidents against Indigenous people, Hurren’s race was immediately noted by critics on social media and in Parliament.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh contrasted Hurren’s arrest with the case of Ejaz Choudry, a 62-year-old who was shot by police in Mississauga on June 22 after his family called a non-emergency help line. The family was concerned Choudry, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia, was not taking his medication.

“That contrast — someone showed up to potentially kill the prime minister of Canada, or with weapons at his residence, and that person was arrested without any violence, and you had a person who, in his own home, was killed,” Singh told reporters Wednesday. “That, to me, is what systemic racism in policing is all about, that difference.”

Lucki and Sauvé did not mention Singh’s comments in their statement.

While the RCMP is facing increased public scrutiny, Lucki herself is facing anger from the rank and file for her acknowledgment of systemic racism within the national police force.

Last month, with controversy swirling around the RCMP’s policing of Black and Indigenous Canadians, Lucki told reporters that she “struggled” with the suggestion that systemic racism exists within the police force. Lucki later reversed that position and acknowledged there is systemic discrimination within the force.

Internal emails leaked to the Star suggest some members feel “betrayed” by Lucki’s comments, and suggest that the commissioner “threw (them) under the bus.”

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA—Finance Minister Bill Morneau took part in the Liberal cabinet’s decision to award a multimillion-dollar contract to WE Charity despite his daughter working for the organization.

Grace Acan has been employed by WE Charity and its for-profit corporation, ME to WE, since August 2019.

Despite his daughter’s employment with the organization, Morneau participated in the cabinet discussion and decision to pay WE Charity $19.5 million to run a $900-million student volunteer grant program.

That decision is at the centre of a widening ethics scandal for the Liberal government, which has so far forced the government to reverse course on the program, revealed a financial relationship between WE and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family, and spawned a third ethics investigation into the prime minister’s actions.

WE Charity confirmed Acan is an employee. The connection was first revealed by Canadaland and the CBC on Friday.

“(Acan) is a contractual employee of WE in an administrative role in the travel department since 2019, following her internship there as part of her undergraduate education in community development,” said Maéva Proteau, a spokesperson for Morneau, in a statement.

“She got this position on her own merits. There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada.”

Federal conflict of interest rules require public office holders such as cabinet ministers to recuse themselves from any “discussion, decision, debate or vote” on any matter that could put them in a conflict of interest.

The rules define a conflict of interest as a public office holder using “an official power, duty or function that provides an opportunity to further his or her private interests or those of his or her relatives or friends.”

Friday afternoon, the NDP’s Charlie Angus asked the federal ethics watchdog to open an investigation into Morneau — in addition to the probe already underway into Trudeau’s actions.

“It would seem apparent that Minister Morneau would recognize that the fact that his family member was an employee of this organization necessitated him to recuse himself regarding this extraordinary decision to outsource nearly a billion-dollar commitment of public funds in a single-source contract,” Angus wrote in a letter to conflict of interest and ethics commissioner Mario Dion.

But the Opposition Conservatives attempted to escalate the scandal from an ethics investigation to a criminal investigation.

Michael Barrett, the Conservative shadow minister for ethics, said the party would write to the RCMP to encourage the national police force to open an investigation into a potential breach of trust.

“The prime minister of Canada awarded a … contract for a program that was tailor-made for this organization, which the prime minister says could only be delivered by this organization, while the government is already delivering a very similar program, the Canada Summer Job program,” Barrett said in an interview with the Star.

“That’s incredibly unusual. And we have members of the prime minister’s family, his mother and his brother specifically, receiving between them hundreds of thousands of dollars from this organization who has been awarded this sole-sourced contract. The prime minister has an ongoing relationship with this organization, as does his wife.”

Barrett dismissed Trudeau’s explanation that he didn’t recuse himself from the discussion because he’s passionate about youth issues.

“This isn’t altruism. It’s capitalism. And it’s capitalism at the expense of the Canadian taxpayer,” Barrett said.

The WE organization confirmed Thursday that it had paid a total of $284,000 to Margaret Trudeau and Alexandre Trudeau, the prime minister’s mother and brother, for a series of speaking engagements at WE-hosted events between 2016 and 2020.

Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the prime minister’s wife, also received a $1,400 honorarium for speaking at a WE-hosted youth event in 2012.

Trudeau is now facing his third ethics investigation in the five years he’s been prime minister. Dion, the ethics commissioner, confirmed last Friday that Trudeau was being investigated for three possible violations: whether he was in a conflict of interest in awarding the contract to WE, whether he gave preference to WE, and whether he should have recused himself from cabinet’s decision to award the contract.

Both Trudeau and Morneau’s office have repeatedly said that the idea to have WE administer the volunteer grant program came from the public service.

Trudeau originally said WE was the “only” organization that could connect students to paid volunteer positions across the country, before his government reversed the decision and gave the program to the public service to administer.

Reach Her Via Email', 'Sdelacourt Thestar.Ca Or Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"In the immediate aftermath of last year’s election, Justin Trudeau said that Canadians had given him “a lot to think about.”

Bob Rae, the man Trudeau named this week as the next ambassador to the United Nations, has turned out to be a significant part of the prime minister’s thinking.

For all the ways in which their lives have intersected over the years, Rae and Trudeau were never particularly close. They both have strong ties to Ontario politics — Rae as a former New Democratic Party premier, Trudeau as a politician who surrounded himself with veterans of Queen’s Park from the days of Liberal power there.

Nine years ago, Rae was holding the reins of the federal Liberal party on an interim basis after the disaster of the 2011 election, when what was once Canada’s “natural governing party” was knocked back to third place in the Commons. A dispirited Trudeau, having served one rookie term as a member of Parliament, was thinking of abandoning his career in politics.

Had Trudeau gone ahead with that escape plan, Rae might well have ended up turning that temporary job into the full-fledged one as leader of the Liberal party.

But that’s not how the universe unfolded.

Trudeau took the leader’s job and it was Rae, the former Ontario premier, who went off to post-political life: teaching, doing some legal work, some international diplomacy, even a lively podcast. Rae, who will be turning 72 next month, also got to spend time fishing, playing the piano and enjoying his grandchildren and his family cottage on Big Rideau Lake.

Something changed, though, after last fall’s election, which saw Trudeau’s power cut down to size and doing all that thinking. Rae started being pulled back again into the orbit of Trudeau’s government, starting with polite, deferential requests for advice.

The first subject was minority government — Trudeau’s new reality after the votes were counted on Oct. 21. Rae has a rich history with them. It was Rae’s proposed amendment to a 1979 budget — when he was an NDP MP in the Commons — that brought down Joe Clark’s Conservative minority government and paved the way for the return of Pierre Trudeau to power in 1980. In Ontario, Rae helped negotiate an accord that put David Peterson’s Liberals in power at Queen’s Park in 1985. Through his five decades in elected office, Rae has seen minorities come and go, at the federal and provincial level.

“Don’t get discouraged,” Rae said this week, when asked what he said in those initial, post-election conversations with the current prime minister. “You know, this is not the end of the world and there’s a chance to rebuild … It’s a good chance to listen and figure out what happened.”

Trudeau was, in fact, listening. “It was a good conversation,” Rae said. “He was very friendly and it was very direct.”

Then again, right after the Christmas break, Rae’s counsel was sought once more; this time because of Ukraine International Airlines crash in Iran that killed 138 people with ties to Canada. Trudeau and his advisers wanted to know what Rae had learned when doing his major report into the 1985 Air India crash. It was in part because of Rae’s counsel, PMO officials said at the time, that Trudeau spent so much time in January with the families of the victims.

A couple of weeks later, Rae headed to Winnipeg to be part of Trudeau’s winter cabinet retreat, talking to ministers about the work he had been doing as a special adviser on the Rohingya humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh.

For a man who had left politics, Rae was spending an awful lot of time around Trudeau and his team in those first months after the election.

Then came the call for lunch — a one-on-one conversation between Rae and Trudeau themselves. It was, incredibly, the first time the two men had sat down together without other people in the room or on the phone.

“That was the first meeting I’d had with him alone,” Rae said. “He used to rely a lot on having other people there in the room. That’s not true anymore.”

The prime minister asked Rae outright: would he be interested in a diplomatic appointment? “I said, ‘sure … what you do have in mind?’” Rae recalled. Trudeau told him that some posts might be coming up in the summer, as the decks were changed at Canadian missions abroad. Rae said he’d consider one if it was offered, and then Trudeau asked Rae if he would also be willing to pitch in with some help trying to win Canada a seat on the UN Security Council.

Canada didn’t win that security council seat — despite best efforts from Rae and Trudeau and others — but Rae did get a new job. Several weeks ago, Rae was quietly offered the post of ambassador to the United Nations, and Trudeau made it official last Monday.

This is a milepost — not just in the relationship between these two politicians, but also in Canada’s history and foreign policy. A global pandemic is shaking the world order, which was already being rocked by great powers such as the United States, China and Britain turning more boldly nationalist. In some ways, the pandemic has accelerated that trend toward nations putting themselves first. COVID-19 has slammed borders shut — including the one between the U.S. and Canada — and citizens around the world have had months to dwell on the perils of a highly interconnected world.

Canada, in the midst of this, is facing the same choice as other nations: turn inward or double down on internationalism. Trudeau has very clearly chosen the latter, and he’s put one of Canada’s most senior political statesmen as his representative at the global crossroads of the United Nations. It is a significant shift between Trudeau in his first term and in his second term, Rae said.

“The number-one priority for the government in the first term was managing the relationship with the United States and in particular, the free-trade issue,” Rae said, “but more broadly, just trying to manage the relationship with the (Donald) Trump administration.”

It’s not like that relationship has become unimportant, Rae said, but Trudeau’s sights are set wider now, to the larger sets of alliances that Canada needs to build in the world.

“COVID is a global event. It’s not a Canadian event or a U.S. event,” Rae said. “I think there’s a tendency to underestimate the truly global nature of this pandemic … It’s forcing everyone to realize that there are a lot of ways in which the world is changing.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has often been compared to a war. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said early in the lockdown that she hoped this crisis would yield another “greatest generation,” the name given to the citizens who helped rebuild after the Second World War.

Rae is a son of that generation, which also helped create the United Nations, and his father, Saul Rae, was one of Canada’s leading diplomats in this era. In the 1970s, Rae’s father served in the post that his son will take up in August, as Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations.

Rae is touched, of course, by the chance to honour his father’s memory by following in his footsteps. In a way, he says, just as age has made him recognize how much he is like his father, the pandemic has made him recognize the similarities between the challenges of that century and this one.

“He was very much part of the generation of diplomats who realized coming out of the Second World War they had worlds to try to build and they weren’t alone,” Rae said. “We’re rebuilding after COVID.”

This can’t just be a domestic exercise, Rae says. “I don’t think we can afford the luxury of ignoring what’s going on in the rest of the world,” he says. “There are a number of countries that are on the verge of financial collapse and that will come to the attention of everybody pretty quickly,” Rae says.

In fact, when he was being asked this week how he foresaw his main job at the United Nations, Rae was saying: “that’s issue number one … that’s staring us in the face. That’s what we have to talk about in New York and wherever else we do business multilaterally.”

Beyond that, the UN could well turn into an important place to negotiate the global rollout of a vaccine, he says, whenever that does arrive. That same tension, between nations looking out for themselves and a co-ordinated, global approach, will play out with the vaccine, Rae says.

“The UN is one of the places where these conversations need to happen and do happen.”

The Star’s Martin Regg Cohn wrote this week how Rae’s entire career had prepared him for the role he is about to take on at the United Nations. While Rae is a little too down-to-earth to talk in terms of destiny, he does have a lifetime of experience accumulated to help him pull off what this job demands.

He attended a UN school in Geneva as a child when his father was posted there, and some of the friendships he forged in those days still endure. As premier from 1990 to 1995, Rae was intensely involved with constitutional negotiations in Canada and labour negotiations in Ontario; skills he will need at the UN. His legal and political work has taken him from Indigenous communities at home to refugee outposts around the world. Rae, in short, specializes in complicated situations — and the UN is going to be a complex place in a pandemic-wracked world.

When asked to predict what he’d enjoy most about the new job, Rae says: “the scope and diversity of it …. I mean, there are very few jobs where you have as many different forces and countries and people at play.”

He’s looking forward to living in New York too, as is Arlene Perly Rae; the two celebrated their 40th anniversary earlier this year. “I’ve never lived there before,” he says. “New York City itself is an interesting place.”

But it does mean leaving the rather pleasant life that Rae created for himself after leaving politics — he thought for good. He laughs when asked whether he’d be doing a tone change of his social-media posts, which are often politically pointed; also funny. Rae says he’ll be diplomatic, but he won’t stop being himself.

One of his friends joked to him this week that he was voluntarily putting the “harness” of duty back on. “I know what that’s like: your schedule is no longer your own, you’ve got to turn up and you’ve got to be here, you’ve got to be there …. I’m reporting to people and people are reporting to me and you’re part of a bigger system,” Rae says.

He takes that on willingly, eagerly — it is now, in retrospect, where things were heading from the moment that Trudeau started doing all that thinking after the election and pulling Rae into that process. Saying no was not really an option.

“I know there are people who are going to say ‘you’re getting pretty long in the tooth,’” he says. “I actually think as long as I’ve got my health and I’ve got my marbles, I think it’s worth making the effort. This really is a significant global crisis and to not be engaged in it would be wrong.”

Read', 'Heather Scoffieldeconomics Columnist', 'Economics Columnist', 'Heather Scoffield Is The Star S Ottawa Bureau Chief', 'An Economics Columnist. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"The interview with Navdeep Bains kicked off with pandemic pleasantries about how the family was faring — inquiries about the children, their health and their anxiety levels.

As the innovation minister pointed out later in the discussion, it’s an entirely appropriate way to begin a conversation about the economic recovery.

He is leading a process working with industry leaders to reopen the economy and set the country very deliberately on a prosperous, competitive and low-carbon footing. And those aspirations would be incomplete without at least a hat-tip to the family finances that are under so much strain in the coronavirus economy.

“I think people want hope. People are still experiencing this crisis, dealing with this pandemic. People want hope. They want better outcomes for their kids. You and I started this conversation with our children. And ultimately, we see the world through the eyes of our kids.”

But the cold hard truth is: children may well be part of our long-term hopes for Canada to build back better, greener, with more diversity and inclusion and wealth, but they and their parents have been an afterthought in the near-term planning to rev up the economy.

Parents can’t really begin to participate in any kind of rebuilding of the economy or even simply return to work unless reliable, accessible and safe arrangements for their children — either in daycare or school — are nailed down, with the return-to-school date looming ever closer.

September is shaping up to be an ugly showdown for many families, and not just because of child care. Many of the supports that have kept them afloat through the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic will wind down at that point. Unless federal and provincial governments and employers figure out in the next few weeks how to get out ahead of the crunch, income supports, wage subsidies, and the loan deferrals that banks have granted household borrowers will fade away.

The programs were designed that way so that they wouldn’t become permanent and drive costs through the roof, and in the early belief that by September, this would all be over.

But it’s not over. It’s only over for some people and some industries who are going to have a hard time finding a full-fledged workforce let alone customers with disposable income or fresh, new orders unless solutions are found for expiring programs.

CERB, the $2,000-a-month benefit that goes to people who lost their jobs because of the pandemic shutdown, has already been extended once, until the end of August. But after that, people without jobs will need to return to the employment insurance system, with its many flaws and spotty coverage. This week’s fiscal update shows more than 8 million people have already relied on CERB at some point and took home $53 billion in just three months. By the time the program wraps up, Ottawa expects to have spent $73 billion. And while EI has been earmarked to rise an extra $10 billion this year compared to last year to a total of $30.8 billion in payouts over 12 months, those numbers imply a much smaller group drawing down on the payment than is currently using the CERB.

The government has pinned its reopening strategy on the wage subsidy, doubling the budget for the program in the hopes that employers will hire back their employees even if they’re not able to break even. But the wage subsidy, which sees Ottawa pay for 75 per cent of a company’s payroll if revenues have dropped by 30 per cent compared to last year, is scheduled to wind down near the end of August as well. Morneau is in talks to make the subsidy more flexible, but time is ticking.

The other key part of family finances is household debt, and that’s about to come to a head in September too. Commercial banks that had granted their stretch customers deferrals on their loans have mainly agreed to extend those deferrals until the end of September. But when those loans come due, with interest, the household debt issues of the past will come tumbling down on many borrowers. In a recent speech, Bank of Canada deputy governor Larry Schembri noted that 20 per cent of mortgage borrowers don’t have enough cash on hand to carry them through two months of payments. Commercial banks have allowed 700,000 borrowers to defer mortgage payments, Schembri said, and they’ve also granted deferrals and interest rate relief on credit cards, car loans and lines of credit.

“Going forward, some vulnerable households are likely to fall behind on their loan payments if incomes do not recover by the time payment deferrals end,” Schembri said, pointing in particular to the energy-dependent West, where the pandemic crisis has been exacerbated by low commodity prices.

That’s likely the polite central-bank way of saying “figure out a better way by September, folks, or risk widespread financial pain among those who can least afford it.”

There is no doubt that finances for many families are improving. Statistics Canada’s latest job numbers on Friday show that now just a quarter of the workforce is sidelined by the pandemic economy, rather than a third. That’s encouraging. Some of us are going back to work, but more men than women (especially mothers of young children). And accommodation, food services and the small companies that employ so many workers are still hamstrung.

But back to Bains and industry leaders and their strategizing to “build back better.”

Their group just held their third meeting to swap ideas, and Bains says they’re focusing on resilient economic growth that would position Canada to be a global force in the emerging digital economy and more aggressive on clean technology, using Canada’s strengths in artificial intelligence to boost all sectors.

They’re also talking about industries that are in deep trouble because of the crisis. This week, they addressed airlines in particular — a sign that the government has now moved to “Phase 2” of its pandemic response.

Phase 1 was the emergency shutdown which demanded a broad, agnostic bailout. Now, with the reopening, the government is looking at more specific help for deeply troubled areas, Bains says.

But: September looms — with its messy and ominous threat of faltering family finances and a workforce in disarray.

Growth can’t really resume in a predictable way unless people can be assured of child care and demand for their goods and services. And inclusive growth — the ultimate goal of the Liberal government — is impossible in those circumstances.

While business groups are glad to see politicians focus on competitiveness and growth, and keep an eye on the long term, they’re worried about the lack of a plan for the near future — a silence that grew louder after the release of the government’s fiscal update this week that had plenty of figures about what has already happened but little in terms of direction.

Policy-makers met the emergency head on with a mountain of money and they’re now brainstorming seriously about the long-term future — with heaps of ideas flooding into the public policy space from interest groups and experts alike.

But how do we coexist with the virus in the meantime, with its urgent requirements for extra space, extra caregivers, extra cleaning, extra attention to hygiene — all of which demand huge amounts of money and people and ambition, right away?

“We can’t just do this in a haphazard way,” says Trevin Stratton, chief economist at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Those mothers desperately reading the fine print on back-to-school memos as they trickle in with ever-changing arrangements would say, cheers to that.

While the hits just keep on coming about Trudeau’s connections to the WE charity, the controversy has touched off grumbling in Liberal circles about the lowercase “we” — as in, how exactly did we get into this mess, and who is “we” anyway in the decision-making circle around the prime minister?

Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, the Liberal MP for the Toronto riding of Beaches-East York, says he was on the phone immediately after the news emerged about WE being chosen to hand out nearly $1 billion in pandemic relief to students. He placed a call last week to the office of Diversity, Inclusion and Youth Minister Bardish Chagger — who’s now gone silent with the media — to get an explanation.

“I was struggling to understand why it was being done this way,” said Erskine-Smith, a rare MP willing to go on the record on Friday about his concerns with the entire WE affair.

He made the call before he knew all the details, which have been emerging daily, about how closely WE had been working with Trudeau’s family, including nearly $300,000 in speaking fees paid out to Trudeau’s mother and brother.

“Had I known what I know now, I would have said this was too close to the prime minister,” Erskine-Smith said.

Other MPs, preferring to talk off the record on Friday, said there has been a lot of chatter in the caucus over the past week about how this WE controversy has revived concerns about team culture — or lack of it — in Trudeau’s government.

“There aren’t a lot of relationships between the PM and caucus,” one MP said. Now, he said, with most of caucus relations taking place remotely during the pandemic, there are even fewer opportunities for MPs to have contact with the PM and the tight team around him.

It is either ironic or fitting that WE has made the Liberal “we” annoyed and nervous.

One MP said he was surprised to learn from news reports — first in the Star, as it happens — that WE had been given a contract to do work that would normally be done by the public service.

“This is a real head-scratcher for me and several of my colleagues,” the MP said. “I like to consider myself plugged in but the first time I heard of the WE contract was when I read the controversy in the papers. I know for a fact that I was not alone.”

What baffled many MPs was why the government needed to do any contracting out at all, especially after months of proving that it was nimble and adaptable enough to get COVID-19 aid directly to citizens.

This was Erskine-Smith’s main concern at first: the government has generous and effective programs in place already for students and summer jobs. MPs themselves, of all stripes, are often helpful in steering that help toward where it’s most needed in their ridings.

So, while Erskine-Smith didn’t put it this pointedly, not only was the WE decision made without input from MPs, the plan itself — which has now been reversed — also kept MPs out of the loop.

“It’s just so frustrating,” he said, citing all the good work the government has been doing to provide help to citizens in this crisis. “Now this is taking up so much of the conversation.” Erskine-Smith’s own mother asked him on Friday why this was going on, though he says his office is not being inundated with complaints, at least not yet.

The exquisitely bad timing of this controversy has Liberals frustrated too. Not only is it happening during a pandemic, but also still in the shadow of the humbling the government received during last year’s election.

From all accounts, Trudeau had been making genuine efforts after the election, also after last year’s SNC-Lavalin saga, to forge some greater connections with the Liberal team. Just this week, Trudeau handed a major ambassador’s appointment to former interim leader Bob Rae — a decision seen as a symbolic olive branch to Liberals who had been kept at arm’s length from the PMO.

But the WE controversy is viewed by some Liberals as being about how easy it is for Trudeau and his team to lapse back into old habits of keeping to themselves and giving access and benefits only to the small number of people they trust. Many MPs chose to speak off the record on Friday precisely because they were worried about reinforcing that outsider-insider culture.

None of the MPs or Liberals I reached were calling for Trudeau to resign, as his official opponents are. But there were suggestions that the PM had to surround himself with people who ask harder questions, who would have immediately spotted that WE would hurt the Liberal “we.”

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"We are living through a summer of madness. I cannot recall a time of greater rage, unhingement, outbursting, cruelty, silliness, and above all, humourlessness.

Truly, this pitchfork summer has been ruled by the narcissism of small differences. Never have I seen people so unwilling to let things go, especially when the confluence of horrors is so intense. We are all a lit match.

I find it calming to think of Greenland sharks, the longest-living creatures on Earth, some of them 500 years old, moving through deep Arctic waters while far away and above, hot little humans squabbled and slaughtered each other and Shakespeare wrote his plays. Take the long view. The Greenland shark certainly does.

The first prong in the pitchfork: we are enduring the hottest year in history. That’s a grand claim that morally condemns us as a species, yes, but what it really boils down to is this. In June, Calgary was hammered by hail the size of canned hams. This week, a sudden huge rainstorm killed power across much of Toronto, which killed air conditioning which kills sanity.

It only takes one more thing — could be stink bugs, could be a Harpers.org letter defending American free speech — and suddenly everyone’s hair is in flames. Opponents want free speech for themselves, not for those who signed the letter, and now everyone has third-degree burns.

I just watched “Jaws” — I sense a mordant fish theme here — which holds up remarkably well, and it strikes me that on social media, everyone thinks they’re Chief Brody and regards everyone else as the great white shark. But the shark is the only blameless creature on the boat, doing what sharks do.

Take the most recent Ottawa scandal failing to grip the nation. Reporters tell us with glee that aside from paid work by the PM’s brother and long-famous mother, the WE charity — the one no longer running a hasty cross-country student COVID jobs plan — had paid Sophie Grégoire Trudeau $1,400 for a speech in 2012.

My reaction was anguished. Why are Canadian scandals always so quaint? Why can’t we do big shameless American crimes? Crime better, Canada.

Second prong: we are in early- or mid-pandemic. Although people are carefully trying to edge back into work with its lovely “pay,” few jobs are worth the risk of painful death alone in a hospital room, spatchcocked by a tube. So we’re at home, which breeds paranoia. We love our co-workers, who are probably out to get us.

The third prong is destitution, and if not that, heart-clutching financial worry. Pinned to the wall this summer, good people have gone off their nut.

NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said that a white gunman’s failed invasion of Rideau Hall proved that the RCMP was racist, since a mentally ill Mississauga man of colour, Ejaz Choudry, and others, had been shot to death by police recently.

“This person showed up with weapons, publicly, at the residence of the prime minister of Canada and was arrested without being killed,” Singh said. So he’s saying a nonracist RCMP would have shot Corey Hurren out of a sense of fairness. Singh did not regard the gunman’s survival as a police success, which it is.

He then said Trump had done more to check police violence than had Trudeau. Sound of Canadians dropping their groceries.

If Singh has a point, and I don’t think he has, it’s in questionable taste. But public discourse is like that now, weird, self-centred, hurtful. The Conservatives wanted Parliament reopened and then had the worst attendance record of any party at COVID-19 committee meetings.

Conservative party house-sitter Andrew Scheer, seen maskless and smirking in Pearson airport, was talking to Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister, who later apologized for having briefly de-masked. (Another dollar-store scandal.) Scheer didn’t apologize, taking his cue from Donald Trump, who now says he wants to build a monument to statues.

The Liberals face no credible opposition in Parliament, not by design but by opposition panic and confusion. Right now the Conservative party emblem is the bright little face of Erin O’Toole, an ex-soldier who wants to send every Canadian to basic training.

He wants us shipshape and military-style, he’s talking gun rights and bouncing loonies off our beds. We don’t need this level of strange right now.

In a pitchfork summer, back to those Greenland sharks swimming quietly, their massive cartilaginous bodies bending in black water. I find it comforting that the shark has always been there, while humans were crabs, “pairs of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas,” temporary scavengers out of our collective minds in 2020.

Emulate the shark. Move slowly. Think before you attack. Let nothing faze you. Try not to take offence at small things, just as the shark doesn’t mind the long dangling parasites attached to its corneas.

We will all be judged on how we behaved in the summer of the pitchfork.

Reach Him Via Email', 'Walkomtom Gmail.Com']",2020-07-10,"Finance Minister Bill Morneau made one thing patently clear this week: As far as the federal Liberal government is concerned, deficits don’t matter.

They really don’t.

Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have long been cavalier about deficits. In the 2015 election campaign, they promised to spend in order to get the economy moving even if that meant briefly running a deficit.

In the 2019 campaign, they dropped the word briefly, arguing that they could run deficits indefinitely — as long as the federal government’s debt as a percentage of the national economy was falling.

This week, they effectively abandoned even that target. Thanks to the pandemic, the debt-to- gross-domestic-product ratio has risen sharply. But that, said Morneau in his fiscal snapshot Wednesday, isn’t reason to cut back spending or raise taxes.

In fact, he said, the government will spend $50 billion more. In the current fiscal year, the deficit is expected to balloon more than tenfold to $343 billion.

Don’t get me wrong. I think the Liberals are right to abandon what had been, in the days of Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, their fixation on deficits.

Since then, federal and provincial governments of all political stripes have used the deficit bogeyman as an excuse to slash social programs ranging from medicare to employment insurance.

Whenever a new social program, like pharmacare, is proposed, naysayers needed only raise the word deficit to scupper it.

So kudos to Morneau and Trudeau for acknowledging what many economists have long pointed out: countries like Canada can survive deficits quite handily. Government borrowing is not necessarily a recipe for disaster. In most cases, it involves Canadians borrowing from themselves.

Since April, for instance, the government has been borrowing at least $5 billion a week from the Bank of Canada. In effect, and properly so, the central bank is printing money to help fund the deficit.

Today’s monster deficit stems from COVID-19. Shutting down the entire economy in order to preserve public health carries a cost. Morneau’s fiscal snapshot predicts that Canada’s gross domestic product will shrink by a stunning 6.8 per cent this year.

The government’s response has been to devise a bevy of emergency programs designed to patch things up. Employers have been offered wage subsidies if they agree to keep workers on the job. Workers sideswiped by the virus have been offered benefits to tide them through temporarily.

Small businesses have been offered low-interest bank loans to stay afloat. Young people have been offered money for volunteering.

All of this is aimed at keeping the economy afloat until the pandemic has run its course. All of this assumes that the pandemic will run its course.

But what if it doesn’t? What happens if the world doesn’t return to a pre-pandemic normal?

Will people eat out as much? Or will they fear catching the virus? Will holidayers and business people be willing to travel as much as they did? Or will they try to avoid crowded planes and heavily frequented hotels?

Will we get through this first wave of the pandemic only to be sandbagged by a second? If so, do we just shut down again?

Most Canadians labour in the service industry. But it is workers in this industry, ranging from store clerks to nursing home workers to baristas, who have been hit hardest.

The service industry was whacked by the first wave. Will it survive a second?

All of these questions were neither asked nor answered in Morneau’s snapshot. They will have to be faced eventually.

But at least the finance minister made it crystal clear that he’s not bothered by deficits. That’s not much. But it’s something.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporter', 'Technology Reporter', 'Tony Wong Is The Star S Technology Reporter Covering Big Tech', 'Disinformation', 'Regulation. Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-10-15,"Nearly two-thirds of news publishers believe their relationships with big tech platforms, such as Facebook and Google, have become more fraught in recent years, according to a global report examining the co-existence between journalism and the digital giants.

In a survey of 90 companies, the International News Media Association (INMA) found that 72 per cent of publishers describe their general attitudes towards digital platforms as “much more negative” or “slightly more negative” than they were only three years ago.

And, as the report notes, there are now more than 100 major official inquiries or legal cases by law makers against the top four digital platforms: Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.

“There is a broad agreement among major authorities in different countries that these companies have grown too powerful and should be regulated,” says Robert Whitehead, author of the 94-page report, How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship.

“A global exercise has begun to co-ordinate investigations and share their research into the issues surrounding the platforms.”

The INMA-commissioned report is, according to the group’s executive director and CEO, “a first step” towards that goal.

“Publishers and platforms must work together to better bolster the journalism ecosystem. Yet we must first get on the same page across the breadth of issues. That’s what this report aspires to do,” Earl J. Wilkinson says in report’s foreword.

“We hear the daily developments, we hear the country-by-country and commission-by-commission stories, but nobody to date has wrapped their arms around the issues — both good and bad,” Wilkinson added in a statement to the Star.

The INMA initiative was overseen by a blue-ribbon committee consisting of Damian Eales of News Corp Australia, Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten/Schibsted, Maribel Perez Wadsworth of the USA Today Network/Gannett and John Boynton, Torstar president and CEO, and publisher of the Toronto Star.

Building on the survey, conducted last spring, the report is based on dozens of interviews and analyses of regulatory developments. The committee hopes it will provide a much-needed roadmap for publishers to navigate increasingly complex and integrated digital relationships.

“We are an industry of local companies that can’t act globally. But there is no geographical nuance in the issues we face,” says Boynton. “The issues we face in Canada are the issues that publishers face everywhere.”

For example, the World Association of News publishers condemned Google in September for announcing that it will not pay publishers in France for search results as a result of a copyright law that comes into force this fall. The law means large platforms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube must pay for content beyond short extracts of work.

Google says, instead, they will block any results from European newspapers in France unless those papers grant free use of their content.

“This stance is not only disrespectful of the French government, it is also against a law that will soon be applicable in the entire territory of the European Union,” said the publishers’ association in a statement.

Platforms aggregating, but not paying for content has also been a bone of contention for publishers globally. They have long been lobbying for more transparency in the algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what comes up high in a search.

At stake is the way countries around the world, including Canada access their information and culture. A lack of local news and investigative journalism means citizens are less informed about their world. And that has implications for democracy.

“There needs to be more oversight by government because market forces won’t be able to fix most of these issues,” says Torstar’s Boynton. “That includes algorithms that determine what people see, whether it’s Canadian or foreign content. It’s something that ultimately determines what people’s business models will be and which Canadian companies survive.”

Whitehead, the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, says the public first started to really become conscious of the impact of big tech during the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, where the British firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target in political advertising.

Since then, 2019 has been a watershed year for the number of investigations into big tech. The Canadian government’s own inquiry and report due this January looks into updating outdated laws to regulate platforms.

Significantly for the publishing industry, lawmakers are also understanding the importance of quality journalism to democracy and are leading inquiries into the impact of the big platforms on news media.

“News and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,” Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chair Rod Sims said in a report this year. “It is vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.”

The U.S. News Media Alliance estimated that Google alone made $4.7 billion in 2018 from publishers through its search engine. Google has denied that figure, but there is no doubt that the search engine, along with Facebook, takes the lion’s share of the digital advertising market.

“The regulation of the digital platforms is bigger than one country or even a region such as Europe can effectively handle,” says Whitehead. “With so many countries setting up their own antitrust investigations, the plans to co-ordinate the regulator responses across their research efforts and prosecutions will prove critical.”

INMA, which is not a lobby group, is trying to connect the dots not only for its 11,000 members at 700 news media companies in 70 countries, but also for the consumers of news.

“I think finally people are starting to take notice and regulators are now seeing how important the issues are when it comes to the platforms,” says Boynton. “The public should rightfully be shocked at what’s going on.”

Based on the INMA survey, potential solutions to improving the publisher-platform relationship centre on three approaches:

Direct action by platforms, such as prioritizing subscription content and introducing mechanisms to distinguish quality journalism;

Changes in law where regulators would create a level playing field on a host of issues including taxation and copyright;

And solutions involving collective bargaining where publishers could negotiate with big platforms on payment for content.

But more research and work needs to be done, according to the report, which describes itself as a potential playbook to help publishers turn their “wish lists into action.”

“Ideally, we hope that we can work things out and co-exist together and that it’s mutually beneficial,” says Boynton. “I’m hoping that someone realizes within the big platforms that in the long term the best play is to have a business relationship with publishers that is ultimately good for both sides.”

Over the next week, the Star will outline, in more detail, seven key issues identified in How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship as the most concerning to publishers.

We asked the four main political parties for their views,"['Tony Wong', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporterwed.', 'Oct.', 'Min. Read', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporter', 'Technology Reporter', 'Tony Wong Is The Star S Technology Reporter Covering Big Tech', 'Disinformation', 'Regulation. Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-10-02,"Social media has become the battlefield for politicians in the upcoming October federal election.

The Liberals are leading in Facebook ad spending, followed by the Conservatives as the two parties try to woo voters in the digital age. According to estimates from Facebook’s ad library, the Facebook pages of the Liberal Party of Canada and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent $454,179 in the last 30 days.

The Conservative party page and leader Andrew Scheer’s page racked up $285,031 in ad spending. The NDP spent $99,846.

Here’s the irony: The very platforms the main political parties hope to regulate are the ones they are dependent on in getting their message out.

The digital economy has created unprecedented wealth and promise, allowing consumers and voters access to a dazzling array of information, services and products.

The world’s most valuable technology companies — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG) — have been the innovators. But progress has not come without cost.

Governments have been slow to implement regulatory changes to bring their laws into the digital age. Issues such as policing fake news and content, avoiding taxes, remunerating artists and publishers, contributing to Canadian culture, creating an unlevel playing field for domestic players and legacy media, including broadcasters and the publishing industry, have been cause for concern. Some say Big Tech is too big and should be broken up. Others say what’s needed now is urgency by governments to implement regulations.

The European Union has been at the forefront, legislating sweeping changes aimed at online platforms in the areas of copyright and creating a more equitable market. Meanwhile, prosecutors for 50 American states have launched an antitrust investigation into Google, and Facebook was fined a record $5 billion earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.

The increased scrutiny has caused public attitudes to shift. A Ryerson Leadership Lab poll says a majority of Canadians want regulation of social media platforms. But critics say Canada has been slow to respond.

The Star asked the four main political parties — the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Green parties — for their thoughts on the need for legislative reform in the digital age.

One thing is for sure: After the October election, what the next government implements will affect future generations of taxpayers and chart the course for Canada in the 21st century.

1. The European Union has imposed stringent privacy and copyright laws on social networks and digital platforms. Do you think Canadians need to have more control over their personal data? If so, how would you propose to regulate this?

Liberals: Canadians’ trust in the digital world is shaken; they’re understandably anxious about how digital technologies and data will affect their lives. Our Digital Charter will ensure Canadians have the capacity and tools to know who is using their personal data and for what purposes, with clear penalties when rules are not respected, and that they are ultimately the ones to benefit from it. Social media platforms are already subject to Canada’s commercial privacy law, PIPEDA, which we took steps to strengthen in the fall to ensure Canadians are made aware if their data has been placed at risk. We know more needs to be done, and that’s why we unveiled the Charter, which was characterized by renowned privacy expert Michael Geist as “a sea change in Canadian privacy law.”

Conservatives: Ensuring that the personal data of Canadians is protected is a priority of Canada’s Conservatives. Unfortunately, the Trudeau Liberal government has been particularly careless on this front. It’s past-time the federal government did something to protect Canadians’ information online.

A Conservative government would take a three-pronged approach to this issue: sensible regulation, standards and education to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions, and strong oversight at the highest levels of government.

We will ensure that plain language-use agreements are put in place so that companies collecting electronic data must receive informed consent from Canadians.

We will apply regulatory standards for the ethical and secure use of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things and create the Canada Cyber Safe brand to ensure that consumers know when products have met rigorous security standards.

An expert committee with industry leaders will define binding cyber security standards for critical infrastructure sectors and penalties for non-compliance.

Additionally, Canada’s Conservatives will also establish a Cabinet Committee on Cyber Security and Data Privacy and conduct periodic cyber security penetration testing on all government departments and establish performance benchmarks for senior public servants

NDP: Recently, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found Facebook had failed to take basic precautions or have adequate policies in place to protect users’ information. More surprisingly, Facebook has refused to implement the Commissioners’ recommendations, and the Commissioners warn that there is still a high risk that Canadians’ personal information can be used and shared without their knowledge or consent. Facebook has been under the spotlight for over a year now for their privacy and business practices, from the Cambridge Analytica breach to the UN accusing the platform of having played a determining role in inciting a genocide in Myanmar. That they are refusing to actually improve their privacy policies at the direction of our regulators shows more cavalier disregard for not just Canadian laws, but for their own users’ privacy rights. This Liberal government’s cosy relationship with the American tech giants and their lobbyists means that they always put Canadians’ privacy rights second. We need a government that will be willing to implement the all-party recommendations of the Ethics Committee and stand up to the web giants and their disregard for Canadian law. It’s wrong that the Liberals and Conservatives always prefer to let private companies self-regulate instead of requiring them to do the right thing by putting the safety and privacy of Canadians before profits. New Democrats will prioritize the safety and privacy of Canadians.

Green Party: The Green Party believes that all Canadians have an inherent right to privacy, including online. Successive Canadian governments have failed to adequately modernize privacy protection digitally. We support the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Greens plan to modernize the existing Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act to the GPDR Standards. We do not believe that political parties should be exempt from these laws, and will apply the same standards to parties’ collection and use of Canadians’ data. We will regulate all tech companies, including tech Giants like Facebook and Google. We will make the penalties severe enough to get all companies’ attention, and convince them to follow the law.

Maximum fines per violation would be set at a percentage of a company’s global turnover.

We will: Ensure companies that are not located in Canada, but are operating here, pay the same taxes as Canadian companies and have social media companies ensure that racist and other discriminatory pages are not allowed to be posted, consistent with Canadian laws.

Also, all companies that have experienced a breech of their data must notify the Canadian government and the individual Canadians who have been affected. In addition, companies that sell programs or games, must allow the buyer to own a copy of the program or game, in the event the company goes out of business.

We will apply Canadian laws to all digital companies, including those companies based in other countries. We will force them to change their practices, to allow individuals to confirm what data they are willing to allow a company to collect. Canadian citizens must be able to access and download all the information any company has on them, and if they want their information deleted, they can ask the company to delete all their personal data, and the company must comply. It is essentially the right to be forgotten.

2. Quebec and Saskatchewan have required online foreign companies to collect provincial sales taxes since the start of the year. This has not happened at the federal level. So far Facebook has said it will start to collect the tax. Google and Netflix have said they will collect the tax when required by law to do so. An Auditor General report said in 2017 Ottawa could have collected $169 million in GST alone.

Would you require digital companies who have no substantial physical presence in Canada to collect the GST and PST on sales of subscriptions to Canadians?

Liberals: We are committed to ensuring that Canada’s tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem — it is a global issue. That’s why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure “multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,” according to a statement released by the party.)

Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren’t subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.

Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.

We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.

NDP: The NDP is proposing a level playing field for all, where large foreign multinationals must pay their fair share. New Democrats will stand up to web giants and make sure they play by the same rules as Canadian companies. By taking this bold action, the government would recoup billions of dollars that could be used to make life more affordable for all Canadians, protect our content and culture, save local media, and create good quality jobs for the future.

Greens: We will tax online companies federally, not just on subscriptions.

3. In the European Union, some countries have required on-demand video services contribute investment into local content. Legacy Canadian broadcasters are required to put 5 per cent of their gross revenue into the Canadian Media Fund to produce Canadian content. (The CMF is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the Canadian television and digital media industries to produce original content.) Should foreign online platforms such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube be required to put a percentage of their revenue into content?

Liberals: For 10 years, all the Conservatives did for culture was to cut. They ignored the struggles the industry was going through. The result is that our laws and tools predate the internet. We have committed to modernizing them to protect our culture on the web and that’s what we’re doing. We created an independent experts panel to help us bring the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Acts into the 21st century. Our end goal is clear: all players that participate in the system must contribute to the system. There will be no free rides.

Conservatives: While we do not believe Canadians should pay more to watch Netflix, we know that services on the internet represent a growing part of the Canadian and global economy and foreign-owned technology companies aren’t subject to the same regulations as Canadian companies.

Conservatives believe in a level playing field and that public policy should keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.

We will have more to say on this as the campaign unfolds.

NDP: The Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed to assume his responsibility in establishing a framework regarding the rise of on-demand video services. Rather than fixing this injustice, Justin Trudeau and his team went even further by signing a secret deal with Netflix without any consultation and without any guarantee of creating French content. The NDP think that Netflix and others should play by the same rules as other broadcasters and companies that operate in Canada.

Greens: In consideration.

4. Cable service providers have had shrinking revenue in the digital age as competition from online platforms means fewer subscribers. Those providers place a percentage of their revenue into producing Canadian content, and the pot is shrinking. Would you support a move to have internet service providers, who have benefitted from the increased use of streaming services, also make similar financial contributions?

Liberals: (Same as answer 2)

Conservatives: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems.

NDP: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund.

Greens: In consideration.

5. Under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act, domestic marketers who place advertisements in Canadian publications qualify for a tax deduction. But if they placed that ad in a foreign print publication, they wouldn’t qualify. But the new digital reality means that if you advertise in the print edition of The New York Times, you wouldn’t get a tax deduction, but if you did so in the online edition, you would. This has created an unlevel playing field for legacy publishers, diverting millions to major platforms like Google and Facebook. Would your party close that loophole?

Liberals: Canada is working with international partners and the OECD to examine the impacts of digitalization on some key aspects of the existing tax framework and to work toward a consensus-based approach.

Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not. Justin Trudeau has failed to create good policies. Conservatives will have more to say about our plan for a free, fair and sustainable press as the campaign continues.

NDP: Yes. There are many things that the federal government could and should do now to help solve this media crisis and closing the loophole at Section 19 of the Income Tax Act is clearly one of them. Section 19 was introduced in 1965 to encourage advertising spending in Canadian media — but instead it is now being used to support American multinationals like Facebook and Google that don’t need it. Section 19 needs to be updated or reinterpreted to take into account online advertising. That idea was one of many recommendations made to the federal government in two different reports on the future of media, released in December 2016 and in June 2017. Many months of consultation went into those reports, and thousands of people were consulted, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Pablo Rodriguez, and the Minister of Finance, Bill Morneau, have chosen to ignore the vast majority of those recommendations. This can’t continue. The Liberals must act now to protect our medias, our democracy and our communities.

Greens: Yes.

6. Would you continue to provide ongoing and stable funding to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, maintaining or increasing current levels?

Liberals: After 10 years of cuts and partisan games under the Conservatives, we are proud to have reinvested $675M to better support our public broadcaster, in our first budget. We also put in place the first ever independent appointments process for CBC, and appointed accomplished individuals like Michael Goldbloom, Suzanne Guèvremont, and Sandra Singh, rather than Conservative cronies. We firmly believe in the importance of CBC/Radio-Canada and of local news in all communities across the country. Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives have openly said that they don’t like journalists and could axe the CBC News division because they don’t like the media calling them out for their inconsistencies.

Conservatives: When we look and see how much coverage is devoted on CBC to U.S. politics, the inner workings of U.S. politics, making sure that it’s focused on the things that are going on here in Canada — Canada’s Conservatives think that’s something that many Canadians have said we should ensure that it’s focused on the core mandate of being concentrated on Canada.

NDP: The CBC is an essential public service in a country like ours, where minority-language communities require regional news coverage in their own language. The NDP has a proud history of promoting our public broadcaster. In the last Parliament our MPs fought hard against the Conservatives’ $115 million cut to CBC/Radio-Canada. We will release our vision for CBC in the near future!

Greens: We would continue, and expand funding for Canadian culture and the CBC.

7. If the CBC were to discontinue advertising, would your party support an advertising free environment, supported by taxpayers?

Liberals: The CBC is an autonomous Crown corporation responsible for managing its own operations.

Conservatives: We have to make sure the CBC’s impact in that is not creating an undue hurdle against those private-sector entities that are trying to stay afloat and now have to compete with a government-subsidized entity that is also going out into the market to sell ads to get viewership

NDP: An advertisement free CBC is a fantastic idea in principle, but it does require further study. The main impediment is the revenue shortfall that would transpire. Current estimate reveals that this idea would cost $533 million annually.

Greens: Yes, we would.

8. Do you support federal aid for newspapers. If so, what measures would you propose?

Liberals: Canadian newspapers are taking a big hit by the media crisis. They have lost half of their jobs since 2010. We are going to the root of the problem and are creating concrete measures to support Canadian newspapers, big or small. Recently, our government announced the plan to introduce three new tax measures to support Canadian journalism estimated to provide approximately $595 million in support over five years. We must protect journalistic independence and that’s why an independent experts panel will assist in implementing our investments. Journalism is at the core of our democracy, but Conservatives aren’t one to miss an opportunity to attack its independence. The only type of media they’re interested in are ones they control, like the Rebel, 24Seven, and Ontario News Now. They are into conspiracy theories and it’s insulting to the intelligence of Canadians and the professionalism of journalists.

Conservatives: A healthy democracy relies on an independent press, free of political influence. It should never be up to any government to determine which media outlets receive government support and which media outlets do not.

NDP: In the wake of fake news, a strong, healthy and independent media industry is essential to our democracy. Our local newspapers have been put in a difficult financial position because of Liberal and Conservative governments refusal to equal the playing field and take away the tax holiday given to Facebook, Google and other internet giants. Our Quebec MPs like Pierre Nantel are the only ones who have been demanding action from the government for months. We believe any support package for the news media needs to be efficient, transparent and fair. The NDP will always fight to save our local medias while Liberals and Conservatives are playing partisan political games. You can expect further details in the near future.

Greens: In consideration.

Read', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporter', 'Technology Reporter', 'Tony Wong Is The Star S Technology Reporter Covering Big Tech', 'Disinformation', 'Regulation. Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-09-06,"We’re living in a FAANG world. And, no, it’s not a vampire movie, although the metaphor of a behemoth that thrives on our data as its lifeblood might be apt.

Whether you shop for shoes on Amazon, call your mom on your iPhone, click on Facebook for your news or on Netflix and chill on the weekends, FAANG impacts just about every aspect of your life.

It’s an acronym for some of the world’s biggest technology companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. Add in Microsoft and you pretty much have the wealth of some nations in companies that have become superpowers unto themselves.

Combined, the six have annual revenues of approximately $865 billion (U.S.), greater than the GDP of Saudi Arabia, the 18th largest economy in the world based on 2018 figures. (Canada, with a GDP of $1.7 trillion is the 10th largest world economy.) Data has become the new oil.

“How dominant they’ve become has been amazing,” says professor Tyler Chamberlain of the University of Ottawa’s Telfer School of Management. “These are truly global companies. The major businesses of the past had international operations. But the scale of the digital companies is unprecedented. They have dominated like no other companies before.”

Canada has certainly been a beneficiary of the tech boom. This year, Toronto was ranked as one of the top North American cities for tech talent by commercial real estate consultants CBRE. Toronto’s talent pool grew at the fastest pace of 50 markets measured, with 80,100 jobs created in the past five years, making the city the third best market in North America.

Only Silicon Valley (the San Francisco Bay area) and Seattle were ranked higher for their overall talent pools.

While the companies have undoubtedly created great wealth and prosperity for shareholders, the dominance of the big six has also created problems.

“They have, to some, become the robber barons of the modern era,” says Chamberlain.

Governments worldwide, including Canada, are grappling with how to regulate the foreign enterprises that are disrupting domestic economies on a massive scale.

That includes issues such as corporate taxation, privacy, fake news, antitrust and even cultural concerns such as contributing to Canadian content.

The Canadian government is looking at ways to regulate and tax the digital entities with a federal review panel that will make recommendations in January. What makes regulation more difficult is that the companies are notoriously secretive, guarding their information and data, while monetizing the data of consumers.

Basic information such as the number of employees or Canadian revenue is not always publicly revealed, making it difficult to gauge the exact footprint of Big Tech on the Canadian economy.

Netflix, for example, doesn’t reveal how many viewers are watching their shows. A Netflix Canada spokesperson told the Star “no comment” when asked repeatedly about the most basic information such as how many employees or offices they had in Canada. With an estimated 6.3 million subscribers in Canada alone, according to U.K.-based third-party analysts Comparitech Ltd., the country is the company’s fifth-largest market.

Facebook, meanwhile, told The Logic, a news outlet that reports on the innovation economy, that, globally, the company had 30,000 workers in safety and security by the end of 2018. But the company would not reveal a breakdown of the number of employees working in safety and security in Canada.

“It’s a major issue how we deal with these tech giants at this point because it will impact us in a significant way down the line,” says BMO Financial Group chief economist Doug Porter. “It bears extremely close watching to see what happens because, at the end of the day, it will affect Canadian government revenues fundamentally.”

But citizens are demanding change. In August, a coalition of Canadian arts organizations representing producers, writers, publishers, directors, actors and artists launched a pressure campaign demanding that political parties update digital laws to protect Canadian culture. The #SaveOurCulture campaign is aimed at politicians running in the October federal election.

“Digital has not only transformed the ways in which cultural content is accessed, it has also disrupted the cultural economy without adapting the rules of the game,” said spokesperson Bill Skolnik, co-chair of the campaign and executive director of the Directors Guild of Canada.

Canada’s Competition Bureau told the Star it is “monitoring” tech giants for anti-competitive behaviour in the wake of a sweeping U.S. Justice Department investigation as well as an inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Regulators are looking at whether the digital companies are abusing their power by stifling innovation and competition. As a result, Canada’s Competition Bureau launched a wide-ranging inquiry this month on how the digital economy may be harming Canadian business, asking anyone with information to come forward.

“Since certain digital markets tend towards a “winner takes all” outcome, firms in these markets have a strong incentive to adopt strategies that increase the likelihood the market tips in their favour,” says the bureau in a paper.

On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced her office was organizing a multi-state antitrust probe into Facebook, while another group of states was preparing to launch a separate antitrust probe targeting Google.

The stakes are certainly high: Facebook was recently fined a record $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, and the European Commission just opened an antitrust investigation into Amazon.

Facebook has been on the firing line because of its impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election and issues of foreign interference. With the federal election next month, Canada is also on alert.

“They all have their own sets of problems and issues. But Facebook, especially, because of their prominence on social media and impact on culture and communication,” says the University of Ottawa’s Chamberlain. “It really puts them in the spotlight where they get a lot of attention, making it more difficult and complex.”

Netflix, meanwhile, competes with Canadian broadcasters such as CTV, Global and Citytv, but does not have an obligation to contribute funds to produce Canadian shows.

And tax rules that were made during the heyday of print journalism puts legacy publishers at a disadvantage compared to platforms such as Google and Facebook. They have grown so large they now command almost three-quarters of all digital advertising dollars.

The digital economy has also put a squeeze on artists, including writers, musicians and actors struggling to attain the kind of middle-class living status that, while never assured, seems more difficult to attain now than in the past.

Interestingly, a government bureaucrat didn’t coin the term FAANG, but it was popularized by CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer, who used it to describe high-performing technology stocks. The original FANG consisted of only four high-performing stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (owned by parent company, Alphabet). Since then, it’s been expanded in various versions, but the old guard of Apple and Microsoft — because of their market dominance and importance — are worth adding to the list.

The dominance of big tech companies has some critics calling for them to be broken up into smaller companies. That’s not a new reaction, says Chamberlain.

“If you go back in history when you have these dominant firms, there is always pushback, a desire to split them up and tear them down. But the reality is market forces say they certainly won’t be there forever.”

While Facebook is being scrutinized now, Chamberlain says it wasn’t that long ago that Microsoft, for example, was demonized as the thousand-pound gorilla that threatened to stifle development of other companies.

In 2008, the company was fined the equivalent of $1.35 billion (U.S.) by the European Union over antitrust violations.

Since then, Microsoft has transformed itself from essentially a device-based company to a mobile and cloud company, as the negative attention has focused on the other tech leaders.

“Someone’s head is always on the chopping block, but that changes. What everyone is afraid of today will invariably change tomorrow,” says Chamberlain. “That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t regulate and have rules. But it’s good to have perspective.”

BMO economist Porter says a chart of the biggest firms in earlier decades would look far different than the FAANG-dominated chart of today. Traditionally, automobile, real estate, oil and bricks and mortar retailing were the bread and butter stocks.

“We unquestionably have a very different picture at the top this time around,” says Porter. “But for Canada, success in technology goes beyond the FAANG companies.”

Porter says there is a wave of smaller homegrown companies that are doing exceptionally well in areas such as artificial intelligence, but are under the radar that could one day be part of the next FAANG.

“It’s maybe something that is not as celebrated as it should be. But we are seeing solid employment gains in the technology sector and the birth of a lot of very interesting companies and that bodes well for Canada and for the future. That is the bulwark against the dominance of FAANG.”

Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-08-19,"Australia is taking on the digital behemoths of Facebook and Google, while the rest of the world watches closely. But will Canada follow?

After an 18-month landmark study, the final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on regulating big platforms and to encourage media competition was released in July. It didn’t get a lot of attention outside the country initially, but it is a watershed moment for consumers in the digital era as global regulators are examining whether it provides a blueprint for the future.

It is one of the first instances where an independent regulator is looking at antitrust and competition law through the lens of consumer protection regarding digital platforms and the publishing industry. Google and Facebook are responsible for more than 70 per cent of all digital advertising, with traditional publishers and others struggling for the remaining piece of the market. That has left a hole in local news, not just in Australia, but in other countries including Canada.

“This is the first time we’ve seen really a credible, independent, nonindustry panel really examine the media implications and what it will cost the economy,” says John Hinds, CEO of News Media Canada, which represents Canadian newspapers. “This isn’t something that can be regarded as a partisan report by the industry or something that is politicized. It’s looking at how the big platforms are affecting consumers and the economy through a very practical lens.”

The sweeping 632-page report comes with 23 recommendations, including methods to ensure there is enough competition in the market, to determine if there is sufficient transparency in the prices charged for advertising, and to require platforms to develop a code of conduct to make sure news businesses are treated fairly. News businesses would also be given notifications about any changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings on websites.

Other recommendations include taxpayer funding for local news, and allowing donations for non-profit organizations engaging in public interest journalism to be tax deductible. The digital platforms have three months to respond to the report. The Australian government has said it will have a response to the report by the end of the year.

A spokesperson for the Canadian Competition Bureau said the bureau was aware of the Australian initiative to investigate digital platforms, but would not confirm whether they were considering a similar study.

“As you know, the Bureau closely follows the developments of investigations by our international counterparts while remaining mindful of the different legal regimes in each jurisdiction,” said spokesperson Jayme Albert in a statement to the Star. “The Bureau continues to closely monitor firms in the digital economy to ensure they do not engage in anti-competitive conduct.”

Local news has become an endangered species, with many smaller newspapers disappearing in the face of digital disruption. The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said “the greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news” at an International News Media Association (INMA) conference. Baquet predicted that “most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a billionaire.”

INMA, whose board of directors includes Torstar publisher John Boynton, considers and shares global strategies for media growth.

A study released in June by the organization finds that Google alone made $4.7 billion US in 2018 from publishers through advertising linked to its search engine.

Google has denied that figure, but there’s no doubt that the search engine along with Facebook takes the lion’s share of the digital advertising market.

Big tech has been under major regulatory scrutiny this year, not just for the impact on legacy media, but on privacy and antitrust issues.

Facebook was recently fined $5 billion US by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy breaches in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into the platforms, and the European Commission in July said they were launching an antitrust investigation into the activities of Amazon. And lawmakers in the U.S. have introduced bipartisan legislation (the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act) looking at how the newspaper industry can reach an agreement with the platforms for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window to come up with a deal.

But while the European Union and the U.S. have launched aggressive investigations into the big digital platforms, other countries, including Canada, have taken more of a wait-and-see approach. Part of the reasoning may have been that the bigger jurisdictions have greater resources to deal with the world’s biggest companies.

Not so for Australia. The country of 25 million, compared to Canada’s 37 million, is not only less populated, but has a smaller economy (13th largest in the world by GDP, compared to Canada’s 10th position). But they have decided to tackle the issue head on.

“Australia, like Canada, are commodity-based economies with large land masses that are facing similar issues in regard to disruption,” says Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Professor of Technology Management and Strategy at the University of Toronto and an antitrust expert. “Canada though has historically been more passive and sometimes waiting for other people to take the lead. This could either be a lack of self confidence, or maybe it’s the smart thing to do. Let them experiment first and see what works.”

Albert said the Canadian Competition Bureau was “unable to confirm” whether it was investigating “any specific matters with regard to the publishing industry, as the Bureau is required by law to conduct work confidentially.”

News Media Canada’s Hinds says he has been in touch with the bureau to try and arrange a meeting to determine next steps.

“A lot of the discussion around media is about democracy and privacy. But the competition bureau can look at the issue through the lens of a tangible economic perspective and that’s certainly what we want,” Hinds says. “What the Australian example is telling us is that while everyone is looking for a silver bullet, this is an incredibly complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach.”

What the Australian Competition Bureau didn’t do, however, was recommend the breakup of the large platforms, although it did recommended changes that would force companies to inform regulators about the impact mergers would have on competition.

“You don’t necessarily want to discourage them from innovating or growing bigger, but what you want to do is to stop them from behaving badly so it stops other people from growing and innovating,” U of T’s Tombak says. “But the important thing is that the Australians are taking this very seriously.”

One way to regulate transnational companies with global reach might be the formation of an international competition authority, similar to the World Trade Organization, Tombak says.

“It’s been talked about before. But maybe now is the time, given the rise of these major digital platforms, that you need a competition regulator with more clout.”

In July, competition authorities of the G7 countries and the European Commission released a common understanding agreement highlighting challenges faced by regulators in the digital economy. It’s not quite the formation of a transnational competition bureau, but it’s a recognition that more needs to be done.

“Given the borderless nature of the digital economy, competition authorities must emphasize co-operation with their international counterparts,” said the memorandum.

“The common understanding demonstrates our shared agreement of the importance of competition authorities keeping pace with the digital world,” said Canadian Commissioner of Competition Matthew Boswell in a statement.

Read', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporter', 'Technology Reporter', 'Tony Wong Is The Star S Technology Reporter Covering Big Tech', 'Disinformation', 'Regulation. Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-07-24,"The Canadian Competition Bureau says it is closely monitoring big technology firms “to ensure they do not engage in anti-competitive conduct,” as regulators around the globe crack down on the world’s leading digital companies.

“Should evidence come to light of anti-competitive conduct that may affect the Canadian marketplace, the bureau won’t hesitate to take appropriate action,” agency spokesperson Jayme Albert said in a statement to the Star.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice said it was launching a sweeping antitrust review of internet giants and whether they had abused their power to stifle competition. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is already undertaking a similar investigation.

The competition bureau was responding to questions by the Star as to whether a similar action will be undertaken by the federal agency responsible for monitoring and regulating competition in Canada. Recent steps, including the hiring this month of its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer, indicate that the agency is bulking up to take on the big technology companies.

And experts say it is only a matter of time before Canada joins the United States and the European Union in antitrust investigations.

“This is a big deal and we should be paying attention because this will impact Canada,” said professor Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Chair in Technology Management at the University of Toronto and an expert in antitrust issues. “I think it’s inevitable that the Canadian authorities here will be looking at how they should be taking a more aggressive stance.”

In Canada, it will be up to the competition bureau to determine whether an investigation is warranted. And one former commissioner says she thinks the agency will eventually have to follow the lead of European and U.S. counterparts.

“I think regulators are very interested in the issue and that the competition bureau will eventually do something, the question is what?” said Melanie Aitken, co-head of the Antitrust Group at law firm Bennett Jones and the former Canadian Commissioner of Competition in an interview. “These are really tough decisions facing the competition commissioner.”

The scope of the conversation around these issues in the U.S. and elsewhere is broad, but Aitken says defining the issues will be paramount.

“Some think it’s a privacy issue, others may think it’s a data protection or competition problem. And certainly a privacy issue can relate to a competition issue. A lot of people are trying to get their arms around what can be legitimately addressed. And what mechanisms or tools to use to do so.”

The U.S. did not mention which tech companies would be under investigation. But this month, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for mishandling user information. In Europe, Amazon is already under an antitrust investigation by the EU’s Competition Commission announced last week. And critics of big tech have been more vocal than ever, calling for the break up of some companies.

“The EU has been more aggressive on investigating these companies, but the U.S. is following suit,” says U of T’s Tombak. “What often happens in competition cases is that companies get prosecuted in other jurisdictions and Canadians take a similar path.”

The big question, says Tombak, is if the big firms are “stepping over the line” and choking off small firms that contribute to innovation.

“It’s not illegal to be in a dominant position. You may be dominant because you’re really good. But if you’re abusing that position, that’s a problem.”

The competition bureau’s Albert said the bureau could not confirm whether an official investigation into technology firms was underway.

“The bureau is required by law to conduct its work confidentially,” said Albert.

However, he pointed out that the bureau is working closely with the federal innovation department and policy-makers to “take a look under the hood” of digital competition policy and recently hosted a forum looking at that subject in May.

In July, the bureau hired former IBM executive George McDonald as its first Chief Digital Enforcement Officer. McDonald will “boost our digital intelligence gathering skills,” said Albert.

Given the more limited Canadian resources to investigate tech giants, lawyer Aitken, who was also on the steering committee of the International Competition Network, says the bureau may do more “surgical strikes” addressing narrower issues at the most egregious offenders.

“I think the bureau will more likely be looking at discreet behaviours or acquisitions rather than embarking on a massive investigation, which is possible in the United States, which is more resource capable,” said Aitken.

Tech giants have traditionally been given a hands-off approach by antitrust regulators focused on pricing at least in respect to acquisitions of competitors. In the usual scenario, if one company gobbles up a competitor in the market, competition is reduced and pricing may go up. But products offered by companies such as Facebook and Google are seemingly free. However, that thinking has shifted.

“A typical analysis of mergers and antitrust is whether prices go up,” said Aitken. “But often with these powerful platforms you’re not really going to find price effects … So how to determine the material effect on competition so as to block a merger will be a real challenge for the competition authorities.”

U of T’s Tombak says one wider issue to be considered is whether antitrust legislation will impact innovation overall.

“Do big firms contribute disproportionately to innovation? The jury is still out.”

Tombak says Canadian regulators have traditionally been more moderate than their U.S. or European counterparts with antitrust legislation.

“Our corporate culture is to nudge them to do the right thing rather than haul them to court,” says Tombak. “Here in Canada we like to talk and work things out.”

In some cases that hasn’t worked too well. The Canadian Privacy Commissioner announced this year it is taking Facebook to court over privacy violations and “refusing to implement recommendations to address deficiencies.”

Former competition bureau commissioner Aitken says, in her experience, which includes high-profile litigation against the Toronto Real Estate Board over opening up the Multiple Listing Service, and challenging Visa and Mastercard over card acceptance rules, getting compliance from companies through enforcement remains one of the most important tools for Canadian regulators.

“Advocacy is important. But it alone doesn’t get you far. You need to have the resources and the right tools to back them up. That’s a powerful way to correct behaviour.”

Read', 'Tony Wongtechnology Reporter', 'Technology Reporter', 'Tony Wong Is The Star S Technology Reporter Covering Big Tech', 'Disinformation', 'Regulation. Follow Him On Twitter']",2019-07-22,"Technology giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have become new “world superpowers” that governments including Canada have to rein in and regulate, while at the same time ensuring economic progress isn’t derailed, says a prominent analyst.

“The 20th century tools we have for protecting a free society won’t work for 21st century giants,” says technology guru Brian Hopkins, vice-president and principal analyst of U.S.-based consulting firm and think tank Forrester Research, in an interview with the Star on how Canadians can thrive in the digital economy. “At the end of the day, each country including Canada has to set up safeguards. That’s the grand experiment that we are living with. The thing is, we don’t know what the right balance of regulation versus economic enablement is.”

Hopkins, whose clients have included the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve, says the scale and speed of the big tech companies, which constitute FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) plus Microsoft, are going beyond what regulators can keep up with.

“Regulators move too slowly, and the tech giants are one or two steps ahead,” says Hopkins. “The answer is you have to learn how to be flexible. That’s difficult to do and some of these decisions will be hard to make.”

Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau was in Chantilly, France last week meeting with his G7 counterparts to talk about how to tax and regulate big technology companies.

A Canadian federal legislative review panel struck under the Heritage and Innovation departments is also working on that very question. And what they determine will have an impact on whether future generations of Canadians sink or swim in the digital economy.

There have been particular concerns with Facebook from government regulators. MPs earlier this year voted unanimously to issue a standing summons for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg after they refused to testify before an Ottawa committee on digital regulation. The privacy commissioner is also suing the company over data-related breaches. And in the U.S., the company was fined a record $5 billion this month over privacy violations.

There is also concern over foreign influence in the upcoming federal election using social media. Facebook has said it will regulate itself and take down any accounts that try to interfere.

“So much of public opinion is now shaped, not by curated trusted news sources, but the stuff that gets posted on Facebook, and that’s powerful when you have 2.7 billion users of their apps,” says Hopkins. “Facebook has more of a reach on what we think and the implications are huge.”

Another issue is that much of the “news,” or what comes onto newsfeeds on social media platforms, is developed by artificial intelligence.

“Do you want what you know about the world to be based on what an algorithm thinks you should see?” Algorithms are developed by humans who have inherent biases, says Hopkins.

Still, he insists the tech giants are “not evil. They are simply forcing us to rethink what the digital ethics of the 21st century should be.”

One big discussion currently is whether Toronto should give the go-ahead to an ambitious plan by Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, to build a new smart city on the Toronto waterfront. The company has committed $1.3 billion to the project, but critics say the collection of data and how it will be used is concerning.

“I think it’s easy for us to villainize these companies, but ultimately I believe they are good for us,” says Hopkins. “Money is certainly at stake, but most of these companies have a socially progressive west coast ethic, and at some level aren’t purely corporate profiteers. But they are certainly pushing the bounds of digital ethics and the notions of what is public and what is private. And that’s what we have to figure out: How do we let them innovate but without surrendering the rights we hold dear?”

Canada and other western democracies are being leapfrogged by former developing countries as the new technologies are being implemented, says Hopkins.

Part of the issue, he argues, is political and cultural. That’s where the debate over regulation gets murkier. And that has implications for projects such as Sidewalk Labs in Toronto.

“China is doing surveillance in a way that is not acceptable to western democracies. Are we disadvantaged because of that, and will it hold back economic development? There are sets of values that we hold dear while other countries are accelerating and growing economically because they violate our norms. We have to decide how to maintain that balance.”

Hopkins says, in reality, Canada has no choice but to let tech giants self-regulate since government doesn’t have the tools to “work at their scale and speed.”

“You have to essentially put in checks and balances that ensure that Facebook is regulating itself properly. The stick is that as a country you can cut Facebook off if they don’t abide by those rules,” says Hopkins. “But to actually do the policing and regulation for them would be very tough.”

Facebook meanwhile, announced recently that it is looking at launching its own cryptocurrency called Libra, which Hopkins says is both “brilliant” and dangerous at the same time.

“It’s a brilliant move because they already have such a big reach but now they would be in charge of a system that will turn them into a bank with responsibility for potentially billions of dollars worth of payments. Look at the requirements and scrutiny that banks have to go through. We would have to rethink the rules once again.”

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-13,"As Ontario prepares to further reopen the economy, the province is reporting 116 new cases of COVID-19.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all.

“Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered stage two, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about stage three of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,” Elliott said on Twitter.

There are 104 patients in Ontario hospitals with coronavirus, 28 of whom are in intensive care units. Of those, 20 are on ventilators.

That encouraging data is why Premier Doug Ford unveiled the next steps of opening up the economy with much of the province to reopen Friday, though the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area will have to wait until at least late next week.

Ontario has been in a state of emergency since March 17, meaning the government has had sweeping authority to close businesses and restrict the opening of public spaces.

Most of the province will enter the third stage later this week, meaning restaurants and bars can serve meals indoors and gyms can reopen as long as safe physical distancing is maintained.

The provincial government says 2,710 people have died from the virus since the pandemic struck in March, but the Star has determined there have been 2,759 COVID-19 deaths in Ontario.

That difference of 49 fatalities is because early in the outbreak, some were not included since COVID-19 tests had not been conducted before the people — elderly residents of long-term-care homes — died.

The government says there have been 36,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ontario.

But as of 6 p.m. Monday, a Star count of regional public health units found 38,875 cases.

The Star’s tally includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases.

That means they have symptoms, contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive test from a lab.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"More than two-thirds of Ontarians believe police treat Black and Indigenous people “worse” than others and 90 per cent want mandatory body cameras for all officers, a new poll has found.

The Campaign Research survey for the Star also revealed opinion on cutting police budgets by 10 per cent was evenly split and that most don’t think officers all need to carry guns.

Campaign Research principal Nick Kouvalis said the findings should be concerning to police forces across the province.

“The major takeaway is the police have a big problem — they have lost the support of the super majority of the public and they need to work hard to get it back,” Kouvalis said Friday.

Campaign Research polled 1,395 people across Ontario on Wednesday and Thursday using Maru Blue’s online panel. It is an opt-in poll, but for comparison purposes, a random sample of this size would have a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

The survey comes against the backdrop of Black Lives Matter protests around the world after the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minnesota on May 25. Four Minneapolis officers, who have since been fired, have been charged.

Asked if they feel “Black people and/or Indigenous people and/or other people from racialized communities are treated worse by police than other citizens,” 68 per cent of respondents agreed with that statement.

Only 22 per cent disagreed and nine per cent weren’t sure.

“It’s not surprising two-thirds of people believe that, because it’s true,” said Kouvalis, who has worked with Conservative and Liberal candidates across Canada and managed the winning Toronto mayoral campaigns of John Tory and Rob Ford.

“Brown, Black, and Indigenous people know when they meet a police officer that they could have a problem because the officer has preconceived notions about them,” he said.

The poll found 51 per cent agreed that “it is only a minority of police officers who engage in racist behaviour” while 35 per cent said “this is a widespread problem that has infected police culture.”

Similarly, 61 per cent said “it is workable to have a segment of our police officers who are not armed and can deal with appropriate calls where a firearm is not required.”

About one-quarter — 26 per cent — disagreed and 13 per cent weren’t sure.

A staggering 90 per cent of respondents believe all Ontario officers should have mandatory body cameras with only five per cent opposed and five per cent unsure.

“The sense is that not only will people be protected, but the police officers themselves will be protected if they have body cams they can’t shut off,” said Kouvalis.

There was 41 per cent support for “the Ontario government mandating a 10 per cent reduction to all police budgets” and 42 per cent opposed to that with 17 per cent unsure.

But the pollster stressed “the public is split on it if there’s a hard choice” in poll questioning.

When he asked about defunding the police in a different way, 74 per cent said they would prefer reforms to policing while nine per cent said budgets should be cut “as much as you can” with two per cent wanting police abolished and 15 per cent unsure.

“There’s way more support for reforming police,” he said.

Campaign Research found 65 per cent back speed cameras in order to free up officers to do other duties while just 23 per cent opposed that and 12 per cent weren’t sure.

“What that shows is that all the noise made by the right on speed cameras is just noise,” said Kouvalis, noting the traditional opposition to photo radar by conservative-leaning voters.

Ford, who in the past has professed support for Trump, urged the American leader not to slap levies on Canadian aluminum, which would hurt Ontario.

“We’re the number one customer to 19 states, we’re the number two to nine others. We were instrumental in employing 9 million Americans, and then they want to start talking about tariffs against us?” the premier told reporters Friday in Woodbridge.

“You got to be kidding, we’re the number one customer in the world, Canada is. So I highly recommend President Trump, don’t do it,” he said.

“Don’t put tariffs on our aluminum or we’re coming out swinging, we may be small, but we’re your number one customer. Remember that. Don’t forget it.”

In off-the-cuff comments after promoting a new “Ontario-made” push to get people to buy domestic products, Ford, who once ran his family’s label business in Chicago, said “we’re going to make sure we support our own.”

“I was down there for years, ‘made in USA.’ Well, guess what, it’s going be ‘made in Ontario,’ ‘made in B.C.’, ‘made in Quebec,’” he said.

“Folks, let’s stick together because economically, we’re going to war.”

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau skipped a White House meeting with Trump and Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador to mark the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, pact that took effect July 1.

Health Minister Christine Elliott noted Friday that 30 of the province’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases and 17 of those had no cases at all.

Only Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, and Windsor-Essex reported more than five cases apiece.

“With 178 more resolved today, Ontario is reporting fewer active cases than seen at any point in April, pre-peak,” Elliott said on Twitter.

Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens said there have been instances where ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing,"" and having a lead agency would help prevent that.

""Everyone is doing the best they can do locally but this type of situation requires a different level of co-ordination because of the complexity involved,"" he said in a news conference with other local leaders Friday morning.

""What we want to do is make sure there are no gaps,"" and no duplication of efforts, he said.

He noted, for example, that if migrant workers who test positive are being housed in a hotel, there must also be arrangements to deliver meals to them so they don't have to leave their rooms.

Leamington Mayor Hilda MacDonald said there should be incentives for farms to have their workers tested, or fines for those who refuse.

""It's a prickly issue, no one seems to want to take that on but someone needs to. If we don't get somebody to do this, we'll just keep going round and round in circles,"" she said.

""There has to be something, a carrot or a stick, basically.""

Asked whether the province was willing to take over the COVID-19 response in the area, Premier Doug Ford would only say it's ""all hands on deck"" when it comes to addressing farm outbreaks.

Officials in Windsor-Essex are asking the province or Ottawa to take over the response to large COVID-19 outbreaks in farms. Ontario Premier Doug Ford wouldn't say the province is willing to take the lead, but says it's ""all hands on deck"" in the region.

He said federal and provincial inspectors are already in the region, as are local and provincial health officials and the Ministry of Health.

Farms in Windsor-Essex have been hit hard by COVID-19, with four currently in outbreak.

Hundreds of migrant workers have tested positive for the virus, and three have died — two of them in Windsor-Essex and one in Norfolk County.

Two more farm workers were reported to have tested positive on Friday, according to the Windsor-Essex health unit.

Health officials in Lambton County said they have offered voluntary, on-site testing to farms in that region that hire temporary foreign workers or seasonal employees.

Of the 86 tests completed at six farms in the last two weeks, 84 have been negative and two are still pending, the health unit said.

Lambton County expects to see between 200 and 300 temporary foreign workers arrive for seasonal work at area farms, it said.

""The response has been good and we are having regular conversations with local farm operators on how to prevent COVID-19 transmission and manage the risk for any possible outbreak,"" Dr. Sudit Ranade, the county's medical officer of health, said in a statement.

Ontario reported 116 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, and seven new deaths due to the novel coronavirus.

The total number of cases now stands at 36,464, which includes 32,155 marked as resolved and 2,710 deaths.

The province is also reporting 178 newly resolved cases today. More than 27,484 tests for the novel coronavirus were completed over the previous 24 hours.

The number of people in hospital because of the virus dropped slightly, while people in intensive care and on ventilators both slightly increased.

The farm outbreaks delayed the economic reopening in the Windsor-Essex region, particularly in the towns of Leamington and Kingsville, which were the last two communities to reach Stage 2 this week.

The Ontario government last week deployed a team from its emergency management agency to help co-ordinate care and housing for farm workers who tested positive for the virus.

Meanwhile, Ford planned to make multiple public appearances at businesses on Friday to thank Ontario workers for their service during the pandemic.

The premier, alongside Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli, promoted a program meant to help Ontarians identify products made in the province, in an effort to boost the local economy.

The Ontario Made program, which is run by the Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters organization, is receiving $500,000 in provincial funding through the Ontario Together Fund launched in April.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-14,"VICTORIA—The British Columbia government is expected to give a financial update today on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected its residents, businesses and the economy.

Finance Minister Carole James says the pandemic has created “profound” challenges for people in B.C. and around the globe, fundamentally changing the ways people live and work.

She says the update will provide a summary of those impacts and outline the supports government has put in place and will continue to provide.

James says predicting how long recovery will take would require a crystal ball, with so many moving pieces.

Possible risks like a second wave of infections or shifts in other jurisdictions that would affect B.C. exports mean the timeline for economic recovery is uncertain.

The B.C. government has already tabled legislation giving itself room for three years of deficits and James says that will be re-examined each year.

“I’m afraid it’s a challenging time and you’ll see that in some of the statistics tomorrow when it comes to economic forecasters who have a wide range of what they anticipate could be coming,” she said Monday.

And that period couldn’t have come sooner, say doctors and epidemiologists who have been watching the pandemic unfold.

While the news that we have reached a day with zero dead from the virus for the first time since mid-March is undoubtedly good, experts are warning that we should not begin to rest on our laurels lest the virus flare up amid relaxed restrictions.

One person in Ontario died from the virus on Sunday, a significant departure from the height of the pandemic in May, when more than 90 deaths were reported in one day.

Todd Coleman, an epidemiologist at Wilfrid Laurier University, called it “fantastic news.”

“It means that the severity of spread has slowed down consistently to see zero deaths in a 24-hour period,” said Coleman. “It also means though, that we still need to remain vigilant because the deaths are representative of infections happening over the last few weeks. We still need a few weeks to monitor and see what things are like before coming to any definitive conclusions.”

Dr. John Granton, head of respirology at University Health Network, said the decrease in deaths was a natural outcome of a decrease in cases overall.

“You naturally see a reduction in those coming in really sick,” he said.

His hospital has seen a significant decrease in critically ill patients being admitted due to the virus, although he warns that there could still be more deaths — critically ill patients who have been in the hospital for weeks and are suffering from secondary infections or complications related to the virus.

“Sadly, it is possible still to see late deaths for patients who have not recovered,” said Granton.

Here we survey how Ontario and Canada’s fight against COVID-19 is progressing and also check on other countries that have had success in flattening their curves.

Ontario and the GTA compared

There were 185 new cases of the virus reported by health units on Monday, with 129 of those originating in the GTA. Toronto had the highest number at 67 with Peel a close second at 42.

But the overall trend shows a decrease in cases.

Coleman noted that while the downward trend in the rolling seven-day average is “definitely a positive sign,” Ontarians still “need to be vigilant in terms of preventative measures, and that includes social distancing and mask wearing in public spaces, especially indoor public spaces whenever possible.”

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s associate medical officer of health, also cautioned against letting our guard down despite the general decline in new COVID-19 case counts.

“It is important to remember that while our COVID-19 case numbers have decreased, this does not mean there is no risk of contracting the virus in our city,” she said in an email.

“The reality is that the virus continues to circulate in our city and we are seeing more younger adults getting COVID-19 compared to earlier in the outbreak when there were many residents in long-term care homes who were getting COVID-19,” said Dubey.

“This means we still need to be careful. This point is made very clear in the experiences of other jurisdictions.”

Health units compared

The Windsor-Essex health unit continues to have the highest number of cases based on population counts as widespread testing last week revealed hundreds of cases in the farm sector, where thousands of temporary farm workers are employed.

More than 560 people in the area are in self-isolation, the health unit reported Monday.

But after an outbreak on the weekend in the manufacturing sector, Dr. Wajid Ahmed, the area’s medical officer of health, also warned about the importance of workplace health and safety measures such as in-person screening and staggering employee start and break times.

Ahmed said cases could originate anywhere and that the health unit is looking into contacts but they couldn’t identify one particular risk area.

That is unlike Kingston, where 37 cases have been linked to a nail salon with more cases originating at other businesses including a golf club, a restaurant and two other nail salons.

Meanwhile, Toronto, Peel and York continue to have significant case counts in the last week based on population.

The York Region Public Health unit has had a number of outbreaks at workplaces, the majority involving employees who lived outside the region, said Patrick Casey, director of corporate communications for York Region.

The R number

The current reproduction number of the virus, which refers to the number of secondary infections from one case, dipped below one a month ago and has stayed there, which is a “very good sign,” said epidemiologist Susan Bondy, an associate professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

“We’re looking for the R number to be less than one over the long haul,” said Bondy.

If the number is over one, it means that one case will lead on average to more than one secondary infection, which can lead to exponential growth down the road.

Bondy says in this phase of the pandemic it’s extremely difficult to predict where there will be a flare-up of new cases as there was in Kingston.

“We’re seeing all these little lightning strikes and the little lightning strikes are sometimes unfortunately large numbers of cases,” said Bondy. “It’s these little lightning strikes that really drive the R value for a week and drive the provincial averages in terms of case counts,” she said. “There’s no mathematical model that could say Kingston … would have an outbreak in a nail salon.”

Asked whether we can expect to see the reproduction number go even lower due to Toronto’s mandatory mask policy, Bondy said it’s more important that it doesn’t go back up.

“I think what could have happened if we didn’t have the mandatory masks is that people would feel that the risk is low and they would let down their guard,” said Bondy. “So if you don’t see further reduction in the R number, that doesn’t mean the mandatory mask policy wasn’t successful.”

“I believe it will help (the R number) stay low as we reopen,” said Bondy.

Bondy also believes the city’s mandatory policy will reduce tension that might have occurred if some stores and businesses had instituted the policy and others didn’t.

“I was in public health when we were trying to enact universal smoke-free laws in bars and restaurants. The worst scenario is when you had a hodgepodge. That’s where you had conflict,” said Bondy. “And one business pitched against another business. And you had people that were upset and aggressive if they moved from a place that had one rule to another with another rule.”

“I really believe the mandatory stance is the better thing for social comfort.”

What can Canada do to further flatten its own curve?

It’s instructive to look at what successes other countries around the world have experienced. While some of the lessons might be too little too late, the way countries such as Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam and Ireland responded to COVID-19 could be useful in the event of another pandemic.

Taiwan is held up by many experts as the model for how to respond to COVID-19. The East Asian nation of 23 million people has seen 449 cases of the virus and just seven deaths since the pandemic began, despite its proximity to China. How did Taiwan do it?

One thing that helped, said Simon Bacon, a behavioural scientist at Concordia University in Montreal, was the country’s experience in battling SARS in 2003 that gave it a nimble ability to respond fast.

“SARS for example hit Taiwan very heavily so they put in place a whole series of mechanisms so that as soon as something looks like a pandemic or a fast-spreading virus, they can mobilize very quickly. Obviously one of the key successes from Taiwan was their ability to identify cases and then do all of the contact tracing around it,” he said. “Taiwan did that from the very beginning.”

Bacon noted that Taiwan’s citizens had a very high rate of face-mask use, a cultural practice born of the country’s experience in dealing with infectious diseases.

The country has also been hailed for its robust electronic health infrastructure that allowed for tracking of hospital and doctor visits and reporting of travel and symptoms through an online platform. One study noted that the country also proactively sought out patients with severe respiratory issues who had previously tested negative for influenza so that they could be retested for COVID-19.

Like Taiwan, New Zealand took measures early on that helped to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and likely save thousands of lives. As early as the end of January, the country had already set up a team within its health ministry to keep tabs on what the virus was doing elsewhere and even began screening passengers coming off flights from China.

On Feb. 2, the country banned travel from mainland China outright. By mid-March, New Zealand cancelled festivals and large gatherings, including a memorial service for victims of the 2019 Christchurch massacre. On March 20, all public services were closed down and five days later the country went into full lockdown. The country also instituted widespread, aggressive testing and contact tracing earlier than many nations.

As of July 6, the country reported just 1,534 cases and 22 deaths.

Bacon noted the country had exceptional communication from government officials that emphasized the wellbeing of the collective. The messaging was “we’re in this together. We need to work together to beat this,” said Bacon. “Very few countries have done that.”

Vietnam, a country of 97 million, acted quickly when news of the virus emerged out of Wuhan, monitoring its long border with China before eventually closing it, and extending the New Year shutdown of schools at the end of January until mid-May, according to media reports.

As of July 6, there have been just 369 cases of COVID-19 in Vietnam — and no deaths — according to Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center.

While countries in Europe and North America were just starting to figure out how to respond to the pandemic in March, Vietnam was sending travellers to quarantine for 14 days and testing them, ensuring that even asymptomatic people entering the country were detected. The country also did contact tracing for both direct and indirect contacts of cases.

“The one thing we’ve probably learned from all of this process is that if you go aggressive early, you can really minimize the spread at the very beginning. You then don’t get all the problems in terms of overwhelmed health-care systems,” Bacon said. “Vietnam did that and they’re now reaping the benefits of that. They’ve got way more public activity going on because they went early, they went aggressive.”

To date, Ireland has seen 25,531 cases of COVID-19, including 1,741 deaths, but data from Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center shows the country has largely flattened its curve. This was partly due to strict early measures that saw people over the age of 70 asked to stay indoors and keep social visits to a minimum.

The fact that Ireland is an island also helped, said Bacon, noting that fast action by the government, including consistent messaging. In fact, clear communication on the part of all four of the above countries, including that three of them are islands, played a large role in helping them meet the challenges of the pandemic, he says.

“That consistent messaging becomes critically important because as an individual, a citizen of that country, you get this very concise ‘this is what needs to happen, this is what we’re going to do,’ ” Bacon said. “Contrast that to the UK and the US, which I think are two examples of how definitely not to do this...they’ve never really been very committal or consistent in their messaging.”

Coleman noted that these four countries paid close attention to the virus’s behaviour in the world and showed excellent coordination between government and public health experts to ensure consistent messaging and aggressive testing and contact tracing.

Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-07-05,"OTTAWA—Opposition parties have laid out their demands for the federal Liberal government as Ottawa prepares to update Canadians on the country’s finances after four months of COVID-19 — and where it expects the economy to head for the rest of the year.

Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot will be the first public assessment of the country’s economic and financial situation since the pandemic started in earnest in March, forcing provinces into lockdown and the Liberal government to start doling out billions in aid in lieu of a federal budget.

The snapshot is expected to give an idea of how the government sees the rest of the fiscal year playing out, including figures for a potential deficit.

But the Conservatives and NDP made clear Sunday that they want more than just numbers: They want action. That includes additions, changes and expansions to federal COVID-19 support programs along with more accountability and transparency.

Yet while the Conservatives also called for the Liberals to produce a plan to get government spending under control, the NDP warned against any premature efforts to cut federal assistance.

Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre on Sunday blasted the Liberals’ handling of the economy while small business critic James Cumming underscored the importance of accurate fiscal projections and planning from the government for Canadian business.

“What business needs as they start to open up is some level of certainty,” Cumming said during a news conference on Parliament Hill.

“They need to understand what the government’s finances are to understand how long these programs are going to last to assist them and when they will be starting to phase out. And a lot of that has a lot to do with the financial health of the government.”

Federal figures last week showed direct government spending on COVID-19 supports at just over $174 billion, which included another increase to the budget for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. That is now expected to cost $80 billion as eligibility increased to 24 from 16 weeks.

At the same time, Statistics Canada last week reported that the Canadian economy shrank 11.6 per cent in April — the largest monthly drop on record. That follows a 7.5 per cent contraction in gross domestic product in March. Both are expected to hit Ottawa’s bottom line through lost tax revenue.

Parliamentary budget officer Yves Giroux has previously predicted that the increased spending and lost revenue could combine to see the federal deficit top $250 million this year.

With COVID-19 in retreat across most of the country — at least for the moment — Poilievre said it was time for the Liberals to produce a plan to start getting what he described as Ottawa’s “fiscal mess” under control.

That includes weaning Canadians off the CERB and getting them back to work by phasing out the $2,000-per-month benefit based on how much they earn rather than simply cutting off anyone who earns more than $1,000 in a month.

“The government is punishing Canadians for working,” Poilievre said. “We think that people on it should be rewarded when they make the courageous decision to go back to work and make a wage.”

Poilievre, who also demanded more money for the federal auditor general’s office to better scrutinize government spending during the pandemic, dismissed suggestions that Ottawa needs to keep the taps wide open to stimulate the economy as it starts to reopen.

He instead took aim at various Liberal policies and regulations around natural-resource development, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, as having stunted economic growth and prosperity in Canada.

“Removing these government obstacles is the way you unleash growth and create a cornucopia of opportunity for our workers and businesses that will generate the wealth,” he said. “More deficit spending does not create jobs and growth.”

Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet also called last week for the CERB to be phased out to encourage Canadians to return to work. He made an exception for seasonal workers in the arts, hospitality and agricultural industries who will not earn a full income until next summer.

Yet NDP finance critic Peter Julian warned against any early cut to COVID-19 benefits and support and instead repeated longstanding calls from his party for the federal government to crack down on tax havens and tax wealthy Canadians and businesses to pay for the federal aid.

“There’s been a call for ... dealing with the economic and financial fallout of the pandemic through cutting services,” Julian said in an interview.

“We actually believe that now is the time to handle the pandemic from the revenue side. We believe in tackling the tax haven problem, which is more acute in Canada than any other country. And to put in place a wealth tax.”

The NDP is also pressing for the Liberals to ease the criteria for businesses to access the federal wage subsidy, which covers up to 75 per cent of employees’ salaries, to encourage more hiring. And it wants the government to provide promised support for Canadians living with disabilities.

While the fiscal update will be presented in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Julian said the report itself will not require a vote. However, he suggested NDP support for future legislative proposals from the government could be contingent on the Liberals accepting the NDP’s requests.

The Liberals have leaned heavily on the NDP since being elected to a minority government in October. That included securing NDP support for several confidence motions in the winter and spring that, if defeated, could have triggered a federal election.

From coast to coast to coast the usual festivities, parades and fireworks that accompany Canada Day have been cancelled in many communities this year because of COVID-19, but Canadians are still finding ways to mark the country’s birthday.

In British Columbia, orchestra conductor Stuart Martin said he knew his neighbours were curious about what he was doing in his backyard when one peered over the fence as he pointed his baton and wildly moved his arms.

The neighbours couldn’t know, but the musical director of the Surrey City Orchestra was conducting a virtual version of “O Canada” while standing on the grass.

The finished product is a unique version of the national anthem played by 28 musicians who have been missing each other due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“On this particular day, I had a neighbour peak over the fence trying to figure out what I was doing,” said Martin. “It’s an amusing thing to watch, but when the video’s all together it actually kind of looks like an orchestra. It was pretty neat.”

The orchestra was billed to perform in Surrey on Canada Day, but the pandemic cancelled the celebrations on Wednesday, he said.

Orchestra members suggested producing a virtual recording and each member recorded “O Canada,” with their parts all being stitched together for the final production, said Martin. The video shows some people recording from their balconies, living rooms and yards.

“At first I was skeptical that we could pull this thing together in such a short time or whether or not it would sound any good,” Martin said. “I think it’s really great.”

He said this is the first time he’s been part of a recording of “O Canada.” The experience, especially during a pandemic, will make for a memorable Canada Day, Martin said.

“Overall, as distinct as Canada Day is going to be this year, I think connecting virtually is something that we’re all really starting to enjoy and really starting to cherish,” he said.

“This is just kind of an extended version of a Zoom meeting.”

In Montreal, sibling singer-songwriters Rufus and Martha Wainwright will be among the artists playing to an empty house at the city’s iconic Olympic Stadium.

In a 60-minute, pre-recorded show promoted as an “immersive experience,” performers will take to the stage at centre field of the massive multi-purpose venue.

The lineup also includes Quebec-based artists Charlotte Cardin, Hubert Lenoir and Patrick Watson, as well as Inuit folk singer Elisapie.

Interspersed with the musical acts will be speeches from politicians, including Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante and federal Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, along with everyday Montrealers describing their vision of the city and the country.

Promoters call it a “historic event,” calling it “the first show without an audience in the centre of the Olympic Stadium grounds.”

While many municipalities have cancelled their fireworks shows, some Canadians are still planning their own private displays if they live in regions where regulations allow it.

John Adria, owner of Uncle John’s Fireworks, which operates four stores in Alberta, said one group near Edmonton is planning a show but isn’t telling anyone in advance where the fireworks will be launched from. That way, he explained, they’ll prevent a crowd from gathering that would violate social-distancing rules.

“It’s a big show. Will you be able to see it from many places in Edmonton? Yes,” said Adria, who wouldn’t divulge the name of the organization.

“I’ve probably said too much already.”

Hudson Bay, Sask., meanwhile, will launch only fireworks that explode high up and are easily visible from far away so that town residents won’t have to crowd in a single gathering area to view them.

Councillor Betty Lou Palko said the display will be launched from the high school football field and people will be allowed to gather in vehicles — parked five metres apart — in several nearby parking lots, but she said the town is small enough that folks will be able to watch the display from their homes.

“I have young family visiting me so I’ll be able to ‘ooh’ and ‘ahh’ with them,” Palko said.

Toronto, however, has moved its Canada Day celebrations online starting with a pancake breakfast at 9 a.m.

Mayor John Tory will be participating in a full day of festivities that includes Jully Black, Kardinal Offishall and Gordon Lightfoot, among others.

Meanwhile in Hamilton, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum may do a flyover, weather permitting.

In New Brunswick, the RB Bennett Commemorative Centre in Hopewell Cape will celebrate the 150th birthday of the 11th Canadian prime minister on Wednesday.

On Canada Day, 150 cupcakes will be given to the first 150 guests at the centre.

On the West Coast in Victoria, Mayor Lisa Helps said the virtual program this year aims to reflect the diversity of experiences in the country and the city.

The crowdsourced content will be sprinkled throughout the show, with members of the community demonstrating “What it means to Me to be Canadian” and singing “O Canada,” she said.

“With everything we have experienced locally and as a country due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, this is a Canada Day we won’t soon forget,” Helps said.

“Even though we can’t physically be together on the legislature lawn, we can still come together virtually to celebrate Canada’s diversity and its strengths.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tonda Maccharlesottawa Bureau', 'Ottawa Bureau', 'Tonda Maccharles Is An Ottawa-Based Reporter Covering Federal Politics For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"OTTAWA – Canada could avoid a second wave of the coronavirus if it learns the lessons of South Korea and Taiwan and attacks testing, tracing and treatment of COVID-19 cases and practices “dynamic distancing” from the get-go, MPs heard Tuesday.

That means as the economy reopens, communities must be ready to reimpose physical distancing and socially restrictive measures periodically with surges in disease activity in order to contain outbreaks and allow economic revitalization to continue, Asaph Young Chun, head of Korea’s Statistics Research Institute, told the Commons health committee.

Those “nonpharmaceutical” interventions are the best “exit strategy” from the COVID-19 lockdowns, he said.

Two American health experts said South Korea and Taiwan showed the path for other countries to follow, but they warned Canada against reopening too quickly even to its neighbours, the United States.

Jeremy Konyndyk, a fellow with Centre for Global Development who works closely with the World Health Organization, said the pandemic is moving to a different phase around the world where governments now find it difficult to sustain prolonged and complete lockdowns “economically, politically and socially.”

It’s hard for governments to reimpose measures once they’ve been lifted, he said, so communities and individuals need to voluntarily “adopt and own” social distancing and public health measures like hand hygiene and wearing masks.

Konyndyk said states like Arizona, Florida, Texas, parts of California and other southern states that lifted restrictions too early without having the public’s buy-in to sustain those measures are now seeing outbreaks starting to overwhelm them.

“It was easier for those which locked down earlier to think because they dodged a bullet that they’re bulletproof,” he said. They are now paying “a real penalty” with a resurgence of the disease. “If you give this virus oxygen, it will burn you down,” he warned.

Taiwan and South Korean officials outlined how their governments used early border closures, aggressive testing and contact tracing with the support of digital mobile tracing technology and lockdowns to tackle the epidemic at first. Both have moved to lift restrictions as the virus comes under control.

Those countries learned hard lessons in the 2003 SARS outbreak and moved quickly this time to order their populations to stay at home, practice hand hygiene and wear masks, even before there was hard evidence of asymptomatic transmission.

The Korean government worried about the negative impacts of the lockdown on the mental and physical health of families and individuals, so Korea continues to “experiment in real time” with the idea that restrictions can be lifted but must dynamically cycle on and off as reports of new cases emerge, he said.

Korean disease modellers worked closely with Canadian infectious disease expert Dr. David Fisman of the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health to plot its reopening. They coined the term “dynamic distancing” to describe the need to “allow a certain amount of relaxation when it comes to small gatherings, and working at the office and also spending time in public places,” said Chun.

Korea now reports only about 50 new cases a day and even that is seen as too high by a population that wears masks as the new normal, he said.

“You certainly should be anticipating this epidemic might be coming back,” but a second wave is not inevitable, he said. What’s important is “do you have a system in place to deal with it.”

Winston Wen-Yi Chen, a representative of Taiwan in Canada, said although Taiwan is neither a member nor an observer at the World Health Organization, it detected alerts about the new virus in Wuhan early. It launched an emergency command centre on Dec. 31, communicated clearly, closed borders, conducted massive testing, supplied protective equipment like masks to the general public, and guaranteed their privacy rights when it adopted digital tracing technology.

Konyndyk said governments that had “horrible communication” and sowed “confusion and mistrust” are “doing worst, and the worst performing countries in the world right now are the United States and Brazil.”

As the global COVID-19 response shifts “from something that is government-imposed to something that is community-owned and led,” Konyndyk said front-line local organizations in poor countries need more help. He said less than $2 million of $2.5 billion pledged globally is reaching them. The rest appears directed to flow through international organizations, which e called “a recipe for failure.”

Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor and director of the WHO Collaborating centre on National and Global Health Law, said the WHO made mistakes but he defended it against criticism it was too slow to report the Wuhan outbreak, to reveal rapid community spread, and to recommend border closures.

He said the WHO had “no power” to go into China without Chinese permission to investigate the outbreak and said it is “unfair to criticize the WHO for not doing something that the world did not give it the power to do.”

Read', 'Joan Brydenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Joan Brydenthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-06-20,"OTTAWA—Federal Conservatives have crusaded for a return to parliamentary business as usual but they’re opposed to the one thing Liberals and New Democrats insist is necessary to do that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: electronic voting.

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen says her party is suspicious of anything promoted by the Liberals that would keep most MPs out of the House of Commons and, in her view, help the government avoid accountability.

Besides, she says there are other options that would allow all 338 MPs to vote in person in the chamber while maintaining physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In a letter to Commons Speaker Anthony Rota earlier this month, Bergen suggested six different options, including having MPs line up in “yea” and “nay” queues in the courtyard space surrounding the chamber from where they could individually enter the Commons to have their votes recorded.

Other options included having small groups of MPs vote in shifts, issuing paper ballots and allowing each party’s whip to “block vote” on behalf of their colleagues.

Allowances would be made for any dissenting MPs to cast their own votes.

“When Liberals don’t want members of Parliament in Ottawa, I’m suspicious,” Bergen said in an interview.

“When they want MPs to do their jobs in a nice, far-away setting and where their powers are diluted, where their responsibilities are taken away, I am very suspicious.”

However, government House leader Pablo Rodriguez says he can’t figure out why the Conservatives are so dead set against the “one little thing” that would allow the Commons to resume all normal operations and restore all MPs’ powers, including voting, without risk for transmission of COVID-19.

“This is the 21st Century,” Rodriguez said in an interview.

“It would be very, very simple to bring back Parliament ... with MPs in the House, others virtually. That means 338 MPs participating which is what we want because this is what’s best for democracy, with everything of a regular Parliament, the only difference (being) you vote electronically.

“The Conservatives are still opposed to that and I don’t know why ... They’re the only ones.”

Rodriguez says the Conservative position makes no sense because it would require MPs to travel back and forth from their ridings to Ottawa, increasing the potential for catching and spreading the infection.

The Conservatives have been pushing for weeks for a full resumption of normal in-person parliamentary business, albeit with a limited number of about 50 MPs actually physically present in the Commons. The Bloc Quebecois recently sided with them on that front, after initially opposing the idea.

But New Democrats joined forces with the Liberals to reject that option, arguing that normal business can’t resume until a way is found to allow electronic voting by MPs not in the chamber.

In the meantime, they agreed to continue having a special COVID-19 committee meet four times a week in the Commons, with a small number of MPs in the chamber and the others participating virtually.

The last special committee meeting took place Thursday but there are to be similar sessions four times over the summer.

Normal proceedings in the Commons have been suspended since mid-March, except for a handful of brief, single-day sittings to pass emergency aid legislation. It is currently scheduled to resume regular business on Sept. 21.

However, if public health experts continue to recommend physical distancing in the fall, Rodriguez said the Commons could still safely resume all normal operations, with most MPs participating virtually and voting electronically from remote locations.

Rota has said he’s confident electronic voting can be done securely. The all-party procedure and House affairs committee has been instructed to recommend a precise procedure for doing so by next week.

While it could be implemented on a temporary basis with the support of just one of the main opposition parties, Rodriguez said it would be better if they could all agree.

But Bergen indicated that’s not in the cards.

While Conservatives were initially open to the idea of electronic voting, she said: “I would say we have become progressively more opposed to it and more suspicious of the idea.”

The last straw was “the hypocrisy” of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mingling with thousands of protesters against racism two weeks ago, even as he argued that it wasn’t safe for MPs to sit in Parliament.

“That was I think for Conservatives a clear signal that he was running more from accountability than he is ... concerned about health and safety,” Bergen said.

“Parliament has sat during wars, depression and all kinds of crises and not had electronic voting ... I think all members of Parliament need to be there voting in person and being recorded as such.”

Rodriguez said the government has done what it could to remain accountable during the pandemic. Indeed, he said the special committee arrangement allowed opposition MPs to ask almost 3,200 questions of the government this spring, compared to just 1,800 that would have been asked had the Commons been operating normally.

But Bergen dismissed that as “lame excuses,” arguing that simply posing questions “is not Parliament and it’s insulting to every member of Parliament and really to Canadian democracy that that is what he defines as satisfactory.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Rosa Sabacalgary Bureau', 'Calgary Bureau', 'Rosa Saba Is A Calgary-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-04-14,"As financial relief arrives in the bank accounts of the thousands of Canadians suddenly left unemployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, many are finding the process puzzling.

If you too are wondering where that money in your account came from, and whether or not you’ll have to return it, you’re not alone.

Many recipients are confused by the difference between Employment Insurance (EI), which a worker typically gets when laid-off, and the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides $2,000 per month for four months. The phone lines to Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency are busy as thousands of Canadians call for answers everyday.

To help out, the Star is gathering your questions about EI and CERB and attempting to answer your concerns. If you don’t see your question below, send it in and we’ll try to get the answer.

If I applied for CERB through the new portal and got it, will I be eligible for EI once the 16 weeks have passed?

A spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada said accessing CERB does not have an impact on EI claims, and once a person has received the 16 weeks of CERB, that person may be eligible for EI providing criteria are met.

If my previous income was not from Canada, can I still get CERB?

A person has to reside in Canada to receive CERB, but their applicable income from the previous year can have been earned elsewhere, said a spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada.

If I applied for EI but got transferred to CERB, do I still need to do bi-weekly reports through Service Canada?

Yes. According to an emailed statement from ESDC, if you originally applied for EI and were transferred to CERB, you are still required to complete the bi-weekly reports an EI recipient would.

What happens when I’ve claimed 16 weeks of CERB? Will I get automatically transferred to EI?

According to an emailed statement from ESDC, anyone who has received 16 weeks of CERB and is still eligible for EI can receive EI. The exact mechanics of the transition have yet to be confirmed.

Is CERB taxable income? What about EI?

CERB is taxable income, which you’ll have to declare come the 2021 tax season. How much you’re taxed will depend on your tax bracket for the year.

EI is also taxable, but it’s taxed at the source, meaning you won’t have to pay any extra taxes on it in 2021. While many Canadians who applied for EI are getting CERB instead, those who applied before March 15 will be receiving EI.

Is it true the CRA is approving everyone for CERB right away, and then asking people to pay it back later if they don’t qualify?

CERB is an emergency benefit, meaning it’s paid out without a full application process — this means people can get their funds within days, instead of waiting out the backlog of EI applications the government had before CERB.

However, this means that if you don’t qualify for CERB, you will have to repay what you received at a later date. In an email, a CRA spokesperson compared it to Canada’s income-tax season, where your taxes are checked at a later date.

How will I know if I need to repay what I’ve received?

There are two reasons you might need to repay CERB money. Some people applied for both EI and CERB, and are receiving double payments. Others applied for one, but don’t actually qualify for CERB.

If this is the case, the CRA will let you know, said a spokesperson.

“If any payments are found to have been made in error or a taxpayer is deemed ineligible, the taxpayer will be informed and required to repay the amount owing.”

How or when do I reapply for the CERB?

According to the CRA, each application for CERB covers a four-week period. After those four weeks, the applicant can reapply, for a maximum of 16 weeks, or four periods. If applying through the CRA, you must make a new application for every period.

The first four-week period runs from March 15 to April 11, and a full list of the periods can be found here.

Will receiving CERB affect my eligibility for EI after the four periods end?

According to the federal government website, receiving CERB will not affect your EI entitlement.

How do I know if the payments I’m getting are CERB or EI? What do I do if I’m getting both?

If you applied for EI before March 15 and are eligible, you will get EI payments. If you applied for EI or sickness benefits on March 15 or afterward, you will automatically be switched over to CERB.

If you applied for both EI and CERB after March 15, you may get double CERB payments and will have to pay half of it back — the CRA has said it will notify people in this position.

What should I do if my EI application from after March 15 is still processing, and doesn’t seem to have been switched to CERB?

According to a CRA spokesperson, your application will still automatically be switched to CERB, and Service Canada is processing these as quickly as possible.

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-07-14,"OTTAWA—A new poll suggests Canadians are torn on whether the federal government should tighten the taps on COVID-19 spending to keep the deficit from flooding the nation’s future.

The Liberals last week revealed this year’s projected deficit sits at $343 billion, driven by an estimated $231.9 billion in COVID-19 spending, so far, and a massive drop in government revenue.

With the deficit at levels not seen since the Second World War, Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies asked 1,523 Canadians whether they felt the government ought to immediately and quickly begin to scale back pandemic support programs to Canadians and to business.

Forty-one per cent said yes to that question, 44 per cent said no and 15 per cent said they didn’t know or preferred not to answer.

The survey was conducted between July 10 and 12, just after the Liberals released their projections.

It cannot be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

This week, the Liberal government announced that one of the biggest benefit programs — a federal wage subsidy — will be extended until the end of this year.

It covers 75 per cent of wages, up to a weekly maximum of $847, for eligible companies and non-profits that have lost at least 30 per cent of their revenues.

“Over the last three months you have seen me come out to talk with Canadians about what we’re doing to help you and your family, your employer, your local businesses deal with this pandemic,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday in announcing the extension.

“We’re going to continue to do that vital work.”

As of July 6, the wage subsidy had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies. Last week’s fiscal and economic update from the Liberals increased the overall budget to $82.3 billion.

The other marquee support program, the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, is set to expire in the fall.

The $500-a-week benefit had, as of July 5, paid out almost $54.8 billion to 8.25 million people.

Of those surveyed, 78 per cent said they were worried about the size of the deficit and how it may affect things in Canada in the long term.

In releasing the deficit projections, the Liberals didn’t set out a plan for how or when they might get the books back to balance.

Canadians say finances are still the greatest source of stress in their lives compared to personal health, work and relationships, with about half saying they’ve lost sleep over money worries, according to the 2020 Financial Stress Survey released by FP Canada. Similar studies FP Canada conducted in 2014 and 2018 found that finances were the top source of stress.

As the COVID-19 pandemic expanded from a health issue to an economic crisis money continued to weigh on Canadians. Four in 10 said the COVID-19 pandemic has added to their financial stress levels.

The survey found that, for many, job loss, reduced hours, working from home and volatility in the job market has made coping with usual financial stress all the more difficult.

FP’s survey noted that younger people listed money as their main source of stress at a higher rate than people over 65, and women said they lost sleep over finances more often.

A woman, who the Star is not naming due to her fear of job reprisal, has been losing sleep over money worries as her hours have been cut at work. She is a registered nurse and working from home doing infection screenings, but in recent weeks, her shifts have gone from five days a week to only three.

Her husband has also seen his pay decrease 10 per cent.

With four kids, one of whom is starting at York University in the fall, she said she’s been going to bed feeling sick every day.

She says she could likely find more work considering the demand, but isn’t comfortable with the risks more exposure could pose.

“It’s kind of a scary industry to be in. [It’s] scary to think of going out and getting something else and then the risks that come along with it to bring home to the kids.”

Todd McCullough, 44, and a single father of two had recently finished a college IT program when the pandemic hit.

“The whole point of going back to school was to try and get a better job lined up,” McCullough said. “If I had graduated last year, I probably would be in a much better predicament at the moment.”

He says he’d planned out the career move, budgeted and saved for the time he would be in school and spend job hunting afterwards, but the pandemic halted his job search.

“I’m not drowning. I’m just treading in deep right now,” he said. “I don’t want this to be my life for the next year and a bit or longer and I feel like this is what it’s going to be.”

Even in moments money isn’t scarce, finances still occupy a large part of the brain for many.

Tejahn Burnett, 28, has fortunately been able to work full-time from home and save on money commuting during the pandemic. Between that and business picking up with her side gig designing a line of shoes, she’s been able to significantly pay down debt and is optimistic about being debt free soon.

But there is still the matter of reallocating money to groceries, supplies for her two kids and closely managing finances.

“It’s the forefront of my mind,” Burnett said. “I’m constantly thinking about it because I don’t want to find myself in the same situation I was prior.”

While the survey found Canadians self-reported feeling money stress regardless of salary-size, Dr. Arjumand Siddiqi, a professor at University of Toronto’s School of Public Health who researches health equity and income inequality, points out that financial stress is not always equally felt.

“There is definitely a sort of racial distribution of who falls at various points in the income distribution of Canada.”

She said racialized people — particularly Black Canadians and Indigenous people — are more likely to have lower incomes and “therefore, will be bearing the brunt of financial stress.”

She says the people most stressed by finances are those experiencing intergenerational poverty.

“They are low income, but the bigger story is very likely that their parents and grandparents and so on are low income as well,” Dr. Siddiqi said. “Wealth is actually, ironically, what generates income.”

She says wealth from previous generations is what allows people to access education, buy a home earlier, save up and have a network of people to fall back on when difficulties arise. This sort of gap is quite racialized, she added.

Long-term, money stress, can have a negative impact on health. “Wealth is actually one of the biggest predictors of health even more than income,” Dr. Siddiqi said.

“You can imagine that if we are going to be in a pandemic of economic insecurity and more specifically a pandemic of inequality ... you’re probably going to see that people who are financially stressed because they’re economically insecure, are going to have fallout in terms of other outcomes, not just COVID.”

It was just before Christmas last year when a man peered into her Toronto massage parlour, pushed the unlocked door open, went in and throttled her. When he demanded money, she gave him the $180 in her wallet.

Since then, Yan says she has known only anxiety. It was not the first time she had been robbed, but circumstances since then — and city bylaws — have compounded Yan’s troubles.

Yan, not her real name, is one of about 2,500 mostly Asian workers in Toronto’s 400 massage and body rub parlours. She is what the city labels a holistic practitioner, or an unregistered massage therapist.

Forty such practitioners and workers in parlours, all women, have been robbed from December 2019 to March this year, says Elene Lam, executive director of Butterfly, a network to support Asian and migrant sex workers.

One reason their parlours get broken into is they are not allowed to lock the doors. A bylaw stipulates that they may lock doors if there’s a customer inside, “provided that whenever the doors are locked the time at which the doors will be unlocked shall be posted in a manner clearly visible from outside the holistic centre.”

When asked for a rationale for asking workers to keep doors unlocked when there’s no client inside, a city spokesperson told the Star by email this week, “Regulations relating to locked doors in BRPs (body rub parlours) was enacted in 1975 to safeguard inspectors’ full and unencumbered access to inspect the establishment.”

On the calls to remove restrictions on locking doors, they said, “Staff will continue to review these and other provisions as part of the future report on BRPs and holistic centres.” The report detailing the review is not expected until 2021.

Meanwhile, Yan says not being allowed to lock the door “haunts me like a shadow.” It leaves her in a constant and heightened state of anxiety at work. Locking the door is a safety measure. “I can see outside the glass door and decide if it is safe to open it,” she says in Mandarin, through an interpreter.

Last week, Butterfly wrote a letter asking Toronto Mayor John Tory, city councillors and other agencies to put “an immediate end to racial profiling and discriminatory, excessive, targeted inspections and prosecution of holistic practitioners” by bylaw officers.

Through an access to information request to the city, Butterfly found that the number of investigations of holistic practitioners rose from 611 or 3.7 per cent of all investigations in 2013 to 2,585 or 19.3 per cent of all investigations in 2015. This data was published in a 2018 survey of holistic practitioners’ experiences with bylaw enforcement and police by four advocacy groups.

Some of the practitioners were charged with infractions such as: locking the door when they are alone or installing a camera for safety and privacy reasons, Lam says. In the first 10 months of 2017, there were 255 charges issued; the stated reason on 41 of them was “table mat not in a good repair.”

Many bylaws related to holistic centres and body rub parlours were created without consultations with the workers, says Lam, who is also spokesperson for the Coalition Against Abuse by Bylaw Enforcement.

“It’s not just police who should be defunded but also bylaw officers,” says Lam, referring to calls to reform police that have arisen amid protests in Canada and the U.S. over police violence and anti-Black racism.

Over the past three years, more than a dozen rights organizations have been meeting with various city agencies asking the city to prioritize worker safety and human and labour rights over excessive inspections and arbitrary prosecutions.

This year, the workers’ situation simply worsened. Many of them were already reeling from rising anti-Asian racism in January with the onset of COVID-19. Subsequent pandemic closures slashed their wages. Many of the workers are migrants or undocumented; without documentation they were unable to access government income supports like the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).

When Ontario moved to Phase 2 of the reopening late in June and the city’s public health department allowed a conditional reopening of these parlours on June 26, relief appeared to be in sight.

But even that reopening turned fraught. On July 1, even as many Canadians celebrated the day with pride, bylaw officers ticketed “multiple” parlours, advocates say.

“At a time when the city should be supporting businesses to reopen … these workers are being punished simply for doing their jobs, despite having received written permission to do so,” Butterfly says in its letter to the city.

Yan was one of those ticketed $880 that day. While one bylaw officer was writing her ticket, the other was conducting a search. “He was looking under the table, my belongings, my rest space.”

Failed to comply with declared emergency, the ticket says.

The city accepts this was an error. “In this particular case, the individual has already been contacted by MLS (Municipal Licensing and Standards) and advised of the error and that no further action will be taken,” the media spokesperson told the Star. “The city is continuing to review training for bylaw officers to ensure they have the latest information around emergency orders and bylaws” evolving in response to COVID-19.

But Butterfly’s letter to the city says there is more than one case and Lam wants the city to drop all erroneous tickets without requiring the workers to fill out any identifying forms.

The city spokesperson, however, says the city is only aware of a single case.

“To the best of the city’s knowledge, there was only one ticket issued in error,” the spokesperson said Thursday. “The city did not receive any further information from the complainant that would indicate other tickets issued in error.”

In its letter, Butterfly asks the city to immediately stop ticketing parlours for reopening, to stop charging workers when they lock doors and to ensure zero retaliation for workers who report abuse at the hands of bylaw officers.

This is the fourth time since January that Yan’s parlour has been raided. “They’re rude. They kick the door and come in. They use a torch (flashlight) to look at every corner, even in my vanity bag.”

“I feel angry,” says Yan, weeping over the phone. “Their attitude was so disrespectful. Canada is a place where people are treated with human rights. They did not treat me as human.”

Yan says she has Canadian citizenship which emboldens her just enough to speak out, albeit anonymously. Many others who are on work permits don’t. Even so, Yan didn’t go to the police after she was robbed. She faces language barriers and her many interactions with bylaw enforcers have broken her trust. In any case, she doesn’t understand why people like her are being singled out for such treatment.

“Why am I being treated this way? I’m not robbing anyone. I’m just surviving. I’m not harming society. I’m contributing to it.”

Read', 'The Associated Press']",2020-07-07,"How risky is dining out during the COVID-19 pandemic?

There is some risk, but health officials say there are precautions you can take to minimize the chances you’ll be exposed to the virus.

Ordering takeout or delivery is still the safest option for getting restaurant food, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If you decide to eat at a restaurant, it’s best to opt for outdoor seating where tables are at least six feet apart, the agency says. Dining inside a restaurant that hasn’t reduced its capacity or safely distanced tables poses the most risk, it says.

The coronavirus spreads through droplets that are emitted when people talk, laugh, sing, cough or sneeze. Indoor spaces are more risky than outdoor spaces because it might be harder to keep people apart and there’s less ventilation, the CDC says.

Diners should assess what other safety steps the restaurant is taking.

For example, servers should be wearing masks and the restaurant should have a process to ensure people are not congregating too closely while waiting for a table, says Dr. Susan Casey Bleasdale, an infectious disease expert at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Digital or disposable menus and throwaway utensils are also preferable, according to the CDC. The agency says touchless payment options, like those available on your mobile device, are optimal. Otherwise, restaurants should have procedures for avoiding hand-to-hand contact with cash and credit cards.

If you are gathering at a restaurant with a group, Bleasdale suggests only dining with people you know, and checking if they have been feeling sick or experiencing any symptoms.

People more vulnerable to severe illness from the virus, such as the elderly, might want to avoid eating out at restaurants altogether.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"Editor’s note: The Star is taking a broad look at what entering the second phase of reopening after COVID-19 lockdowns will mean for Ontario. Every day, we’ll try and answer a different question about post-lockdown life. You can read a recap of all of the questions we’ve answered here.

In the 86 days between Ontario entering a state of emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic and Premier Doug Ford announcing social circles were permitted as the province began to reopen, I spent a lot of time wishing for bubbles.

As a person who lives alone, my social interactions were essentially limited to avoiding people when I ventured into the outside world. I nearly shed a tear on June 12, when Ford announced I could safely be within six feet of 10 other people.

But the dynamics of creating a social circle can be harder to navigate than expected. What about the friends who don’t take COVID-19 precautions as seriously as you do? How about that couple who has opposing views of what their circle should look like? What happens if you realize you want to ditch a circle mate?

Registered psychotherapist Joshua Peters, the clinical manager at the Centre for Interpersonal Relationships, says getting back out there with your loved ones could be a bumpy road, no matter how much you may have missed their company.

“It will feel weird to get back in front of a lot of people, if anything just from the experience of safety and being so cautious within big groups of people,” Peters said. “Any social interaction that we don’t do generally after three or four weeks you’re going to feel weird doing that ... There’s no way of broaching or getting over that kind of awkwardness because it’s just inevitable, it’s going to happen. Be compassionate towards yourself in that space.”

If you are planning on circling up with loved ones, or have already, here are some suggestions Peters makes for navigating this new dynamic.

Remember what we’ve all been through.

We are all operating as if we’re in crisis because of COVID-19, said Peters, which means everyone that you’re dealing with could be stressed, too. He suggests not putting too much pressure on yourself or others to maintain the perfect reciprocal relationship.

Peters said he likes to joke with his clients that in crisis all the blood from our thinking brain goes back to the animal parts of our brain, which can make human relationships tricky.

“We’re really in fight or flight mode, a lot of time, which can make it quite difficult to have complex relationships,” he said. “So even more interesting that we’re now faced with a really complex relationship structure that we have to create.”

Start your circle at home.

If you are a couple or a family planning to join a social circle, make sure members of your household are all on the same page before doing so.

A lot of conflict in families happens because family members don’t discuss boundaries or expectations, Peters said. Don’t assume you know how your family members or partner feels about the process of reintegration.

Talk about it.

Once a person or family has decided to join a circle, it’s important to talk about everyone’s experiences and expectations. These may be uncomfortable conversations, Peters said, but it gives people the space to work through how they are feeling.

“I think a lot of people are saying, ‘OK, I choose you. You’re in my bubble,’ and then they kind of move forward and that’s it ... Being able to have an explicit conversation about boundaries and where you see the boundaries within your social bubble is important,” he said.

Peters suggested explicitly discussing expectations around the routines that are specifically in line with COVID-19, like handwashing, wearing masks and socially distanced outings.

If you want to take this conversation to the next level, Peters said, write it down — a good option for families with young children. A written agreement helps avoid confusion and can be revisited over time, as the context changes in this ever-evolving pandemic.

Avoid blame.

If you’re worried about circling with a person for health and safety reasons — say they’re not taking the same precautions you are — Peters suggested focusing on the most vulnerable emotions that you’re having instead of the other person’s behaviours.

“You have to be firm about what your needs are for safety but focus on, ‘I’m feeling afraid and that’s why I’m doing this,’” he said. “‘It’s not about you, it’s not about I don’t want to connect with you, it’s that I’m scared of the current situation that we’re in.’”

It can be an uncomfortable spot to be in, but saying no can offer peace of mind.

Don’t be afraid of the social circle break up.

Peters said “a spoonful of honey goes a long way” if someone in your social circle isn’t holding up their end of the bargain.

“You want to be able to really express how important this person is to you and that ultimately your choice to remove them for a temporary amount of time, being clear that it’s temporary, is really about your safety and not a reflection of how much you care about the person,” he said.

Stay connected with people outside of your circle.

Let the people who aren’t in your circle know that you’re yearning to connect, Peters said, and that while you can’t do so now, there will be space in your life for them when relative isolation is over.

Text messages, phone calls and video chats are all ways to keep in touch, but Peters also suggests seeing people in person — while at a social distance and wearing a mask.

“It actually makes a big difference,” he said. “It still doesn’t feel like a warm hug or an embrace from a friend but it’s certainly a better way to connect than Zoom calls. We’re all getting a little bit fatigued from looking at our screens too much. If we can sit six feet away from someone and have a chat with them, it would mean a lot, I think.”

Try not to overwhelm yourself, or others.

Peters suggested starting your social circle in low-risk, low-stress environments, like going for a walk to get ice cream, before ramping up.

Be particularly compassionate with single people and members of marginalized groups. They may be among the best people to add to your circle because of their level of isolation in recent months, but may also have the hardest time stepping out.

Understand that the time will come to reconnect.

Human beings live a messy experience in the best of times. Communication is hard and some relationships may fracture in painful moments during this pandemic. That doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t bounce back in the future, Peters said.

When things get strained, don’t be afraid to go back to that person and try to reconnect.

“Be really compassionate towards each other and recognize that even if there’s some moments of discomfort, once it’s all over and we’re all on the other side of it and we’re feeling a little bit more stable, there will be opportunities to repair those relationships,” Peters said. “Don’t worry too much.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kevin Mcgranstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Kevin Mcgran Is A Star Sports Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-20,"Going to the gym, going to places of worship, playing some golf, having a drink on the patio at your favourite bar, taking the TTC.

These are things we once took for granted and did without thinking.

Maybe not anymore.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many of them have been off-limits, deemed unsafe.

But as Ontario dips its big toe into reopening and you consider whether to take part in some of these activities again, what really should be your comfort level?

“We’re all getting anxious. I know I am. I would like to go do some things,” said Gerald Audette, associate dean in the Faculty of Science at York University. “We’ve got a good handle on this, but we haven’t got it completely licked yet.

“We’re at that point where, yeah, if we’re intelligent about this, you can do some things. However, you’ve got to be aware.”

The Star surveyed five university health professionals to get their take on just how comfortable they’d feel doing formerly mundane activities.

The questions were open-ended. Their answers — on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating a level of risk that made the expert extremely uncomfortable — are not recommendations, more generalizations to get people to think. It’s a conversation, not a scientific survey.

If there was a consensus, it was that outdoor activities where social distancing is easier are far less risky than prolonged indoor activities with other people.

“Indoors is always going to be much, much less safe,” said Colin Furness, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information. “Length of exposure and closeness, those are the major risks.”

And activities where you know and trust the other participants are much less risky than with strangers involved.

“We should be doing bubbling,” said Furness. “If you just hung out with people you trusted, you’d be way less at risk.”

From hiking to attending an indoor party, here’s the list:

Going hiking — rated from 0 to 2

As a group, our experts were most comfortable with hiking — so long as it wasn’t hiking in a pack. “If it’s pretty isolated and you’re just bumping into a couple of people, probably a 1,” said Thomas Tenkate, an expert in health risk assessment at the School of Occupational and Public Health at Ryerson University. “But if it’s more crowded, and every minute you’re bumping into someone, that’s ramping it up to a 6.”

Going for a bike ride — rated from 0 to 3

After hiking, our experts were most comfortable with going for a bike ride. “When you’re on a bike, you can’t get too close to people, so I think it’s pretty safe,” said Tenkate.

“If you’re by yourself, it’s a 0,” said Timothy Sly, an expert in influenza pandemics at Ryerson’s School of Occupational and Public Health.

Playing golf or tennis — rated from 0 to 2

Golf these days involve individual carts and not touching the flag. Both sports lend themselves well to social distancing. “If you’re stuck in the clubhouse with a bunch of other people who are angry about losing golf balls, well, that might be a little different,” said Audette, who gave a 0 rating. “But you can effectively socially distance even in a party of four.”

“They’re both activities where you have a bit more control over social distancing,” said Tenkate, one of three experts to give a 2. “If you’re like me, you’re pretty isolated because you’re looking for the ball all the time.”

Going camping — rated from 0 to 4

A family trip to a provincial park seems an acceptable risk. “You can stay on your own little campsite, but it depends on what the kids are doing and how they’re mixing,” said Anna Banerji, director of Global and Indigenous Health in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

“You’re reasonably isolated when you’re camping anyway,” said Tenkate. “Apart from, I suppose, the use of public facilities.”

Said Sly, who gave a 4: “If you go with 16 other people and a huge case of beer, it’s very different.”

Visiting the dog park — rated from 1 to 5

Another relatively low-risk outdoor activity where the dog walker has social-distancing control — although the dogs may change that equation. “People like to be a little bit social when they’re there,” said Tenkate, who gave the lone 5. “Some dogs are more social, too.”

Going inside a library or museum — rated from 1.5 to 4

These activities got good marks for COVID-19 comfort, despite being indoors, because the experts believed the managers of libraries and museums would take proper care of their patrons. “In these sorts of activities people tend not to be all over each other,” said Sly. “They tend to keep separate.”

Added Audette: “You can limit access.”

Going to the beach — rated from 1 to 5

The outdoors and the idea of relatively easy spacing got the experts to skew toward comfort. “I’m thinking about what you’re doing and how much you can control in regard to your interactions with other people,” said Tenkate. “I think you can control your interactions a little bit easier at the beach, versus in a public swimming pool.”

Going to the dentist — rated from 1 to 6

Even though it’s indoors — and it got our first rating on the top half of the scale, a 6 from Sly — the experts were largely comfortable that those involved with dentistry are health professionals who take sanitary practices seriously and have proper personal protective equipment. “Dentists will be really hardcore about this,” said Furness. “There’s going to be masks, and there’s going to be PPE.”

A backyard BBQ with friends — rated from 1.5 to 5

Being outdoors, choosing the people to invite and being in control of their surroundings led to relatively high comfort. “As long as I know the friends I’m having over, and we’ve understood about how we’re social distancing, and we’re all aware of where we’ve been and what we’re doing, I’m fine with that,” said Audette.

Playing road hockey — rated from 2 to 5.5

Not quite as in-your-face physical as basketball, not quite as socially distant as golf or tennis. “I would be asking the people I was playing with what’s going on, how are you guys feeling,” said Audette. “If we’re all comfortable with each other and we’ve all been quote-unquote good people, I would be OK.”

Going to a hair salon, barber or nail salon — rated from 3 to 8

One high-end response, an 8 from Furness, but overall one of few indoor activities the health experts were comfortable with because they trust the barbers and salons to be professional when it comes to hygiene and protecting their customers. The workers, after all, run more risk than their customers.

“The ones I’ve seen have been practising (safe habits) as much as they can,” said Sly. “Nobody in the waiting room, one customer at a time. It can be done.”

Working in an office — rated from 1 to 7.5

A wide range of answers.

Audette, who offered a 1, said he’d be comfortable in his office, where he can close the door.

“It depends if you have to use an elevator and it’s a big tower,” said Furness, who offered a 7.

“You can actually give people space nicely, working away in the computer and desks,” said Sly, who gave a 4. “But it’s the pinch points when you get to the office, the elevator, the elevator button, the handrails, the subway getting there, the lunchroom.”

Walking in a crowd on Queens Quay or the boardwalk — rated from 1 to 8

Another wide range, with experts torn between the benefit of being outside and the whole idea of being in a crowd.

“If it’s a moderate crowd where I can actively socially distance myself, I’m fine with that,” said Audette, who gave it a 1.

“Just a sea of bugs,” said Tenkate, who gave it a 7.5.

Going to the gym — rated from 2.5 to 7

Our first activity to get an average rating worse than 5, but the experts held vastly different opinions. Furness gave it a 7, worried about “sweaty machines” and the ability to distance in locker rooms. Audette’s 2.5 reflected a belief that gyms would adequately enforce social distancing and clean machines. “People going to the gym is a much more adult audience, so they’re all going to be much more aware,” said Audette.

None of the experts were high on the idea of group workouts, however. “Doing a Zumba class would be disastrous,” said Sly.

Eating and drinking on a restaurant patio — rated from 3 to 9

The crowds are risky, but being outside helps with the comfort zone. Being able to socially distance, as well. “The one thing I would worry about at that point is the serving staff,” said Audette. “Mainly because there’s going to be interacting with multiple people.”

Playing basketball outside — rated from 3 to 8

A three-on-three schoolyard game is problematic, the experts say, because it would involve a lot of contact and maybe strangers joining in. “You’re going to get a lot of contact. I’d have to know who I was playing with,” said Audette.

“You’re getting sweat and viruses and bacteria all over you,” said Sly.

Going to an outdoor public pool — rated from 3 to 9.5

Summer is approaching, and so are sunny days when lots of people might want to cool off. At 9.5, Banerji was least comfortable. “So many people around. You can’t control kids,” she said.

Furness gave an outdoor crowded pool scenario a 3, but said it would go much higher on an indoor pool.

Sitting in a doctor’s waiting room — rated from 1.5 to 9

The idea of being in one with other patients didn’t sit well with most (Audette gave the lowest rating of 1.5). Doctors would be wise, they said, to limit numbers.

“It always was a problem,” said Sly. “You go there with an ingrown toenail and you come out with a throat infection. If there was only one person in it, there’s no problem at all. If it’s a normal waiting room with lots of people waiting — which I don’t think is happening these days — people are going be there anyway because they’ve got something quite wrong with them.”

Visiting elderly relatives — rated from 3 to 9

A nursing home visit caused a lot of consternation since the elderly have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19. For that, the experts preach extreme caution. They wouldn’t want to inadvertently introduce the virus, which can happen even from asymptomatic and presymptomatic patients.

“If you think about the broader scope of things, what is isolation for people doing versus disease transmission risk? If it’s done with good consideration for prevention measures, then it’s not no-risk but it’s lower-risk,” said Tenkate.

Visiting healthy elderly parents in their homes was less concerning, they agreed.

Eating at a buffet — rated from 5 to 8

This gave the experts the shivers. They acknowledged restaurants could be trusted to adhere to social distancing rules, but were deterred at the thought of lines at the food bar and sharing serving utensils. “It depends how crowded as it is, but I certainly wouldn’t do it,” said Furness, who gave it a 6.

“I’m not comfortable with doing that at the moment,” said Tenkate, who offered a 7.5.

Getting on an airplane — rated from 5 to 9

Airlines and airports are pushing the narrative they have safety figured out. The experts were less sure, even with empty seats. “It’s not just the plane, but it’s the whole process of having to line up. At various points in the whole process you end up having to be close to people,” said Tenkate.

“I would wear a mask, I would be social distancing where I can, I would be very aware of what was going on. I would be vigilant,” said Audette.

“I’d still be nervous,” said Sly.

Letting your kids sleep over at a friend’s place — rated from 4 to 8

Even going over scenarios where the number of children was limited to two and with both families trusting each other, there was still reluctance. “If it was one kid and a family that you knew, and they were completely virus-free, you never can tell. I’d be more cautious,” said Audette.

“We’re not doing it, and I don’t think we would want to,” said Tenkate.

Eating and drinking inside a restaurant — rated from 5 to 10

The same activity as on a patio, but the indoors changes everything. Sly gave it a no-go 10 (this was the only activity to get a maximum rating). “Bars are a problem and will be for a long time,” he said. “People get a little back-slappy.”

Going to the theatre — rated from 6 to 8

Live theatre with a lot of clapping might be slightly worse than, say, a movie theatre. Either way, being indoors and side-by-side with strangers left the experts with a great deal of discomfort. “Getting a complete six-foot circle around everybody is going to be a bigger challenge,” said Audette.

“That’s what worries me,” said Sly.

Going to places of worship — rated from 5 to 9

The idea of strangers sitting beside each other indoors for an hour or so left our experts unanimous in their discomfort. “Shoulder to shoulder and singing? That’s going to be a 9,” said Furness.

Riding the subway — rated from 5 to 9

Be careful on the TTC, was the message from the experts. If the train is empty and you’re wearing a mask and have hand sanitizer at the ready, then it might be a 3, said Sly, “but if distancing is completely breached and you are in the breathing zones of dozens of people for up to 40 minutes” then it’s much higher. (Sly gave a final rating of 9.)

“Even though the TTC is asking people to wear masks and has blocked off some seating, there can still be crowding on the platform and in the subway cars. This means that it is still difficult to maintain the recommended social distance,” said Tenkate.

Taking the ferry to the Islands — rated from 5.5 to 8

Not that it’s possible, yet. Being outdoors on the Islands — either the beach or going for a walk or bike ride — seems fine. The ferry, however, offers an uncomfortable pinch point.

Tenkate: “I’ve been on the ferry and it’s pretty crowded. It’s hot, and everyone’s sweaty and so it’s probably not (for me) unless they put in a bit more distancing.”

Audette: “Once you’re on Centre Island you can social distance, of course, but getting there is a challenge.”

Going to a wedding — rated from 6 to 8

Indoors, crowds, lots of social contact and drinking. “At events like this, you might not be able to socially distance as well as you would like,” said Audette.

“Lots of people drinking, who at the best (of times) don’t observe boundaries,” said Banerji.

Going to a child’s birthday party — rated from 5 to 9

Like a wedding, but swap in hyper preteens for the drunk adults. Most experts didn’t like what they saw, and this activity got the worst rating on average. Banerji gave it a 9, because “there’s a whole bunch of people.”

Audette was the most optimistic, coming in at a milder 5, “mainly because a lot of people will try to do that social distancing, which is really what you need to be doing in a situation like this.” But he acknowledged “once you’ve got a sniffle, you’ve got problems.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw my toddler pick up a glass beer bottle shard a few steps in front of me at our new parking lot playground and my heart stopped.

Toddlers are curious beings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for me and my wife to teach ours not to touch everything she comes across. The elevator and automatic door buttons in our building are off limits now, as are the rocks right outside the entrance.

I wish I could hold her hand during all of our outings and never let go, but letting her roam around outside a little bit gives her some highly desired independence away from our cramped Toronto apartment. That’s why the empty parking lot behind an abandoned Joe Fresh and away from the busy sidewalks of the city seemed like the perfect playground.

My little one smiled ear to ear as she ran from one side of the vacant lot to the other, shouting out the numbers painted on assigned parking spaces and singing “wiggle, wiggle, wiggle” as she danced in front of the mirrored double doors of the musty building.

I felt relieved we could add it to our collection of safe places to play near our west-end Toronto apartment, along with an area near our friendly neighbourhood caution-taped playground and the spacious grassy area by the waterfront. The feeling was quickly undone as we were leaving and she picked up a shard of glass left behind from a broken beer bottle.

She held it for maybe a second before I leapt forward and safely removed it from her palm, inspected her skin, then cleaned it with an antibacterial wipe. As I put the wipes back into my bag, she took a few steps forward and picked up a cigarette butt — one of the most littered items in Toronto. I cursed under my breath and we repeated the sanitizing process.

It was upsetting because I had brought my daughter to this parking lot after feeling so desperate to give her a change of scenery. Going to the same couple of outdoor spaces every single day felt dull. In retrospect, I realize she doesn’t care where we go to play, as long as Dada is there to play with her.

This was supposed to be the summer of new experiences for us and many families with young kids. We were looking forward to a trip to Wonderland for her second birthday, her first swimming lessons and family barbecues now that she can keep up with her older cousins.

All of that may be lost, but I now realize the parking lot incident could have happened anywhere — and we still have the opportunity to make this a special, once-in-a-lifetime kind of summer.

“It’s going to be a different kind of summer, and that is going to be very difficult in some ways because it’s so much pressure on parents. But this summer provides different kinds of opportunities,” said Dr. Nikki Martyn, the program head of early childhood studies at the University of Guelph Humber.

“I think what’s important for parents to remember is that children don’t need fancy or fantastic experiences. What children need is what all humans need. We’re social animals, and all we need is love.”

With the official arrival of summer and child care mostly unavailable for preschoolers, parents are finding new ways to keep the kids entertained as indoor facilities remain mostly closed and there are varying levels of accessible outdoor space for everyone.

Lichia Liu has been using the outdoors to try and fill the void left by the cancellation of her 2-and-a-half-year-old’s gymnastics classes.

“We look for new ravines to walk our dog and kid. She’s been really missing her gymnastics classes so we look for natural balance beams like fallen tree logs and rocks,” Liu said. “We love the Beechwood trails. Last week we went and found the rainbow tunnel that you can see from the highway.”

Sophie Beaumier De Santana brings her two boys, Kylan, 3, and Mateo, 19 months, to their neighbourhood park in North Etobicoke with a bag of snacks, bubbles, kites, chalk and a soccer ball. While Mateo likes to stay close and pick dandelions for mama and papa, Kylan will usually go “creature searching.”

“He will come back with a worm, which he calls a snake, and empty snail shells. Yesterday he found 20 of them,” De Santana said.

While parents may feel pressure to get their kids outside every day and to replace all the activities and excitement that field trips or attractions like the CNE have to offer, Martyn stressed that it’s not about what we do with our kids — it’s about the feeling we create.

“A child who feels love and prioritized and cared for, and is heard and understood, that will exist within them for their whole life,” she said. “Just do the best you can, and the best you can do is to be there and love your kids.”

Martyn said creating science experiments, exploring the natural world and learning how things work are ways to provide meaningful experiences. When asked on social media, many parents were excited to share their own versions of spending quality family time these days.

Ginette Reynolds and her family have turned to geocaching, where they use a free app to join a worldwide treasure hunt that recently led them to a beautiful streetscape on Lansdowne Avenue. Window decorating and leaving painted rocks in parks and on trails for others to find has become a trend across the province.

Hayley Perryman, who works for a non-profit organization that provides therapy to children living with autism, suggests creating an obstacle course using things you find in your backyard. “Get your little ninjas to jump, roll or crawl through the obstacles for some high energy, low-budget fun.”

Tiffany Tsui, a speech-language pathologist working with children in York Region, said scavenger hunts on walks can be tweaked where you focus on different themes for learning basic linguistic concepts for early language learners. Find something tall and short, big and small, bumpy and smooth. Other themes can include looking for shapes, colours or letters on signs.

Natalie Cox, a mother of four whose youngest is 14-years-old now, remembers summer days where she used to sit back in a lawn chair and watch her little ones race up and down the sidewalk to see how fast they can go — a great way for kids to burn energy while the caregiver doesn’t have to.

Beyond the major city parks and the hidden gems in your neighbourhood, there is plenty of outdoor space ready for the taking.

“City living worked for us because the attractions and parks were our backyard. Once that was no longer there, we had to be creative in how we kept ourselves entertained,” said Yashy Murphy, a downtown Toronto family lifestyle blogger and travel writer who also has two kids. Her blog advises parents to grab some bubbles, scooters and bikes and head to places like Rosedale Ravine, Tommy Thompson Park area, Corktown Common, Allen Gardens and the Bentway.

Shari Porter suggested the R.C water treatment plant in southwest Scarborough, which is right on the water and has lots of space to run around, including a small beach at the bottom of the property.

No matter where we take our kids this summer, Martyn emphasized the important thing is that we spend time with our children.

“You don’t have to get out every day. You have to do what’s right for you and, most importantly, your kid,” Martyn said. “What they’re going to remember is how good it felt to be with you.”

My daughter said “pine cone” in her sleep the other night, hours after she collected 70 of them at the park and neatly lined them up on a ledge.

Whether we’re having a lazy day at home, stacking up pine cones or running in an empty parking lot, the summer won’t be perfect, but it sure will be one to remember.

Additional list of fun and accessible activities submitted by caregivers:

Decorate the windows with finger paint

Fly a kite, you can even make your own

Count how many random objects you can find (Trees with red leaves, dandelions, butterflies, birds nests)

Themed scavenger hunts focusing on basic linguistic concepts (Find something tall/short, big/small, hot/cold, many/few, bumpy/smooth; find things of different shapes, colours or letters on signs)

Roll dice or pull pictures of animals out of a hat and move like that animal (Leap like a frog, bear crawl, penguin walk)

Simple crafts such as making crowns and animal faces

Paint rocks and leave them in a park or trail for another family to find

Sidewalk chalk, DIY sidewalk paint and hop scotch

Car wash using a tub or large container, animals, cars, baby dolls with some shaving cream and dish soap

Water play using cups, funnels, ladles, turkey basters

Freeze water in different shaped containers, hide some toys and letters in ice cubes and use kitchen utensils to scoop them out

Create an obstacle course with sticks and dandelions or whatever else you find for kids to jump, roll or crawl over, depending on the age

Sidewalk spray: Crush up chalk and mix it with warm water so it dissolves, or mix corn starch, water and food colouring and then spray-paint the driveway or sidewalk

Outdoor freeze dance (Missy Elliott yields great results)

Nature paint brushes: send your child to find materials that are textured such as pine cones, leaves and rocks; dip those into paint and press them onto the paper or tie leaves to sticks to make paint brushes.

A slightly deflated beach ball is a great toy for kids to walk around with and is also easily compressible

Bird watch bingo: Have a card with pictures and names of birds, and go searching for them

Read', 'Jenna Moonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Jenna Moon Is A Breaking News Reporter For The Star', 'Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-17,"Editor’s note: The Star is taking a broad look at what entering the second phase of reopening after COVID-19 lockdowns will mean for Ontario. Every day, we’ll try to answer a different question about post-lockdown life. You can read a recap of all of the questions we’ve answered here.

Heading into stage two of reopening means that more people are heading back to work or leaving their homes for errands more often.

If you’re new at buying masks, figuring out what works best for you might seem difficult.

Households consisting of more than one person should consider having masks for each separate family member to avoid the possibility of cross-contamination.

“The recommendation is really try to have your own masks just to avoid the chance of accidentally picking up someone else’s in case it’s not clean,” said Monika Dutt, a public health physician based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.

Colour coded masks that relate to each member of the household might be a clear way to differentiate between which mask belongs to each person, she said.

The number of masks a person owns is going to be largely dependent on their lifestyle and how often one might be using a mask, Dutt explained.

“If you only go out once a week for grocery shopping …versus somebody who’s going out often, I think you need to kind of look at what your days are like and how often you’re going to be using them and washing them if needed, and then decide (the number of masks that) works best for you,” she said.

If you’re just starting your hunt for a non-medical face mask, Dutt recommends looking for something made of at least two layers of tightly woven cloth — something that is also outlined by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Most commonly, this can be either cotton or linen, according to the PHAC guidelines.

While throwing fabric masks in with a load of laundry is a great way to keep them clean, it might not always line up with washing schedules. In these cases, Dutt said, hand-washing the masks in hot, soapy water will disinfect them between uses.

Your mask should still hold its shape after washing. If you start finding holes or tears, it’s time to retire the mask, Dutt said.

“If (the mask) looks like it’s getting really stretched, that might be a time to change it. But in general, just kind of make sure that there’s no tears, no holes, and you have those two pieces of cloth … layers. And that should be sufficient.”

Dutt suggests taking a mask with you every time you leave the house, even if you’re not planning on going into closed or busy spaces.

“It’s just good to have them with you. So even if you’re not wearing it because you’re in an open space and it’s not something that’s needed at that time, it can happen that you end up in a place where people close by and you might want to have (the mask),” she said, noting that this also means you’re prepared to enter stores or restaurants that require masks.

“I think it’s the kind of thing now that’s just good to always have with you.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Nicole Thompsonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Nicole Thompsonthe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-07-09,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford vowed Wednesday to make air conditioning mandatory in the province's long-term care homes, though critics say any change will come too late for many residents already suffering in the stifling heat.

Ford's announcement came the same day that opposition leaders called for concrete action from Ford, and a day after the premier criticized homes without air conditioning.

""We're going to move forward with this. We're going to move forward rapidly,"" Ford told a news conference Wednesday. ""I can't imagine sitting there in 27-, 28-degree heat in a room. It's just unacceptable.""

Ford said he and Long-Term Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton are already looking at how the relevant legislation can be changed, and exploring the option of providing money to make it possible. But Ford stopped short of providing an exact timeline for when the government would make those changes.

All three opposition parties said they would support such a bill.

As it stands, the province's Long-Term Care Act does not mandate air conditioning, but says homes without it must have a ""cooling plan"" in place.

A spokeswoman for Fullerton said the government was looking at the ""best path forward to get air conditioning into homes that do not have it.""

The Long-Term Care Association, an industry group, said its members follow all provincial legislation, and it hopes the province will offer funding to retrofit facilities without air conditioning — or rebuild them, if necessary.

Wednesday's announcement offered no comfort to Jeanette Abrahams, whose 90-year-old mother has lived at Midland Gardens Care Community in east Toronto since early March, following the death of her husband.

""Without a timeline, it's just hot air coming out of his mouth,"" Abrahams said of Ford's announcement.

Midland Gardens does not have air conditioning, Abrahams said, and the already-difficult conditions have been worsened by a recent heat wave.

Abrahams said her mother contracted COVID-19 a few months after moving in to the long-term care home, becoming one of 89 residents and 48 staff members diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.

She's since recovered, Abrahams said, but was left with damaged lungs and is now on oxygen therapy.

""She always looks very sweaty and listless,"" Abrahams said. ""We were told that the weakness and the listlessness is because of having had COVID-19, but it's also because of the horrendous heat that they are living in.""

A spokeswoman for Sienna Living, which operates the facility where Abrahams' mother lives, said the company purchased 10 additional air conditioning units for Midland Gardens, adding to some that were purchased last year.

She said they would be installed throughout the residence on Thursday, based on temperature readings. She said the company had also brought out all of the fans and implemented measures such as closing curtains in a bid to mitigate the heat.

Abrahams said the promise to mandate air conditioning in long-term care homes is a good thing, but is ultimately unlikely to come into effect soon enough to help her mom.

Glen Kenny, a University of Ottawa physiology professor, has studied how the body responds to heat over time and said the situation is particularly dire for the elderly.

""As we age there's deterioration in how the body can actually lose heat,"" he said, noting that when older people are exposed to temperatures up to 40 C, they store that heat rather than shedding it.

He said heat can exacerbate underlying conditions and can affect blood pressure, making people more likely to fall over — which is particularly dangerous for seniors.

That's why it's so important that long-term care homes have appropriate temperature controls, said Jane Meadus, a lawyer and institutional advocate with the Toronto-based Advocacy Centre for the Elderly.

But she's concerned that the changes won't happen fast enough.

""Some of the older homes, I don't believe are going to be able to be retrofitted for air conditioning,"" she said.

In those cases, the facilities would have to be totally rebuilt.

""That's a lengthy process,"" Meadus said. ""It's not happening very quickly.""

Read', 'Wanyee Livancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'With Files Robert Benzie', 'Wanyee Li Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-08,"It’s 30 C. Wendy Cooper-Parkinson’s 89-year-old mother is wearing a black, heavy-knit sweater at the long-term-care home where she lives.

She has trouble breathing even on the best of days and there is no air-conditioning in her room, no fan.

With the help of a support worker, Cooper-Parkinson checks on her mother in a video call.

“Looks pretty hot to be wearing a sweater … we gotta get that fixed for sure,” says Cooper-Parkinson. Her mother has advanced dementia and doesn’t respond.

Cooper-Parkinson knows from visits in previous years that her mother’s room can become stiflingly hot in the summer.

Ontario advocates worry that seniors already preyed upon by COVID-19 will continue dying — not from COVID but from the heat — unless the government mandates air-conditioning in residents’ rooms.

Temperatures in Toronto have soared to the 30s in the last couple of weeks.

Extendicare isn’t providing even fans for residents, Cooper-Parkinson said. She says she was told by staff that families can bring portable fans for their loved ones’ rooms, where residents now spend almost all their time due to infection-control protocols.

“They should be providing something,” Cooper-Parkinson told the Star. “You would think that after all of this … I mean, it’s heartbreaking.”

Extendicare sent the Star a written statement Tuesday afternoon, clarifying that residents in all Extendicare homes should have access to air-conditioned “cooling stations” or have portable fans in their rooms, and that Extendicare would follow up with the Guildwood home.

“For residents who cannot leave their rooms for medical reasons, we ensure they are provided with increased fluids, loosened clothing, portable fans, and we remove excess bedding,” said spokesperson Rebecca Scott Rawn.

“We did see in your coverage that these policies may not have been followed in one instance and we are currently following up with the home.”

Rawn said Extendicare has been advocating for infrastructure upgrades of long-term-care homes for more than a decade.

Extendicare Guildwood is one of Ontario’s care homes worst hit by COVID-19. By May, a quarter of the residents had died from the virus and more than half had tested positive. But Guildwood is far from the only care home that doesn’t have air-conditioning in residents’ rooms.

Premier Doug Ford, saying he didn’t know some homes lack ways to keep residents cool during heat waves, pointed the finger at long-term care operators in a news conference Monday.

“I’d like to give these owners who don’t put air-conditioning on the short list to stick them in the room for 24 hours in 30 degrees heat. See how they like it, to put their parents in there.”

Ford said he would consider making air-conditioning mandatory in homes.

In a written statement Tuesday, NDP opposition leader Andrea Horwath said her party had raised the issue before.

“It’s shameful that the Liberal government had 15 years and, time and time again, refused to set minimum cooling and other standards in long-term care when the NDP raised this issue,” the statement read.

“And it’s shameful for Doug Ford to now claim he didn’t know that seniors living in these homes are suffering without air-conditioning after the NDP brought it to his attention in the legislature two years ago.”

AdvantAge Ontario, which represents 200 non-profit and municipal long-term-care homes in the province, acknowledged the lack of air-conditioning is a long-standing issue.

CEO Lisa Levin did not have exact numbers to share but said “many” homes don’t have air-conditioning.

“A lot of the older homes do not have central air-conditioning. Even the newer homes don’t have to have it. It’s not part of the design requirements.”

Some care homes have installed air-conditioning and multiple thermostats on every floor.

For instance, the Salvation Army’s Grace Manor in Ottawa has air-conditioning in residents’ rooms and its Meighen Manor in Toronto has a dual air-control system in which conditioned air from common areas is blown into residents’ rooms. There is one thermostat for every five rooms at Meighen Manor, said Major Rob Kerr, a spokesperson for the charity.

But for the many homes that don’t have sufficient cooling, Levin believes the province needs to start planning to evacuate residents.

“It’s shocking that we’ve allowed our system of long-term care to be built up in this way that you have frail, vulnerable seniors — even if there wasn’t any COVID — who would be in buildings without air-conditioning.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has only made the situation more dangerous for residents in homes without air-conditioning, said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge, a seniors advocacy organization. Some care homes have air-conditioning in common rooms where residents could previously spend most of their days to stay cool, but the pandemic — and the infection control protocols that came with it — changed all that.

“We knew this was coming. We were talking about it months ago because the summer comes and the heat waves hit, and often older people are more susceptible to heat-based illnesses.”

Tamblyn Watts said the Ontario government needs to make air-conditioning mandatory in all long-term care homes — and specifically in residents’ rooms, not just common areas. Otherwise more residents will die, she said.

“I think we will see people die from the heat in combination with the COVID restrictions. That would be a tragedy upon a tragedy and easily preventable.”

Cooper-Parkinson’s mother is deteriorating quickly. Some days, she is unresponsive.

“My mom can’t even hold her head up in the wheelchair. Her head is back, her eyes are closed,” she said.

In yesterday’s FaceTime video, Cooper-Parkinson sang her mother’s favourite song.

“You’ll never know dear how much I love you. Please don’t take my sunshine away. Hi mom, are you going to sing it with me?”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Stephanie Marinthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Marinthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-07-05,"MONTREAL—George Chabo was just a teenager when the Syrian refugee arrived in Montreal in the winter of 2016, met first by Canadian Red Cross volunteers who supplied him and his family with boots and winter jackets to brave the Quebec cold.

Chabo never forgot that initial encounter and now he’s determined to give back to the humanitarian organization and the province that welcomed and helped his family.

Recently, Chabo, 21, sat attentively in a classroom — a converted hotel room where the Red Cross has been training people to do humanitarian work in long-term care homes as support aides and other tasks.

These aides are being trained to replace Canadian Armed Forces personnel, most of whom have recently left the homes.

The Red Cross is training up to 900 people to fill a variety of tasks while Quebec completes training for more than 10,000 people to work full-time as orderlies by mid-September in long-term care homes.

People like Chabo will be pressed into service in the coming weeks to fill that void and give workers some reprieve after a difficult spring on COVID-19’s front lines.

Chabo is a student, but instead of taking the summer off, he raised his hand to help the most vulnerable.

During a break last week during his intensive training session where he’s learning to take care of the elderly, Chabo explained why he answered the call.

“We went through difficult situations in our country, in Syria, we know what crises are,” Chabo said. “We understand, we have empathy.”

He wants to help those most vulnerable during a pandemic.

“It’s a difficult moment for us, but especially for them,” said the soft-spoken Chabo.

He’s convinced the job will be a good experience.

“The elderly have a great life experience ... they have a lot to talk about,” said Chabo, no stranger to helping out as his own family takes care of his paternal grandparents.

“It is enriching to help them.”

He hasn’t forgotten the impression the Canadian Red Cross made during his arrival to Canada.

He first came to know the organization in Syria, ravaged by war since 2011.

It was also the Red Cross that helped his family in Lebanon, providing the medical exams needed ahead of their arrival in Canada in February 2016.

Chabo was just 17 when representatives provided them with the winter clothes and helped to fill out their immigration documents. His family — his parents, sister and brother — were sponsored by Quebecers.

So when Chabo caught word of the recruitment drive, he jumped at the opportunity.

He wasn’t even in need of work — he already had a job. But he was determined to give back.

“In exchange, I feel it’s a good idea to help the community like this,” he said. “I want to give back to society for its warm welcome.”

Speaking last week, Chabo said he wasn’t worried about contracting COVID-19 in long-term care residences.

The coronavirus has hit Quebec the hardest of all provinces, with long-term care homes and seniors’ homes accounting for more than 80 per cent of deaths.

But the situation has stabilized somewhat since the spring, he said. And Chabo is confident the measures in place and his Red Cross training will keep him safe.

The first group of trainees — about 150 people — are scheduled to start working Monday in a variety of long-term care residences.

The rest are expected to be deployed by July 29.

Read', 'Moira Welshstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Moira Welsh Is An Investigative Reporter Based In Toronto.']",2020-06-28,"A fashionista nursing-home resident who once revelled in jewelry and luxury fabric now sits and stares out the window, her face blank.

A nurse weeps because a resident’s pressure ulcer is growing deeper as staff, working through the pandemic, struggle to give the proper time-consuming care.

A man refuses to eat after weeks in isolation, away from bustling dining room meals.

These are stories behind the data released by Peel Region’s Sheridan Villa, numbers tallied during the lockdown that show seniors isolated by COVID-19 restrictions are increasingly depressed, and suffering from falls, unexpected weight loss and pressure ulcers.

The monthly reporting of long-term care “indicators,” sent to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), do not show extreme declines, but Sheridan managers say their data is trending in a negative direction, exposing the simple fact that people need each other.

Ontario’s COVID-19 restrictions — with strong limits on physical contact — blocked interactions between residents, families and staff, said Sylvonne Milligan, Sheridan’s specialist in the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) data collection tool. All nursing homes use the government-mandated tool. Sheridan released its internal data to the Star, saying it proves change is needed or residents will continue to decline.

“I’d like to think that our folks are more used to us being around, doing things with them,” Milligan said of the relationship between Sheridan residents and staff. “Now, you can’t even hold someone’s hand without a glove. I think that’s a really big piece of (the decline). As human beings, we crave connection.”

The pandemic has created an awakening about seniors’ care, with a focus on the importance of emotional connections. It also inspired leaders within the industry to speak openly about the need for emotion-focused care, placing individual fulfilment above the traditional system of schedules and tasks.

Sheridan Villa, the municipally operated nursing home in Mississauga, already uses programs that focus on residents’ emotions and personal interests. Its staff met last week to discuss ways to improve care under COVID restrictions in case a second wave of the virus arrives.

“We can’t put our residents through this again,” one nurse said.

In February, the month before the lockdown, 12.5 per cent of Sheridan Villa’s 142 residents had experienced a “worsened depressive mood.” That number increased to 15 per cent in March, 15.7 per cent in April and 17.5 per cent in May. The most recent provincial average for depression was 22.3 per cent, according to Sheridan documents.

During the lockdown in March, April and May, Sheridan had slight increases in the number of residents with unexpected weight loss, pressure ulcers and falls. Those changes may look minimal on a spreadsheet, but staff say they know the people behind the data, calling the increase of a percentage point or two deeply personal.

Data for so-called “behaviours” noted a 6.4 per cent increase from February (when it was at 8.6 per cent) to 15 per cent in May. The most recent provincial average for “behaviours” was 12.6 per cent, according to Sheridan. Behaviours is a traditional nursing-home term used to describe people, mostly with dementia, who walk constantly, shout or sometimes act aggressively. Advocates say these are reactions to a life that is sterile.

Milligan said the behavioural changes are likely the result of resident confusion after provincial rules required isolation in rooms. She said many, particularly those with cognitive decline, are feeling rejected because they can no longer hug staff or hold hands.

They are also feeling a profound sense of abandonment because many do not understand why their families no longer visit, she said.

The Ontario government banned family visits in mid-March when the virus began its surge through homes.

On June 18, the Ministry of Long-Term Care began allowing one family member one outdoor visit each week. Unlike staff, who do not need regular COVID testing, families must test negative for COVID every two weeks. The demand for swabbing is onerous, particularly for fragile older spouses.

It took a deadly virus, but the long-term care industry is starting to understand the need for transformation that elevates emotion-focused care, said Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge, a seniors’ advocacy group.

“Social isolation syndrome, as we are calling it, is a combination of low mood, loss of physical mobility and a loss of connection with people,” Watts said. “We’ve seen it in Canada and around the world.

“Having homes share the impact of isolation really brings to light how important it is to move to emotion-focused care in long-term care homes in Canada,” Watts added. “Only through tracking things like mood, things like social connection, can we take care of the whole person, not just their physical well-being.”

There’s a new willingness in the industry to explore the programs and approaches that offer seniors vibrant lives, she said, not just medical care and meals.

“What we are seeing now is associations and industry in long-term care are really understanding the importance of this model in a new way.”

In traditional homes, where the task-focused system rules, isolation is pervasive. If there is a chance for real change, industry insiders say the government must ensure that homes provide individualized care that offers purpose and activities that connect with each person — not the typical activities, like sitting in a circle tossing balls to each other.

“I look at long-term care as being a pyramid and at the top of it is the resident,” said Chris Brockington, a 20-year consultant in the nursing and retirement home industry.

“With every decision, it has to be framed with, ‘Will this be good for the resident?’ Staff has to say, ‘If I’m in their shoes, is this something I would like for my mother or father?’ It’s the simple understanding of, how do we build a culture that cares?

“To me that is the starting point. I think we can get on that really, really quick. Maybe we need to start thinking of (residents) as the customer. They are paying for the service. What do they get for it? Do they deserve to be awakened at 7 o’clock when they really don’t want to be awakened at 7 a.m.?”

Brockington consults with for-profit and not-for-profit homes along with service providers such as pharmaceutical or medical device companies. After the public outrage over flaws exposed by the pandemic, he believes many operators are willing to change the old culture that put the needs of residents behind efficiencies and scheduling.

“They are going to be open to anything right now because they know the onslaught that is coming toward them,” he said. “Culture in long-term care for the most part is not great. We do need to move it away from, say, an ivory-tower approach of ‘We know best for your home.’”

Ask Doris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario about Premier Doug Ford’s promise for transformation and she’ll say there’s a good chance he’ll bring legitimate change.

“I believe the premier takes this to heart,” Grinspun said. “And this is indeed a matter that we need to solve with heart, not only with the numbers, the budget. And we need to put the budget where the heart is.”

Grinspun is pushing the government to commit to a minimum of four hours of direct nursing and personal care for each resident, each day. Currently, the RNAO says the average resident gets roughly 2.7 hours of direct daily care.

The estimated cost of the additional staffing, a mix of registered nurses, registered practical nurses and personal support workers, is $1.75 billion, according to RNAO reports. In its June 2020 report on staffing, the RNAO said the additional cost to bring staffing up to a new standard is “truly an investment, not an expenditure, as it will save us from enormous costs in the future.” It also said the cost “is not large relative to the $63.8 billion health budget.”

The pandemic exposed the staffing shortage in long-term care although the problems have existed for years, with residents sitting in filthy briefs, going hungry or left alone for hours. It was the report written by the Canadian Armed Forces, whose staff worked in homes with the most COVID infections, that got Ford’s attention.

Grinspun wants the government to commit to the staffing formula, saying it would help residents get the time and individual attention they need. She doesn’t believe the industry’s problems need to be studied again. The upcoming commission into long-term care, promised to begin in July, will produce yet another report, she said. Her staff recently counted 35 long-term care reports in the last 20 years. None led to lasting change.

“Give us a plan,” she said. “Give us a two-year plan. But don’t put this on an election platform.”

The industry has never had the hiring power or the cachet of hospitals even though nursing home residents share the same conditions as acute care hospital patients, said Brockington, the consultant.

“Part of it is, we are not portraying the sector as being a thought leader,” he said.

“We’ve been left behind for so many years in terms of innovation. With innovation, you think of acute care, not long-term care. So, we are playing catch up, for years, trying to bring in new ideas. Because it is slow, the (nursing home) culture is ‘make my life easy.’

“We need to make it a place where our educational system is actually promoting it as innovative, as fair, as doing something that is thought-provoking, that is compassionate.”

Susan Veenstra is a registered nurse who spent two decades in long-term care, working in administrator and director of care roles. She now works as a consultant, often with Brockington’s company, In Initiatives Inc.

Veenstra agrees with the assessment that there’s a culture of fear in many homes, with top-down decisions leaving staff and families afraid to speak up.

“The ones who have done the best are probably with the most open communication,” she said.

The industry is ready for a shakeup, eradicating the old task-focused system and replacing it with individualized care that allows frontline workers and residents to engage, she said. But that won’t happen unless the upcoming commission into long-term care brings in new people with fresh ideas.

“At the end of the day, they don’t need to have the same old, same old, sitting at the table thinking that they are going to make things better if the same people are at the table.

“It’s like the definition of insanity: doing the same thing every time and expecting a different result.”

For Derek Hoare, who left a 32-year career in private and not-for-profit long-term care management to run a restaurant on Prince Edward Island, the instrument of change is always the home’s leader.

“I’ve given this a lot of thought,” Hoare said. “When I look at the homes on the list of the ones that had greater (COVID) fatalities than the other ones, I would hazard a guess that the homes that did better had a much stronger employer-employee relationship and a much more common goal relationship where they worked toward the common good and developed programs for residents collaboratively.

“That is what I’ve seen, and that is what I have found has worked. It is not autocratic leadership but one that has involvement.”

Most long-term care managers don’t call attention to negative outcomes, but Sheridan Villa administrator, Marianne Klein, said the declines in her home’s data, particularly in “worsening mood” category, prove that homes need creative approaches moving forward.

Klein said Sheridan’s emotion-focused program, Meaningful Care Matters (formerly Butterfly) gave staff an edge when, for example, they tried to get a man, declining with COVID, to eat. He had been refusing food and drink.

His registered practical nurse, Darryl Hawtin, knew the man well and remembered that he liked Polish sausage. Hawtin spoke to Sheridan’s dietitian who bought a package of Polish sausages at the grocery store. Culinary staff cooked the meat the next day. The resident ate the sausage and later asked for ice cream. He’s been eating well ever since, Klein said.

“If we know the people we are caring about, if we understand them, what their needs are and what their strengths and limitations are, we are able to provide care that meets their needs,” Klein said.

“If we don’t do that, we treat people like a piece of data and that’s not what this is all about.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reach Her Via Email', 'Leannedelap Hotmail.Com']",2020-07-10,"Celebrities were a harmless, shiny distraction in the Before time, when showing off was still cool.

They were lifestyle deities gorging the Instagram beast on images of their private jets, lavish vacations and endless wardrobes. Then came the pandemic and celebrities in lockdown were suddenly just like us — albeit with more square footage and luxury amenities.

At first, that made the stars feel closer, more relatable. We watched the real-time dissolve of the Vaseline lens through which celebrities have presented themselves and their carefully branded images. We got to peek at their living rooms and visible roots, as sweats and masks became the new OOTD (outfit of the day, of course). Celebrity quarantine couples Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, and Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello seemed to have the paparazzi on speed dial to capture all the mundane coffee-run and dog-walking domesticity. Gigi Hadid’s and Zayn Malik’s lockdown pregnancy reveal qualified as major news, wiping the cringey Gal Gadot “Imagine” video off the radar.

“What happened to the reality stars? Well, every single major star in the world became a reality star,” says Roz Weston, co-host of Global’s “ET Canada” and morning co-host on Kiss 92.5, about the effect of the pandemic on celebrity newsgathering. “People were only used to seeing high-budget stars fake the ‘quote-unquote’ reality.”

The socially distanced celeb interviews Weston has been getting, he says, are “unfiltered, breaking rules that were never meant to be broken. Nobody would ever get to sit ‘alone’ with Sam Smith in his kitchen, talking about his nan. These are fantastic moments with people and I’ve been really shocked at the openness.”

That said, the Zoom cameras are carefully pointed away from the gold faucets, he adds: “Nobody wants you to know how rich they really are.”

Time and belief were suspended at first, in a blur punctuated by snippets of adorableness: Ina Garten posing with a giant martini for breakfast; Stanley Tucci’s viral Negroni tutorials; and fun celebrity moms Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner reading stories to children. Rihanna was in early with major giving through her family foundation and, to the delight of everyone, she enthusiastically joined in on virtual dance parties. Influencers, including Kylie Jenner at the behest of the U.S. Surgeon General, talked up public health responsibility with their followers.

But then, as the weeks dragged on, and our own financial worries and creeping unease grew, things began to rankle.

Madonna’s “COVID is the great equalizer” bathtub videos went clunk. We started to resent the sliver of pool cabana in the background and the exclusive retreats, such as the one in Wyoming where Kanye West, who made a surprise announcement of a 2020 presidential run, has a compound. Tucked away from the rising virus tide in L.A., his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, posted a tone-deaf pic last week bragging about her herd of 14 Friesian horses: you know, the ones with the extra long, extra silky manes. The post was greeted with a flurry of “People are dying, Kim” and “Please, Kim, I’m LITERALLY poor.”

Without the usual insulated layers of handlers and entourage, stars can and do get it wrong. The system had already been changing, Weston says. “Shows like ours used to be the only place for celebrities to promote their projects or to address their scandals. Now social media is a direct pipeline. That said, they are giving us lots of content that way right now, by both making mistakes and getting it right.”

To follow the whiplash, it is first necessary to decode the confusing climate of call-out and cancel culture fomented by social media. In looking at the effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on celebrity culture, it’s necessary to consider also the long-term, mood-altering effect of the Black Lives Matter movement on the entertainment industry.

The protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis highlighted the economic and social inequities laid bare by the quarantine. The pandemic will end, but the BLM movement is a turning point. Thus we have an entertainment universe that had to make two sharp pivots in a row.

Sonia Beeksma moved from Vancouver in January to take up a post as an entertainment reporter on CTV’s “eTalk.” She says everyone is watching which celebrities are using their platforms to speak up politically, especially throughout the Black Lives Matter movement. “There is a change in the way people operate now, people are choosing a completely different path; something happened within their core: it is very powerful right now.”

Elaine “Lainey” Lui is a co-host on “eTalk,” as well as a host on CTV’s “The Social” and founder of the popular website Lainey Gossip, launched in 2003. “ I do agree that especially during this time where we are collectively protesting injustice and anti-Black racism, there is space to be candid in terms of self-reflection,” she said. “When it is done right and well, it can be very effective and necessary. Allyship is not perfect. But in those mistakes, we are exposing vulnerability and humanity.”

The pundits are not immune to the whiplash of call-out culture: Lui’s colleague at “eTalk,” Ben Mulroney, stepped aside from co-hosting to make room for more diverse voices in the aftermath of his wife Jessica’s white-privilege scandal. Lui herself made her own amends for decades-old Lainey Gossip posts from the early 2000s (including one about Janet Jackson calling her outfit “ghetto”). In her blog and on “The Social,” she stated: “Those posts were racist, they were misogynistic, they were homophobic, they were transphobic, they were shameful. I am so sorry.”

The online mood has sharply shifted and social media is no longer a celebrity playground for inducing envy or pitching products mindlessly. Lesser mortals have been eaten alive by the fires of social media, but the Kardashians have until now created an impermeable shield around themselves. They are still relevant in the business world: Kim Kardashian-West inked a recent deal with Coty to take her makeup empire to billion-dollar valuation, moments after husband West announced a 10-year megadeal with the Gap for a Yeezy collaboration.

The Kardashian way has been the opposite of vulnerability. The reality royal family had been notably quiet in the first three months of quarantine and revolution, tooling down their massive promotional machines to a tread-water setting, a.k.a. a smattering of thirst-trap bikini shots by the pool. There was a brief scandal around Kylie Jenner’s downgrade from billionaire by Forbes. Then there was Khloe Kardashian’s perplexingly “changed” face; her face did look dramatically different, launching a flurry of speculation by plastic surgery pundits.

The Kardashian-Jenner machine invented the prevailing modalities of modern fame: bod-revealing, made-for-Instagram photo shoots; attention-grabbing romantic sagas, sex tapes and cheating scandals; fluffed-up feuds within the family and with other celebrities. The clan created an entire aspirational beauty and fashion esthetic (and the products to get the look at home). One day, we will look back at the decade from 2010 till the start of the pandemic and a Kardashian-bot will come up on Google.

But won’t we somehow be essentially changed by this moment? Post-pandemic, after so much death and fear and reckoning, with the economic fallout and the lasting effects of prolonged isolation, amid the clamour for social justice: if we are different on the inside, won’t we want to look different on the outside, too?

The backlash may have started to reflect this. Actress and activist Jameela Jamil called out Kardashian-West recently over another throwback the personality posted of herself in an extreme waist-training corset by couturier Mr Pearl that she had worn to the 2019 Met Gala. A year later, the unnatural ideal it represented feels hopelessly out of sync.

Jamil, who heads an anti-body-shaming campaign called @i_weigh, has been all over the Kardashians for years for their promotion of an “impossible” body image and the negative effects that has on regular women and girls. Jamil switched advocacy tactics this time, saying that Kardashian-West was “just so harmed and deluded into thinking this is what SHE needs to look like to be special and beautiful and she’s spilling it out onto her following.”

By bringing in sympathy for Kardashian, Jamil wisely tried to change the timbre of the conversation, but until Kardashian-West and her sisters accept the responsibility of their outsized influence on their followers, the effort may fall on tone-deaf ears.

As other stars heed collective pressure to be more thoughtful in this time of all-around reckoning, will the Kardashian fame-shield hold? Resistance is futile, says Weston. “From certain people, we accept the esthetics are fixed. For Kim Kardashian-West, the esthetics are her entire world,” he says. “I don’t think she needed to show up ‘undone’ on social (during the pandemic) to prove, ‘Oh my God I’m just like you!’”

Beeksma says it’s all about business for the famous family. “We all know they are not in this business to change the world for the better. The train the Kardashians are on, they are businesswomen, they are their brand.” She is practical about their reach, though. “Their esthetic seems to be waning … But let’s be honest, they have millions and millions of followers, so someone wants that content.”

Weston thinks some of the flashier lifestyles of the rich and famous will come back sooner, rather than later. “It’s all about escapism. Guilty pleasures are important: we can’t worry all the time.”

“As for reality stars, I can’t say (the phenomenon) is ever gonna go away,” says Lui. “Nor do I want it to! When lockdown ends and red carpets can be walked again and premieres attended again, I don’t know that we can say the trend of flaunt is over.

“I will say — and this is not a defence of celebrity — the illusion of Hollywood, the lure from the very beginning, the reason superstars exist, is that they live in our imaginations in a world of fantasy, a land of dreams and fairy tales.”

We want them to live there, says Lui. “I’m in the business because I never want them to go away, not only because I think art and culture is necessary but because, through celebrities, we learn about ourselves.”

Athleisure and sneaker culture are appealing, especially while we are all at home, but “red carpets will absolutely happen again. And if it takes too long, celebrities will start wearing cocktail gowns to the grocery store,” she says.

The show, after all, must go on.

Read', 'Shawn Hublerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-07-13,"SACRAMENTO, CALIF.—California’s two largest public school districts said Monday that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers.

The Los Angeles and San Diego unified school districts, which together enrol some 825,000 students, are the largest so far in the country to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August.

More than a third of California’s coronavirus cases are in Los Angeles County, and San Diego County has had 18 community outbreaks over the past week, more than double the state’s acceptable threshold.

“There’s a public health imperative to keep schools from becoming a petri dish,” said Austin Beutner, school superintendent in Los Angeles.

The joint announcement came as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continued to press the Trump administration’s case to quickly reopen public schools, not only for students’ social and emotional development but also to allow parents to return to work fully.

In the Los Angeles and San Diego districts’ joint statement, they noted that research is incomplete and recommendations have been contradictory.

But “one fact is clear,” the statement said. “Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available. California has neither.”

California’s death toll from the coronavirus rose to more than 7,000 over the weekend, with 7.5 per cent or more of test results coming back positive over the past two weeks, even as testing has ramped up to more than 100,000 tests a day.

Beutner said the decision will be revisited when local infection rates have been sufficiently lowered and public health authorities have implemented adequate testing and contact tracing systems.

The San Diego superintendent, Cindy Marten, said the district has not given up on the possibility of reopening physically if infection rates get down to a safe and manageable level and even moved forward over the weekend with plans to purchase $11 million (U.S.) worth of masks and other protective equipment. But the state’s current infection levels, she said, “should make it clear to everyone that the virus is not under control.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Maggie Habermanthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Maggie Habermanthe New York Timessun.']",2020-07-12,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s advisers undercut the country’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, over the weekend, anonymously providing details to various news outlets about statements he had made early in the coronavirus outbreak that they said were inaccurate.

The move to treat Fauci, who has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for decades, as if he were a warring political rival came as he has grown increasingly vocal in his concerns about the national surge in coronavirus cases, as well as his lack of access to Trump over the past several weeks. It has been accompanied by more measured public criticism from administration officials, including the president.

And it came just days after the White House called school reopening guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overly restrictive, part of a pattern of the administration trying to sideline recommendations that could slow the reopening of the economy, which Trump views as vital to his flailing re-election effort.

Aides to Trump first released to the Washington Post what the paper called a “lengthy list” of remarks that Fauci had made about the virus when it was in its early stages. That list featured several comments from Fauci that White House aides had privately complained about for months, including one in February in which he minimized the chance of asymptomatic spread and said people did not need to make big changes to their lives.

An official told the Post that several other officials were concerned about how often Fauci had been wrong.

For example, White House officials pointed to a statement by Fauci in a Feb. 29 interview that “at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.” But they omitted a warning he delivered right after.

“Right now the risk is still low, but this could change,” he said in the interview, conducted by NBC News. “When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread.”

In the same interview, Fauci also warned that the coronavirus could become “a major outbreak.”

The list of statements, laid out in the style of a campaign’s opposition research document, was later released to several news outlets. It was an extraordinary move for the White House to provide news organizations with such a document about a health official who works for the administration and retains a high level of public trust.

Fauci declined to comment. A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity insisted that the administration was not trying to discredit Fauci, who it acknowledged is an expert, but rather remind members of the public of his record and that it should be listening to a range of doctors.

A poll conducted for the New York Times by Siena College last month showed that 67 per cent of Americans trusted Fauci when it came to the virus; only 26 per cent trusted the president.

With the United States leading the world by a large margin in both cases and deaths, Fauci has grown more outspoken recently in interviews with his concerns about the virus, even as Trump has tried to push for states to reopen faster and has threatened to withhold federal money from school districts if they do not reopen in the fall.

In a recent interview on a podcast with FiveThirtyEight.com, Fauci said that a few states had the virus under control but that “as a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don’t think you can say we’re doing great. I mean, we’re just not.”

By contrast, Trump has tried to play down the threat almost without interruption while making false claims about how quickly and effectively his administration has responded to it.

White House officials would not speak for the record. But a senior administration official said the document provided to the Post was intended to push back on any belief that the administration was negligent if it did not always adhere to Fauci’s words. The official argued that people who disliked Trump outside the administration had given outsize value to Fauci’s voice.

And in a White House where almost everything is treated in terms of how it relates to Trump, staff frustrations with Fauci have run high for months.

Trump recently told Fox News that Fauci had been wrong about many aspects of the pandemic. Fauci “is a nice man, but he’s made a lot of mistakes,” the president said.

Despite claims early on in the fight against the virus that they enjoyed each other’s company, Trump has long been dismissive of Fauci in private, according to White House officials, taking note of the amount of time he spent on television and of when the doctor contradicted him during press briefings. Trump began growing frustrated with Fauci when he expressed concerns about the efficacy of using hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, to treat people who had the coronavirus. Trump has continued to evangelize in support of the drug, even after the Food and Drug Administration withdrew an emergency authorization allowing it to be used in coronavirus cases.

The president’s advisers have echoed, and sometimes amplified, Trump’s frustrations.

“Dr. Fauci is not 100 per cent right, and he also doesn’t necessarily — and he admits that — have the whole national interest in mind,” Admiral Brett P. Giroir, an assistant health and human services secretary, said in an interview aired Sunday on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” “He looks at it from a very narrow public health point of view.”

Read', 'Ben Hubbardthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-07-12,"BEIRUT—For three decades, chef Antoine El Hajj has appeared on television five days a week to help cooks across Lebanon improve their grasp of the culinary arts.

Two months ago, as an economic crisis caused Lebanon’s currency to collapse and prices to soar, he realized that many of his viewers could no longer afford staples he had long relied on in his recipes, like beef.

“There used to be a middle class in Lebanon, but now the rich are rich, the middle class has become poor and the poor have become destitute,” El Hajj, 65, said in a recent interview before going on the air.

He has since cut beef from his menus and fills his segments with tips on how to keep dishes tasty with less oil, fewer eggs and cheaper vegetables.

Lebanon’s crisis, the result of years of government corruption and financial mismanagement, has caused unemployment and poverty rates to skyrocket, businesses to shutter and salaries to lose their value as inflation soars.

Mass protests against the political elite erupted across the country last fall and sometimes turned violent. The demonstrations tapered off when the country shut down because of the coronavirus, but have recently picked up again as the lockdown has added to the economic distress.

The effects of the economic meltdown are increasingly infiltrating the daily lives of many Lebanese. Power cuts darken streets, banks refuse to hand over depositors’ cash and families struggle to buy imported essentials like diapers and laundry detergent.

The government has long failed to provide sufficient electricity. But blackouts have grown so long that the din of traffic in Beirut, where about one-third of Lebanon’s 5.4 million people live, has been replaced by the roar of overworked generators.

Their exhaust fouls the air, and many residential buildings are shutting them off to rest at night, depriving residents of air-conditioning during the sweatiest stretch of the Mediterranean summer.

For two days recently, Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the main facility treating Beirut’s COVID-19 cases, suddenly went from one hour without power per day to 20 hours without power, according to its director, Dr. Firass Abiad.

So the hospital, which now lacks power six hours a day, has closed some operating rooms and delayed surgeries.

“It feels like you are continuously firefighting with no end in sight,” Abiad said.

After dark, Beirut’s once-raucous nightlife has given way to an eerie desolation. Bars have few patrons, main streets are dark and traffic lights at major intersections are out, leaving drivers to navigate on their own, flashing their high beams and hoping for the best as they plow through.

The swift collapse has struck a blow to the pride of many Lebanese, who often have claimed to have the Middle East’s best cuisine and have seen themselves as more sophisticated than others in the region. Now, many wonder how far their standard of living will fall.

“Beirut is a survival city. People always find ways to eat and drink and make music and do activism. But now, the air is very thick,” said Carmen Geha, an assistant professor of public administration at the American University of Beirut. “Now, even upper-middle-class people can’t afford to eat outside the house. It’s like you take your salary and divide it by nine.”

The Lebanese pound, or lira, has lost about 85 per cent of its value on the black market since last fall, getting its own satirical Twitter feed where it reacts to its own decline.

“I’m the cheapest but I’m not a piece of junk,” the account said early this month amid reports that it was trading at 9,500 to the U.S. dollar, far from the official bank rate of 1,500.

Much of the financial distress comes from chaos in the banking system. The central bank ran what critics have called a Ponzi scheme, enticing commercial banks to make large deposits of U.S. dollars with high interest rates that could be covered only by bringing in more large depositors with even higher interest rates.

But that system ground to a halt last year when new investors stopped coming, leaving the country’s banks far short of the dollars they owed their depositors.

The banks have reacted by mostly refusing to give out dollars, which the Lebanese had long used interchangeably with local currency in daily life.

A former Lebanese banker, Dan Azzi, has taken credit for coining a term now widely used for these theoretical dollars that exist only in Lebanese banks: lollars.

The result has been financial pandemonium and pain.

The government has sought to control the black market exchange, where changing money on better terms than the official rate can feel like buying drugs, requiring quick meetings in alleyways with money-changers who use fake names and fear arrest.

The effects of the crisis on the country’s poor have been acute, as was made clear by four recent suicides in one two-day period, all linked to the economic crisis. A man who shot himself on one of Beirut’s best-known boulevards left behind a handwritten sign reading “I am not an infidel,” a line from a well-known song whose next lyric is “but hunger is an infidel.”

Membership of a Facebook group called Lebanon Barters has swelled, its members offering everything from poker chips to hookahs in exchange for food. Their posts read like tragic poetry.

“New weights, never used, to trade for a package of diapers, size 6, and a bottle of oil,” read a post with a photo of dumbbells still in the box. “People need them.”

Another post featured a lime-green dress that Fatima al-Hussein, a mother of six from northern Lebanon, had bought as a gift for her daughter. She was looking to trade it for sugar, milk and detergent.

In a phone interview, al-Hussein said her husband makes 200,000 Lebanese pounds per week as a manual labourer, an amount that used to be worth $130 (U.S.).

Now it is worth less than $30, leaving her family struggling to afford essentials.

She said she decided to trade the dress after she had to start feeding her children bread dipped in water. But so far, she had found no takers.

When her neighbours cook, she closes her doors and windows.

“I don’t want my children to smell the food,” she said.

Before going on air recently, El Hajj, the television chef, said that what counted as affordable recipes was a moving target.

“Beef got expensive so we moved to chicken, and now people are telling me that chicken is expensive, too,” he said.

As he prepared the dishes for the day’s show, he fielded calls from viewers struggling with preserving food amid power cuts. How do you make jam from plums or cherries? How do you keep meat fresh when you can’t count on the freezer?

He laid out the options. Fruits and vegetables could be canned, pickled or dried. Ground meat could be preserved in fat as confit.

“Everything has a solution,” he said after the show, and added, “What is important for me with my program is to help people to continue to eat.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inside one neighbourhood cafe’s make or break reopening,"['Karon Liu', 'Karon Liuculture Reportersun.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-12,"The sight of people eating on patios in the summer sun might look like the dining scene is slowly getting back to normal, but the threat of permanent closure is still on the minds of restaurant owners as they try to figure out how to pay the bills while making a fraction of what they were used to before the COVID-19 shut down.

“Places like mine, which don’t have any backers and are owned by people who live in the neighbourhood they serve, they’re the most at risk,” says Leo Wong, 31, owner of Scenic Coffee + Brunch, a small cafe and brunch spot located in a plaza on Woodbine Ave., just south of Highway 7, in Markham. “We don’t have any financial resources to fall back on.”

Scenic opened in April 2019 and shut down for the first month and a half of the pandemic. This past April, the cafe started taking online orders for baked goods such as Japanese-style cream puffs and mochi brownies. About two weeks ago Wong opened the restaurant for takeout and outdoor dining for three days a week. Since then he’s brought in a total of between $500 and $600, he said. It’s about 10 per cent of what the restaurant made in the same time period in 2019.

That doesn’t cover the money he spent on outdoor furniture so that diners can make reservations to eat in front of the store. “We spent about $300 on six tables and chairs from Ikea. Then this past weekend it was too hot for people to eat in the sun so we spent another $400 on umbrellas. I can’t just build a patio or deck.”

Other costs include $300 to $500 for coffee from a local supplier as well as produce, dairy and other ingredients to last two weeks. The point of sale system costs $70 a month, and he also has an accountant to keep track of payroll and taxes. There’s also service fees with a new reservation system, as well as fees for processing credit and debit cards as many businesses are opting to go cashless to minimize contact with customers. He received a $40,000 small business loan from the government during the pandemic, which he’s been repaying as well. Half of it has already been spent on existing bills.

In addition to himself, there’s usually one other person working at the restaurant, which can usually seat 25. To keep costs down, Scenic is currently only open Friday to Sunday. Wong has three part-time employees making $24 an hour plus tips. Tips have been very little, he added. The hourly wage is more than the usual $16 per hour (about $20 with tips) workers had been making before the pandemic, but Wong said one of his goals upon reopening is paying a more livable wage to essential workers.

He added that he hasn’t paid himself in the last year since the cafe opened, though he splits the tips with staff which works out to $3 to $4 an hour. He moved in with his parents when the restaurant opened last year to save money.

His biggest worry right now is rent. Wong pays $4,000 each month, which also includes utilities and taxes.

“Our space is a sublet and our landlord is a tenant who has been trying to work something out with their landlord but it doesn’t seem like they’re taking the government’s commercial rent subsidy. My landlord hasn’t asked for any money yet, but they might ask for all of it back. Imagine trying to pay four to five months of rent with no revenue.” Wong said he’s worried that if he has to retroactively pay the rent, his business loan would be all used up.

“We thought about raising menu prices but I don’t think it’s the right decision because diners are in a financial struggle themselves,” he said. “There have been talks about doing a coronavirus surcharge, but I don’t think that’s the way to go. It’s the least creative way to go by passing the costs on to people.”

Instead, Wong said there are larger changes that need to happen to help small businesses survive. “There have been problems before the pandemic, but they’re now exacerbated. The hospitality industry is a window into society. A lot of people who work in the industry can’t even afford to live in the city.”

He said in addition to rent forgiveness during the pandemic, the province should revisit the idea of universal basic income. He said that if there’s a universal income, it will allow small business owners to still have some money coming in (for living expenses) while they invest all their money into starting a restaurant, which usually doesn’t make back its money in the first year or two.

“It’s outrageous for it to be a common practice for a restaurant owner to not have an income for the first two to five years. It doesn’t encourage small business owners,” Wong said.

Julie Kwiecinski, Ontario’s director of provincial affairs for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said that even though outdoor dining is now permitted, many smaller restaurants only have room for one or two patio tables. It may cost more to reopen and bring back staff than the revenue they can generate.

A recent survey from the CFIB reported that about 28 per cent of respondents in the hospitality sector across Canada are making a quarter or less of the revenue they made in previous years. Another 20 per cent reported making between a quarter and half of the revenue from before.

“It’s important to recognize that in Ontario, where they are reopening more slowly due to health requirements and higher case loads, the recovery is going to be slower,” she said, noting that even when indoor dining is permitted, it’s not going to be at full capacity, which is what a restaurant needs to turn a profit. “We see programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance, but the question is how long they’re going to be in place.”

In another recent survey by CFIB, members were asked if they’re considering winding down their business or declaring bankruptcy. In Ontario, 16.4 per cent of respondents said yes compared to the national average of 14.3. “Those numbers are for every sector, not just in hospitality, but it’s still a telling number,” Kwiecinski said. “Under normal times, that number is around one per cent.”

While it may seem somewhat back to normal for diners, Wong says restaurants, especially ones like his, are still far from being in the clear.

“I want the average person to understand the difficulties of being a business owner and it’s just not all that glamorous,” Wong said. “I really want to be able to push forward these changes that the coronavirus forced us to look into so that small business owners have the opportunity to survive and contribute to their communities. The current systems in place don’t allow for social and economic stability. Talking about this is the first step.”

Read', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Christine Sismondo Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'Contributor To The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"Roughly 150 years old, the Manhattan is easily one of the most popular and enduring cocktails of all time.

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly.

It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics.

First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth.

Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it.

These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics.

Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord.

The Concord

2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky

¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County)

2 dashes Angostura bitters

1 Amarena cherry (for garnish)

Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry.

NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. They have several different expressions, including a rye and a single malt.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.

At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8.

“Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem.

Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family.

My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.

For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover.

Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me.

“No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it.

“You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-”

“No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.”

“Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned.

But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma.

After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional.

“We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia.

As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia.

In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.

In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious.

COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma.

At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape.

The sign at the local splash pad has new rules: Use your elbow to push the button. Maintain physical distancing. No more than 19 people at a time.

There’s a lot to unpack for parents and caregivers as they try to keep kids cool on hot summer days, with splash pads and public pools now available for use in phase two of Ontario’s reopening plan.

With these outdoor options available for children, another challenge has emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on through the summer: how do you teach kids to play safely?

Signage on splash pads in the city provides guidance on safety measures, such as touching the button with your elbow instead of your hand. But with up to 19 people allowed at some splash pads in popular areas like Toronto’s Centennial Park, ensuring everyone follows those guidelines can be challenging.

We spoke to Dr. Upton Allen, head of infection diseases at Toronto’s SickKids Hospital, to see how parents and caregivers can take advantage of this outdoor public space while keeping themselves and their children safe.

“I try to let them recognize that once the guidelines have been issued for public play areas to open, it usually means that the risk of transmission is likely low. Kids should have fun,” Dr. Allen said, “but there are things that you really should try to do to reduce the risk and let them be aware of that.”

To help get that message across, he came up with a mnemonic called STOP N’ PLAN.

“It won’t be a one-size-fit-all type scenario, but there are some general things parents can talk about that might help them keep their children safe.”

S

Stands for staying away if a child is ill with COVID symptoms. In other words, the old principle of staying home if you’re ill.

T

It relates to touching. Speak to your kids and tell them, ‘don’t touch what is not yours.’ Tell them to focus on their equipment. Don’t be playing with other kids’ equipment or water bottles or supplies.

O

This one is more directed at the parents and stands for observe. Basically what you really want to do is to observe the surroundings, ensure they are safe and clean. Check out the washrooms ahead of time. Is there soap and water to wash your hands? Visit the particular splash pad or playground ahead of time. Know where you’re going before you go there.

P

Is for physical distancing. If you go to a particular area and it is overcrowded on that day, you may want to think, ‘do I really want to go today?’ And if you go somewhere where there’s a lineup, well, at least try and create some physical distance while waiting.

N’

Never, never, never share food or drinks. It might be obvious, but it’s important to teach young kids not to do that.

P

PPE, which is really for the parents based on their local city guidance. If parents are going to be there interacting and standing with other parents, they should have face coverings on.

L

Lave, which means washing and hygiene measures like bringing your own supplies to clean. That’s one thing I always say to the families is to remember to take your wipes, your hand sanitizer, and it’s probably not a bad idea to invest in a Lysol spray to be ready to clean an area that is frequently touched like a table — especially if it’s indoors.

A

Simply avoiding touching your face, eyes and mouth. Kids love to do that, so you can encourage them, but you know they’re still going to do it.

N

Stands for networking among parents at the facilities. If you go somewhere where you know people, that’s always good, but the key is to be able to share information and emphasize the importance that everyone remembers we’re all in this together. Parents need to remember that they could be a source of infection — it’s not just the children.

Dr. Allen said it’s important for kids to be aware of where they are going and why they need to be taking these precautions if they are old enough to understand these conversations. For the younger ones, it can be helpful to focus on short, simple mantras like “hands clean.”

He emphasized that there is a risk in contracting the virus in these settings, much like anywhere else, but it is a low one.

“You want kids to have fun. At the point when the city says you can go out, generally it’s a reflection of advice coming from experts and the risk is low. Given that we’re all in this together, collectively there are things we might be able to do to make that low risk even lower.”

Read', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Christine Sismondo Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'Contributor To The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"Is the pandemic changing the way we sleep?

Anecdotally speaking, it would appear so. I know night owls who’ve become early risers, friends suffering from insomnia for the first time and have heard plenty of stories about vivid COVID-19 dreams. I’ve even spoken to people who, freed from the tyranny of their alarm clocks, are finally getting a proper night’s sleep for the first time in their adult lives.

We need more than anecdotes to know if the pandemic is really making a difference in people’s sleep patterns—for better or worse. Fortunately, there’s an international study in the works, being run by sleep experts from 14 countries around the world that will analyze the responses from tens of thousands of participants to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on sleep and circadian rhythms in adults.

The study is still underway (Canadians have until July 15 to participate in the survey) and we won’t see results published for many months. So, it’s still too early to call it, but the researcher heading up the Canadian chapter, Dr. Frances Chung, suspects we’re going to find dramatic changes.

“I think the pandemic is really affecting people emotionally and it's very challenging for everyone because of the increased stress and anxiety,” says Chung, a Professor of the Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the University Health Network and University of Toronto. “So there’ll be increasing levels of irrational fears and also depression. And, you know, also we’re not going out and not doing exercise and regular things, that will all affect sleep.”

One COVID-19 habit, in particular, worries Chung, namely, watching 24-hour cable news channels and “doom-scrolling” on Twitter and other platforms that feed us a constant barrage of bad news, from rising coronavirus numbers around the world to murder hornets and anti-maskers. Obviously, reading a lot of terrifying things all the time isn’t a likely path to sweet dreams.

Even worse, though, is checking your feeds and/or watching CNN right before bed—and not just because it’s hard to doze off with murder hornets on the brain. Doom-scrolling is actually double trouble, since the news is bad, plus the blue light emitted from these screens interferes with your “circadian rhythms.” I decided to ask Greg Wells, PhD and author of “Rest, Refocus, Recharge: A Guide for Optimizing Your Life,” why that was so important.

“All humans have a circadian rhythm, which is a 24-hour cycle that sees our physiology change throughout,” explains Wells. “A lot of that is guided by a structure inside the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is sensitive to light and so, as the light becomes brighter, we become more alert and, as it gets darker, we sleep.”

He continues: “Blue light is wonderful in the morning and is very helpful to wake us up and get us going but, late in the evening, it activates the brain and makes it hard to get to sleep.”

Simple enough. And so is the solution. Wells says we need to protect ourselves from that and create a “digital sunset.” Thirty to 60 minutes before bed, he advises we turn off the devices, turn down the lights and read a book or take a bath or meditate or whatever. That will put your brain in a place where it can release melatonin, the hormone that helps us fall asleep quickly and deeply. Wells says we need to “defend our last hour from tech.”

Unless you have a serious sleep disorder, this might not seem like a top priority. A lot of emerging evidence, however, shows that sleep plays an important role in keeping us healthy and happy.

“I think most of us did not realize sleep was so important, but sleep actually affects the body’s whole health system,” says Chung. “If you sleep less than six hours a night, it increases your risk for obesity by 21 per cent, your risk for stroke by 22 per cent, your risk for diabetes by 25 per cent and coronary artery heart disease by 35 per cent.”

Add to that dementia and depression, say both of our sleep experts. And, unfortunately, one in four Canadians has some form of a sleep disorder.

On the brighter side, Wells thinks it’s possible that folks are waking up to the importance of sleep and may even be using this time to develop healthier sleep habits.

“Sleep is definitely a hot topic for everybody and what I saw, especially early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, was a period of disrupted sleep for most people I work with,” says Wells. “However, about six weeks into all of this, we definitely saw a shift where people have gotten used to working from home and started really enjoying not commuting which gives them extra time. A lot of people are now using that extra time to exercise more, spend more time with family and sleep.”

Wells cautions that his sample size is small, so we can’t make too much of his observations. Still, though, it’s nice to know people can make changes—even during a time of crisis.

“I think the key message is that the quality of your sleep is actually under your own control,” Wells says. “We can improve our sleep. It does take time but you can dramatically improve the amount and quality of your sleep and that will have exponential ripple effects on the rest of your life.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the internet contains some proper gems that get more interesting the longer you watch, all easily searchable on YouTube or other sites as indicated.

Diane Dufresne: Symphonique n’ Roll at the Colisée de Québec (1988)

It’s a crying shame that the rest of Canada doesn’t know Quebec’s reigning art-rock diva of the 1980s and ’90s, but this is probably because Dufresne never bothered with the Anglo markets. Before Bjork’s swan, Madonna’s Gaultier cones and Lady Gaga’s meat dress, there was Diane Dufresne and … any number of spectacular dresses, featured in several concerts now available on YouTube. In Symphonique n’ Roll, Dufresne sings symphonic arrangements of her synth hits and, at one point, wears a dress train with wheels covered in musical instruments, with a violin on her head. But the outfits are the least of it: the punk attitude, the hysteria, the ownership of the text, the unfailing musical instincts and the tongue-in-cheek moments all make for an exciting spectacle. Follow along with the lyrics if possible: her knack for turning them into dramatic monologues is something to behold. There’s also a Mahler song and a Verdi aria in the program, and she shines in both.

Julie Andrews Sings Her Favorite Songs (1989)

“You could say my mom was a bit of a stage mom,” says Andrews as she introduces Noel Coward’s “Mrs. Worthington,” and interrupts the singing with memories of performing with her mother’s and stepfather’s double act. The embodiment of all that is good manners and polish, Andrews started off on the wrong side of the tracks, entertainment-wise: music hall stages in the small towns of England. She loved every moment of it, she recollects, especially the short lady by the name of Ella Shields who was a male impersonator and who would dress up as an elegant bum for “Burlington Bertie from Bow.” Which Andrews proceeds to sing (and dance) herself. There is a risqué and elaborately set up #MeToo joke a quarter of an hour later, a hot rendition of “Le Jazz Hot” from “Victor/Victoria” and a lot more lanky dancing before she changes into a silver gown for the only sedate portion of the evening. Unlike most of her movies, this is not family-friendly and so much better for it.

La Traviata

There’s an intriguing recent Paris Opera staging of this Verdi opera available at Medici.tv, free with a Toronto Public Library card. Fronted by the charismatic South African soprano Pretty Yende, the production sets the Verdi-Dumas classic in the present time, with Violetta Valéry as an Instagram influencer, girl-about-town famous for being famous, both feted and owned by her followers in that unique way that social media celebrities are. By way of video projections, there are status updates and photo uploads happening seemingly in real time throughout the opera. In the final act, when illness strikes, millions of virtual friends are reduced to a single one in flesh and blood. In at least two operatic classics, sopranos die due to respiratory illness (tuberculosis); it can’t be long before COVID-19 becomes a dramatic device in productions of “La Traviata” and “La Bohème”

For the Gen-X set

There are a lot of concerts for the discerning Gen-Xer online — after all, the concert as an art form was created as members of that generation were coming into youth culture. Pet Shop Boys’ Electric Tour (2013) is a fantastic hybrid of light projections and electronica, aptly directed for video. There’s New Order in Berlin (2012), geezers by now but still having it. The 1998 Depeche Mode Live in Cologne, recorded for MTV, shows Dave Gahan’s baritone at peak suavity. There’s also Arcade Fire Live at Lollapalooza in 2017; and Oasis in Manchester in 2005, before an insane number of people, as the 1990s’ last hurrah. But for the sheer propulsion, visceral onslaughts and brain food, these are two standouts: Eurythmics Live in Sydney from 1987 and the Jonathan Demme-directed recording of the Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense, preserved on DVD and BluRay.

Laurie Anderson Home of the Brave (1986)

This is the young Laurie Anderson: playful and childlike as she moves between instruments and guest musicians, voice and sound modulation, recorded and live. No melancholy of “O Superman” here, nor the gravitas of “From the Air” — this is as carefree and fun as avant-garde song-making gets.

Mozart Great Mass in C minor

Insula Orchestra — named after the part of the brain that turns inchoate sensations into conscious emotions — is one of France’s several orchestras run by women conductors. Mozart’s “Mass in C-minor” was its first big statement to the world. An old church was opened for the purposes of this recording for the Arte TV network and four superb soloists hired. Period instruments are different from modern symphonic orchestras: sound comes across as smudgier and more in-between because they’re differently tuned and produced by different materials, gut strings not steel or nylon, and horns that come valveless, like bugles. In other words, the impression of precision and sharpness is harder to achieve, and Insula and the chorus do this — but observe the conductor, Laurence Equilbey. Hers is not a style of strict beat-tracking; it’s more of a trance from the first big tutti in Kyrie on. It’s a great pleasure to observe women owning such muscular and masculine works as Mahler’s 5th (see for example, Han-na Chang when she next guest-conducts the TSO) or Holst’s “The Planets” (Susanna Mälkki), but witnessing this kind of helplessness before the ineffability of music, as evinced by Equilbey, is a pleasure of a different, more poignant kind.

This week, we asked readers to show us their DIY home improvement projects completed during self-quarantine.

These are the results.

The Skiflower

Tom Siegner bought a few sets of skis from an “old timer’s yard sale” near Grand Bend. He screwed them into a circular piece of plywood, which he painted yellow and adorned with pieces of shale collected from the beach.

Shower showcase

Star digital producer Andrea Macdonald decided to use her time during the coronavirus lockdown to work on her newly purchased house.

Her first DIY home project was the shower backsplash, which she says was made of linoleum flooring and had “something evil” manifesting itself in the corner. She tore it all out and started fresh.

“It’s still not 100 per cent done, but if you squint really hard, it looks finished,” she says.

Hedge removal

It took 16 truck loads for Cathie Beacock and Dave Isaac to remove the remains of a monster cedar hedge at the front of their house in Orillia.

They cut down the branches and trunks of the 12-foot wide and 12-foot high hedge and plan to replace it with fresh grass and a picket fence.

“We had the unexpected pleasure of comments and encouragement from neighbours walking along our road, neighbours we hadn’t met before,” Beacock says. “And we two seniors did it all ourselves.”

Plaster restoration

After COVID-19 forced Doug Knight and his wife Marg to put their 50th wedding anniversary celebration in Portugal on hold, he shifted his focus to a plaster restoration project at the family home in Picton.

“The great thing about being older is that you know that things will get better,” he says.

The home, which was originlly built in 1830, has mutiple cracks on the 18 foot ceilings, which have been left untouched for 120 years.

With the help of some scaffolding and a few online articles, Knight says he’s found the formula to create what he calls a permanent repair. Here, he describes his process:

Open up the cracks right back to the wooden lath that carries the plaster, making the incision V shaped so it is wider at the lath side. The lath is then wetted down a couple of times and a strong setting plaster (one that’s mixed with water) is forced into the crack with a trowel. A second coat brings the plaster flush with the surface and then comes the cosmetic part of the repair where you blend the filled crack into the rest of the surface with drywall compound. Where the plaster is loose, mechanical fasteners and fiberglass cloth are used for additional strength.

Indoor garden

Star digital producer Jordan Tamblyn says she doesn’t have a balcony or much of a green thumb, so she bought a tomato starter kit.

“If we have to stay inside, why not create a magnificent indoor garden,” she says.

The pictures below show the difference from April 30 to May 5. Her next addition? Lemon balm, and maybe some mint, properly spaced in an egg carton.

Homemade mantle

Penny Batchelor was tired of looking at the blank wall above her fireplace. So she did what anyone would do — went to Pinterest for inspiration.

She painted the wall white, added the primed moulding, then the caulking, painted again, and topped it off with some decor. It only took her and her husband two days.

Bathroom reno

Vilija Govedas had been neglecting her bathroom renovation but with this newfound time at home, she says she was tired of focusing on COVID-19 and decided working on the bathroom would provide a good distraction.

She had a headstart as the walls were repaired and plumbing lines rerun in early March. The job started again in April with painting, caulking, tiling, grouting, laying new floor, fabricating and installing window and baseboard moulding and bringing the fixtures back in.

Aside from the plumbing, this 58-year-old mom of two young adult boys proudly says she did it all herself. “I make my dad proud.”

Artsy garage

Brenda Ostaff put some love into her attached garage while in isolation. It started with a fresh paint job, then she framed the outside of her electric sauna area in pine.

To give the place a personal touch, she mounted old album covers on the walls and is looking forward to the musical conversations sparked by them.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Music and theatre lovers can’t go to concerts; dance lovers can’t go to recitals; nor art lovers museums; foodies to restaurants. That doesn’t mean the richness of our lives diminishes; it just means we need to look at it differently, for now. There are still plenty of new things to experience — alone and together, in person and virtually. And each week the Star brings you that in our Life, Entertainment and Books section — now At Home.

Art is something we can all experience together — even if we’re apart. Each week, we’re presenting Star readers with a work of art.

This week, Carlos Bunga’s new work, at Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Art, seems to be made for our times — the strong, visual image evokes a sense of us all staying apart while still being together.

But Bunga created this piece even before the COVID-19 social distancing we’re all experiencing. He methodically organized hundreds of standard packing boxes into a vast grid covering a significant portion of MOCA’s second floor.

Bunga’s work encourages us to situate ourselves within art, and thereby, the conditions of the present.

The boxes are labelless and open-ended, uniformly facing upward, as if offering themselves up to be physically or imaginatively filled. Collectively, the composition suggests an anonymous geography or urban plan, a camp or modular storage system.

There are no specific directions, no designated beginning or end. Each viewer’s passage is entirely their own.

We’ll all get through this together, even as we all take our own slightly different path while doing it.

So in the time of COVID-19, the Star wanted to hear what some of the best in Canada had to say. This is the first in a series of essays that share ideas, emotions, ways to cope — and bring us together.

A friend of mine, when he begins a novel, always reads the last page first. Perhaps he wants no surprises, perhaps he wants to read for voice rather than plot, or, perhaps he doesn’t want to read in the dark. He claims that any novel that can be spoiled by knowing the ending isn’t worth reading. This is the same friend who reads in large gulps, like a dog bolting down food. He is fast, he is efficient — he read “The Idiot” in one day. Is this impatience? Rapacious desire? A need to dominate the narrative?

I have been thinking of my friend these days as we experience the virus that has affected billions of people. What do you do if the ending of this story has not yet been written and you cannot skip to the last page, if the narrative is constantly changing? We would like to believe that we are the authors of this story, not the virus. If it were otherwise, we would all throw up our hands and hug each other.

As a writer of fiction, I live under the illusion that stories can be shaped, that I have control of my characters and their actions, and that I can determine the various voices, and the structure of the novel. Of course, every story has a structure, even ones with dire endings, and just because we don’t like dire endings doesn’t mean that the story can be ignored. In our story, right now, it is difficult to trust the narrator, or the many narrators. And this makes it difficult to keep reading. I mean that literally. Many people I speak with are having a hard time concentrating on reading. Oh, news works. Facts. And more news. And more facts. But at some point, the news bleeds together and so we have a reappearance of the same story. Eternal repetition. Eternal return. But why this difficulty with fiction?

Some say they have found it easier to go back to Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf. Well-worn stories, where the endings are known. The familiar. Read what is safe. Others, those who can parcel up the world, are devouring fiction. My father reads Revelations and calls to tell me about the pale horse. I am reading “Threshold” by Rob Doyle, a young Irish writer. It is drug and sex addled — a quest for dead writers, a search for meaning. Which is what all novels worth their salt do: they deal in death. They trigger our imaginations, and our memories.

I am also reading “Decameron,” a plague novel by Bocaccio, a story of seven women and three men who go up to a deserted villa in Italy during the Black Death — this is the 14th Century. Each night, for ten days, they gather and tell stories to each other as a distraction or as a reminder of better times. The stories are not about the plague and death, but about life. The tales are often sexual, and full of trickery. Freed from the morality of the city their stories grow wild and wanton. Even the nuns of the villa have their wily ways, seducing a deaf mute who cannot out them.

Another book: “The Plague,” by Camus. Like many a reader, I recently went back and reread the novel, and discovered that Camus had captured, in 1947, the intricate details and emotions and dread that we experience today — the failing economy, the rich going short of practically nothing, letting the weak die, herd immunity, fear of the other, the efficacy/inefficacy of wearing a mask, flattening the curve, ‘doubtful cases’, finger-pointing, the bravery of the doctor, the nurse, the undertaker. Camus of course is dealing with more than a plague foreshadowed by dead rats. He is looking at how the plague is both outside of us and inside of us. He is saying that Yes, our bodies may survive, but if we don’t recognize the interior pestilence, we will be diminished metaphysically. At the end of the novel, as the fear of the plague fades, the rodents return. Beware the rats. What is astounding about Camus’ novel is the use of facts, the counting of the dead, and the utter banality of the pestilence. “The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.” First goes imagination, then goes memory.

I watched a YouTube video recently, in which a psychoanalyst said that during this time humans are regressing. He said that the virus has normalized paranoia and has literally scared the s--t out of us — hence our need to hoard toilet paper. We have lost our sense of control, our sense of the future, and therefore we have lost our sense of time. We are in isolation, stuck here forever, never ending, eternal. Usually, time passes from the past to the present to the future. And that future includes death, for all of us. No one wants to live forever. We just don’t want to die quite yet, not in this manner.

My daughter, who is in isolation in Montreal with her husband and their four-month-old daughter, sent me a Sylvia Plath poem called “Nick and the Candlestick.” It is about a pregnant mother who wanders like a miner through her cave-like house, carrying a candle, talking to her unborn child. It is perfect for our times, in that it recognizes the child to come, the future. Plath ends the poem by pushing away dread and praising the unborn child.

Let the mercuric

Atoms that cripple drip

Into the terrible well,

You are the one

Solid the spaces lean on, envious.

You are the baby in the barn.

The baby in the barn. The book as barn. Do we build fictions like barns, to protect ourselves from the unknown? In literature, in art, in photographs, film, in any art form that succeeds, there has to be a sense of movement, of life beyond the frame, of the story continuing after we close the book.

Also, art requires work. It isn’t a Twitter feed, or Instagram — rather than being fed, we must learn to feed ourselves. As we read the narrative of our own plague, in real time, we keep looking for what is to come. We want hope. We need it. We want to sustain a sense of time. We must protect the baby in the barn.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-14,"A union representing Ontario health-care workers says it’s planning a series of escalating political and legal actions, including brief work interruptions, in response to the province potentially extending its emergency powers.

The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, a division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, says it’s pushing back against the province’s emergency order because it suspends their collective bargaining agreement.

Union president Michael Hurley says his members are going to start by sending their MPPs emails this week, explaining how the order damages their workplace rights.

The union says it’s also planning legal challenges and will hold rallies outside of its workplaces on Friday.

Members of the union will vote on Monday night to see if it will be necessary to have a brief work stoppage the next day.

Hurley says that while the emergency orders were acceptable in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s now a detriment to health-care workers and the emergency is over in most of the province.

A spokeswoman for the union confirmed on Monday that 98 per cent of its membership voted in favour of political action over the weekend.

Hurley says that his members are “angry” and will be holding a series of news conferences in Hamilton, Sudbury, Ottawa and Toronto this week to bring attention to the issues at the community level.

The Progressive Conservative government introduced a bill last week that would allow it to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

Hurley said the suspended agreement means hospital staff may have their shifts changed, be moved from site to site, or have vacation requests denied.

Read', 'Amy Smartthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-13,"KELOWNA, B.C.—British Columbia’s health minister says several COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna serve as a reminder of the risks posed by private gatherings.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

“When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

Interior Health also issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver after two positive tests associated with the farm. Public health officials are monitoring the situation and placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm, the government said in a news release.

The cases linked to Kelowna involved people who live in three regions of the province, including the Interior, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, said Dix. He credited contact tracers with making the connections.

He said the tourism industry has done a good job of creating safe environments for guests, but it’s also up to guests to ensure they respect physical distancing guidelines and group size limitations.

“Whether it’s a trip or a party at home, the same risks and the same rules apply,” Dix said.

If you’re gathering with friends and family, you should consider the increased risk that indoor locations pose and determine how many people can maintain a safe distance accordingly, he said.

“We have got to live with COVID-19 for the next year so that means the responsibility is on all of us to understand the risks and understand our responsibilities to one another.”

Interior Health issued an exposure advisory for the resort and bed and breakfast on Friday and added the restaurant and spin studio in a statement on Sunday.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also warns that a case or cases were confirmed on an Air Canada flight from Kelowna to Vancouver on July 6, but Dix could not say if that warning was linked.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority said it’s reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

Testing is recommended for anyone with novel coronavirus symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or a loss of taste or smell, said Interior Health.

“Milder symptoms may include runny nose, fatigue, body aches ... diarrhea, headache, sore throat, vomiting and red eyes,” it said in a statement.

Anyone with even mild symptoms is urged to stay home and avoid travel.

Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 include physical distancing, regular hand washing, not touching the face and avoiding gatherings of more than 50 people, the health authority said.

Read', 'Noushin Ziafatilocal Journalism Initiative Reporter', 'The Chronicle Herald', 'Local Journalism Initiative Reporter']",2020-07-13,"Nasra Gele calls her brother Abdinassir Abdille every single morning to check how he’s doing.

The siblings have been separated for more than 20 years. Gele and Abdille, along with their parents, moved to the Daadab refugee complex in Kenya after fleeing their war-torn homeland, Somalia, in 1991. Gele eventually came to Halifax in 1997, but her family stayed behind.

While she’s thought about her family members often throughout her time in Nova Scotia, the past few months have been especially difficult and their catch-up WhatsApp calls have become less and less lighthearted, according to Gele.

Abdille’s asthma has become more threatening over the last two years, and with COVID-19 preventing puffers and medication from flowing to the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she worries that her brother, too, will fall victim to the chronic disease. Asthma runs in their family and it claimed the lives of their aunt and grandfather.

“Every morning I talk to them to see how he’s doing. Some days he’s OK, some days he’s getting worse, sometimes it’s really scary,” said Gele.

“The situation is very, very hard now. Every night, my brother thinks (whether) he will die now or not. When he’s home and he’s sitting, really he cannot even breathe.”

Abdille’s 14-year-old daughter Nasteeh, who similarly suffers from asthma, has also been on Gele’s mind lately. Gele said the father and daughter have hardly stepped foot outside in the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their immuno compromised state.

United We Win Halifax, a private sponsorship group that met Gele through her translation and settlement support services for newcomers in Nova Scotia, has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to sponsor and bring Abdille, his wife and seven of their children who are under 18, to Halifax.

“We were really struck partly by how much Nasra was doing in the community, but also trying to support her brother (in Kenya), sending money to him to buy food and medication,” said Dave Aalders, a member of United We Win Halifax.

Aalders said Gele told him about the asthma attacks her brother would have where he “didn’t know (if) he was going to live” and the limited health care and access to medication at the refugee complex. That prompted the group to lend a hand.

“We want to be able to help,” he said.

“And also the fact that (Abdille) has been (at the refugee camp) since the early ‘90s and the world sort of tends to forget about some refugees, that bothered us as well, that there are folks that have been there for that long and haven’t had a chance to get out.”

The group’s GoFundMe fundraising goal is $10,000, but that will only cover a portion of the $30,000 that is required to bring a refugee family the size of the Abdille family to Canada and support them for one year, according to Aalders.

They have also set up accounts with some bottle depots in Halifax, allowing community members to exchange their bottles and have the money from that exchange go directly toward an account in the United We Win Halifax’s name to help sponsor the Abdille family.

“The sooner we can get the money raised, the sooner we can (complete) the application and get things rolling,” said Aalders, adding they want to sponsor other refugees, seeing how “the need is so great.” Aalders acknowledged that the federal government has put its refugee resettlement programs on hold during the pandemic, but said he hopes they will be able to bring the Abdille family to Canada soon as possible. “They’ll be able to (live) in a healthier environment and not have to worry about (Abdille) dying from not being able to breathe or (Nasteeh),” he said.

‘I would be really happy to see my family’

With the poor housing conditions, dust and extreme heat at the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she’s concerned the respiratory conditions afflicting her brother and niece will only worsen, making them more susceptible to COVID-19.

Gele had asthma herself, but recovered from the disease a year after arriving in Halifax. Living here, she said she’s grateful to have access to an emergency room or a puffer if ever she experiences an asthma attack, but recognizes her family is not so lucky.

Aalders said this is concerning, considering how the virus “could spread like wildfire” in a typically overcrowded refugee camp.

Ultimately, Gele said she wants her family to be able to live in “good health,” as she hopes for all people, and reunite with them in Halifax.

“For 25 years, I haven’t seen my parents or my brother or my family. I have seven children and my children have never seen their uncle or my parents, so I would be really happy to see my family,” she said.

“I want to say thank you so much to anyone supporting my family.”

Aalders said people can contact United We Win Halifax at unitedwewinhfx@gmail.com for more information about sponsoring the Abdille family or to pitch in for the bottle exchange initiative.

Read', 'Kevin Bissettthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Kevin Bissettthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"CHARLOTTETOWN—The confirmation of an eighth new COVID-19 case in Prince Edward Island in the past week could delay an easing of border restrictions, the province’s chief medical officer of health said Monday.

Dr. Heather Morrison said the latest cases are not the result of seasonal visitors to the province or the so-called Atlantic bubble, which the four provinces opened July 3 to allow travel within the region.

“But this situation raises questions about the possibility of the Canadian bubble,” Morrison told a news conference.

“Although ultimately this is not my decision, I believe it would be premature today to be considering a further loosening of our border restrictions and encouraging broader travel.”

The latest case is a man in his 40s who works in the emergency room at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown. Morrison said he tested positive Sunday night after being identified through contact-tracing of another case.

She said the health-care worker had come into contact with a Queen’s County woman in her 80s who went to the hospital by ambulance on July 4.

Morrison said the woman was not displaying COVID-19 symptoms when she was at the hospital and was not tested. She had no contact with anyone in the waiting room. She had diagnostic testing and then was taken home by family.

Morrison said the woman’s symptoms worsened Saturday and she called 811 and was tested. The results came back positive Sunday.

“This is a challenging and worrisome situation,” Morrison said Monday. “The increased number of contacts, both patients and staff, makes for a larger and more complex response.”

Morrison said the health-care worker had travelled to a Canadian destination outside the Atlantic provinces and returned to work July 4 after testing negative for COVID-19.

“Essential health-care workers who travel or arrive from elsewhere in Canada have been able to work as long as they are tested immediately prior to reporting to work and wear appropriate (personal protective equipment),” she said.

Morrison wouldn’t say what role the person has in the emergency department, but he worked seven shifts between July 4 and 11.

She said 100 patients and 125 staff have been identified as contacts and will be tested.

“I encourage anyone who was at the QEH emergency department between July 4 and July 11 to be patient and calm. Not everyone who went to the emergency department during this period will need to be tested,” Morrison said.

She said anyone who flew on WestJet Flight 654 from Toronto to Charlottetown on July 2 should call 811 or their family doctor about testing.

She said it is hoped the spread to patients and staff at the hospital has been limited.

P.E.I. has now had 35 cases of COVID-19, including 27 that are considered recovered.

Read', 'Nicole Thompsonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-13,"Teachers in Ontario’s northern school boards are sounding the alarm about back-to-school plans, saying the region’s vast geography and sparse population present challenges not considered in southern parts of the province.

School boards provincewide are still in the process of developing contingency plans for September, and while the teachers say reopening will be hard for everyone, they note that the general guidelines developed by the Ministry of Education don’t take into account the lack of resources in the Far North.

“We want to be in the schools. We want to be delivering quality education,” said Kim Douglas, president of the local elementary teachers’ union for the Keewatin-Patricia District School Board. “(But) I don’t think they have enough equipment, enough cleaning, enough help to even allay the fears that people are feeling, going back into the school.”

The Dryden, Ont.-based union representative, who spent three decades as a teacher, said schools in her board are few and far between, and have scant staff.

In one school, she said, there’s one full-time teacher, a part-time teacher and an education assistant. There’s no administrator, which raises a new host of problems during a pandemic.

“When there’s no administrator on site, and a kid gets sick, what do you do?” Douglas said. “Who’s gonna be responsible for that child?”

But the barriers to remote learning are also greater up north, she said.

“A lot of us don’t have Wi-Fi abilities at our homes,” Douglas said. “We pay an exorbitant amount of money to get Wi-Fi. And for us to do online learning, it’s been a challenge for many members. I’ve had members who have paid upwards of $700 for their Wi-Fi, just to do the distance learning.”

And while she noted that the risk of contracting COVID-19 in her region is relatively low, many people live along the Trans-Canada Highway and could be coming into contact with truckers and other travellers who have recently been in coronavirus hotspots.

Louis Clausi, a representative for the northeastern unit of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association who was a high school teacher for 20 years, said the geography in his board is also an issue.

“For me to even drive from one end of my board to the other, to go from Kapuskasing to Cobalt, is a six-hour drive,” he said. “It’s hard for the board to organize such a large area and to deal with all these specific issues.”

He listed daycare and busing as two areas of particular concern.

And he said in his region, it’s even more important to come up with a plan quickly — some schools are due to resume in late August because they take a break in October for the hunt.

Education Minister Stephen Lecce has said boards are expected to prepare plans for three scenarios come September: regular in-class instruction with physical-distancing measures in place, full-time remote learning, and a hybrid model blending both approaches.

Lecce later said he expects all students to start the 2020-21 school year with the blended model, which will see no more than 15 students in class attending on alternating days or weeks.

But more recently, he’s expressed a preference for fully in-class learning and said it’s looking increasingly likely that it will be possible.

“That data’s fluid, but it’s moving in the right direction,” Lecce said late last week. “It gives us promise about our reopening plan to get to where those boards, a lot of parents and every member of our caucus wants to go — which is day-to-day learning. Our kids need it.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dragonfly owner Sandy Pasko greets customers from an appropriate distance and wears a face covering, as do her staff. She embraced these practices when she was first given the green light by the province to reopen the women’s clothing and accessories store. ​

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, customers entering stores and other commercial establishments in Brighton and other areas of Ontario are now required to wear a mask or face covering.

On July 7, the Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit (HKPRDU) asked owners and operators of commercial establishments in its jurisdiction to have policies in place that require people to wear a non-medical mask or face covering before entering their premises. Dr. Lynn Noseworthy, the Medical Officer of Health for the health unit, issued instructions to commercial establishments currently open during Stage 2 of the province’s reopening.

Those instructions were issued under the authority of Ontario Regulation 263/20 under the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

HKPRDU said masks or face coverings are required in establishments such as malls, retail stores, convenience stores, restaurants, personal service settings, grocery stores, bakeries, gas stations, indoor farmers’ markets and areas of mechanics’ shops, garages and repair shops that are open to the public.

For Pasko, it made sense to make face coverings required in her boutique from the get-go, she said. ​

“When we opened on May 19, it was masks right away, sanitizing and a limited number of people in the store,” Pasko told the Brighton Independent.

“Medical experts are saying (masks) help to protect each other and because physical distancing is difficult in spots in our store, I want to keep our staff and families safe and all of our customers safe.” ​

The majority of Dragonfly’s patrons are receptive to the policies she has in place, Pasko said. She offers customers the option to book personal shopping appointments if they can’t wear a mask or if they feel more comfortable being in the store without other patrons. “That way it satisfies everyone.” ​

There are exemptions for the face mask requirement, which include people with certain medical conditions and children under the age of two, or a child under the age of five either chronologically or developmentally and he or she refuses to wear a face covering and cannot be persuaded to do so by his or her caregiver.

When the news broke about the mask requirement in Brighton’s commercial establishments, Sarah Hilwerda, president of the Downtown Business Improvement Area (DBIA), hit the core and went into a few businesses to have conversations and hand out information packages from the health unit. ​

“The majority of them already had their personal protective equipment and physical distancing in place,” Hilwerda said. ​

“There were a couple of questions about where they could get more masks now that this is mandatory — was it being provided for them and how that was going to play out.” ​

HKPRDU told the Independent under the instructions it has issued, commercial establishments are not required to provide non-medical masks or face coverings to customers. If a customer does not have a non-medical mask, he or she can wear another face covering, including a bandana or scarf.

When asked for the best way to address someone who wants to enter an establishment without wearing a mask or a face covering, HKPRDU said owners or operators and staff of commercial establishments are asked to use their “best effort” to ensure patrons and members of the public wear a mask while in the commercial premise. ​

“This means offering a verbal reminder to the patron that mask use is required within the establishment or a verbal reminder about mask use if the person removes the mask while in the premise. No one should be denied service if they cannot wear a mask,” HKPRDU said. ​

“Employees will need to wear masks while in areas that are servicing the public,” the health unit added. ​

Brighton’s mayor, Brian Ostrander, recently said he supports the use of face masks in indoor public spaces. ​

“I certainly advocate for the use of a mask if people find that they will be in a setting that (makes) it difficult to physically distance,” Ostrander said.

“It is now my practice to use a mask whenever I am inside a building open to the public.”

Hilwerda, who owns The Cellar Door winexpert, said she expects wearing face masks, using hand sanitizer and practising physical distancing will be well-received at her shop. “Honestly, 100 per cent of our customers are happy to comply with that and feel safer because those measures are in place,” she said. ​

Moving forward in her capacity with the DBIA, Hilwerda said, “we will do whatever we can to support our businesses and to make people feel safe.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
245,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/07/13/nwt-ignored-in-alberta-monitoring-suspension-despite-agreement.html,"N.W.T. ignored in Alberta monitoring suspension despite agreement, emails show","['Bob Weber', 'Bwbob Weberthe Canadian Pressmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Bob Weberthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Bob Weberthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"EDMONTON—Alberta suspended environmental monitoring for oilsands companies without notifying the Northwest Territories, despite a legally binding agreement to do so.

The omission is revealed in a series of emails between the two governments obtained by The Canadian Press.

“We have been made aware ... that the Alberta Energy Regulator has indefinitely suspended several environmental monitoring requirements for major oilsands producers,” wrote Erin Kelly, the N.W.T.’s deputy environment minister to her Alberta counterpart.

“Do you have any information that can be shared about this?”

The May 15 email was written more than a week after Alberta’s regulator suspended a wide array of monitoring over what it said were public-health concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kelly said her government learned about the move from news reports.

Ten days later, Kelly had not received a response.

“This is concerning to many N.W.T. residents, who still maintain subsistence lifestyles,” she wrote May 25.

“With COVID-19 we have even more residents relying on food harvested from the land and it is almost certain that concerns related to reduced monitoring upstream will be brought up during (the upcoming legislative) session.”

Monitoring is expected to resume Wednesday.

The N.W.T. is downstream from the oilsands and in 2015 signed an agreement with Alberta that spelled out clear responsibilities on information-sharing, notification and consultation for cross-boundary waters.

In her second email, Kelly points to that deal.

“The (territory) has not been informed of or discussed new changes to monitoring as per (the agreement). I have yet to receive a response to my last email.”

An Alberta Environment and Parks email shows Kelly’s second note provoked an “urgent” request within the department for a response to her concerns.

In answer to a request for an explanation for the lack of consultation, Alberta’s United Conservative government provided a one-sentence email.

“There have been ongoing discussions and information-sharing with the N.W.T. on the status of ambient water quality monitoring at sites referenced in the Alberta-N.W.T. Bilateral Agreement throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in March,” wrote Alberta Environment spokesman John Muir.

Joslyn Oosenbrug, spokeswoman for the N.W.T. Environment Department, said several meetings were held in June to address the territory’s concerns.

“Alberta has committed to sharing information and discussing any changes to monitoring,” she wrote in an email. “Communication is ongoing, and includes emails and letters exchanged at the deputy minister and ministerial level.”

However, the territory wants a stronger voice in managing water flowing into its land. It wants a seat on several committees that determine how waters will be monitored “to ensure downstream interests are represented,” Oosenbrug wrote.

Marlin Schmidt, environment critic for Alberta’s Opposition New Democrats, said the snub showed a “lack of respect.”

“It’s really disappointing to me to see the government of Alberta is taking its relationship with other Canadians so lightly right now,” he said.

“When our government is complaining about the poor treatment that we’re allegedly getting from other Canadians, we should be treating (them) with the respect with which we expect to be treated.”

The N.W.T. isn’t the only interested group that wasn’t consulted about the suspensions. First Nations in the oilsands area, environmental groups, Alberta’s chief scientist and the scientific consultants who perform monitoring work all say they were left out of the decision.

The government has said the move was made in response to concerns from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers about operators not being able to meet certain monitoring requirements while complying with COVID-19 orders.

Alberta has yet to release work plans or budget for this year’s field season of a joint federal-provincial program responsible for environmental monitoring outside various oilsands leases. Industry, which funds the efforts, has been lobbying heavily for a less extensive and cheaper plan.

Indigenous groups share impact of border closures,"['Nick Wells', 'Nwnick Wellsthe Canadian Pressmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Nick Wellsthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Nick Wellsthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"Indigenous bands along the west coast of British Columbia say their borders will remain closed to tourists and non-residents, despite the economic impact, as they work to raise awareness about the threat COVID-19 poses to their communities.

The Nuu-chah-nulth, the Heiltsuk Nation and the Haida Nation have all closed or restricted access to their territories and reserves.

“Of course it’s negatively impacting. But our directors have said, our chiefs have said, people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, the president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, in an interview. “I think everyone is slowly realizing the impact economically, but right now we just really feel that we want to protect the members first.”

Members of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, made up of 14 First Nations along the west coast of Vancouver Island, have deployed a variety of tactics to help ensure their borders are kept sealed from non-residents.

Members of the Ahousaht First Nation, who live in the remote area of Flores Island, have deputized citizens to act as peacekeeping officers, Sayers said.

The Ahousaht issued a notice on July 2 that their territory, which covers a large area of land and water north of Tofino, B.C., including provincial parks, will remain closed to tourists and non-residents as there “is still no vaccine, no antiserum and no cure for COVID-19.”

Others, like the Tla-o-qui-aht in Tofino, stopped cars in an effort to convince them to turn around.

The concern, Sayers says, lies in the ability to test and contain any potential COVID-19 outbreak.

“A lot of our communities are remote and testing is not easily available,” she said. “If you’re in Port Alberni, or Nanaimo, or Victoria, or somewhere (else), you can get testing and get results in 24 hours. It’s not the same with our communities.”

The closures have resulted in disputes between Indigenous groups and local businesses.

The Haida Nation in Haida Gwaii have turned away non-residents at the ferry terminal, discouraged leisure travel and called on two local fishing lodges to rethink their reopening plans.

“We’re such a close-knit community, I think that once we get a case of COVID, I think that it’ll spread like wildfire,” said Duffy Edgars, the Chief Councillor of the Old Massett Village Council in Haida Gwaii.

Edgars said many local fishing lodges are respecting the Haida Nation’s state of emergency, but is frustrated by others who want to open up.

“It’s disrespectful,” he said. “These bigger (lodges) are coming in and just doing whatever they want.”

Leaders and representatives from the Nuu-chah-nulth, Heiltsuk and Haida all say they would like to see more co-operation from the provincial government in working with Indigenous communities.

“It’s really frustrating,” said Marilyn Slett, the chief councillor of the Heiltsuk. “We have a limited amount of time here, we think, before that anticipated second or third wave so right now is the time for us to be sitting down and having those discussions so going forward we’re all working collaboratively together.”

Part of the issue, she says, lies in B.C. politicians encouraging residents to take part in interprovincial tourism.

“We’re seeing a lot more vessel traffic on the coast, we’re seeing a lot more recreational boaters, and that’s a really high concern for our community,” said Slett.

The closures — many of which began in March — have been felt at a variety of levels.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of the Heiltsuk’s Spawn-on-Kelp fishery this year, an event Slett says employs 700 people and is a hugely important economic driver for the community.

“Certainly our community put forward the health and safety before the economic driver,” she said. “So our community has been hit hard.”

Sayers says when the pandemic first broke out and restrictions were placed on communities, First Nations were bringing in food for members so they didn’t have to leave their reserves and face possible exposure at grocery stores.

The Heiltsuk, Nuu-chah-Nulth and the Tsilhqot’in issued a statement in late June, criticizing the provincial government’s reopening plan and what they saw as a lack of dialogue with First Nations groups.

All three want the province to commit to four conditions which would allow border restrictions being lifted: COVID-19 information sharing, screening, rapid testing and culturally-safe contract tracing teams.

Until those are met, Slett says, she can’t see Indigenous communities fully opening their borders.

But the provincial government says it is committed to working with Indigenous communities.

“Many tourist-depending communities are now safely welcoming the gradual return of out-of-town visitors,” said Sarah Plank, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “At the same time, we acknowledge some smaller and more remote communities and First Nations continue to be concerned about visitors to their communities.”

The government is also working on scheduling a meeting with the Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsilquot’in, Heiltsuk and Haida Nations and other communities, she added.

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file is no longer updating. Click here to read the latest coverage. Web links to longer stories if available.

9 p.m.: British Columbia’s health minister says several COVID-19 exposures in Kelowna serve as a reminder of the risks posed by private gatherings.

Adrian Dix said during a news conference Monday that warnings of possible exposures at a restaurant, spin studio, bed and breakfast and resort are believed to stem from “private parties” at the hotels.

Eight positive tests for the disease are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9, said an email from Interior Health, the regional health authority.

“When people come together for private parties — in this case it was primarily people in their 20s and 30s — the risks are considerably higher,” Dix said.

The exposures follow the move to a new phase of reopening in B.C. that allows for tourism within the province. Although the accommodation industry was not ordered to close during the pandemic, many operators did so voluntarily but began welcoming guests again as part of the new phase.

Infections in B.C. inched up on Monday as health officials announced 62 new cases since Friday.

Two more people also died for a total of 189 deaths in B.C.

The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in the province to 3,115, while 2,718 people have fully recovered from COVID-19.

7 p.m.: Toronto reports a jump of 120 cases and three deaths over the last three days.

Meanwhile, as of 5 p.m. Monday, Ontario’s regional public health units are reporting 38,875 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 with 2,759 deaths.

That’s an increase of 258 cases and six deaths from 21 hours before. The jump in cases can be blamed on the fact that a number of local units don’t report on the weekend.

6:22 p.m.: Saskatchewan is reporting another 56 active cases of COVID-19 in the province since Friday.

Health Minister Jim Reiter says the new cases are concentrated in the province’s southwest but are spreading north.

He says local public health authorities are working with area Hutterite colonies to control and contain the spread.

Opposition leader Ryan Meili says Reiter waited too long to announce the new infections.

He points out that over the weekend the province developed 25 new cases — an increase of more than 50 per cent in active cases over two days.

Saskatchewan now has 90 active cases and 871 cases overall.

5:38 p.m.: The Alberta government is giving out 20 million more masks to help stem the spread of COVID-19, but Premier Jason Kenney says it’s not necessary to make face covers mandatory.

In June, the province began distributing non-medical masks through A&W, McDonald’s and Tim Hortons drive-thrus.

In the latest batch, nine million masks are to be given out through the fast-food chains, both at counters and drive-thrus, and in packages of eight instead of four.

Four million are to be distributed through municipal transit and 2.5 million have been given to places of worship.

The rest are being doled out at long-term care and seniors facilities, First Nations and Metis settlements, courthouses and other places.

5:05 p.m.: NBA says two of 322 players tested positive during quarantine at Disney campus in Orlando. “Those players never cleared quarantine and have since left the campus to isolate at home or in isolation housing.” Nineteen players tested positive in market and never got to the bubble in Florida.

5 p.m.: COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of Canada’s biggest marathon.

The Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon, which was scheduled for Oct. 18 and traditionally draws Canada’s top runners because of its fast course, has been cancelled due to health and safety concerns.

“Sadly, we have reached a point where it is clear we will not be able to bring a mass event of 25,000 people from more than 75 countries, safely to downtown Toronto this October,” race director Alan Brookes said in a statement.

COVID-19 has shut down numerous major marathons around the world, including the storied Boston Marathon and the New York City Marathon, leaving runners in search of qualifying marks for next summer’s postponed Tokyo Olympics in a bind.

This year’s Toronto marathon will instead be a virtual event to be held between Oct. 1st and 31st, and will include two new distance options — a four-person marathon relay and a 10K — as well as the traditional marathon, half marathon and 5K.

Last year’s race featured 25,000 runners from 70 countries. The livestream broadcast had 132,000 viewers from 79 countries.

4 p.m.: Toronto Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, says the situation is improving — city is averaging 40 new COVID-19 cases a day — but we must continue to be vigilant to avoid a second wave.

3:57 p.m. Mayor John Tory announces that the current ban on festivals in Toronto will continue to the end of September. This includes the cancellation of the annual waterfront marathon. Nuit Blanche, which attracted 1.2 million visitors last year, moves online. The annual Scotiabank waterfront marathon will be conducted online this year.

3:50 p.m. The city of Toronto is launching a new program, called DriveTO, which will provide temporary drive-in entertainment, including films and sports broadcasts, at locations including Ontario Place.

3:45 p.m. Toronto Mayor John Tory and city officials will provide an update on the city’s COVID-19 response. A livestream of the news conference will be available on thestar.com.

3:44 p.m. Manitoba has recorded 13 consecutive days without a new COVID-19 case and, with more people recovering, is down to one known active case.

Dr. Brent Roussin, chief public health officer, says health officials are looking at loosening some of the remaining restrictions on businesses and public activities.

He says the 100-person cap on outdoor public gatherings could be eased, but warns very large gatherings in stadiums and similar venues are unlikely to happen any time soon.

Roussin says the novel coronavirus is still a threat, and rising numbers in some other jurisdictions mean there is still a chance it can be imported.

He also says caution will be needed in the fall and winter when flu season arrives.

Manitoba has recorded a total of 325 COVID-19 cases and seven deaths since the pandemic began.

3:30 p.m. The resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States ignited fierce debate Monday about whether to reopen schools, as global health officials warned that the pandemic will intensify unless more countries adopt comprehensive plans to combat it.

“If the basics aren’t followed, there is only one way this pandemic is going to go,”said the director of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “It’s going to get worse and worse and worse.”

Debate over the risks the virus poses, and how best to fight it, were spotlighted in Florida after it shattered the record among U.S. states for the largest single-day increase, with more than 15,000 newly confirmed cases.

Officials and health experts in hard-hit Miami pushed back against pressure, both from Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Donald Trump, to bring students back to classrooms next month.

“We just absolutely cannot risk the health of children, their well-being and safety, or any of our colleagues,” said Karla Hernandez-Mats, president of the United Teachers of Dade union and a middle school teacher herself. “We’re probably going to have to go to a full shutdown mode. I can’t see the schools reopening except with the 100% virtual model.”

3:20 p.m. People traveling between Nunavut and Churchill, Manitoba, no longer have to isolate for two weeks.

Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s chief public health officer, announced on Monday, July 13, the latest easing of restrictions in place to keep COVID-19 out of the territory.

“It’s safe at the moment,” Patterson said. Nunavut remains free of any confirmed cases of COVID-19, and health officials in Churchill are “pretty certain” there’s no cases in that community.

Medical travelers between Churchill and Nunavut haven’t had to isolate since June 22.

The “common travel area,” as Patterson calls it, applies to land, water and air travel.

In order to be exempt from the requirement to isolate for 14 days before entering Nunavut, travellers must be going between Churchill and Nunavut or Nunavut and Churchill only.

3:09 p.m. Statistics Canada says Canadians’ buying patterns changed so much during the COVID-19 pandemic that its measure of consumer inflation went a little wobbly.

The agency previously reported that year-over-year inflation declined by 0.2 per cent in April, then took a further drop of 0.4 per cent in May as lockdowns put a damper on consumer spending.

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don’t weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation. And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

The research paper made public Monday says a specific consumption pattern, such as that happening during the pandemic, would need “to be sustained in order to have a subsequent impact” on year-over-year headline numbers.

3 p.m. Canadian business organizations welcomed Monday’s extension of the federal wage subsidy, but say changes are needed to the program so that more employers can use it.

The federal government is extending its wage subsidies for companies hit hard by COVID-19 until December, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday.

The subsidy covers 75 per cent of wages up to $847 weekly for employees of companies and non-profits that have seen a drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent.

The government has said the eligibility rules may be tweaked so that businesses aren’t discouraged from growing for fear of being cut off from the aid.

“We need to make sure the subsidy is appropriate for the challenges facing enterprises in actually rehiring and getting people back to work,” Finance Minister Bill Morneau said last week.

The subsidy, which had paid out $18.01 billion to 252,370 companies as of July 6, is one of the federal government’s programs aimed at supporting the economy amidst the pandemic.

2:52 p.m. For the second time this year, Hong Kong Disneyland Park is closing temporarily following the city’s decision to ban public gatherings of more than four people because of the coronavirus pandemic, Disney officials said Monday.

Disney officials posted on the resort’s website that the Hong Kong park was closing Wednesday until further notice. The resort’s hotels will remain open with adjusted levels of service, Disney officials said.

The resort is closing “as required by the government and health authorities in line with prevention efforts taking place across Hong Kong,” Disney said on the website.

Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, announced new coronavirus-related restrictions Monday and she urged the private sector to put in place work-from-home arrangements for employees.

On Monday, 41 out of 52 coronavirus infections reported in Hong Kong were locally-transmitted cases. Since July 6, Hong Kong has reported 250 new cases, with Monday’s tally being the highest since March.

2:38 p.m. Florida’s rapidly increasing number of coronavirus cases is turning Miami into the “epicenter of the pandemic,” a top doctor warned Monday, while an epidemiologist called the region’s situation “extremely grave.”

Those assessments came as Florida recorded more than 12,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases Monday after a record-setting weekend, a spike that partly reflects the larger number of tests being performed but also a high percentage of those returning positive. The state set a national record with more than 15,000 cases reported Sunday.

While the outbreak has been spreading through much of the state, it has hit South Florida particularly hard, both now and throughout the pandemic. Its three counties — Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach — make up about a quarter of the state’s population but have been responsible for about half the new cases.

Florida International University epidemiologist Dr. Aileen Marty called the region’s situation “extremely grave,” saying the public is not taking this virus seriously enough, ignoring rules on large gatherings, social distancing and wearing masks in public places.

2:15 p.m. Premier Francois Legault has announced mask-wearing will be mandatory in all indoor public places across Quebec starting Saturday — just in time for the province’s annual construction holiday.

Businesses will be expected to enforce the new rules and are subject to fines of between $400 and $6,000 if their customers are caught violating the health directive, Legault told reporters Monday in Montreal.

He said the government is considering imposing fines on individuals at a later date. People who for medical reasons cannot wear masks are exempt from the new rule, Legault added.

The premier said his government held off making mask-wearing indoors mandatory until now because it wanted to impose restrictions on Quebecers gradually. The new rules enter into effect July 18, at the beginning of the two-week construction holiday, during which Quebecers are expected to travel around the province with their families.

“It’s easier to wear a mask than to return to being confined,” Legault said, adding the province has seen a slight increase in the number of daily new COVID-19 cases.

“I know it’s summer,” he said. “It’s holidays. It’s not fun to wear a mask, but its essential to avoid going backwards.”

1:56 p.m. The confirmation of an eighth new COVID-19 case in Prince Edward Island in the past week could delay an easing of border restrictions, the province’s chief medical officer of health said Monday.

Dr. Heather Morrison said the latest cases are not the result of seasonal visitors to the province or the so-called Atlantic bubble, which the four provinces opened July 3 to allow travel within the region.

“But this situation raises questions about the possibility of the Canadian bubble,” Morrison told a news conference.

“Although ultimately this is not my decision, I believe it would be premature today to be considering a further loosening of our border restrictions and encouraging broader travel.”

1:55 p.m. President Donald Trump started the week in the fight against the coronavirus by amplifying the fact-free claim of right-wing personality Chuck Woolery that “the most outrageous lies are about COVID-19.”

As case numbers set new records daily and hospital units fill up in hot spots, Trump chose Monday to retweet the onetime “Love Connection” host’s dubious words of wisdom.

“Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust,” Woolery wrote in a grammar-challenged tweet that Trump shared with his millions of followers.

In the face of the strong resurgence of coronavirus, some of Trump’s far right-wing #MAGA supporters like Woolery, who has no medical background, have taken to denying the reality of official infection totals and attacking public health experts.

The White House is now abandoning all pretense of a cordial relationship with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s premier pandemic doctor, who is warning that the pandemic is quickly spiraling out of control.

Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who also has no medical expertise, slammed Fauci for being wrong on several issues early in the pandemic. Fauci acknowledged that he hasn’t spoken with Trump in nearly two months.

The national infection rate is hitting new seven-day average highs on a daily basis and the death toll has also turned higher as the virus slams populous Texas and Florida especially hard.

1:40 p.m. Auston Matthews confirmed Monday that he tested positive for COVID-19.

“It didn’t hinder my training,” the 22-year-old star centre said as the Maple Leafs opened training camp at the Ford Performance Centre. “I was able to do stuff at home (in Arizona). Obviously, I wasn’t allowed to leave or anything. I was skating beforehand, but had to take 21/2, three weeks off the ice.

“Pretty much asymptomatic. I felt for the most part pretty normal for the two weeks. I did my quarantine and I’m healthy now.”

Matthews took part in the first portion of the opening training camp session in preparation for their best-of-five Stanley Cup qualifying round series against the Columbus Blue Jackets, starting Aug. 2.

1:30 p.m. Russell Westbrook of the Houston Rockets said Monday that he has tested positive for coronavirus, and that he plans to eventually join his team at the restart of the NBA season.

Westbrook made the revelation on social media. As recently as Sunday, the Rockets believed that Westbrook and James Harden — neither of whom travelled with the team to Walt Disney World near Orlando last week — would be with the team in the next few days.

In Westbrook’s case, that now seems most unlikely.

“I tested positive for covid-19 prior to my teams departure to Orlando,” Westbrook wrote on his Instagram page. “I’m currently feeling well, quarantined, and looking forward to rejoining my teammates when I am cleared.”

Westbrook also offered a word of caution in his post.

“Thank you for all the well wishes and continued support,” he wrote. “Please take this virus seriously. Be safe. Mask up!”

1:25 p.m. A First Nation in central Alberta is warning that a non-resident member who visited the community has tested positive for COVID-19.

The Samson Cree Nation says in a memo posted on social media that it has been told by a community health nurse that contact tracing has begun.

Officials say the person may have transmitted the virus while visiting Maskwacis.

They say the person is self-isolating away from the community, but they are trying to identify anyone who may have come in contact with the visitor in the community or at Ma-Me-O Beach.

Anyone who has been identified as a contact is being tested, and there are currently no active cases in Maskwacis.

The memo says non-essential programs and services have been closed for two weeks.

“During the closure, all face-to-face meetings are prohibited and the council chambers will remain closed,” said the memo posted Monday. “Please organize all meetings virtually.”

1 p.m. Indoor restaurants, bars, gyms, and cinemas will reopen Friday in most of Ontario except for the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and parts of the southwest, says Premier Doug Ford.

The premier announced Monday that much of the province will enter stage three of the framework for reopening as new cases of COVID-19 continue to remain low.

That’s good news for Ottawa, Brant County, Peterborough, Grey Bruce, Kingston, Kitchener-Waterloo, Guelph, Muskoka, Sudbury, North Bay, and a slew of other regions.

But Toronto, Peel, Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand-Norfolk, as well as Windsor-Essex, and Lambton will remain in the current second stage of reopening.

Ford said those regions would reopen “at a later date” as long as new cases of coronavirus stay steadily low and public health officials give him the green light.

12:18 p.m. Military sentries are returning to their spots in front of the National War Memorial and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as the threat posed by COVID-19 appears to be receding.

The Canadian Armed Forces has posted a ceremonial guard at the monuments near Parliament seven days a week from April to November since 2014.

The sentry program was established both as a way to honour the sacrifices of those who have served in uniform and to protect the memorial and tomb from vandalism and other acts.

This year’s iteration looked like it might be cancelled entirely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the military says it was decided after talks with Ottawa city officials that the sentry program is a “low-risk outdoor activity” and one way to return a sense of normalcy after months of lockdown.

The first sentries took up their positions this morning and the guard will remain in position five days a week until Nov. 10.

Sentries normally stand guard seven days a week, but the military says it will be using a reduced schedule this year.

While visitors often stand beside the sentries for photographs, they are being asked to remain at least two metres away from the sentries because of COVID-19.

12:11 p.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says bilateral discussions are continuing on the Canada-U.S. border, which remains closed to non-essential travel as the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to rise. Trudeau says he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call earlier Monday.

He says the two countries will make an announcement before the current border agreement expires next week.

12:05 p.m. Health officials are monitoring several cases of COVID-19 exposure in Kelowna, B.C., and say they’ve identified two more locations where people may have contracted the respiratory illness.

Interior Health says in a statement issued Sunday that a restaurant and spin studio have been added to the resort and a bed and breakfast identified on Friday in an advisory about the Okanagan outbreak.

An email from the health authority says eight positive tests for the virus are linked to visits to downtown Kelowna and the city’s waterfront between June 25 and July 9.

Visitors to the Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 or the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to July 5 were advised Friday to self-isolate and monitor themselves closely for symptoms.

The health authority is now urging visitors to Kelowna’s Cactus Club restaurant on Water Street between July 3 and July 6, or the Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 to self-monitor and get tested if COVID-19 symptoms appear.

Public health contact tracing is underway and the health authority says it is reaching out directly to anyone who has been exposed, where possible.

11:44 a.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he’s very sorry he didn’t recuse himself from the government’s decision to award a contract to WE Charity to manage a major student-volunteering program.

He says his and his family’s longtime involvement with the WE organization should have kept him out of the discussions.

And he says he’s particularly sorry that the delay in the program caused by WE’s eventual decision to withdraw will harm students looking for ways to help in the COVID-19 pandemic.

11:37 a.m. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government planning to extend its program to subsidize wages in companies hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic until December. More details are expected this week.

The program is the heart of the government’s promise to help Canadians get back to work, even if has to be at a slower pace, as the pandemic wanes.

11:16 a.m. A health-care worker at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown is the eight person on the Island to test positive for COVID-19 in the past week.

Chief medical officer of health Dr. Heather Morrison said today the man in his 40s tested positive Sunday night after being identified through contact-tracing of another case.

Authorities say he had been in contact with a Queen’s County woman who tested positive on the weekend.

The woman, in her 80s, had gone to the hospital by ambulance on July 4 and came into contact with the health-care worker.

Morrison says the worker had travelled in Canada, but outside the Atlantic provinces, and returned to work July 4 after testing negative for COVID-19.

P.E.I. has now had 35 cases of COVID-19, including 27 that are considered recovered.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 13, 2020.

Correction, July 13, 2020: This entry has been updated from a previous version said the worker was infected by the patient.

11 a.m. As Ontario prepares to further reopen the economy, the province is reporting 116 new cases of COVID-19.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that 29 of the province’s 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases, with 21 of them reporting no new cases at all.

“Having seen a continued decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province entered stage two, and with hospitalizations being at all-time lows, today we’re providing details about stage three of our plan to continue the safe and gradual reopening the province,” Elliott said on Twitter.

There are 104 patients in Ontario hospitals with coronavirus, 28 of whom are in intensive care units. Of those, 20 are on ventilators.

10:35 a.m. Amid pervasive backsliding on social distancing, Britain and France are weighing whether to require people to wear masks in public places.

Scientists say the two countries’ governments should have done so ever since they started easing lockdowns — like many other European nations did – instead of exposing their populations to the risk of infections from mass dance parties and summer vacationers who think there’s no longer anything to worry about.

Whether to make masks mandatory isn’t just a matter of debate in the United States, where infection rates are still climbing fast.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged U.K. residents Monday to wear face coverings in shops and other tight indoor spaces — but stopped short of making it compulsory.

Critics have accused Johnson’s government of failing to provide clarity on mask-wearing in the days since he began backtracking on its previous advice that suggested face covers were not necessary. After the prime minister then was photographed wearing one in a shop, government ministers appeared on TV urging personal choice in the mask issue.

Meanwhile, France’s government said Monday it’s considering requiring masks in all indoor public places amid signs of a small rise in confirmed virus cases – and a big drop in public vigilance. French scientists have pushed for such a requirement in recent days as families crisscross the country for summer vacations, but the government has remained cautious.

10:04 a.m.: Gyms in Boston are welcoming back members and the iconic duck boat tours are rolling out again as the city enters the third phase of its coronavirus economic restart.

Boston begins Phase 3 on Monday, a week after most of the rest of Massachusetts, allowing museums, movie theatres, historical sites and gyms to reopen with certain restrictions.

The New England Aquarium and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum are among those expected to reopen this week.

Boston Duck Tours are also beginning on Monday. The company says its limiting the number of people on the duck boats so guests can socially distance and is requiring face masks for staff and guests.

9:23 a.m.: Health authorities in Thailand are seeking to trace the contacts of two recent foreign arrivals in the country who were infected with the coronavirus and may have violated quarantine rules.

The two cases, an Egyptian military officer and the 9-year-old child of a diplomat from Africa, surfaced as Thailand marked seven weeks with no local transmissions of the coronavirus. With few foreigners allowed to legally enter the country, all other recent cases have involved Thai nationals repatriated from abroad.

That recently arrived foreigners were cleared for entry despite testing and quarantine procedures meant to keep them isolated has caused concern as Thailand considers how and when to reopen on a larger scale to foreign tourists.

9:11 a.m.: Teachers in Ontario’s northern school boards are sounding the alarm about back-to-school plans, saying the region’s vast geography and sparse population present challenges not considered in southern parts of the province.

School boards provincewide are still in the process of developing contingency plans for September, and while the teachers say reopening will be hard for everyone, they note that the general guidelines developed by the Ministry of Education don’t take into account the lack of resources in the Far North.

“We want to be in the schools. We want to be delivering quality education,” said Kim Douglas, president of the local elementary teachers’ union for the Keewatin-Patricia District School Board. “(But) I don’t think they have enough equipment, enough cleaning, enough help to even allay the fears that people are feeling, going back into the school.”

The Dryden, Ont.-based union representative, who spent three decades as a teacher, said schools in her board are few and far between, and have scant staff.

In one school, she said, there’s one full-time teacher, a part-time teacher and an education assistant. There’s no administrator, which raises a new host of problems during a pandemic.

“When there’s no administrator on site, and a kid gets sick, what do you do?” Douglas said. “Who’s gonna be responsible for that child?”

(UPDATED) 9:00 a.m.: A government source says Quebec Premier Francois Legault will order that mask-wearing be mandatory in all indoor public places in the province starting Saturday.

The premier is expected to make the announcement this afternoon in the company of Dr. Horacio Arruda, the province’s director of public health.

Owners of shops and other enclosed public spaces would be responsible for ensuring the new regulations are respected.

Individuals are not expected to face fines for non-compliance.

Companies that do not ensure clients and patrons follow the rules, however, could face fines of between $1,000 and $6,000.

A bylaw making face coverings mandatory on public transit in the province came into effect today.

8:50 a.m.: A May 17 Ipsos poll indicated that only 20 per cent of Canadians anticipate travelling outside Canada in 2020; 50 per cent would not be at all likely to do so.

Undoubtedly, they are influenced by Global Affairs Canada’s ongoing COVID-19 travel advisory, recommending that Canadians “avoid all non-essential travel outside Canada and to avoid all cruise ship travel until further notice.” The ban has meant that Canadian insurers are not issuing travel health insurance for people who ignore the advisory, putting snowbirds at risk for health expenses related to COVID-19 and other ailments.

8:28 a.m.: The United States was grappling with the worst coronavirus outbreak in the world on Monday, as Florida shattered the national record for a state’s largest single-day increase in new confirmed cases.

Meanwhile, two World Health Organization experts were part of a mission in China to trace the origin of the pandemic. The virus was first detected in central China’s city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing had been reluctant to allow a probe but relented after scores of countries called on the WHO to conduct a thorough investigation.

Deaths from the virus have been rising in the U.S., especially in the South and West, though they are still well below the heights hit in April, according to a recent Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.

“I really do think we could control this, and it’s the human element that is so critical. It should be an effort of our country. We should be pulling together when we’re in a crisis, and we’re definitely not doing it,” said University of Florida epidemiologist Dr. Cindy Prins.

Here’s how to explain the nasal swab,"['Megan Ogilvie', 'Megan Ogilviehealth Reportersun.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Megan Ogilviehealth Reporter', 'Health Reporter', 'Megan Ogilvie Is A Toronto-Based Health Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-12,"With the launch of CampTO this week, thousands of Toronto kids will be leaving their homes, some after weeks of isolation, for daylong fun in parks and recreation centres across the city.

Along with the chance of sunburns, scraped knees and other summertime mishaps, kids will also have an increased risk of getting COVID-19 — even with the strictest safety precautions in place.

CampTO, the city’s scaled-down summer program for children ages six to 12, starts July 13 and will have COVID-19 precautions.

Among its detailed safety protocols, which include wearing masks indoors, assigned individual start times and daily health screenings, CampTO requires any camper with symptoms to get tested for COVID-19 — and have proof of a negative result before returning to the program.

Parents may fear that few kids, from toddlers to teenagers, will welcome a long, thin flexible swab up their nose. But Natalie Wilson, a certified child life specialist at the Hospital for Sick Children, said that with help from a trusted caregiver, many kids cope well with the nasopharyngeal swab to test for COVID-19.

As of July 4, some 61,555 children under the age of 19 had undergone COVID-19 testing in Ontario, according to data provided to the Star by Ontario Health. The data, compiled by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, shows the following age breakdowns for those under 19 who got tested: 28,435 teens between the ages of 15 and 19, 9,996 children between the ages of 10 and 14, 9,263 children between the ages of five and nine, 6,380 children between the ages of two and four and 7,481 children under the age of two.

Wilson, who has more than eight years experience assisting children through difficult and sometimes painful medical procedures, said it’s crucial to set kids up for success for their first COVID-19 swab, especially as some will need to be tested more than once during the pandemic.

“If they feel a sense of accomplishment and mastery — a feeling of ‘oh, that wasn’t so bad’ — they can reflect on those positive experiences to increase their coping and co-operation if they have to have a swab in the future.”

Here, Wilson offers advice on how parents and caregivers can help kids through the uncomfortable — but absolutely necessary — COVID-19 test.

How can I prepare a child for a nasopharyngeal swab?

It’s important to explain to children why they need a nasal swab and provide that information in a way that’s appropriate for their developmental age, Wilson said. This helps take away the fear of the unknown, which can lower some of their anxiety and increase their co-operation with the procedure.

For school-age children and preschoolers, Wilson suggests a short, straightforward explanation; too many details can be overwhelming. “It can be something like: Our noses have information inside them that let a doctor know if your body is growing a virus or not. This will let them know if your body needs some extra help to get better in case the virus is inside your body.”

Older children and teenagers are likely to have a greater understanding of the pandemic’s impact worldwide and might be scared about the virus hitting close to home. Wilson said it’s important to listen to the fears of older children, clear up any misconceptions they might have and explain that getting tested for COVID-19 is safe and something many kids and adults are doing now.

“You want to normalize it, let them know it’s not something specific to them.”

Should I tell kids what to expect at a COVID-19 assessment centre?

Explaining the specific steps of a nasal swab — giving children some predictability in the process — is another way to help reduce their anxiety, Wilson said. Older children can have the information ahead of time to process it and ask questions, while younger children can be told what is happening right before the procedure or as each step unfolds.

First, tell kids the people they meet at the testing centre will be wearing personal protective equipment. “Do this in advance so they aren’t overwhelmed to see someone wearing a mask and face shield and gloves.”

Next, explain their specific role, which is “to sit as still as possible and look up at the ceiling so the nurse can see their nose better,” Wilson said.

Then briefly describe how the nurse will put a thin, flexible swab into one of their nostrils for about five seconds, take it out and put it into the other nostril for about five seconds.

“It’s important to be honest about what they will see, hear and feel,” Wilson said. “We usually let kids know it will feel strange or a bit uncomfortable for the few seconds the swab is in their nose but there are ways to make the process a little easier.”

How can I help a child during a nasal swab?

A hug-like hold from caregivers can make young children and school-age kids feel more comfortable during the procedure — and help them stay still, said Wilson, adding that this trusted adult can also help kids tilt their chins back.

Taking big breaths through their mouth and squeezing a caregiver’s hand or a stress ball during the procedure helps many kids. As well, a favourite song or show are good distractions during the procedure, she said.

“A caregiver can hold a tablet or phone above a child’s head to encourage them to look up.”

If a child gets upset after the swab goes in the first nostril, Wilson recommends a brief break — three big, deep breaths, for example — before the nurse swabs the second.

Throughout, it’s important for caregivers to validate a child’s feelings, no matter their age, Wilson said. “Whether it’s stress or fear or anxiety, let them know it’s OK to feel that way and that you are going to do this thing together.”

Is there something I can do to help a child after the procedure?

No matter how a child coped, Wilson said it’s important to follow up with positive messages and provide specific praise for the things they did well, such as sitting still or looking up at the ceiling.

“Something specific like ‘I know that was hard for you, but you did a great job squeezing my hand’ … rather than ‘I’m so proud of how brave you were.’ Being specific about what they did well can be helpful for a future swab because you can go back and remind them of those positive things they did.”

Offering a small token or reward or doing a favourite activity when they get home after the swab is another — and often very welcome — way to provide positive reinforcement.

And it’s really important, even in the heat of a stressful moment, not to promise that a child won’t have to have another swab. “With the pandemic, it’s always a possibility; we don’t want to make promises that could potentially break a child’s trust.”

How can I help a child who is worrying while waiting for test results? What can I say to a child after a positive test result?

For kids who worry, remind them nasal swabs are common right now because everyone is being extra careful, said Wilson, adding that health experts recommend adults talk specifically about COVID-19 to differentiate this virus from other illnesses. And be sure to explain that just because you got a nasal swab doesn’t mean you have COVID-19.

For those who do test positive — or if a family member tests positive — it’s critical to remind children of any age that it’s not anybody’s fault, Wilson said.

“Younger, school-age children might have the misconception that they did something wrong,” she said. “For example, they might think that yelling at their sibling is why they are being punished with having COVID-19. Older children might think they didn’t wash their hands enough or follow precautions enough and feel guilty.

“Children need to know it’s not anybody’s fault. That even though everyone takes the proper precautions, the virus is very contagious and can still get into our bodies. And if they do get COVID-19, they need to know there are lots of people to help them.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Sunday, Ontario reported 129 new cases of COVID-19, but there are only 116 people in hospital, 29 in intensive care units with just 19 on ventilators.

“Hospitalizations (and) ICU admissions have both decreased with the number of vented patients being relatively stable,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Twitter.

“Locally, 27 of Ontario’s 34 public health units reporting five or fewer cases, with 18 of them reporting no new cases at all.”

The government says 2,719 have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic took hold in March, but the Star has determined the actual death toll is slightly higher.

That’s because early in the outbreak some deaths were not included since COVID-19 tests had not been done before the people — mostly elderly long-term-care home resident — died.

On Friday, Ford signalled he would have some positive news soon.

“I’ll have to get back to you on Monday, but we’re having some great announcements next week. But you just have to say tuned,” he said.

The premier was less bullish about when playgrounds would be allowed to open. While splash pads and some other outdoor recreations are available to children, slides, swings, and climbing structures remain closed.

“What I’m being told from our medical officer of health and other people ... (is) kids are on there, they’re touching and feeling, you know, sneezing, everything else,” said Ford.

“It will get open. But hopefully in stage three, we can open enough. It’s hard to disinfect the playground every time kids go on there. I’m not going to chance anything when it comes to our children,” he said.

“We’ll find other ways to entertain the kids instead of going on the monkey bars.”

Ford sounded more confident about restaurants and bars serving customers.

“We’re looking at all aspects of that. We just want to be cautious. But eventually, we have to open up the bars. We have to open up restaurants inside,” he said.

“We have to get people back to work. And that’s what our goal is.”

Ontario has been in a state of emergency since March 17. That is expected to continue until July 24.

But after the temporary emergency declaration expires, the Progressive Conservatives expected to have given themselves more permanent powers to restrict businesses from opening if there is a second wave of COVID-19.

Even in the third stage of reopening, the government has warned that large gatherings will continue to be prohibited, meaning concerts and sporting events will be unlikely to occur with crowds in attendance.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country’s known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

“This is the big effort over the next four weeks,” said Andrew McArthur, director of the biomedical discovery and commercialization program at McMaster University.

“What’s going to come out of there pretty soon is a glimpse of what just happened, how did it move around the province, how did it move between provinces or how big was Pearson (airport) in the early days of the airport being open.”

Knowing how the virus spread will show where there were weaknesses in public health measures early on, said McArthur. Being able to keep divining genetic codes from samples will mean when there are flare-ups of cases, they can be quickly compared to each other to see if they’re all related or are coming from multiple sources.

It means, for example, a long-term care centre should be able to quickly know if its 10 new cases are because one case spread widely or arose from multiple carriers coming into the facility.

“That’s a very different infection-control problem,” said McArthur.

It also means that maybe, just maybe, the second COVID-19 wave most think is coming won’t be as bad, or as hard to control, as the first, because the sources can be isolated very quickly.

“A second wave is likely,” McArthur said. “But we’ve never spent this kind of money and effort before, either, so maybe we’ll beat it.”

The kinds of genetic technology being used for this project did not exist when SARS hit Canada in 2003.

This genetic mapping is constantly on the lookout for mutations. Thus far, SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has not mutated as quickly as many others do. Influenza, for instance, changes so much over a year the vaccine has to be retooled every summer to keep up.

But there are enough subtle changes still happening among the 28,000 individual markers that make up a genome for SARS-CoV-2 that cases can be traced backward and linked to the ones that came before. McArthur said it takes a lot of data storage, a lot of high-capacity computer analysis, and a lot of money, to run the comparisons among them all.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

Genome Canada is administering the project, with six regional genomics agencies overseeing the work locally and labs like McArthur’s doing the testing and analysis. The funding is intended to create genetic maps from 150,000 patients. Canada thus far has had about 108,000 positive cases, and the expectation is that almost every one of them will be gene-mapped.

The results will be loaded into a global site comparing all known infections of COVID-19, but also be analyzed for national and regional reports.

In New York, genetic sequencing was used to figure out that COVID-19 in Manhattan wasn’t coming from China and Iran as imagined, but from Europe. In Canada, it is suspected that much of the virus came into this country from travellers returning from the United States in early March. But the work is only now beginning to confirm that belief.

McArthur estimates the first data will be available for Ontario in about four weeks, but warns it will take many more months to complete all of the tests. His lab sequenced 600 samples on Wednesday alone.

Overall, McArthur expects the genetics project to last for two years.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Sunday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

9:39 p.m.: Mexico surpassed Italy on Sunday in the number of COVID-19 deaths, and has become the world’s fourth-deadliest nation.

Deaths rose by 276 to 35,006, according to data released by the Health Ministry on Sunday. Cases rose by 4,482 to 299,750. Over the last two weeks, total deaths in Mexico also overtook Spain and France, as Latin America has increasingly become a hotspot for the pandemic.

Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has prioritized reactivating the economy over enforcing strict lockdowns, a strategy that has drawn criticism that his government hasn’t taken the virus seriously enough. Like other Latin American countries, Mexico has vulnerable populations where people must work to meet basic needs and live in crowded quarters, adding to the challenge of enforcing social distancing.

The country posted repeated record rises in cases this week, with health officials reporting more than 7,000 new confirmed cases for the first time Thursday night. Despite that, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell has said the illness is not spreading in the country as quickly as it was.

8:55 p.m.: Toronto FC and D.C. United, whose opening match at the MLS is Back Tournament was postponed early Sunday in the wake of worrying COVID-19 tests, will now play at 9 a.m. on Monday.

Major League Soccer confirmed the rescheduled start on Sunday evening. Toronto didn’t make it out of the hotel for the 9 a.m. kickoff Sunday after a pair of COVID-19 tests prompted the match to be called off minutes before it was scheduled to start at the ESPN sports complex in Orlando, Fla.

The league said a round of pre-game testing Saturday had returned a positive test for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player. The positive test was considered unconfirmed until backed up by a second test.

“Both teams participated in another round of testing today, and all players from the two clubs tested negative,” the league said. “Based on those results, the game will be played (Monday) morning at 9 a.m. ET.

“The player who received an initial positive test and the player whose test was inconclusive will undergo additional testing and will not play in (Monday’s) match.”

7:28 p.m.: As new cases of COVID-19 remain manageable and hospitalizations decrease, Premier Doug Ford will announce Monday that Ontario is moving into the third stage of reopening the economy.

Senior government officials confirmed to the Star on Sunday that the premier is set to announce that more businesses and attractions will be able to open by the end of this week.

That means restaurants and bars, which are restricted to serving meals and drinks on patios, could be allowed to offer indoor dining as long as patrons maintain safe physical distancing.

Sources close to Ford, speaking on background in order to discuss internal deliberations, said officials are poring over the data from regional public health units to determine which regions can open first.

As it was with stage two, which took effect last month, Toronto and Peel Region will likely be among the last regions to reopen. Durham, Halton, York, Hamilton, London, and Ottawa should open sooner.

4:55 p.m.: The peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in Florida will be “sometime in front of us in July,” AdventHealth’s president and CEO said Sunday on the CBS show “Face the Nation.’

Terry Shaw said that his projection is assuming that people practice social distancing and wear masks to slow the spread of the virus.

His remarks come as Florida on Sunday reported 15,300 new COVID-19 cases, once again shattering its record for a single-day increase in cases since the pandemic began and for the first time breaking a national one-day record, according to The New York Times. The statewide total, including nonresidents, is now 269,811.

Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, also on “Face the Nation,” said, “Things are going to get worse before they get better” and that some models show that there’s “possibly going to be a peak in the next two or three weeks.”

As cases continue to skyrocket, Disney this weekend reopened some of its parks and the NBA is preparing to resume televising games later this month from the resort.

More than 4,200 Floridians have died due to COVID-19 infection since the beginning of the pandemic.

3 p.m.: Prince Edward Island woman in her 80s has tested positive for COVID-19, the province’s chief public health officer said Sunday.

In a brief statement, Dr. Heather Morrison said the Queens County woman is self-isolating at home and contact tracing is underway.

Morrison said the new case is not believed to be linked to a recent COVID-19 cluster in P.E.I. or to a Charlottetown seniors’ residence where a worker had tested positive.

On July 4, the P.E.I. government had announced three confirmed COVID-19 cases, including a woman in her 20s who worked at Whisperwood Villa. They were the first cases in the province since late April.

1 p.m.: Oshawa has hired a private security company to patrol its downtown to help crack down on the vandalism, drug use and violence that have exploded in the area during the pandemic, a move that’s drawn criticism from anti-poverty advocates who say it will further stigmatize the homeless.

In June, city council unanimously passed a motion to spend $100,000 to hire CDN Protection Limited to “provide a higher level of security enforcement with specially trained guards who are more able to address these types of situations occurring at Memorial Park and throughout the downtown.”

According to the city motion, since businesses have shut down due to COVID-19, there has been an increase in vandalism, drug use, graffiti, violence and defecation around the downtown over the past few months. The area’s residents and businesses have also expressed concerns about their safety.

12:20 p.m.: Florida on Sunday reported the largest single-day increase in positive coronavirus cases in any one state since the beginning of the pandemic.

According to state Department of Health statistics, 15,299 people tested positive, for a total of 269,811 cases.

California had the previous record of daily positive cases — 11,694, four days ago. New York had 11,571 on April 15.

The numbers come at the end of a grim, record-breaking week in Florida, with 514 fatalities. On Sunday, 45 more deaths were reported.

Throughout May and into June, the state reopened much of its economy with some restrictions.

Testing has increased, but the percentage of people testing positive has risen even more dramatically. A month ago, fewer than five per cent of tests came up positive on a daily average. Over the past week, the daily average exceeded 19 per cent.

Because of the increase in cases and the positivity rate, doctors have predicted a rise in deaths, saying the mortality rate usually increases two to four weeks later as some of those infected get sicker and eventually die. Health experts are concerned that people are gathering in crowds, and have expressed concern that the Republican National Convention’s nomination party for President Donald Trump will be held in Jacksonville in August.

11:50 a.m.: Quebec added 114 new COVID-19 infections today as health officials in Montreal urged bar patrons and employees having frequented an establishment since July 1 to get tested.

With the new confirmed cases, the province has now had 56,521 cases of COVID-19.

The province also added seven further deaths linked to the virus for a total of 5,627. Of those, three deaths were reported in the past 24 hours.

On Saturday, Montreal’s public health authority urged people and employees having frequented bars since Canada Day to get tested after at least eight cases started in five Montreal bars.

Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante also took to Twitter to call on citizens falling into the public health warning to get tested.

10:40 a.m. (updated): Ontario is reporting 129 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 36,723 cases. The province also processed 25,726 tests.

Three more deaths were reported for a total of 2,719.

Hospitalizations, ICU admissions have both decreased with the number of vented patients being relatively stable, Health Minister Christine Elliott tweeted. There are 116 patients in hospital, with 29 in ICU and 19 of them on a ventillator.

She tweeted that 27 of Ontario’s 34 public health units reported five or fewer cases, with 18 of them reporting no new cases at all.

10:15 a.m.: Health experts say that using Toronto and Edmonton as hub cities for the NHL’s Stanley Cup playoffs probably isn’t a danger to public health in the age of COVID-19.

But they add there are no guarantees and the system has its flaws, including the movement of bus drivers, hotel staff and others in and out of supposedly coronavirus-free bubbles; a dependence on testing that can be less than 100 per cent accurate; and whether professional athletes, teams and the league can be trusted to follow and enforce self-isolation rules after a player tests positive.

9:18 a.m.: Toronto FC’s opening match against D.C. United at the MLS is Back Tournament was called off Sunday after one positive and one inconclusive test for COVID-19.

The inconclusive test came from a Toronto player while the positive test was from a D.C. United player. Both players and teams are being retested.

MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott made the announcement just minutes before the scheduled 9 a.m. ET kickoff at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports complex.

The match will be rescheduled once results of the new tests come back, Abbott said.

It marked the teams’ second delay. There were supposed to meet Friday night but the game was pushed back to Sunday due to Toronto’s late arrival at the tournament because of additional COVID-19 testing.

7:51 a.m.: When a few cases of COVID-19 popped up in Kingston in late June, contact tracers immediately started looking for patterns.

For months they had kept infections low, with just two discovered the entire month before. So where did these new ones come from? What could the patients have in common?

It turned out that two of them had recently gotten their nails done. That crucial clue helped public health officials quickly link the cluster back to a west-end salon, test over 6,000 people, and get hundreds more to self-isolate.

As we emerge from months of lockdowns, the virus that causes COVID-19 could be lurking anywhere. A nail salon, a restaurant patio, a wedding or funeral. But with new infections and deaths down across Ontario and in the GTA — on Friday the province announced there were fewer active cases than there have been since before the April peak of the outbreak — we may soon be in a situation where we can proactively fan out the flames. As the epidemiologists call it: “cluster busting.”

Read the full story on “cluster busting” from the Star’s May Warren here.

7:18 a.m.: The governor of Japan’s Okinawa island demanded a top U.S. military commander take tougher prevention measures and more transparency hours after officials were told that more than 60 Marines at two bases have been infected with the coronavirus over the past few days.

Okinawan officials on Sunday reported a total of 61 cases — 38 of them at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and another 23 at Camp Hansen — since July 7. They said that U.S. military officials told them the two bases have since been put in lockdown.

The disclosure of the exact figures came only after Okinawa’s repeated requests to the U.S. military.

7:11 a.m.: South Korea has reported 44 additional cases of the coronavirus over the past 24-hours, maintaining an uptick in new infections in the greater Seoul area and central cities.

The additional figures released Sunday took the country’s total to 13,417 with 289 deaths. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 21 of the newly reported cases were local transmissions, all of them recorded either in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area or two central cities.

7:01 a.m.: India’s coronavirus caseload is nearing 850,000 with a record surge of 28,637 in the past 24 hours, prompting authorities to announce a weeklong lockdown in the key southern technology hub of Bangalore. The new confirmed cases took the national total to 849,553.

The Health Ministry on Sunday also reported another 551 deaths for a total of 22,674. India has overtaken Russia in the number of cases and is currently behind the United States and Brazil, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Southern Karnataka state, whose IT hub Bangalore is home to Microsoft, Apple and Amazon offices, extended Sunday lockdowns to one week beginning Tuesday.

6:59 a.m.: Australia’s worst-hit Victoria state reported 273 new cases on Sunday, the sixth straight-day of triple-digit increases.

State Premier Daniel Andrews said a man in his 70s died overnight, bringing Australia’s death toll to 108, including 24 in Victoria, which currently has 1,484 active cases. A sudden surge in COVID-19 saw Victoria report a record 288 infections on Friday and 216 Saturday.

Australia’s most populous state New South Wales reported five new cases on Saturday. Andrews warned Victorians “this is a dangerous time.”

The major city of Melbourne is in virtual lockdown and Andrews said “we simply have no choice but to acknowledge the reality that we face and to do what must be done. That is to follow (the) rules, to only go out when you need to and to only go out for purposes that are lawful.”

6:50 a.m.: Taiwan wrapped up an annual film festival with an awards ceremony Saturday night as it holds more public events after keeping its coronavirus outbreak to a few hundred cases.

Actors and others lined up for photo shoots with no social distancing, and participants didn’t wear masks in historic Zhongshan Hall in Taipei. Taiwan, with a population of about 23 million people, has had 451 confirmed cases and seven deaths.

6:10 a.m.: For the last four months, Canada’s public health experts have been racing to stop the spread of COVID-19 by trying to figure out how everyone is getting it, and whom they may have given it to.

But even the best efforts have left doctors stymied about the source of more than one-third of this country’s known COVID-19 infections. Not knowing where cases come from makes outbreaks that much harder to stamp out.

Now medical researchers and supercomputers are turning genetics labs into virus detective agencies, looking first to find the novel coronavirus itself within blood samples from thousands of infected patients, and then comparing all of those isolated viruses to each other looking for places they differ.

Every close match will draw a line from patient to patient, ultimately painting a picture of how the virus spread.

Saturday 7:35 p.m.: U.S. President Donald Trump appeared in public wearing a face mask Saturday, after long resisting, as the country broke its own record for new coronavirus cases in a single day, with more than 66,600 fresh infections documented in 24 hours.

The U.S. has broken its own record in three out of the last four days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with the Friday total coming in above 66,600.

Trump donned the Navy mask, with an official presidential seal, as part of a photo-op as he visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It’s the first major such appearance, amid reluctance on the president’s part to be seen in public with a face covering.

“I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place,” Trump said before he left the White House for the visit. He has at times appeared to mock people who wore masks.

Read', 'Filipe Masetti Leitespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Filipe Masetti Leitespecial To The Starsun.']",2020-07-12,"CALGARY—The air was still crisp as the sun came up.

With violet low-hanging stratus clouds over the Rockies to my right and a fire-lit sky to my left, I began the final 27 kilometres of my journey across the Americas to the Calgary Stampede park.

After trekking more than 25,000 kilometres through 12 nations over the past eight years, this was my last day in the saddle. It wasn’t often that I wore a brand new 100x Smithbilt hat (a present from the Stampede) and donned a freshly pressed shirt for a day of riding, but on that beautiful Friday July 3, my last long ride from Alaska to Calgary was coming to an end, and I wanted to look my best.

Astride Mac, with my beautiful Argentinian girlfriend Clara Davel beside me on Smokey, and the president of the Calgary Stampede, Dana Peers, on a flashy palomino named Oz, we rode in silence. From the saddle I could see my El Dorado far off in the distance, downtown Calgary lit orange and gold by the rising sun.

I was nervous as hell and my horse could sense it. Mac pranced as we trekked south, the stunning Buckskin sensed how tense I was, my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. Smokey decided to ignore me and carried Clara with grace. Those two love each other.

Following highway 1A South, two shadows appeared in the horizon. When we got closer I realized the tall silhouettes were mounted police officers atop dark, glossy, and very wide, horses. I was quickly transported to all those times that strangers rode out to greet me, to accompany me, and keep me safe. Hearty ranchers, farmers, shopkeepers, civil servants, poor sharecroppers, criminals, lawmakers, millionaires and nil-ionaires, people from all across humankind ready to help me fulfil my dream.

“Good morning, we will be accompanying you today as you ride into downtown Calgary,” said one of the officers, a tall man in his early 40s. He almost tipped his helmet. I grinned my thanks.

We made a right turn onto 12 Mile Coulee Rd., and I nearly froze. On both sides of the road sat long lines of vehicles while about 50 volunteers, police officers and media personnel awaited our arrival.

“Filipe, CTV, CBC and Global Television are going to do live hits from here,” an excited volunteer told me as I stepped down from the saddle. It was a stark comparison to the past few weeks on the road. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we avoided civilization and followed the gravel Forestry Trunk Road from Hinton to Cochrane. In the middle of the Rockies and its foothills, we were immersed in the wild. Hard to imagine that only eight days ago I was followed by a male grizzly near Corkscrew mountain and now I was being happily ambushed by media here. Both scary experiences left my knees shaking in the saddle and my mouth dry.

After speaking to the media and thanking all of the selfless Calgary Stampede volunteers who even during this pandemic continue to show the strength of their community spirit, we began crossing the cosmopolitan city.

“Make sure you take in every second,” smiled Peers while we rode through sleepy subdivisions. By 9 a.m., even though we couldn’t release our route in advance due to the pandemic, the streets were lined with Calgarians of all ages. They were dressed in their western gear, bright smiles stamped on some faces and others hidden by masks, while social distancing.

“Welcome home Filipe,” I heard over and over again as I tried to contain the tempestuous storm brewing inside of me.

Under a now bright-blue cloudless sky, with the Bow River running to our left next to tall buildings reaching for the sky, I leaned down to pat Mac’s neck and thank him, then the tears started flowing. I cried so hard I began to hiccup. I couldn’t control it or stop it. It was like everything I had felt and experienced these past eight years just came pouring out of my soul at that moment.

On this journey I had a thousand homes. I was overwhelmed with images of the kind-hearted people who hosted me with meals lavish and humble. The stunning places I saw. The majestic horses I rode. In this wonderful country I spent time with the Osoyoos Indian Band and learned how to train wild horses from Master Horseman Aaron Stelkia. I rode next to Yukon’s Kluane Lake, soaked in BC’s Laird Hot Springs, struggled through a terrible snowstorm in the Rockies in the middle of summer. The clank of horseshoes, the creak of my saddle, rustle of leaves will always be my soundtrack.

And the amazing wildlife. I saw beavers, wolves, a giant cow moose nurse its calf. In fact, I explored the endless uses of moose. I ate moose lasagna in Teslin, Yukon. I attended the Adaka Cultural Festival in Whitehorse and saw how to make a moose hide canoe. I crossed paths with three bears per day in the southern Yukon, but the worst was that big menacing Albertan grizzly. Things are bigger here. And I know he knew that I ate bear meat pasta way back in Toad River, B.C.

Just after noon, I spotted the Stampede Park through Mac’s ears. It was eight years ago that I departed the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth, an unknown cowboy with an impossible dream. Before I rode out on that hot July 8 in 2012, many called me crazy. Said I wouldn’t make it. That I would die. Now, here I was, returning the Parade Marshal after having crossed the Americas in their entirety.

I reached for Clara’s hand and I thanked her for her commitment to this dream.

“Without you I wouldn’t be here, amor,” I said to her while she wiped tears from her beautiful face. I turned to Peers and saw that he too had teared up.

“Thank you for believing in me sir,” I said to him before we embraced. He grinned and nodded. We didn’t need any words.

When I stepped down from the saddle my high school friend Sheilagh Haney’s smile transported me home. Marie Aitken, who lent us the support vehicle for this final journey, hugged me tightly with tears running down her face. Then I hugged Laura, Peer’s wife. For a second, it felt like I was hugging my own mother. They were wonderful surrogates for my childhood friends and family who were not able to come due to travel restrictions.

After a live interview with Global Calgary we made our way to the stage in the infield where a ceremony took place. The stands, which would have been packed with thousands of tourists from all over the world, sat eerily empty.

Peers said a few words, then I tried to speak through my heavy tears and finally, Mayor Naheed Nenshi generously “White Hatted” me; Calgary’s version of giving someone the key to the city. An honour I now share with the Queen of England, the Dalai Lama, Bob Dylan, Bill Clinton and other well-known visitors to this lovely city.

Before the ceremony came to an end, they made the mistake of giving me a bottle of champagne to pop. I sprayed everyone before taking a long sip of the bubbly drink — I felt like the late, great Brazilian racing legend Ayrton Senna.

The gratitude I felt in my heart at that moment made me feel like I was levitating. From the hundreds if not thousands of people who helped me reach this dream during the past eight years and those who carried me during my last long ride from Alaska to Calgary.

It was thanks to the Calgary Stampede and its selfless volunteers, the mounted police and motorcycle unit, the cops in patrol cars, the first responders, and the city of Calgary, that I crossed the finish line safely.

After the ceremony it was time for more interviews and then to say a sad goodbye to our kids, Smokey and Mac. I’m so proud of these two majestic wild horses that I saw evolve from skittish equines into trusting animals. Their strength, resiliency and horsepower allowed me to ride the final 800 kilometres from Grande Prairie to Calgary in only a month and 10 days — a remarkable feat. They are the true heroes of this journey.

“I love you boys so much and I’ll see you soon …. now you rest,” I said before we loaded them up into the trailer.

Clara and I will miss them greatly.

Since the news came out about Dana Peers choosing me as the 2020 Parade Marshal in early June, many people have asked if I was heartbroken that the rodeo and parade were cancelled for the first time in more than 100 years. The year I would lead it all.

Truth is, when I first heard about the cancellation in April, it did make me sad. But if there’s one thing I have learned from this journey it’s that positivity is one of the most important things in life. It was the only reason I was able to take the first step back in 2012 and definitely why I arrived alive in 2020.

When you believe in yourself, focus, work hard and stay positive — no matter what is happening around you — your dreams can come true. If my Long Ride can leave you with one thought: I hope you find the courage to follow your dreams and the strength to continue even when a global pandemic rains on your parade.

Always remember, everyone carries a journey. Don’t forget to start yours.

Read', 'Collin Binkleythe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Collin Binkleythe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"In his push to get schools and colleges to reopen this fall, President Donald Trump is again taking aim at their finances, this time threatening their tax-exempt status.

Trump said on Twitter on Friday he was ordering the Treasury Department to re-examine the tax-exempt status of schools that he says provide “radical indoctrination” instead of education.

“Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,” he tweeted. “Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!”

The Republican president did not explain what prompted the remark or which schools would be reviewed. But the threat is just one more that Trump has issued against schools as he ratchets up pressure to get them to open this fall. Twice this week Trump threatened to cut federal funding for schools that don’t reopen, including in an earlier tweet on Friday.

It’s unclear, however, on what grounds Trump could have a school’s tax-exempt status terminated. It was also not clear what Trump meant by “radical indoctrination” or who would decide what type of activity that includes. The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately comment on the president’s message.

Previous guidance from the Internal Revenue Service lays out six types of activities that can jeopardize a non-profit organization’s tax-exempt status, including political activity, lobbying and straying from the organization’s stated purpose.

But ideology is not on the IRS’s list, said Terry Hartle, senior vice-president of the American Council on Education, which represents university presidents. Any review of a school’s status would have to follow previously established guidelines, he said.

“It’s always deeply troubling to have the president single out schools, colleges or universities in a tweet,” Hartle said. “Having said that, I don’t think anything will come of this quickly.”

In his latest threat, Trump revived his oft-repeated claim that universities are bastions of liberalism that stifle conservative ideas. He used the same argument last year when he issued an executive order telling colleges to ensure free speech on campuses or lose federal research funding.

His interest in colleges’ finances appears to have been renewed as several schools sue the Trump administration over new restrictions on international students. Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued to block the policy earlier this week, followed by Johns Hopkins University on Friday. The University of California system has said it also plans to sue.

The universities are challenging new guidance issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying international students cannot stay in the U.S. if they take all their classes online this fall. The policy has been viewed as an attempt to force the nation’s universities to resume classroom instruction this fall.

Under the rules, international students must transfer schools or leave the country if their colleges plan to hold instruction entirely online. Even if their schools offer a mix of online and in-person classes, foreign students would be forbidden from taking all their courses remotely.

The lawsuit from Harvard and MIT argue that the policy breaks from a promise ICE made in March to suspend limits around online education “for the duration of the emergency.”

Until Friday, Trump had mostly focused his efforts on reopening elementary and secondary schools as millions of parents wait to find out if their children will be in school this fall. He has insisted that they can open safely, and in a Friday tweet argued that virtual learning has been “terrible” compared with in-person instruction.

“Not even close! Schools must be open in the Fall. If not open, why would the Federal Government give Funding? It won’t!!!” he wrote. Trump issued a similar warning on Twitter on Wednesday, saying other nations had successfully opened schools and that a fall reopening is “important for the children and families. May cut off funding if not open!”

Trump has not said what funding he would withhold or under what authority. But White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has said the president wants to use future coronavirus relief funding as leverage. McEnany said Trump wants to “substantially bump up money for education” in the next relief package, but only for schools that reopen.

“He is looking at potentially redirecting that to make sure it goes to the student,” McEnany said at a Wednesday press briefing. She added that the funding would be “tied to the student and not to a district where schools are closed.”

But Trump’s control over school funding is limited. The vast majority of funding for public elementary and secondary schools comes from state and local sources, and non-profit colleges are more likely to rely on tuition or state aid than federal money.

His threats to withhold funding have been denounced by a growing array of education and health groups, including a medical association that the White House has repeatedly cited in its press to reopen schools.

In a joint statement with national education unions and a superintendents group, the American Academy of Pediatrics on Friday said decisions should be made by health experts and local leaders. The groups argued that schools will need more money to reopen safely during the coronavirus pandemic and that cuts could ultimately harm students.

“Public health agencies must make recommendations based on evidence, not politics,” the groups wrote. “Withholding funding from schools that do not open in person full-time would be a misguided approach, putting already financially strapped schools in an impossible position that would threaten the health of students and teachers.”

The American Academy of Pediatrics has supported a fall reopening, saying in June guidelines that schools should strive to start the academic year with their students “physically present in school.” Vice-President Mike Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and McEnany have repeatedly, and as recently as Wednesday, cited the group in defence of Trump’s approach.

But Friday’s statement acknowledged that it may be best for some schools to stay online. School leaders, health experts, teachers and parents should be at the centre of reopening decisions, the groups said, “taking into account the spread of COVID-19 in their communities and the capacities of school districts to adapt safety protocols to make in-person learning safe and feasible.”

Some districts have already announced plans for only a partial reopening, with a mix of in-person and online instruction. New York City’s public school district, the nation’s largest, said students will be in classrooms two or three times a week and learn remotely between. DeVos has opposed that kind of approach, saying it fails students and taxpayers.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Associated Press']",2020-07-11,"SREBRENICA, BOSNIA—Bosnia is marking the 25th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, the only crime in Europe since the Second World War that has been declared a genocide, with only a small number of survivors allowed to take part in commemoration events due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The brutal execution in July 1995 of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys is being commemorated in a series of events and the reburial of recently identified remains of nine victims in a memorial cemetery and centre just outside the town in eastern Bosnia.

The Srebrenica massacre is the only episode of Bosnia’s 1992-95 war to be defined as genocide, including by two UN courts. After murdering thousands of Srebrenica’s Muslims, in an attempt to hide the crime, Serbs dumped their bodies in numerous mass graves scattered throughout eastern Bosnia.

Body parts are still being found in mass graves and are being put together and identified through DNA analysis. Close to 7,000 of those killed have already been found and identified.

Newly identified victims are buried each year on July 11 — the anniversary of the day the killing began in 1995 — in the memorial cemetery just outside of Srebrenica.

Typically, thousands of visitors from various countries attend the commemoration service and funeral, but this year only a relatively small number of survivors will be allowed at the cemetery due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Dozens of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Spain’s Pedro Sanchez, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Britain’s Prince Charles, are addressing the commemoration ceremony via pre-recorded video messages.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"OTTAWA—The Trudeau Liberals’ fiscal update this week put a cost to all the emergency COVID-19 aid the federal treasury will dole out. It delivered some shocks: a gigantic deficit and a projection that the federal debt will top $1 trillion.

What is causing the federal deficit to hit $343.2 billion?

Late last year, the government forecast this year’s deficit at $28.1 billion. But the federal government is staring at a rapid drop in revenues due to the economic lockdown slashing the taxes people and businesses pay: that alone adds $81.3 billion to the deficit. Spending spiked by $236 billion for measures such as the $500-a-week emergency benefit for people whose work vapourized.

Combined, that borrowing will push the federal debt past $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year.

Former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page, in a post on Finances of the Nation, a website run by researchers and tax professionals, summed up what all that debt will mean for the government. He said future generations will pay for it through a mix of higher debt interest payments or taxes, “less fiscal room to address the next pandemic crisis or climate change,” or “less generous government programs.”

What’s the interest like on that debt? Can we afford it?

“Ironically, it’s not as hard as you think, thanks to record-low interest rates,” said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, a big mortgage company.

The government can borrow money for five years at less than 0.6 per cent interest, for 10 years at just slightly higher, and for 30 years at a touch over one per cent, she said, which makes the cost of carrying the debt less today than it was one year ago.

“It’s even less of a problem because the Bank of Canada is buying so much of it,” Cooper said of federal debt, referring to the $5 billion in federal bond purchases the bank is making weekly as a form of low-cost loans.

“So you have a buyer of last resort which will keep a lid on interest rates at least for the next year.”

The government calculates lower rates will save it $4 billion on debt charges this year. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday the government is going to increase its issuing of long-term bonds to 26 per cent from 14 per cent of offerings to capitalize on rates and help manage the debt.

Rates are eventually going to go up, though, and when they do, so will the amount taxpayers shell out on interest.

Are taxes going to have to go up?

Morneau rejected that idea for now, saying hiking taxes would cause more financial hardship. The New Democrats have asked for a wealth tax on the top one per cent, which the parliamentary budget officer calculated this week could net $5.6 billion.

Cooper said raising taxes while the economy is still recovering wouldn’t be wise because it would make Canada less competitive, which would make it more difficult to raise the necessary revenues to pay off the debt. That leaves another option, she said: Grow our way out of it.

How does that work?

The idea is as the economy grows, there will be more workers and companies paying taxes. The same debt, in raw dollars, is less of a burden on a bigger, more prosperous economy. The Liberals have favoured the “debt-to-GDP ratio” as a measure of the government’s fiscal health for exactly this reason.

In their fiscal snapshot, they predict that ratio will shoot up from 31 per cent last year to 49 per cent this year. Though that’s a big increase, the ratio peaked at just under 70 per cent in the mid-1990s.

To help growth along, government will need to spend on things like high-speed internet, Cooper said, or growing sectors like clean energy. Experts also note a need for greater government spending on child care to help mothers whose job losses have been greater, and returns to work slower, than fathers’ during the pandemic.

Even a best-case growth scenario may not be enough to keep the debt sustainable, said Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at Scotiabank, saying more “decisive action” is needed.

“If we don’t keep spending and we don’t get hit again like a depression type of growth scenario, then in theory we can grow out it, but that shouldn’t be enough,” she said.

What other actions could the government take?

Cutting spending is where most eyes will go, and Morneau promised another update or budget come the fall. Research suggests cutting spending, rather than raising taxes, is better at aiding growth out of a recession. It’s also less politically problematic than raising taxes, Young noted.

Tightening purse-strings too early could hamstring the Bank of Canada into keeping rates lower for longer, Young said, which would limit its ability to respond to whatever crisis comes next.

If spending is brought under control relatively soon, the debt should be sustainable, RBC chief economist Craig Wright and economist Colin Guldimann wrote in a report this week. If not, “the red ink could keep flowing,” highlighting the need for careful moves in the coming months.

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"OTTAWA—Conservative MPs said Friday their party doesn’t want to bring down the government over the latest ethics scandal ensnaring Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Current leader Andrew Scheer is in his final weeks in the job.

Party members are now voting for his replacement with the winner to be announced in late August.

Meanwhile, the issue is not going away.

The ethics commissioner has been called in to see if Trudeau broke conflict-of-interest law in awarding a multimillion-dollar contract to the WE organization, given Trudeau’s long-standing family ties to the organization.

The commissioner is also being asked to probe Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s ties as well — one of the minister’s daughters works for the organization.

The Liberals, and WE, have said there is no direct link between the awarding of the contract to run the $900 million Canada Student Services Grant program and the organization’s connections to the Trudeaus.

The Conservatives also say that revelations that the Trudeau family members have been paid by WE for speaking engagements in the past elevates the seriousness of the matter. The party says the police should investigate for possible fraud.

Trudeau himself was never paid.

Both ethics and criminal investigations take time.

The investigation by the ethics commissioner into the SNC-Lavalin affair was requested in February 2019 and completed in August of that year.

The Senate expenses scandal first broke in 2012 and it took two years for criminal charges related to fraud to surface in that case. Former Conservative senator Mike Duffy was acquitted on all of them in April 2016.

So, given that the Opposition Conservatives will have a new boss while the WE story likely continues to percolate, how will Scheer’s replacement seek to proceed?

The Canadian Press asked all four leadership candidates how they would deal with the scandal.

Leslyn Lewis

The Toronto lawyer said the ethics commissioner has proven himself capable in the past of getting to the bottom of Trudeau’s scandals and she trusts him to do that job here as well.

“The problem is that every time the ethics commissioner proves Trudeau has broken the rules, he just shrugs and moves on,” Lewis said in a statement.

“The only way to hold Justin Trudeau accountable is for voters to vote him out. I look forward to leading the charge and replacing him with an honest and ethical government.”

Lewis does not have a seat in the House of Commons. If she wins, she would have to appoint someone to be the parliamentary leader until she could get elected.

Peter MacKay

MacKay’s wife, Nazanin Afshin Jam, a human-rights activist, has spoken at WE events. His campaign says she has never taken money from the organization.

In an interview, MacKay said the WE controversy raises questions about the need to broaden and strengthen the power of the ethics commissioner, so if there’s a finding a politician broke conflict of interest law, they could actually be penalized.

He also suggested that a stronger ethics screen might be required for whomever is prime minister to ensure there can be no blurring of lines between a prime minister’s private life and public role.

In the meantime, MacKay, a former justice minister, said he thinks a criminal investigation into the WE contract could be warranted under Section 122 of the Criminal Code, which is breach of trust involving government officials.

The purpose of the section is to ensure government officials do not abuse their authority or their office, MacKay said.

By being in the cabinet room when the decision was made, knowing their family connection to WE, is a very serious thing, MacKay said.

“It’s essential we keep confidence in public office holders,” MacKay said. “This undermines that.”

While it is the kind of issue that could result in a motion of non-confidence in the Liberal government, it’s not that simple, MacKay said.

“We can’t lose sight of the bigger picture here which is the economic and health crisis that still rages on as a result of COVID-19,” he said.

“This is going to undermine severely the prime minister’s legitimacy and ability to govern throughout this period.”

MacKay also does not have a seat in the House of Commons. What levers of parliamentary power he might want pulled would have to be done by someone else.

Erin O’Toole

O’Toole has suggested the scandal brings with it the threat of a fall election.

When his campaign was asked whether he would seek to topple the government over it, a spokesperson did not directly answer the question, repeating only that they think the chances of a fall election are higher.

O’Toole supports his party’s call for a criminal investigation. In an email, campaign spokesperson Melanie Paradis said that given O’Toole already has a seat in the House of Commons, he would be ready take on Trudeau on this issue from “day one.”

“As leader, Erin will stand up for Canadians and get to the bottom of this corruption,” she said. His campaign did not say how he would do that.

O’Toole’s children have also attended WE events and he has spoken at one in his riding. His campaign said his family has never financially benefited from WE.

Derek Sloan

Sloan is also a sitting MP. His campaign did not return two requests for comment on what he would do to address the issue.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Holly Mckenzie-Sutterthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Holly Mckenzie-Sutterthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"ST. JOHN’S, N.L.—Cool temperatures didn’t stop hundreds of dog walkers, bikers and diners from flocking to St. John’s, N.L.’s main downtown street Wednesday evening.

Friends waved to each other across Water Street and approached newly built patio decks to chat, as residents of Newfoundland and Labrador’s capital basked in the product of a long-discussed vision that’s been fast-tracked by city officials during the pandemic: a pedestrian-only downtown.

“The city really got this right this time. We’re very happy,” Dick Barter, co-owner of Green Door restaurant, said while working on his establishment’s patio.

Barter, like other business owners on the colourful downtown strip, said he’s advocated for closing the street to cars for years.

Less than a week after the July 3 launch, Barter said he’s noticed an increase in business and his customers seem happy to be outside sharing a drink and a meal after staying home for months under restrictions meant to beat back the spread of COVID-19.

With one active case of the illness reported in the province, many restrictions on daily life have been lifted, and in June the capital city green-lit the pedestrian mall on Water Street to support struggling businesses reopening with new limits on capacity.

The experiment will run from July 3 until Sept. 7, closing four blocks of Water Street from noon to 10 p.m. each day, with picnic tables and other seating installed along the route.

Barter noted that businesses had just a few weeks to complete paperwork for their outdoor expansions, but he said the result has been worth it.

Water Street is one example of how cities are making quick changes to support businesses and cooped-up city dwellers in a physically-distanced world where outdoor public space is at a premium.

Cities around the world have introduced similar experiments since the pandemic began, closing some streets to cars and hastily expanding cycling routes, as Toronto mayor John Tory pledged to do in May.

In St. John’s, many hope the transformation on Water Street will become an annual fixture — including Liberal Finance Minister Tom Osborne, who has predicted tough times ahead for the province’s already troubled economy.

Osborne had a front-row seat to the new Water Street during his outdoor meal at The Merchant Tavern Wednesday. “It’s nice to see the economy start to take shape again,” he said.

Osborne said he’s happy with the outcome that he said resembles the bustling outdoor dining spaces he’s admired in other Atlantic Canadian cities that rely heavily on tourist dollars in the summer.

“I hope it lives beyond this year because it does bring more people downtown and it’s not only good for the hospitality industry but some of the shops down here may benefit as well,” he said.

Osborne wasn’t the only familiar face on the street Wednesday. Musician Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea fame was impressed by the turnout as he wandered to find a seat. “It’s fantastic, I’m glad to be down here,” Doyle said. “I can’t believe this is the first year it happened in my lifetime.”

A handful of people were wearing face masks but most had their faces uncovered, including waiters at a number of the busy restaurants. People recognized friends and talked standing close together, but for the most part people appeared to stick to their social groups.

Kelly Whittle spent the evening on Water Street with two girlfriends. The group said it was exciting to see the downtown changed into a vacationlike destination with enough room to safely spread out.

Although it’s been lauded as a success by residents and politicians, the modifications to Water Street are still being tweaked after some pointed out the changes didn’t consider the needs of residents with reduced mobility.

In Facebook post shared widely this week, Lisa Walters posted 48 photos of herself outside downtown spaces she was unable to enter in her wheelchair. She wrote that the new patios and tables on the street made it more challenging for her to navigate the space.

“The glaringly obvious thing to me was how sad it was that so many businesses could build these elaborate patios overnight, and still not have small wheelchair ramps into their stores or restaurants,” Walters wrote.

Mayor Danny Breen was one of the many people who commented on Walters’ post, saying city staff would review the issues she raised. Walters said in a Facebook message that a subsequent conversation with the mayor left her “hopeful that some changes will actually be made.”

A Friday news release from the city acknowledged room for accessibility improvements, and discussed a plan to develop a program to install ramps. “It is important to recognize that this is just the beginning,” Breen’s statement said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7:35 p.m.: U.S. President Donald Trump appeared in public wearing a face mask Saturday, after long resisting, as the country broke its own record for new coronavirus cases in a single day, with more than 66,600 fresh infections documented in 24 hours.

The U.S. has broken its own record in three out of the last four days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, with the Friday total coming in above 66,600.

Trump donned the Navy mask, with an official presidential seal, as part of a photo-op as he visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. It’s the first major such appearance, amid reluctance on the president’s part to be seen in public with a face covering.

“I’ve never been against masks, but I do believe they have a time and a place,” Trump said before he left the White House for the visit. He has at times appeared to mock people who wore masks.

3:44 p.m.: After 117 days, Disney World opened Saturday to the general public after the coronavirus pandemic swiftly shut down the Flordia amusement park.

People who snagged advance reservations in addition to tickets or annual passes could visit the Magic Kingdom or the Animal Kingdom Saturday. Epcot and Hollywood Studios will be open again starting Wednesday.

“Disney World is a world very different than the one that closed back in March,” said Robert Thompson, founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. “Going to Disney World for that experience in the past was so fundamentally defined by the very things that now have to be regulated.”

Disney loyalists won’t line up to get the best view of the daily Magic Kingdom parade. Guests can only see a lone float or a marching band spontaneously travel around the route as entertainment.

And kids can’t hug Mickey Mouse.

3:40 p.m.: Cases of COVID-19 in Florida pushed past a quarter million Saturday, as the state reported 10,383 additional people with the disease.

The state posted 95 additional deaths. A state summary released Saturday morning listed 188 additional deaths, but that appears to have been a miscalculation.

Neither total is a record, but both reflect the worsening trends of the past two weeks. The record for deaths was set Thursday, with 120.

3:37 p.m.: Thousands of Israelis demonstrated in downtown Tel Aviv on Saturday, protesting what is widely seen as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s failure to address economic woes brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Many Israelis think the government has not done enough to compensate hundreds of thousands of workers who lost their jobs as a result of restrictions and shutdowns. Unemployment has surged over 20 per cent, and Netanyahu has seen his popularity plummet.

The protest was organized by unemployed, self-employed, entrepreneurs and business owners who gathered in central Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square. Participants wore masks, but did not appear to be following social distancing rules. One man held a photo of Netanyahu with the words “The No. 1 Corrupt Person.”

“We are not working already nearly five months and unfortunately most of us have not received any compensation from the Israeli government and this is really a tragedy,” said Daniel Tieder, a protester. “In every country all over the world people have received compensation and support from their government. Unfortunately, here in Israel, nothing yet.”

On Thursday, Netanyahu announced an economic “safety net” promising quick relief to the self-employed and stipends over the coming year for struggling workers and business owners. The government is expected to approve the plan Sunday.

1 p.m.: Case numbers rose steadily in B.C. this week, with health authorities recording a total of 106 new cases since July 5.

Last weekend saw case numbers staying low at under 10 per day. By Friday, new cases rose to 25, the highest number of recorded cases in the last two weeks.

Minister for Health Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry did not address the rising number of cases in their joint written statement, instead reiterating the importance of personal safety measures.

The total number of test-positive COVID-19 cases in B.C. has now reached 3,053. There were 10 new deaths reported this week, bringing the total number of deaths related to COVID-19 in the province to 187.

11:50 a.m.: Quebec reported 91 additional cases of COVID-19 on Saturday from the previous day, pushing the provincial total to 56,407 confirmed cases.

Four additional deaths were also reported in the past 24 hours, the health department said.

11 a.m.: A second town south of Montreal is making masks mandatory in indoor public places after a COVID-19 outbreak linked to two house parties grew to about 80 confirmed cases this week.

Mercier, Que., about 30 kilometres south of Montreal, says it intends to make face coverings mandatory as of Wednedsay.

The town of Saint-Chrysostome, Que., where the house parties were held last month, passed a similar rule Friday mandating mask-wearing inside all commercial businesses.

Quebec’s public health director, Horacio Arruda, said Friday the house parties were the source of the outbreak.

Health officials also say they believe the parties are connected to a series of infections that forced several businesses to close in Mercier.

Quebec reported 100 additional cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the second consecutive day new cases topped the 100 mark.

8:41 a.m.: Dozens of U.S. Marines have been infected with the coronavirus at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in what is feared to be a massive outbreak, Okinawan officials said Saturday, demanding an adequate explanation from the U.S. military.

Okinawa prefectural officials said they could say only that a “few dozen” cases had been found recently because the U.S. military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps. Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Okinawan officials said.

Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected.

“Okinawans are shocked by what we were told (by the U.S. military),” Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told a news conference. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the U.S. military and renewed his demand for transparency regarding the latest development.

8:01 a.m.: “Working in an industry where you aren’t properly represented or embraced, there is always a constant fight. For me personally, I think the challenge I have felt is one that is mental,” Toronto-based fashion designer Spencer Badu says.

These are some of the lessons on how to be vulnerable, voice his emotions and find a larger purpose in his identity the 27-year-old has learned amid the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing global protests against anti-Black racism. “Internalizing and suppressing the trauma is part of the Black experience,” he adds.

He has to deal with both the feeling of sorrow and pain from seeing his Black brothers and sisters being killed on the streets and the feeling of pressure to be creative and constantly moving toward the future and trying to inspire change.

Another huge test in the recent months — the COVID-19 pandemic — which slowed down and shuttered businesses across the country. “I’ve been on a constant grind and the pace of fashion is ruthless. We’re a small team so the work can get really exhausting.”

7:31 a.m.: On June 30, North York General Hospital marked a milestone: After 100 days there were no COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit.

That morning, staff gathered to quietly celebrate and reflect on the harrowing weeks of treating the sickest coronavirus patients. The hospital, at Leslie Street and Sheppard Avenue East, was among the first in the GTA to see a wave of critically ill patients with the virus; at its peak, the community hospital had 12 COVID patients in its 21-bed ICU.

Now, during this lull, staff are taking some much-needed time off, though they are not letting down their guard. There are still six COVID patients in the hospital who could require intensive care, and they know new patients can be admitted any time.

7:19 a.m.: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says “things will get worse” in the state as more than 10,000 patients are now hospitalized with the coronavirus.

The deadliest week of the pandemic yet in Texas continued Friday with 95 new deaths.

On the Texas-Mexico border, Starr County Judge Eloy Vera says his rural community is trying to get a refrigerated trailer because the local funeral home can’t keep up with more than two bodies a day.

Texas members of Congress are asking the Trump administration for a field hospital in the Rio Grande Valley. They warn in a letter sent Friday to the health and human services secretary Azar that there is “no indication that case counts will level out soon.”

7:15 a.m.: Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration has given provisional approval to the drug remdesivir, an experimental medicine that has shown promise in the recovery time of the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

The approval comes as Australia is seeing a sharp increase in coronavirus infections in the state of Victoria, which reported a record 288 new confirmed cases Friday.

Authorities say remdesivir will be available only to patients who are severely ill, require oxygen or high-level support to breathe, and are in hospital care. It is the only drug licensed by both the U.S. and the European Union as a treatment for people with severe illness from the coronavirus.

With a population of 26 million, Australia has recorded more than 9,000 coronavirus cases, with 107 deaths.

7:11 a.m.: South Korea has reported 35 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing its caseload to 13,373 infections and 288 deaths.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday that 13 of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the centre of a virus resurgence since late May.

Infections were also reported in other major cities such Daejeon and Gwangju, where patients have been tied to various places, including churches, a Buddhist temple, churches, nursing homes and a sauna.

Fifteen of the new cases were linked to international arrivals as the virus continues to spread in Asia, North America and elsewhere.

7:08 a.m.: New coronavirus cases have dropped sharply in China, and authorities are turning their attention to concerns that the virus could spread through imported food.

Those worries have risen since a June outbreak in Beijing that was linked to the city’s largest wholesale market.

Testing has been stepped up on incoming food shipments, and on Friday customs officials said they are halting imports from three Ecuadorian shrimp producers after tests showed the virus present in recent shipments.

Authorities say the coronavirus was detected on the outer packaging of the shipments July 3. The inner packaging and the shrimp themselves tested negative. Products from the three companies received after March 12 have been ordered to be returned or destroyed.

7:03 a.m.: India’s coronavirus cases have passed 800,000 with the biggest spike of 27,114 cases in the past 24 hours, causing nearly a dozen states to impose a partial lockdown in high-risk areas.

The new confirmed cases took the national total to 820,916. The Health Ministry on Saturday also reported another 519 deaths for a total of 22,123.

A surge in infections saw the cases jumping from 600,000 to more than 800,000 in nine days. The ministry said the recovery rate was continuing to improve at more than 62%.

Eight of India’s 28 states, including the worst-hit Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi, account for nearly 90% of all infections.

6:06 a.m.: At least two doctors in Syria’s opposition-held northwest have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a monitoring group Saturday, raising the total number of cases in the overcrowded rebel enclave to three.

The Syrian opposition and militant groups control the Idlib area, which is home to more than 3 million people, most of them displaced by the war and living in tent camps and overcrowded facilities. Local health facilities have been targeted in Syrian government attacks that have recently displaced nearly a further million people.

The Early Warning and Alert Response Network, which reports on the virus, said the two doctors had been in touch with patient zero, another doctor who works in a hospital in Idlib. The first case was reported on Thursday and the hospital where the doctor works has since suspended its operations and quarantined patients and support staff to carry out testing.

12:47 a.m.: In his push to get schools and colleges to reopen this fall, President Donald Trump is again taking aim at their finances, this time threatening their tax-exempt status.

Trump said on Twitter on Friday he was ordering the Treasury Department to re-examine the tax-exempt status of schools that he says provide “radical indoctrination” instead of education.

“Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,” he tweeted. “Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!”

The Republican president did not explain what prompted the remark or which schools would be reviewed. But the threat is just one more that Trump has issued against schools as he ratchets up pressure to get them to open this fall. Twice this week Trump threatened to cut federal funding for schools that don’t reopen, including in an earlier tweet on Friday.

Friday 11:54 p.m.: Health officials are reporting eight cases of COVID-19 linked to public gatherings in Kelowna, British Columbia, during and around the Canada Day long weekend.

The Interior Health Authority says people who attended private gatherings, restaurants and bars from June 25 to July 6 in downtown and waterfront areas of the city may have been exposed to the illness.

Six of the eight cases are people who don’t live in the region and public health contact tracing is underway.

Officials are urging anyone who took part in such gatherings during this time period to closely monitor themselves for symptoms.

Friday 6 p.m.: Ontario’s regional health units are reporting 38,470 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,752 deaths, an increase of 118 cases since Thursday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

The rate of new infections has fallen sharply in the province over the last two months and has remained low so far in July.

Over the last seven days, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 130 new infections per day, well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April.

Friday’s low total included two days’ worth of data in Toronto, which nevertheless reported a low 42 new cases.

Starting this week, Toronto Public Health switched to reporting cases only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. As such, the provincewide count of COVID-19 cases reported each day is likely to be higher than typical on those days.

Another 10 new fatal cases were reported Thursday, seven in Toronto and one each in York, Waterloo and Niagara Regions. During the worst of the province’s epidemic, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported 117 patients are hospitalized, including 34, who are in an intensive care unit, of whom 24 are on a ventilator. These numbers are themselves near the lowest the province has reported since first publishing hospitalization data in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,710, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that, in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

Read', 'Jenna Moonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Jenna Moon Staff Reporter', 'Jenna Moon Is A Breaking News Reporter For The Star', 'Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"Significant flooding in Toronto earlier this week means that three of the city’s beaches are currently unsafe to swim.

As of Friday afternoon, Marie Curtis Park East Beach, Sunnyside Beach and Hanlan’s Point have all been deemed unsafe for swimming due to increased levels of E. coli. After major rainfalls, conditions are ripe for bacteria.

So what’s happening to our waterways when it rains? According to Roberto Quinlan, an associate professor of biology at York University, major rain events in urban areas lead to a “big pulse of debris and nutrients into the waterways.”

These nutrients fuel bacterial growth, which in turn lead to water conditions that aren’t safe for swimming, Quinlan said. In some cases, after a heavy rainfall “the sewage system becomes overwhelmed and you just get to release the raw sewage directly into Toronto’s waterways.”

That’s a big health concern — especially for those hoping to swim and cool off in the lake this weekend. “Unless there is increased capacity for storm runoff, we’re going to see more of these type of events where you’re going to have sewage overflows into waterways,” Quinlan said.

Beaches could be closed more often due to poor water quality as extreme storms become more frequent. With temperatures rising, conditions will be ripe for blue-green algae, which is highly toxic to humans and animals alike. “(Algae) are expected to bloom more frequently in warmer water temperatures, even if you don’t change the amount of nutrients that goes into water,” Quinlan explained.

“So even if we do a really good job of keeping the water quality the same as it always is, just because of temperature increases alone, we would expect to see more frequent cyanobacteria blooms in the future.”

Miriam Diamond, a professor of environment science with the University of Toronto, said that Ontario’s developed shoreline means more waste heading to the lake after major rainfalls. “We’re dirty. We drive cars, we have pets that poop, we create a lot of waste. It collects on the street, and especially when it hasn’t rained a lot ... it gets flushed into the lake.”

While the lake can clean itself to some extent, it can’t when there’s too much rain, she said. Normally, animal feces would usually sink into the forest floor — something that isn’t as possible in an urban environment.

“We have some trees, but there are vast swaths of lawns that are terrible at taking up these kinds of contaminants.” That means that waste that would typically break down into the soil is flushed down into the late — especially when there’s a storm surge, Diamond said.

Both Diamond and Quinlan urged Torontonians that are hoping to take a dip this weekend to check for water advisories before they go.

“People should be looking out for signs and either the ‘OK’ or ‘not OK’ to go into the water,” Diamond said.

Toronto Public Health updates lake water conditions every 24 hours following E. coli samples. Swimmers should check their local beach before heading out.

In an email, Toronto’s associate medical office of health Vinita Dubey said that while the health department is still encouraging folks to get outside during the weather, “we are still advising to avoid public gatherings and large crowds where physical distancing cannot be maintained, including beaches,” due to COVID-19.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Bill Gravelandthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Bill Gravelandthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"CALGARY—A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Cargill Ltd. that claims the meat-packing company failed to take reasonable precautions to protect its workers in Alberta during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cargill’s beef plant near High River, south of Calgary, employs about 2,200 people. It shut down for two weeks in April because of an outbreak that affected 350 staff.

It reopened after bringing in safety measures that included temperature testing, physical distancing, cleaning and sanitizing.

Eventually nearly half of the workers contracted the virus and two employees died.

The lawsuit, which needs to be approved by a judge, was filed by Guardian Law Group and seeks damages for the harm done to family members, friends and other people who were in close contact with Cargill employees who contracted the novel coronavirus.

The plaintiffs do not include the employees themselves, who are covered by labour and worker compensation laws.

The statement of claim alleges that despite warnings and guidelines issued by the Alberta government, Cargill Ltd. failed to take “reasonable precautions” at the beginning of the outbreak to limit its spread.

“This is a sophisticated facility and a company well-versed in proper safety procedures. That’s why it’s so shocking to see them fall so far below the standard of acceptable behaviour that we expect from employers in this situation,” said Mathew Farrell of Guardian Law Group Friday.

“Businesses bear a responsibility to the community to take reasonable measures to limit the spread of this disease, and where they fail to do so, we will hold them to account for the harms that result.”

The allegations have not been proven in court.

Daniel Sullivan, a Cargill spokesman, said the company does not have a comment to make at this time regarding the class action. He gave a general statement in an email.

“At Cargill, we take seriously our responsibility to feed the world and that keeping people safe is core to our values.”

The High River plant is back at full operation and processes about 4,500 head of cattle a day — more than one-third of Canada’s beef-packing capacity.

Cargill Ltd. is a subsidiary of U.S.-based Cargill Inc., one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States by revenue.

A Toronto infectious diseases expert explains and offers advice,"['Kenyon Wallace', 'Patty Winsa', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterpatty Winsadata Reporterfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter', 'Patty Winsadata Reporter', 'Data Reporter', 'Kenyon Wallace Is A Toronto-Based Investigative Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"Canadian experts say an acknowledgment by the World Health Organization this week that airborne transmission of the coronavirus could be possible in poorly ventilated areas does not mean it’s a predominant route of transmission.

“I think the concern is that this form of the virus could theoretically be more prevalent than we initially anticipated, but that’s a theory only,” said Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, infectious diseases expert at University Health Network. “When you look at real-world experience and real-world evidence, it’s not (matched) by what we’ve seen.”

Up until now, the WHO has been steadfast in its assertion that the virus was predominantly spread when people were close enough that air droplets from one person coughing or sneezing could reach another person’s eyes, nose or mouth. Or when a person touched a surface contaminated with the virus.

The organization has said airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can only occur during medical procedures that generate aerosols, such as intubation.

But in a scientific briefing released Thursday, the WHO said for the first time that under some circumstances airborne transmission may occur outside of medical environments, such as in crowded and poorly ventilated settings.

The acknowledgment by the WHO came after an open letter from Donald Milton, a professor of internal medicine and environmental health at the University of Maryland, and Lidia Morawska, a professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Queensland University of Technology in Australia.

The letter, signed by more than 200 others, appealed to the medical community at large, as well as national and international bodies, to recognize the potential transmission route of the virus through inhalation of microscopic respiratory droplets, and to recommend precautions.

Its authors pointed to studies that have “demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking, and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in air and pose a risk of exposure at distances beyond one to two metres from an infected individual.”

But Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, called the letter “controversial” in a news conference this week, according to media reports, and said that SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through larger droplets transmitted when close contact with others occurs.

Henry said the virus was different from airborne viruses such as measles and smallpox, which can be spread through microdroplets that can be suspended in air for several hours and pass through ventilation systems.

Sharkawy said his concern is that the letter is arousing more alarm than is helpful.

“There’s absolutely no evidence that anybody working outside of a medical setting or high-risk setting of some kind requires the use of N95 masks for their own safety,” he said.

Although the WHO acknowledged that airborne transmission may have contributed to some outbreaks of COVID-19, it also said other factors such as droplets or contaminated surfaces may have been at fault.

“To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated,” according to the briefing, and that “much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission.”

This interview with Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, infectious diseases expert at University Health Network, has been condensed.

How are viruses that can be airborne typically transmitted? Talking? Coughing?

“That’s an excellent way to contrast what we’re seeing with COVID-19 compared to say measles, or shingles or tuberculosis. Those are aerosolizing pathogens, which means that simply talking, simply actually breathing in the same airspace as somebody else, let’s say in an enclosed room you could potentially be at risk. Those particles will be suspended in the air because they’re smaller, and they will remain suspended sometimes for hours.

“And because they’re suspended over time and can travel over greater distances, all you have to do is walk into a room two hours potentially after an infected person was in the room and you may be at risk.

“We have absolutely no evidence that COVID-19 poses the same threat to people.”

What is the difference between microdroplets and droplets?

“Microdroplets are basically somewhere between aerosols and droplets. Then there’s micro-aerosols as well. Microdroplets are small droplets, aerosols are much smaller than the micro-droplets and the micro-aerosols are even smaller than that.

“The truth is microdroplets are probably still not that much more contagious or transmissible than droplets are.”

Sharkawy said because microdroplets are smaller than droplets, they are capable of travelling further, but not by much. And they are not suspended in the air for any length of time.

What do we know about airborne transmission of COVID-19 and microdroplets?

“We don’t think that microdroplets are a major form of transmission of this virus. As simple as that … I would highlight the fact that outside of high-risk medical, dental and other health-care related settings, the risk of aerosolizing from this virus is exceedingly low. It’s just not reflected in real-world evidence.”

Sharkawy said if you’re near a person breathing heavily during a workout, or coughing, that person may release a small amount of aerosolized particulate infectious matter, but the majority of what’s being released from an infected source is still the heavier droplet variety.

For aerosols, will a cloth mask help?

“No. If we’re going to consider what theoretically will work against aerosols or not, then that’s why N95 masks are made. N95 masks are made to filter small particulate matter and to prevent them from being ingested or breathed in.”

But Sharkawy said people should be more concerned with social distancing when they are in a store or on public transit, as well as other measures such as mask wearing. They are not going to “encounter a situation where somebody is so heavily infected with COVID-19 that they’re going to be expelling a high degree of aerosolizing matter into the air around you.

“The situations where we are concerned with that is in a hospital where someone is being put on a ventilator, for example, or deep suctioning is being pursued on them or some other high-risk medical procedure. Occasionally some dental procedure or ophthalmologic procedures can predispose somebody to that same level of risk, but those are the situations where you do need an N95 mask.”

What is your thought or reaction to this open letter to the WHO?

“I think it’s reasonable to remain cautious,” said Sharkawy, but that means “you should be doing things that are readily accessible to manage your own safety and those around you.”

Does there have to be a certain concentration of the virus in an aerosol or microdroplet for it to be contagious?

“Absolutely. We do believe that the aerosols that are being released actually contain less viral RNA, they actually have a lower viral load in them compared to the heavier droplets, which is deemed to be the more conventional route for transmission.”

Are we concerned about aerosols or microdroplets outdoors?

“There’s very little evidence that there’s really any measurable amount of outdoor transmission. Is it reasonable to wear a mask if you’re in a crowded setting (indoors or outdoors)? Absolutely. Is it a must if you go outside? Absolutely not. I think that there’s no evidence for that.” If you want to enjoy the fresh air in a park or anywhere else with your family and you’re engaging in a safe practice otherwise with respect to distancing, there’s absolutely no need for a mask.”

Would you want to open a window if you have people over?

“No question. Everybody has a different level of comfort. I don’t have anybody inside my house, whether they’re part of a circle or a bubble or whatnot. I’m still comfortable meeting with my close friends only outdoors,” where they are still social distancing.

“If other people feel more comfortable in an indoor setting, absolutely I think it’s a good idea, number one, to be in as spacious a setting as possible. If you have the ability to have windows opened, that’s great. If that’s not an option, having the air conditioning set to a very high level will help but it’s not quite as effective.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last month the TTC board voted to make face coverings mandatory effective July 2 in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as the city begins to reopen and people start taking transit again.

On Friday, the agency released figures based on visual observations of nearly 17,000 bus and subway passengers at four busy stations this week, which showed more than 89 per cent of passengers were wearing some form of mask.

Compliance was highest at Bloor-Yonge station, where 94 per cent of riders were wearing face coverings. The rates at Finch, Kipling, and Kennedy stations were 91, 85, and 84 per cent respectively.

Prior to the TTC board approving the mask policy on June 17, only about half of riders were wearing face coverings, according to the agency.

“We’re extremely pleased with the way TTC customers have responded to the mask requirement,” said TTC spokesperson Stuart Green.

“It really shows how willing our customers, and indeed all Torontonians, are to do what’s in the best interests of the broader population.”

According to Green, the compliance rates are particularly encouraging given that the TTC has yet to fully roll out its public awareness campaign about the new rule. He said additional signage and notices will be deployed by the end of July.

The TTC has said it hopes not to penalize riders for not wearing masks, and although disobeying the bylaw comes with a $195 fine, the agency has yet to issue a single ticket for non-compliance. Green said the TTC is instead focusing on “education and awareness.”

Riders with conditions that prevent them from covering their faces are exempt from the rule, as are children under two years old. Agency officials have said that because conditions that make it hard for riders to wear a mask may not be visible to transit officers, the rule would be difficult to fairly enforce.

The agency is distributing “face mask exemption cards” on request to riders who are eligible at its Davisville, Kipling, York University, Union, and Bloor-Yonge stations.

The TTC’s hands-off approach to enforcement came under scrutiny earlier this week when a group of protesters deliberately rode the subway without covering their faces to show opposition to city-wide rules requiring masks in indoor public settings.

Benjamin Boles, who relies on transit to get to his job at a hair salon five times a week, is among the riders who say the TTC needs to be doing more to make sure people follow the rules.

He said that on the Lansdowne bus Friday afternoon, just four in 11 passengers were wearing a mask. “It makes me feel very unsafe,” he said. During busy times of day on the TTC “there’s no way for you to keep two metres distance from people not wearing masks.”

He said even though his job involves close contact with strangers, he feels at less risk there than on the TTC. “We have the door locked. We won’t let anybody in without a mask,” he said.

By the end of April TTC ridership had dropped by 86 per cent as a result of the pandemic. But according to agency statistics ridership has started to return, particularly on the bus network, where passenger volumes are now at 40 per cent of pre-crisis levels. Ridership on subway and streetcar lines remain closer to 20 per cent of normal.

As more people crowd onto the system, physical distancing on stations will become impossible, which the TTC says is why it instituted the mask requirement.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The agency’s monthly jobs report released Friday says 28,900 more Manitobans were working in June compared with May, and May’s numbers had already jumped from April’s. Total employment by June had recovered to 93 per cent of what it was in February before the pandemic began — the second-highest rate among the provinces behind New Brunswick.

“We think it’s a very positive step in the right direction,” Finance Minister Scott Fielding said, noting the unemployment rate dropped to 10.1 per cent.

The numbers also show disparities: the employment rebound has been much lower for young people and low-wage earners across the country. Manitoba recorded the lowest youth unemployment rate in June, but it was still well above pre-pandemic normal at 19.3 per cent.

Fielding said the province may rejig some support programs for people who have lost work during the pandemic to target groups still lagging behind.

“If there’s an ability to move some of those (currently allocated) dollars around, we’ll absolutely want to do that to support Manitobans,” Fielding said.

Manitoba has one of the lowest COVID-19 caseloads among the provinces. It has recorded 325 confirmed or probable cases since the pandemic started and, on Friday, marked 10 consecutive days without a new case. Seven people have died, 314 have recovered and four cases remained active.

The low numbers allowed the province to move fairly quickly to reopen businesses, in stages, through May and June. With restaurants and bars allowed to reopen, subject to some capacity limits, the accommodation and food services industries led the province’s job growth.

The Opposition New Democrats said the Progressive Conservative government should not take credit for the job numbers, and that they are a natural result of the low COVID-19 case count.

The NDP also accused the government of making the situation worse by temporarily laying off some public-sector workers and forcing others to take unpaid days off in order to soften the pandemic’s effect on Manitoba’s finances.

“Imagine if all those people didn’t lose their jobs or didn’t have their paycheques cut, we would be so much further as an economy,” finance critic Mark Wasyliw said.

The provincial government initially predicted the pandemic would result in a $5-billion deficit this fiscal year, due to a combination of lower tax revenues and increased spending. It recently revised that to $2.9 billion, but cautioned the estimate could worsen if COVID-19 numbers rise again.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a lengthy discussion Thursday, York Region council voted unanimously in favour of a motion by Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti requiring business operators to create a policy to prohibit anyone not wearing a mask from entering their premises, beginning July 17 and ending Nov. 30.

“Let’s not let perfection get in the way of doing something,” Vaughan Mayor Maurizio Bevilaqua, who seconded the motion, said. “York Region is not an island. Other areas have gone the mandatory route . . . Does this help our fight against COVID-19? Everything I’m hearing shows it does.”

The list of establishments to come under this requirement will follow that of the City of Toronto.

The list includes businesses that offer sale of goods or services, malls, places of worship, community centres, libraries, art galleries, museums, aquariums, zoos, community service agencies, banquet halls, arenas, stadiums, real estate open house or presentation centres, common areas of hotels, motels, short-term rental lobbies, elevators, meetings rooms, concert venues, theatres, cinemas, casinos and other entertainment facilities.

Office buildings that have an area open to the public for retail or services also fall under the mask mandate. Areas not open to the public are addressed by requirements from the Ministry of Labour and provincial guidance documents depending on a number of factors such as ability of employees to physically distance.

Exempt from mandatory masking: schools, post-secondary institutions, private and public transportation (York transit has its own bylaw), hospitals, independent health facilities, offices of regulated health professionals, apartment buildings and condominiums (including common areas) and restaurant patios.

Signs will be posted in front of the establishments and exemptions will be made for children younger than five years old and anyone with medical conditions and special needs.

Operators are to make “best efforts” to prohibit entry of non-mask-wearers, with education, not enforcement, as the principal objective, but there is still potential for charges.

Newmarket Mayor Tom Taylor acknowledged some people are passionately opposed to masks and will be disappointed with the decision, “but if we are going to err on one side, let’s err on the side of caution.”

Taylor said desperate business owners have cried on the phone with him.

“They’re barely hanging on . . . If we didn’t make masks mandatory and things got worse, they may have to close down.”

The region would monitor activity in the community and direction from the province and may modify these instructions at a later point.

The medical officer of health will report back on the progress of implementation July 30.

Regional mayors and councillors spent more than four hours discussing the issue in public session and another two in private, hearing legal advice, before taking a vote to endorse a recommendation from the region’s medical officer of health to issue instructions consistent with the approach of other public health units.

Vaughan Regional Coun. Linda Jackson said she has been “back and forth” on the issue of mandatory masks and still has great concerns.

When people wear masks, they think they are immune, she said.

“People do not wear masks properly — under necks, nose exposed,” she said. “We need education.

“Mask shaming is also a problem,” she added, saying her father, who has Parkinson’s disease, can’t wear a mask and she feels pressured to make explanations to strangers in stores.

Operators have one week to create a policy prohibiting entry to the premises of anyone not wearing a non-medical mask.

The region will spend between $323,000 to $428,000 on an education campaign.

The mandate would continue longer than other municipalities, with the idea that the virus’s “second wave” would be well underway.

Medical officer of health Dr. Karim Kurji described what would likely happen in the coming weeks: if York Region continues with “aggressive measures” including rooting out the virus where it appears and public adherence to distancing, handwashing, mask-wearing and staying home while ill, COVID-19 case numbers will drop dramatically — maybe even reach zero — with sporadic outbreaks.

Factors will change in the fall, though, with a return to school, possible opening of the United States border, respiratory and flu outbreaks, cold weather drawing people indoors and vigilance “exhaustion” causing the public to drop its guard.

That could lead to a second wave in October or November, Kurji said, adding he would prefer the mask policy remain in place until the first quarter of 2021.

Widespread mask use, along with the other measures, should mitigate that second wave, he said.

“Canada is not out of the first wave yet,” he said. “We have to be vigilant; it can come back and bite us.”

Kurji said the masking measure is being introduced now to prepare for the reopening of the economy and the looming second wave. As well, he said, science has evolved to show two-layer masks made from tightly woven but breathable fabric, worn over the nose and under the chin, can help stop the spread.

A German city, for example, found three weeks after invoking mandatory masks, there was a 40 per cent decrease in COVID-19 cases, Kurji said, adding another study found U.S. states that invoked mandatory masks saw significant decrease in cases.

Evidence as a whole shows the impact of masks on death and daily growth of cases, and their use is most effective when 80 per cent of the population participates, he said.

In York Region, about 65 per cent of residents currently wear masks in public voluntarily, so that goal should be attainable, he said.

While other jurisdictions have opted to exempt children aged two and younger, councillors expressed concern that preschoolers up to age five may have a hard time complying with requirement.

The region plans to purchase 300,000 masks for those who can’t afford or access them.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Nebal Snanlocal Journalism Initiative Reporter', 'The Chronicle Herald', 'Local Journalism Initiative Reporter']",2020-07-10,"Halifax Transit says it’s strongly encouraging all passengers to wear masks when possible.

On Wednesday, they announced through a post on Twitter that staff would be handing out single-use surgical masks at Mumford Terminal Thursday morning.

Some passengers taking the bus at the terminal Thursday afternoon said the initiative is welcome, but it’s not enough. Shawn Jackson has always taken the bus and she continued to do so through the COVID-19 pandemic. She said she felt safe at the beginning, but as people are becoming more complacent, she’s now feeling the opposite. She said at least half of the passengers on the bus she takes don’t wear masks. “I think it should be mandatory that you wear a mask,” said Jackson.

Jackson hadn’t heard that Halifax Transit was handing out free masks. But she said masks would protect all passengers, especially that people can now stand up on the bus. “They all stand up in one spot, right by the middle door. There’s no social distancing in that spot,” she said. In early April, Halifax Transit had prohibited standing on its buses, but they now allow five passengers to stand. “If you’re going to charge a fare and you’re going to re-introduce paying again, everyone has to be protected when they get on there,” she said.

Brenda Dorton also thinks mandatory masks would ensure everyone’s safety. “It’s hard for transit to control what people will do because they’ve been given the option of wearing a mask or not wearing a mask,” she said. Thursday was Dorton’s first time on a bus since Nova Scotia went into a state of emergency. She said she was a bit nervous and is taking precautions to stay safe. She was wearing a mask and carried hand sanitizer to use after getting off the bus.

Robin Pyke has also been avoiding transit for as long as she could. But apartment hunting left her with no choice but to take the bus. Like Jackson, Pyke wasn’t aware that Halifax Transit was handing out masks. But said she always keeps one in her bag to wear at the Halifax Shopping Centre where she works, and now on the bus. “In an indoor situation and even on buses I think there’s definitely logic behind wearing them to help protect other people,” she said. “I think it’s hard to enforce because everybody has different feelings about it.” For a new immigrant in Canada, Twitter may not be the best place to announce mask giveaways.

Nemat Abdul Aleem has only been in Nova Scotia for a month. She doesn’t have any social media accounts, and did not know about the free masks. Abdul Aleem said she wore a mask everywhere when she first came to the province, but as the number of COVID-19 cases dropped, she stopped. Still, she would wear one if it became mandatory. Other passengers said they felt the same.

“I don’t feel comfortable wearing one, but if I really have to, for sure I’ll have one,” said Arnault Binja.

Robert Phillips would also wear one if it became mandatory. But he said enforcing masks means they should become more accessible. “There should be some kind of dispensary where you walk through the door and pull one out,” he said. Phillips hadn’t been outside much since the pandemic. But he felt safe on his few transit trips. “People tend to keep their distance. (They would) sit there and mind their business,” he said. On Thursday afternoon, the Mumford Terminal didn’t have more than two dozen people at any time. Route 1 heading to Spring Garden Road in the early afternoon had at most eight passengers, half of whom wore a mask. Phillips said he’s not sure if he would continue to take the bus if it gets crowded. “It might be a little risky. But I think the huge majority of people out and about in the open don’t have COVID anyway to begin with.”

In Thursday’s COVID-19 briefing, Dr. Robert Strang said he will continue to strongly recommend wearing masks in spaces where it’s difficult to maintain six feet between people. These spaces include stores, elevators, crowded outdoor spaces and public transit. “We need to make it a habit to always have a mask with us,” he said. People should also continue to follow other public health recommendations, such as handwashing, cleaning high-touch surfaces, and staying at home when feeling unwell.

267,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/07/10/canada-asks-british-military-for-help-flying-troops-to-and-from-latvia.html,Canada asks British military for help flying troops to and from Latvia,"['Lee Berthiaume', 'Lblee Berthiaumethe Canadian Pressfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA—Canadian troops have been forced to hitch a ride with the British military to get to and from Latvia due to a shortage of working planes.

Canada has 540 troops in Latvia, where they form the core of a 1,500-strong multinational battle group established by NATO three years ago. Similar battle groups led by Britain, Germany and the U.S. have been established in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, respectively.

The current Canadian contingent arrived in January and is to be replaced this month. That planned rotation was to include having one of the military’s three CC-150 Polaris planes fly to Latvia Wednesday with around 120 soldiers before returning with a similar number later in the week.

But that was before a problem was found with the Polaris’s landing gear, according to Defence Department spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande. And while the other two would normally have filled the gap, Lamirande said they were unavailable, which is why the British were called in to help.

One Polaris is currently ferrying troops to and from the Middle East, where Canadian troops remain engaged in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

The third Polaris — which normally serves as the prime minister’s plane — is out of commission until at least January after a hangar accident last October. Officials have estimated the cost of repairs at around $11 million.

“The members originally set to depart from (Canadian Forces Base) Trenton for Latvia on 8 July departed instead on 9 July with the support of the British Royal Air Force, who had an A330 Voyager aircraft available to support the departure from Canada,” Lamirande said in an email.

“This aircraft will also bring the approximately 120 returning members home.”

The mechanical breakdown is only the latest problem to plague not only the Polaris fleet but also plans to rotate the current contingent of Canadian troops in Latvia.

A Polaris carrying about 70 Canadian soldiers to Latvia was forced to turn around last week because of concerns those on board might have been exposed to COVID-19.

All military personnel deploying on overseas missions are required to undergo strict quarantine measures to ensure troops do not carry COVID-19 to another country or spread the respiratory illness among their unit.

Despite those precautions, the plane was forced to turn around in mid-air after the military received word that a civilian contractor at CFB Trenton who may have come in contact with the plane and passengers had tested positive for the illness.

Those who were on board are now in the middle of a second 14-day isolation period.

The NATO battle group in Latvia includes troops from eight other countries. It and similar battle groups in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland were created after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and began to support separatist forces in Ukraine’s eastern regions.

The battle groups are designed to defend against a Russian invasion, but their small size means they would almost certainly be overwhelmed in a real war. Instead, their main utility is to deter Russian aggression, with the idea that an attack on one would draw in all of NATO.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Gilbert Ngabostaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Gilbert Ngabo Is A Star Breaking News Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"Matthew Morris remembers vividly the time he realized the propagation of social media would help change the conversations around issues of race and inequality.

It was early in 2018 and the clothing giant H&M was facing global backlash for its online ad featuring a young Black model in a sweatshirt that had words “coolest monkey in the jungle” emblazoned on the chest.

That morning Morris, a long-time teacher at Tecumseh Senior Public School in Scarborough, came into class, scrapped his day’s lesson plan and simply put the ad on the screen. He asked his students if they saw anything wrong with it. Every one of his students was able to say the ad was racist and shouldn’t have released.

“Kids today are more in tune to knowing what racism looks like and being able to point to it,” said Morris, noting the arrival of social media and internet connectivity helps spread information about issues at hand faster. “When I was a kid in the 1990s, first of all a teacher would never do that, and even if they did, I think we would have been just sitting there unable to name it, as kids.”

Issues of race have taken centre stage in weekly online meetings amongst Ontario educators that Morris and fellow teacher Jay Williams started earlier this year. Aptly dubbed #QuarantineEd, the initiative was launched with the goal of serving as a safe and open space for educators to share experiences on adapting to new realities of remote teaching amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Williams, who has been teaching for 10 years and is now at Gordon A. Brown Middle School in East York, said many teachers have been struggling to do their job effectively while locked up in their homes. He personally prefers being a hands-on educator, establishing connection with each student in the class. Not having that aspect made his teaching style difficult, and he wanted to hear from his peers on how they were coping.

Subjects for #QuarantineEd discussion usually centred around questions such as what it felt to teach during COVID-19 or thoughts about the end of the school year and how to move forward when school resumes in September.

Then George Floyd was murdered, and everything about these chats changed.

The Zoom meetings, which happen Thursday evening for an hour, went from having about 20 participants to nearly 100, with teachers and principals from across Ontario and Canada and even some from the U.S. joining in.

Discussions have organically changed from remote learning to anti-Black racism education. Folks wanted to get together and have deep conversations about race, police brutality and how educators can help their students have a better understanding of these issues.

“We all needed to have this place to share our experiences. It’s become like therapy for all of us,” said Williams, who grew up in Scarborough’s Malvern community.

By using this platform to share their personal experiences as Black teachers in Ontario, both Williams and Morris have served as inspiration to fellow educators who participate in the weekly Zoom meetings.

“They are definitely the kind of teachers I wish I had growing up,” said Shauna Griffiths, a teacher with the Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

“I think they’re innovative and relatable, and adapt themselves to teaching in a manner that helps students a lot. The things they’re doing in their classrooms, what they talk about, it makes me want to do so much more. They push me to want to be better.”

Jim Spyropoulos, a superintendent of human rights and Indigenous education within TDSB and a regular participant in the #QuarantineEd meetings, described Williams and Morris as lifelong committed learners who have so much to teach to their peers.

“It wasn’t just the quarantine. It was the fact that things were happening in the world with respect to racism and human rights, which have had a profound impact and created so much trauma to so many people,” Spyropoulos said.

“Being part of these discussions has created a sense of comfort and belonging. People look forward to Thursday night. It’s almost like a healing session.”

For Morris, getting to a point where he can accept being himself and value his own culture within the work environment has been a long journey. Growing up, he didn’t have a Black teacher until later in high school. There was no role model to look up to. He remembers early in his teaching career how he’d buy khaki pants and long-sleeved shirts to hide his tattoos. He’d remove his earrings and not wear any jewelry at school, just because he figured he had to assimilate into the dominant culture in order to get respect.

“It takes away your Black identity. You almost buy into the idea that your true self isn’t valuable enough,” he said.

“I have to value myself. I have the same degrees as all these other people, same certifications, I may speak with a different accent because I’m from Scarborough and east side of the city, but what’s important is how I value my job, how I care about the young people in front of me.

“If I’m not myself, I’ll be doing a disservice to the kids who look like me.”

Williams added the quarantine has made many people pay much closer attention than before to anti-Black racism and issues of injustice, which is a good thing but the awareness shouldn’t dissipate by the end of the pandemic. Recent announcements that Ontario will scrap the streaming system for Grade 9 students as well as stop the suspension of kids from kindergarten to Grade 3, are just some of the important changes needed in the education system.

“This can’t be just a phase. There needs to be tangible changes,” said Williams, noting he and Morris have plans to turn their #QuarantineEd work into a podcast in order to take the conversations to a broader platform.

“Whether the meter moves in leaps and bounds it’s yet to be seen but I’m definitely thinking and hoping and knowing that there will be more changes.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting 38,470 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,752 deaths, an increase of 118 cases since Thursday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

The rate of new infections has fallen sharply in the province over the last two months and has remained low so far in July.

Over the last seven days, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 130 new infections per day, well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April.

Friday’s low total included two days’ worth of data in Toronto, which nevertheless reported a low 42 new cases.

Starting this week, Toronto Public Health switched to reporting cases only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. As such, the provincewide count of COVID-19 cases reported each day is likely to be higher than typical on those days.

Another 10 new fatal cases were reported Thursday, seven in Toronto and one each in York, Waterloo and Niagara Regions. During the worst of the province’s epidemic, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported 117 patients are hospitalized, including 34, who are in an intensive care unit, of whom 24 are on a ventilator. These numbers are themselves near the lowest the province has reported since first publishing hospitalization data in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,710, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that, in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:35 p.m. There are 107,023 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 8,759 deaths, according to The Canadian Press.

This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario):

Quebec: 56,316 confirmed (including 5,612 deaths, 25,675 resolved)

Ontario: 36,464 confirmed (including 2,710 deaths, 32,155 resolved)

Alberta: 8,519 confirmed (including 161 deaths, 7,774 resolved)

British Columbia: 3,028 confirmed (including 186 deaths, 2,667 resolved)

Nova Scotia: 1,066 confirmed (including 63 deaths, 999 resolved)

Saskatchewan: 815 confirmed (including 15 deaths, 757 resolved)

Manitoba: 314 confirmed (including seven deaths, 314 resolved), 11 presumptive

Newfoundland and Labrador: 262 confirmed (including three deaths, 258 resolved)

New Brunswick: 166 confirmed (including two deaths, 163 resolved)

Prince Edward Island: 33 confirmed (including 27 resolved)

Repatriated Canadians: 13 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Yukon: 11 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Northwest Territories, all of which have been resolved

Nunavut reports no confirmed cases.

2:56 p.m.: Officials in Ontario’s Windsor-Essex region called on the provincial or federal government Friday to take the reins in tackling COVID-19 outbreaks in farms, saying the situation requires more co-ordination than they can provide themselves.

Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens said there have been instances where “the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing,” and having a lead agency would help prevent that.

“Everyone is doing the best they can do locally but this type of situation requires a different level of co-ordination because of the complexity involved,” he said in a news conference with other local leaders Friday morning.

“What we want to do is make sure there are no gaps,” and no duplication of efforts, he said.

He noted, for example, that if migrant workers who test positive are being housed in a hotel, there must also be arrangements to deliver meals to them so they don’t have to leave their rooms.

2:30 p.m.: As the Blue Jays wait for word on whether they’ll be able to play in Toronto after training camp, infielder Travis Shaw voiced his concern Friday about the length of time players may need to stay in their closed environment at Rogers Centre and its adjoining hotel.

Shaw replied to a tweet from TSN reporter Scott Mitchell, who reported that multiple sources told him players could face a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ballpark — which also are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act.

“We were told two weeks... not all summer... all summer is a bit much,” Shaw tweeted.

1:45 p.m.: Finance Minister Bill Morneau took part in a cabinet decision to award a multimillion contract to WE Charity despite the fact his daughter works for the organization.

Morneau’s daughter, Grace Acan, has been working in the WE organization’s travel department since 2019.

Despite his daughter’s employment with the organization, Morneau participated in the cabinet discussion and decision to tap WE Charity to run the government’s $900 million student volunteer grant program.

The Star’s Alex Boutilier has the full story.

1 p.m: In just three weeks, India went from the world’s sixth worst-affected country by the coronavirus to the third, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. India’s fragile health system was bolstered during a stringent months-long lockdown but could still be overwhelmed by an exponential rise in infections. Here is where India stands in its battle against the virus.

India has tallied 793,802 infections and more than 21,600 deaths, with cases doubling every three weeks. It’s testing more than 250,000 samples daily after months of sluggishness, but experts say this is insufficient for a country of nearly 1.4 billion people.

The Associated Press has a full explainer here.

12:02 p.m.: The U.S. congressman who wants a plan to ease travel restrictions at the Canada-U.S. border is taking the ensuing backlash in stride.

Rep. Brian Higgins got an earful from Canadian Twitter users when he tweeted details of his bipartisan call on both countries to start talking about how best to begin reopening the border.

Higgins, a New York Democrat, says he doesn’t blame Canadians for wanting to keep Americans out, considering the failure of the Trump administration to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

But he says the damaging border restrictions can be gradually eased without jeopardizing public health, and he and other members of Congress from northern border states will keep pressing their case.

A recent online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies found 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it.

The current border restrictions are due to expire July 21, but the fresh surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. makes it all but certain they will be extended before then.

11:40 a.m.: A small community south of Montreal is making mask-wearing mandatory inside all commercial businesses beginning today following a COVID-19 outbreak authorities say is tied to a house party.

Health officials say they believe the party in the municipality of Saint-Chrysostome, located about 50 kilometres south of Montreal, is connected to a series of infections that forced several businesses to close in the nearby town of Mercier.

11:40 a.m.: Quebec reported 100 additional cases of COVID-19 today, the second consecutive day new cases topped the 100 mark.

The province has now had 56,316 infections of the novel coronavirus, with 25,675 cases considered recovered.

Quebec is also reporting three new deaths attributed to COVID-19, two of which occurred in the past 24 hours while one occurred before July 2, for a total of 5,612 fatalities.

Nine more people are in hospital with the disease compared with the prior day, for a total of 317, including 24 people who are in intensive care, a reduction of three.

11:20 a.m.: Ontario is reporting 116 new instances of COVID-19 and seven more deaths, but the province has fewer active cases than it has seen since before the April peak of the outbreak.

Health Minister Christine Elliott noted Friday that 30 of the province’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer cases and 17 of those had no cases at all.

Only Toronto, Peel Region, York Region, and Windsor-Essex reported more than five cases apiece.

11:20 a.m.: Tests for what would have been Nunavut’s first case of COVID-19 have come back negative.

The territory’s chief public health officer, Dr. Michael Patterson, is confirming the result this morning.

A fly-in worker at the Mary River iron mine on the northern tip of Baffin Island was originally diagnosed positive on June 30. Medical officials have said the initial result was on the low end of the infection spectrum.

Patterson says the worker, originally from Western Canada, and all of that person’s eight contacts will no longer have to isolate.

None of the contacts have developed symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19.

Nunavut remains the only jurisdiction in Canada without a confirmed case of the infection. A presumed positive case in the spring also turned out to be negative.

11 a.m.: Newfoundland and Labrador has confirmed a new case of COVID-19, the first reported in more than a month.

The Department of Health says the man in his 50s lives in the Eastern Health region and had recently returned from the United States.

The department says the man self-isolated when he returned to the province and he did not travel through other Atlantic provinces.

It’s the first case of COVID-19 confirmed in the province since May 28, bringing the provincial total to 262.

Three people have died from the illness in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 258 people have recovered.

The province has slowly lifted restrictions on businesses and gatherings over the last month and opened its borders to travellers from Atlantic Canada last week.

11 a.m.: The Conservatives say they want a criminal investigation into the Liberal government’s decision to have the WE organization run a $900-million program for student volunteers.

Their call for police to step in comes after it was revealed that the group has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s family.

Trudeau is already under investigation by the ethics commissioner for potential conflict of interest with regard to the contract, as his long-standing family ties to the group are well known.

But that review was launched prior to revelations the prime minister’s mother, brother and wife have been paid in the past by the WE organization and the Conservatives say that elevates the issue to a potential crime.

The Conservatives say they will send a letter to the police today to see if a section of the Criminal Code pertaining to government fraud could be applied in this situation.

Trudeau has maintained the non-partisan public service recommended WE to administer the program, though did acknowledge he did not recuse himself from the cabinet approval of the deal.

10 a.m.: Serbia’s president said Friday he’s not worried about losing political power amid large protests against his handling of the coronavirus crisis and hard-line rule, but instead expressed his fear about the spread of the virus by the demonstrators.

“It is so irresponsible to call upon people to gather and demonstrate when we are faced with the most horrific numbers of infections from the coronavirus,” President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters during his state visit to France.

“I beg people, please let’s keep our health safe. Nobody is going to take power by force. Power is taken at the elections. You can protest as much as you want when the epidemic is over,” Vucic said.

“If you don’t understand this, and you want to bring some tycoons to power — let me tell you — this is not going to happen.”

After two nights of violent protests and clashes with police, peaceful demonstrations were held in the capital of Belgrade and several other Serbian towns on Thursday. A few people wore face masks.

Defying a ban on mass gatherings passed by the government on Thursday, many protesters wore white T-shirts with the inscription, “Sit Down, Don’t Be Set Up” — referring to widespread reports that the violence the previous nights that played into the government’s hands was staged by far-right groups close to the authorities.

8:40 a.m.: Statistics Canada says the economy added nearly one million jobs in June as businesses forced closed by the pandemic moved to reopen.

The agency says 953,000 jobs were added last month including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions.

The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent in June after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

The average economist estimate for June had been for an addition of 700,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to fall to 12.0 per cent, according to financial data firm Refinitiv

7:55 a.m.: Premier Doug Ford will make multiple public appearances at businesses today to thank Ontario workers for their service during the pandemic.

Ford’s day will start at a skylight manufacturing company in Woodbridge, Ont., where the premier is set to make an announcement alongside Vic Fedeli, minister of economic development.

He’ll then tour a Toronto-based textile company that retooled its facility to start producing face masks.

The premier will then visit a bakery in Toronto’s west end to serve customers through a take window built by the shop.

Ford’s last event is scheduled at 4 p.m. when he’ll tour a dairy and food plant that ramped up production to meet customer needs during the COVID-19 lockdown.

6:20 a.m.: The coronavirus storm has arrived in South Africa, but in the overflowing COVID-19 wards the sound is less of a roar than a rasp.

Oxygen is already low in hospitals at the new epicentre of the country’s outbreak, Gauteng province, home to the power centres of Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria.

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, visiting a hospital Friday, said authorities are working with industry to address the strained oxygen supply and divert more to health facilities.

Some of the hospital’s patients spilled into heated tents in the parking lot. They lay under thick blankets in the middle of winter in the Southern Hemisphere, with a cold front arriving this weekend and temperatures expected to dip below freezing.

South Africa overnight posted another record daily high of confirmed cases, 13,674, as Africa’s most developed country is a new global hot spot with 238,339 cases overall. More than a third are in Gauteng.

6:17 a.m.: Australia’s Victoria state on Friday reported the new daily record of 288 coronavirus cases, which also reflects a record number of tests exceeding 37,500.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed to return to Australia each week will be reduced by more than 4,000 from next week.

Sydney, Australia’s largest city, has been carrying a disproportionate burden of hotel quarantine that is currently paid for by the New South Wales state government.

Victoria, to the south, has banned international arrivals after breaches of hotel quarantine in Melbourne were blamed for Australia’s only widespread transmission of COVID-19.

Victoria’s Chief Helath Officer Breet Sutton said “certainly, 288 new cases today is a pretty ugly number.”

6:16 a.m.: Two World Health Organization experts were heading to the Chinese capital on Friday to lay the groundwork for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.

An animal health expert and an epidemiologist will meet Chinese counterparts in Beijing to work out logistics, places to visit and the participants for a WHO-led international mission, the UN organization said.

A major issue will be to “look at whether or not it jumped from species to human, and what species it jumped from,” WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said at a briefing in Geneva.

Scientists believe the virus may have originated in bats and was transmitted to another mammal such as a civet cat or an armadillo-like pangolin before being passed on to people.

6:15 a.m.: Statistics Canada is set this morning to give a snapshot of the job market as it was last month as pandemic-related restrictions eased and reopenings widened.

Economists expect the report will show a bump in employment as a result, further recouping some of the approximately three million jobs lost over March and April.

Financial data firm Refinitiv says the average economist estimate for June is for employment to increase by 700,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to fall to 12.0 per cent.

The unemployment rate in May was a record-high 13.7 per cent, a far turn from the record low of 5.5 per cent recorded in January.

The Bank of Canada and federal government say the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

The economic outlook released by the Liberal government Wednesday forecasted the unemployment rate to be 9.8 per cent for the calendar year, dropping to 7.8 per cent next year based on forecasts by 13 private sector economists.

Thursday 3 p.m.: The World Health Organization is acknowledging the possibility that COVID-19 might be spread in the air under certain conditions — after more than 200 scientists urged the agency to do so.

In an open letter published this week in a journal, two scientists from Australia and the U.S. wrote that studies have shown “beyond any reasonable doubt that viruses are released during exhalation, talking and coughing in microdroplets small enough to remain aloft in the air.”

The researchers, along with more than 200 others, appealed for national and international authorities, including WHO, to adopt more stringent protective measures.

WHO has long dismissed the possibility that the coronavirus is spread in the air except for certain risky medical procedures, such as when patients are first put on breathing machines.

In a change to its previous thinking, WHO noted on Thursday that studies evaluating COVID-19 outbreaks in restaurants, choir practices and fitness classes suggested the virus might have been spread in the air.

Airborne spread “particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out,” WHO said.

And then, something different happened","['Joanna Chiu', 'Joanna Chiuvancouver Bureauthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Joanna Chiuvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Joanna Chiu Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Both Canada-China Relations', 'Current Affairs On The West Coast For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"VANCOUVER—As she boarded a bus Monday after a morning of classes at a downtown Vancouver campus, Tina Hoang was pleased to see that most passengers were physically distancing.

She sat down at an empty area near the middle of the bus.

But soon, a white man got on board and walked by a row of people who were all wearing masks, who all happened to be people of colour.

“Jesus Christ! Everyone is wearing a mask. It’s the f---ing Chinese virus,” he ranted loudly.

Hoang, who is 21, said she snapped at that moment after enduring months of dirty looks from people in Vancouver, which she attributed to scapegoating for the coronavirus outbreak.

I told him, “Hey, that’s really racist! Don’t say that! It’s very rude of you.”

The man stopped and stood over Hoang, who is a small woman of just five feet.

At that moment, Hoang felt scared, but she stood her ground and demanded an apology from the man.

He snarled, “No! It’s a Chinese virus, from Chinese people eating s---.”

That’s when other passengers on the bus stepped up.

To Hoang, it felt like a collective uprising against a spate of racist attacks in the city.

In March, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.

Eight per cent of Chinese Canadians respondents said they have been physically attacked by strangers during the pandemic, according to a recent survey from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta.

On the bus, the passengers weren’t going to stand by for another attack.

Two older women, one of Latino descent and the other of Southeast Asian descent, began to lecture the man about his “shameful” behaviour.

They were trying to educate him about why people wear masks, Hoang told the Star.

“The women said something along the lines of, ‘Everyone is trying to be respectful and take care of each other by wearing masks and keeping a distance.’”

Some passengers said, “Don’t be racist!” while others chose more subtle means of solidarity, changing their seats to stand or sit protectively around Hoang, who had burst into tears.

“You made this girl cry; how can you do that?” one man said.

Hoang told the Star she was shaking from anger, thinking about the racism her family endured when they lived in a mostly white suburb of Mississauga, Ont. Her parents are immigrants from China and Vietnam.

“People belittled my mother for not speaking English correctly, and white men hit on her. I couldn’t believe my mother had to stand up for her rights, and I still have to do it now,” Hoang said.

Before she reached her stop, the man struck out again, telling her, “You’re a piece of s--- for eating s---.”

“I hope you can find inner peace,” Hoang responded calmly.

Of the 516 Chinese Canadians who responded to the poll from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta, 43 per cent also reported being threatened or intimidated.

“Every day, I pray that you people die,” is one of the threats and name-calling instances respondents reported.

“Since March 2020, I have been repeatedly yelled at on the sidewalk in my own neighborhood,” said one person who took part in the survey.

Because of the support of her fellow passengers, Hoang says she feels hopeful about the future.

“Canada has systemic racism, but people are willing to stand up for change and that makes me proud to be Canadian,” she said.

Some Canadians think so,"['Edward Keenan', 'Edward Keenanwashington Bureau Chiefthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Edward Keenanwashington Bureau Chief', 'Washington Bureau Chief', 'Edward Keenan Is The Star S Washington Bureau Chief. He Covers U.S. Politics', 'Current Affairs. Reach Him Via Email', 'Ekeenan Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-09,"WASHINGTON—On the question of loosening restrictions on border crossings between Canada and the U.S., most Canadians have a simple answer, summed up in an email I received from Laura Teskey, who lives near Crystal Beach minutes from the border: “NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO… and NO!”

Public opinion polls show most Canadians want current restrictions maintained until at least the end of the year. Dozens of readers have written to underline the point.

“Build the wall and stay behind it,” Chris James wrote.

“The Canada and U.S. border should remain closed until the U.S. gets the COVID virus numbers reduced to similar numbers per population as Canada,” Elaine Lee says.

It’s an argument understood — and mostly supported — by many people who would desperately like to cross the border. U.S. case loads per capita are far higher than Canada’s, and rising. Yet many people remain saddened by the restrictions, feeling they arbitrarily block many potentially safe and justifiable crossings.

“Why is a lawyer residing in Windsor and working for a Detroit law firm considered essential and I am not?” asks Paula Teevens-Hered, an American who lives in Amherstburg, Ontario, an hour’s drive from the Michigan town she’s from and where her octogenarian parents still live. She grew up criss-crossing the border for work, friendships and recreation. She commuted to work in Michigan after getting married and moving to Canada. “As my father stated in his speech at my wedding, ‘We are all North American.’”

Teevens-Hered has been the primary caregiver to her parents for years, but has not seen them in months outside of tearful Zoom calls. She wonders why she can’t be accommodated. “I would only expect to be put through the same protocols as the current essential workers are at the border.”

I heard similar questions about the way the rules apply to certain people. Canadian Natasha Parsons, who lives in New York City, tried to cross into New Brunswick with her American husband in March, after her father was hospitalized. They had a quarantine plan and thought they’d ticked off the checklist of entrance requirements. At the border, she says, her husband was denied entry not because of anything he’d done differently from her, but because of his citizenship.

By contrast, American citizen Anthony Antonelli, a Canadian permanent resident, was quarantining at his home near Yonge and St. Clair this week. He and his family had just returned from their third trip to rural Maryland since the beginning of March. Antonelli said they’d had no trouble crossing into the U.S., because they were American, and had no trouble crossing back into Canada because they were going to their home — though they were advised of quarantine requirements by Canadian authorities (and obeyed them).

The apparent inconsistencies leave many people with more questions than answers.

I also heard complaints about methods of travel and how each can impact crossing the border. Canadians can more easily travel into the U.S. by air than by car. Lorna from Pickering (who asked her last name not be used) would like to visit her son and pregnant daughter-in-law in New York state as her son prepares to undergo surgery. “Usually the trip is four hours and safer in our own car,” she says, which is not allowed right now, while “flying by a two-stop, eight-hour flight via Chicago is permissible.”

Other people in both countries who own property on the other side of the border would like to be able to visit their homes. “We are worried about looters, winter damage, damage throughout the season, maintenance,” writes one man living in Toronto with a home in New York state, whose job requires he not be quoted by name. The plight of such cross-border property owners was one of the concerns outlined in the letter signed by 29 members of the U.S. Congress I wrote about earlier in the week. They are asking both governments for guidelines outlining when and how border restrictions might be loosened in phases, and to consider broadening circumstances classified “essential.”

The current situation, with restrictions extended 30 days at a time with little explanation of criteria, “is untenable for the communities that have been separated from family and unable to tend to their property for over three months,” they wrote.

Among those I spoke to, the conversations centred less on the concept of “reopening,” and more on whether refined restrictions could allow more safe trips under the public health controls that already exist. That and, as the members of congress wrote, to have a process that leads to less uncertainty. For many, not knowing if or when they’ll be able to visit home has been a major source of anxiety.

Canadian Gail King Carlisle is in quarantine in Toronto, after travelling from her home in California to be with her family after both her parents were hospitalized. The trip and its quarantine requirements were made easier, in a “bittersweet” way, because she was recently laid off due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, she says.

She thinks the current requirements for crossing the border were appropriate. “I was surprised at, truly, how easy it was.”

The most difficult part of the process, she says, was the uncertainty about whether she’d be allowed and able to come.

“There was nothing worse than the five to seven days leading up to me finally just deciding to get on the plane. It was the most traumatizing time, feeling completely helpless. And really feeling like there was no way that I could come here,” she says. “It’s amazing how much of a weight it took off. Like just that weight on my chest of emotion. Just arriving here.”

Read', 'Rachel Mendlesonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', ""Kristin Rushowyqueen'S Park Bureau"", ""Queen'S Park Bureau"", 'With Files Jennifer Yang']",2020-07-09,"Health Minister Christine Elliott has promised to take action to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Toronto’s hard-hit northwest corner, after the chair of the city’s health board called on the province to do more to protect vulnerable residents in these neighbourhoods.

Elliott told reporters at Queen’s Park on Thursday the government is “prepared” to deploy mobile testing units to the area, which has borne the brunt of the pandemic in Toronto.

Premier Doug Ford’s Etobicoke North riding includes several of the hard-hit northwest neighbourhoods. Among them is Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown, where the disease burden is heaviest, with a rate of 1,241 sporadic infections per 100,000 people — 22 times higher than in The Beaches, the city’s least-affected neighbourhood.

“We’re certainly happy to look at the situation in northwestern Toronto if they need help, if they need access (to) testing. Of course, we will help out,” Elliott said.

A ministry spokesperson added in an email: “With Toronto Public Health, a local public health unit, having indicated that they need additional support, the relevant Ontario Health region will now work with them to determine how we can implement expanded testing in northwestern Toronto.”

Elliott also said the province is “working with the federal government, who is helping to provide quarantine accommodations” for those who have the virus and are unable to safely self-isolate at home due to overcrowding.

“It’s really important that we all work together — municipal, provincial and federal (governments) — in order to make sure that we respond appropriately to COVID-19,” she said.

Improving access to testing and joining other levels of government to create free, voluntary self-isolation accommodations are among the measures the chair of Toronto’s Board of Health, Coun. Joe Cressy, requested in a letter to the province on Wednesday.

Cressy made the appeal to Elliott and Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, after data from Toronto Public Health showed high rates of infection in the city’s northwest corner, and reporting from the Star laid bare the deep inequities that are putting residents in these neighbourhoods at risk.

Cressy said he is “delighted and pleased to hear that the provincial government is now keen to act.”

“I cannot stress the urgency enough of protecting the most vulnerable. Not only is it necessary today. In the likelihood of a second wave, there will be no excuses,” he said. “We all know who is most at risk. We know the occupations where COVID is wreaking havoc. We know the living environments where COVID spreads.”

Leticia Deawuo, who is executive director of the Black Creek Community Farm and lives at Jane and Sheppard, reiterated on Thursday the need for a “long-term plan” to address the inequities that have made these communities vulnerable in the pandemic.

“It’s important that the government is making the right investment in the community, to make sure that we can survive, not just COVID, but we can survive anything else that comes our way,” she said, citing the need for affordable housing as an example.

The Star found that the neighbourhoods in the northwest corner have some of the highest concentrations of residents who are low-income, racialized and living in cramped housing while working in higher-risk sectors like manufacturing — findings that were echoed by Toronto Public Health data released last week.

In his letter, Cressy also urged the province to share COVID-19 data on race and income it is poised to start collecting, ensure better protections for at-risk workers, implement a “more efficient and fully automated” system for reporting lab results to public health units, and “address the social determinants of health that have created deep health inequities.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Omar Moslehedmonton Bureau', 'Edmonton Bureau', 'Omar Mosleh Is An Edmonton-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-08,"Marianne Ryan feels stuck in child-care limbo.

The Toronto labour-room nurse spends her days helping to deliver babies, while worrying about child care for her own two kids, aged seven and 10.

Ryan, a single mother, was using the city-run emergency child care for essential workers until it closed on June 26. But her regular daycare, Church Street School Child Care Centre, hasn’t reopened due to low enrolment and increased costs, she said.

She tried the city’s CampTO program, but it was full. She turned to the YMCA’s summer camp program but says she was told she couldn’t use her city of Toronto child-care subsidy there. She says the full cost of $600 a week for her two kids wouldn’t leave her enough to pay rent.

She feels lucky because her father drives from Richmond Hill to her home downtown three to four times a week to care for the kids during her 12-hour shifts. But she believes the emergency child-care program was aimed at helping essential workers like her, and then abandoned them.

“What are families supposed to do? I’m lucky enough I have my dad, but if he couldn’t help me for some reason, or he got sick, I would have to quit my job,” Ryan said.

She believes the province needs to do more to support essential workers who don’t have many options, especially when it comes to child care.

“I can’t work from home like other people, and I’m putting myself at risk and my kids at risk all the time,” Ryan said.

Church Street School Child Care Centre did not respond to the Star’s request for comment.

Chris Meyer, a spokesperson for YMCA of Greater Toronto, said while they couldn’t comment on Ryan’s specific case, Toronto subsidies are transferable to the YMCA if space is available. She said it’s more likely an issue of available space at downtown locations.

“Finding child care in downtown Toronto was challenging even prior to the pandemic, especially for certain ages such as infants,” Meyer said. “As a result, unfortunately not all of our Toronto locations have open spaces right now. We try our best to accommodate families, especially health-care workers who are a priority when registering new families.”

Carolyn Ferns, of the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care, says Ryan’s situation shows that the province’s plan for reopening child care isn’t adequate.

“It’s a perfect illustration of the chaos that’s really been created and, I think, really needlessly,” Ferns said.

“We had been urging them not to close down emergency child-care programs. And rather than actually expand those programs to serve more families, they did the opposite.”

She said it reveals the need for a total paradigm shift on how child care is operated in Ontario. She said the model before was unsustainable. Parents had to sometimes pay prohibitively high fees, while child-care centres had to operate at full capacity just to keep their doors open.

“We know we can’t do that now because of health and safety. … None of those things are going to work anymore because parents are impacted by the recession,” Ferns said.

A spokesperson for the Ontario’s ministry of education said they have instructed child-care service managers, who are the ministry’s representatives in municipalities, to prioritize recipients of emergency child care when determining space availability.

In a statement, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce said the province’s plan to support child-care centres enhances health protocols to keep kids safe and doesn’t impose higher fees on parents.

“We know that child care is critical to our economic recovery,” Lecce said. “That is why we are providing more financial support to child-care operators to ensure they remain viable, and it is why we are providing clear health guidance to ensure our staff and kids remain safe.”

Ferns said she doesn’t expect society to return to normal any time soon. She believes the province needs to take a long-term view of how it can better support child care.

“This needs to be the crisis that really makes us look at child care in a different way and move toward a much more publicly funded and publicly managed system,” she said.

Meanwhile, Ryan says she still feels as if she’s been left with no options and is worried what it might mean for her and her kids in the long term.

“If there’s no school and no child care, we can’t start the economy again because nobody can work,” she said. “And the kids are suffering.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Heather Morrison said Thursday the latest case involves a man in his 20s who was identified by tracing the contacts of a group of four people who had tested positive over the weekend.

“He initially tested negative, but as per protocol, he needed to remain in self-isolation,” she told reporters. “He developed symptoms yesterday and was retested and the positive result came in last evening.”

Morrison said there are now six active cases on the Island, which has had a total of 33 COVID-19 cases and zero deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus.

One of the cases in the current cluster involves a woman who works at a seniors’ residence in Charlottetown, but all staff, residents and visitors to the facility have so far tested negative. Morrison said a second round of tests began Wednesday and will be completed Friday.

“I know we’ll all rest easier and feel better when we get the results of the second round of testing related to Whisperwood Villa,” Morrison said.

The cluster of cases are tied to a U.S. traveller with a student visa to study in P.E.I. That person was turned back at the Confederation bridge and is now being quarantined in Nova Scotia.

The traveller infected a P.E.I. resident when they were both in Nova Scotia and the Islander infected others upon returning to the Island.

Morrison said all of the infected Islanders are recovering at home.

She said a new testing clinic will open Monday in the Borden area for truckers and other essential workers who make frequent trips outside the Atlantic provinces.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-09,"HALIFAX—A Nova Scotia man has been charged with assaulting a peace officer near a border crossing — leading Premier Stephen McNeil to accuse the officer’s union of playing politics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cpl. Jennifer Clarke said the RCMP were called to assist at the Fort Lawrence crossing near the border with New Brunswick just before 8 p.m. Wednesday. She said a man from East Amherst has been charged with assaulting a peace officer and breach of conditions.

Jason MacLean, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, said the incident happened during a routine vehicle inspection, and it’s left the officer shaken.

MacLean said the driver objected to the inspection and tried to choke the male officer, who used his radio to call for help from some nearby conservation officers. Those officers helped detain the alleged assailant before the police arrived, he said in an interview Thursday.

The officer, MacLean said, “is very lucky that there were conservation officers nearby.” He said vehicle compliance officers have raised concerns about safety in the past because they work alone and are equipped only with radios.

During a COVID-19 news conference Thursday, Nova Scotia’s premier said the incident is concerning and thanked public servants for their efforts as the province reopens its borders to Atlantic Canada.

But when asked what his government would do to improve safety for peace officers, McNeil accused the union of distracting from wider efforts to recover from the pandemic. “To me, the union has looked at every opportunity to complain and looked to divide,” the premier said.

“I will not allow some people to try to divide our province as we continue to work our way through dealing with COVID and reopen our economy.”

McNeil said law enforcement agencies will be placed at the border if needed, but said some groups are bringing up past issues while the province tries to move forward.

The premier said the province reported no new cases of COVID-19 and one additional recovery from the illness.

MacLean said the premier’s outburst reflects a bad attitude towards unions and their safety demands.

He noted that his union had not raised the pandemic when discussing Wednesday’s incident, and said the inspection happening at the time was not related to the pandemic or to border controls.

“It’s unfortunate that (McNeil) gets that way because we’re speaking out on bona fide issues that are ones of safety,” MacLean said. “We’re going to continue to advocate.”

He said the union’s duty is to stand up for members at a time when safety at work is paramount, and that it’s unfortunate the premier interprets safety concerns as sources of division.

“Lost in all of this are the heroes that (McNeil) says are out there doing all the work, and I’ll tell you, it’s tough times,” MacLean said.

Read', 'Jillian Kestler-D Amoursstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter']",2020-07-09,"MONTREAL—Bars across Quebec will have to operate at half-capacity and close earlier than usual starting Friday, the province has announced as it seeks to prevent potential COVID-19 outbreaks.

At a news conference in Montreal Thursday, Health Minister Christian Dubé did not give examples of delinquent venues, but he said the surge in infections across the United States linked to bars made him nervous.

He said the government wants to be proactive and prevent the potential spread of the virus.

“I prefer to be more prudent than regret over the next few weeks and few months that we didn’t do the right thing,” Dubé said.

He referred to the fact the province reported 137 cases of COVID-19 Thursday — the highest number since June 19 — but said his decision to restrict access to bars was not linked to the new numbers.

As of Friday, bars and nightclubs can no longer sell alcohol after midnight and are limited to 50 per cent of their legal customer capacity. Customers will need to leave the premises by 1 a.m.

Dubé added that police will be out in higher numbers, and inspectors will be deployed to make sure bars and nightclubs follow the new rules.

“We need everyone to work together on this, including bar owners and their clients,” he said.

There have now been 5,609 deaths related to the coronavirus in Quebec and 56,216 COVID-19 cases, of which 25,616 are considered recovered.

Renaud Poulin, president of the Corporation des proprietaires de bars, brasseries et tavernes du Quebec, said the government has not provided the aid needed to help bar owners weather the financial impact of the pandemic.

He said hundreds of owners could be forced to shut down their businesses if the new restrictions remain in place for more than two weeks.

“If it lasts a week, it’s OK. If it lasts two weeks, it’s livable .... But the more the weeks go on, the harder it will be,” said Poulin, whose organization represents 1,200 bars across the province.

Bar owners from Quebec’s outlying regions have called to voice their concerns about the new measures, Poulin added. “They don’t have any cases (of COVID-19), but they’ll be penalized like everyone else. They think it’s really unfair,” he said.

Dubé said he knows bar owners are not happy. “But this is a compromise,” he said. “We said from the beginning that health is the priority.”

He also said the government is encouraging bars to collect personal information from their customers to help with contact-tracing in case an outbreak occurs.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a non-profit that advocates for business owners, said the restrictions are better than a complete shutdown.

The group called on the government to do more to help the venues withstand the pandemic.

“It is essential that these measures stay progressive, that the control carried out by the authorities is just and rigorous, and finally, that more action is taken to help these businesses,” the group’s Quebec vice-president, François Vincent, said in a statement.

Toby Lyle, co-owner and founder of Burgundy Lion Group, which owns three pubs and two restaurants in Montreal, said he was disappointed the province imposed blanket restrictions instead of going after individual bars that have flouted the rules.

“The vast majority of us try to do a really good job to make sure that we’re being as safe and sanitary as possible,” he said. But he said he understands that the government needed to do something.

Reducing opening hours and capacity will mean employees across his five locations will lose a combined 500 to 600 paid hours each week, Lyle said.

Like Poulin, he hopes the new restrictions won’t last long. “We cannot risk being in this situation for the next six months where we’re not fully open,” he said.

It may seem like an odd request when riders are going up and down, upside-down and sideways at high speeds. But intense vocal expressions are thought to produce droplets that could spread the coronavirus.

A consortium of Japanese theme parks developed the rule so they could reopen with precautions after closing due to the pandemic. However, as The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, theme park goers are having a hard time following it.

In response, two executives from the Fuji-Q Highland amusement park appeared in a four-minute video where they rode the park’s Fujiyama coaster in complete silence.

“Please scream inside your heart,” the video advises at its conclusion.

U.S. theme parks have issued no guidance for screaming on roller coasters. They have required social distancing, temperature checks and face masks.

T&T chief executive Tina Lee issued a statement defending her staff in the video at its location on Central Parkway, where an argument broke out over mask wearing.

Two videos appear to show a customer arguing with another customer and a store employee. When the first customer was asked to wear a mask as per store policy, the incident escalated.

Multiple racist statements from the irritated customer can be heard throughout the video as he claimed to have asthma.

Additionally, the customer accuses the man of bringing the COVID-19 virus into Canada from China.

“Due to the customer’s behaviour, we stand by the store manager’s decision to ask the customer to leave,” Lee said.

She also pointed out that customers who have medical conditions are encouraged to tell T&T customer services so that they can shop for them instead. They also offer online services.

Warning: Video content may be disturbing to some viewers

“His accusations are unacceptable in our workplace. We are a proud Canadian company employing over 5,200 Canadians across the country, and we happened to be celebrating this very fact in the stores at the time of the incident for Canada Day,” read Lee’s statement.

Const. Sarah Patten confirmed to the Star that Peel police are investigating the incident. Patten said investigators are looking to see if it qualifies as a “hate-motivated incident.” Possible charges laid could also include causing a disturbance, Patten said.

In response to the incident, Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie provided a statement, saying racism has no place in the city.

“Racist, hurtful and divisive comments like these have absolutely no place in our city and are frankly appalling. We pride ourselves on our diversity; it is what makes our city one of the best places to live in the world. To those who seek to divide us, I send a strong message that you are not welcome in Mississauga.”

Crombie continued to state that “face masks have been scientifically proven to be critical in reducing the spread of COVID-19 — period,” and asked residents “to continue to be kind, considerate and think of others.”

The city passed a bylaw this week making wearing face coverings in public settings mandatory starting Friday.

“Let’s not make this into a divisive issue. We’ve gotten to where we are today by working together and listening to the advice of our public health professionals. Let’s keep it up and continue to fight this as team Mississauga,” said Crombie.

T&T was started by Cindy Lee, a Taiwanese immigrant, who opened the first two locations in British Columbia during the early 1990s. In 2009, T&T was acquired by Loblaws.

“These types of incidents are rare, and we believe most Canadians do not share the same view,” Lee said

The statement finished by thanking T&T employees for “standing up for what we know is right.”

Reach Him Via Email', 'Scornwell Metroland.Com']",2020-07-09,"Masks will be mandatory in most indoor public spaces in Peel Region starting Friday after local councils passed a bylaw this week.

In Mississauga, council passed a bylaw Wednesday mandating non-medical masks be worn, with some exceptions, in indoor public spaces in the city.

That means for visits to indoor spaces open to the public — including stores, malls and fitness facilities as well as hair and nail salons — individuals will be required to wear masks unless they’re exempt for age or health reasons.

Masks will also be required inside taxis, municipal building such as libraries and at places of worship, except during religious ceremonies that are “incompatible with face covering,” according to a city staff presentation.

The rules wouldn’t apply to individuals with medical conditions preventing the use of masks and children aged two or under. Masks will also not be required for staff and workers separated from the public as well as individuals eating and drinking when indoor seating in restaurants restarts.

For those who have to wear them, non-medical masks would include a face covering such as a balaclava, bandana or similar items that cover the nose, mouth and chin.

Mayor Bonnie Crombie said the move was a precautionary measure to help avoid another wave of COVID-19.

“We have businesses that are open,” she said. “We want to ensure that they stay open.”

While council supported a one-week grace period after July 10, when fines for non-compliance begin, they could be a minimum of $500 and maximum of $100,000.

Coun. John Kovac was the lone vote on council against the mandatory mask bylaw.

He said he was concerned that people with disabilities preventing them from wearing masks may feel “ostracized” with the mandatory bylaw.

“If we’re going to go forward and pass this bylaw, we just have to be aware of the complications that exist,” he said.

According to the staff presentation, businesses and operators have to ensure that no one without a mask can enter their establishment, unless they’re exempt from the rules.

In a letter to council, Mississauga Board of Trade CEO David Wojcik asked that a mandatory mask rule only be required inside businesses “where physical distancing is not practical or possible.”

He also asked that the enforcement of the bylaw not fall to businesses as they could cause “potential conflicts between businesses and their customers.”

“The individual not complying with the (bylaw) is the one who should be fined and not the business doing its best to ensure compliance,” Wojcik said.

Sam Rogers, Mississauga’s director of enforcement, said businesses are required to ask a person not wearing a mask if they are exempt from the rule, but not what the exemption is for.

“So if they ask that question they have complied with the bylaw,” he said.

Council passed the bylaw following a lengthy closed session with city lawyers discussing mandatory masks in indoor spaces that was not streamed to the public.

In Brampton, council also ratified the face covering bylaw at its Wednesday meeing. The bylaw requires securely fastened face coverings that fully cover the face including the mouth, nose and chin. Plastic or Plexiglass face shields do not qualify.

Children under the age of two and those unable to wear masks for medical reasons are among the exemptions, along with day cares, school buses, classrooms and kids’ day camps.

“There is going to be a reasonableness because we know young children will not be covered by that bylaw,” Mayor Patrick Brown during a news conference Wednesday.

“Individuals and businesses not adhering to these bylaws may be fined a minimum of $500 and a maximum of up to $100,000 for each offence.

“So, there are serious fines. This is not just a warning or a strong recommendation. This is for mandatory masks.”

The mayor added the city will be distributing 1,000,000 masks through various sources to help facilitate compliance with the new bylaw.

In Caledon, a bylaw was passed Tuesday.

“It’s extremely important that we continue to follow the guidelines of public health officials and wear non-medial masks while inside a public venue,” Mayor Allan Thompson said in a statement.

“Wearing a mask is just one way for us to keep ourselves and our families safe. Continue to follow the ‘Core Four’ — wear a mask, stay two metres apart, wash your hands often, and if sick, get tested and stay at home. Together we can stop the spread of COVID-19.”

The move follows a June 30 recommendation by Peel Region’s medical officer of health Dr. Lawrence Loh that Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon pass bylaws mandating use of non-medical masks in public places.

10:40 a.m.: Canada isn’t prepared for second wave, report says

6:10 a.m.: Virus showing no signs of slowing in U.S., Brazil and India.

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

6:20 p.m. There are 106,805 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, according to The Canadian Press, including 8,749 deaths.

This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario; see this file):

Quebec: 56,216 confirmed (including 5,609 deaths, 25,616 resolved)

Ontario: 36,348 confirmed (including 2,703 deaths, 31,977 resolved)

Alberta: 8,519 confirmed (including 161 deaths, 7,774 resolved)

British Columbia: 3,028 confirmed (including 186 deaths, 2,667 resolved)

New Brunswick: 166 confirmed (including two deaths, 163 resolved)

Prince Edward Island: 33 confirmed (including 27 resolved)

Repatriated Canadians account 13 confirmed cases, all of which were resolved

Yukon: 11 confirmed, all of which were resolved

Northwest Territories: five confirmed, all of which were resolved

Nunavut reports one case presumed to be COVID-19.

5 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 38,352 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,742 deaths, an increase of 120 cases since Wednesday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

However, because Thursday is an off-day in Toronto Public Health’s three-day a week reporting schedule, the daily total does not include an update from the unit that has seen by far the most cases of any in the province.

Starting this week, Toronto Public Health switched to reporting cases only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

As such, the provincewide count of COVID-19 cases reported each day is likely to be higher than typical on those days, and vice versa.

Over the last seven days, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 137 new infections per day, well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April.

Both cases and deaths have fallen sharply in Ontario in recent months.

Another two new fatal cases were reported Wednesday, one each in Durham and Peel Regions. During the worst of the province’s epidemic, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Thursday, the province reported 123 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19, 31 in an intensive care unit, of whom 23 are on a ventilator. These numbers are themselves near the lowest the province has reported since it started publishing information on hospitalizations in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,703, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases,. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4:38 p.m. York Regional Council passed a motion making the wearing of face masks mandatory in public indoor spaces as of July 17.

3 p.m.: Manitoba has recorded its ninth straight day without any new COVID-19 cases and, with more people recovering, the number of active cases has dropped to five.

The province’s chief public health officer, Dr. Brent Roussin, says the numbers are encouraging but people must continue to take precautions.

Roussin says Manitobans may also have to get used to wearing masks more often once the flu season arrives in the fall.

Roussin says that if the number of COVID-19 cases rises along with seasonal flu cases, the government’s messaging about the importance of wearing masks will get stronger.

He says there are no immediate plans to mandate mask use in public places. But he says the novel coronavirus is going to be around for some time and he won’t rule out issuing such an order if needed.

2:59 p.m.: Premier John Horgan says British Columbia’s restart is gaining ground as some industries resume operations and more people leave their homes to participate in the economy.

He says the number of passengers on transit and ferries is growing, and television and movie productions have restarted, as well as restaurants serving more customers.

Horgan says B.C.’s successful efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and the willingness of people to spend more time out in public leave him optimistic.

The latest B.C. job numbers are due Friday and Finance Minister Carole James is releasing a fiscal update next week.

The federal government’s fiscal update Wednesday forecast a deficit of more than $343 billion and up to two million people unemployed.

Last month, B.C.’s jobless rate was 13.4 per cent, with more than 350,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic.

2:29 p.m.: Education Minister Stephen Lecce says the Ontario government prefers a return to in-class learning for students this September.

Lecce’s statement comes weeks after the province told school boards to prepare for an array of options, including a return to regular class learning, online learning or a combination of both.

Premier Doug Ford said last month that with different areas of the province at different stages of reopening, the same should apply to school boards, so there won’t be a one-size-fits-all approach in schools.

Lecce says the government wants to have all students in class, but health officials must approve.

He says school boards, and the government, must make plans to continue student learning in light of the unpredictable conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lecce says while cases appear to be on the decline across Ontario, the province must be prepared to respond to any potential spike in the fall.

2:16 p.m.: Quebec says it is limiting the operating hours and capacity of bars and nightclubs across the province in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks as the number of new infections begins to climb.

Health Minister Christian Dube did not give any examples of delinquent venues but told reporters today the surge in infections across the United States linked to bars made him nervous.

He also cited the fact the province reported 137 cases of COVID-19 today — the highest number since June 19 — but said his decision to restrict access to bars was not linked to the new numbers.

Starting Friday, bars and nightclubs can no longer sell alcohol after midnight and are limited to 50 per cent of their legal customer capacity.

Dube adds that police will be out in higher numbers, and inspectors will be deployed to make sure bars and nightclubs follow the new rules.

There have now been 5,609 deaths related to the novel coronavirus in Quebec and 56,216 COVID-19 cases, of which 25,616 are considered recovered.

1:24 p.m.: Authorities are enacting stricter parking rules at Toronto beaches after a number of nighttime parties were busted over the weekend.

The city says that parking at three popular beaches will be restricted after 7 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

They also note a “significant increase” in the number of gatherings happening at beaches where people are not practising physical distancing.

Partygoers have reportedly brought DJ equipment, lit bonfires, and participated in excessive drinking while leaving behind heaps of litter.

Alongside an increase in bylaw officers patrolling the beaches, the city says Toronto police will also be increasing their presence to crackdown on illegal gatherings.

12 p.m.: Prince Edward Island’s chief medical officer of health is reporting one new case of COVID-19 that she says is connected to a recent cluster of cases on the Island.

Dr. Heather Morrison said today the latest case involves a person identified by tracing the contacts of a group of four people who had tested positive over the weekend.

Morrison says the man, in his 20s, originally tested negative.

He developed mild symptoms Wednesday, however, and results of another test came back positive.

Morrison says there are now six active cases on the Island, which has had a total of 33 COVID-19 cases and zero deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus.

One of the cases in the current cluster involves a woman who works at a seniors’ residence in Charlottetown, but all staff, residents and visitors to the facility have so far tested negative.

11:30 a.m.: Quebec is expected to impose more restrictions on bars today to limit the spread of COVID-19.

Health Minister Christian Dube and public health director Horacio Arruda are scheduled to make an announcement this afternoon.

Multiple sources tell The Canadian Press that the province will force bars to close earlier and require owners to collect contact information from patrons for tracing purposes in case of a COVID-19 outbreak.

The move comes two weeks after authorities reopened those businesses following months of pandemic-induced shutdowns.

Dube had threatened to close bars and revoke their licenses earlier this week after reports of venues in the Montreal area violating public health guidelines on such things as physical distancing.

Quebec health officials reported 137 new COVID-19 cases today and six additional deaths, four of which had occurred before July 1.

There have now been 5,609 deaths related to the novel coronavirus in Quebec and 56,216 COVID-19 cases, of which 25,616 are considered recovered.

11:25 a.m.: Asian and European officials pleaded with their citizens Thursday to respect modest precautions as several countries saw coronavirus outbreaks accelerate or sought to prevent new flare-ups, while the virus showed no signs of slowing its initial advance in Africa and the Americas.

Following two nights of anti-lockdown protests in Serbia, authorities banned mass gatherings in the capital of Belgrade amid an uptick in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Officials elsewhere in Europe warned of the risk of new flareups due to lax social distancing, while officials in Tokyo and Hong Kong reviewed nightclubs, restaurants and other public gathering spots as a source of their latest cases.

Infections mounted at a frightening speed in the countries with the world’s highest confirmed caseloads — the United States, India and Brazil. Between them, the three account for the majority of new cases worldwide reported daily.

11:15 a.m.: A COVID-19 testing blitz of farm workers in Windsor-Essex is accounting for half the number of new cases in Ontario.

The province reported 170 new cases Thursday — 86 of which are in Windsor-Essex.

On Twitter, Health Minister Christine Elliott said that’s because “targeted testing of temporary workers on farms to contain outbreaks has continued.”

“In fact, 30 of Ontario’s 34 (public health units) are reporting five or fewer cases, with 20 of them reporting no new cases,” Elliott tweeted.

“Yesterday, Ontario processed over 26,000 tests and we continue to lead the country in daily testing. Hospitalizations, ICU admissions and vented patients are stable or have decreased,” she added.

The Star’s Robert Benzie has the full story.

10:40 a.m.: A new report from a committee of senators says the country is ill-prepared to handle a second wave of COVID-19.

The Senate’s social affairs committee says the federal government needs to pay urgent attention to seniors in long-term care homes where outbreaks and deaths in the pandemic have been concentrated.

There are also concerns in the report about the vulnerability of low-income seniors should there be a second wave of the novel coronavirus later this year.

The document made public this morning is the committee’s first set of observations on the government’s response to the pandemic, with a final report expected later this year.

Senators on the committee say the national emergency stockpile of personal protective gear like masks, gowns and gloves, wasn’t managed well over the years, nor sufficiently stocked when the pandemic struck the country in March.

Committee members add concerns that military members could be deployed without sufficient personal protective equipment because of “inconsistencies from international procurement.”

10:30 a.m.: Masks will be mandatory in most indoor public spaces in Peel Region starting Friday after local councils passed a bylaw this week.

The move follows a June 30 recommendation by Peel Region’s medical officer of health Dr. Lawrence Loh that Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon pass bylaws mandating use of non-medical masks in public places.

10:26 a.m.: A crowdsourced survey of Canadian parents finds that nearly three-quarters of respondents are concerned about their children’s social lives during the pandemic.

Statistics Canada published a report Thursday about the impact of COVID-19 on children and families.

Unlike most of the agency’s studies, the survey wasn’t randomly sampled and therefore isn’t statistically representative of the Canadian population.

The responses suggest that 71 per cent of parents who filled out the online questionnaire were very or extremely concerned about their children’s opportunities to socialize with friends, and more than half were very or extremely worried about their kids being lonely or socially isolated.

Participants’ top concern for their families was balancing the demands of childcare, school and work, while nearly two-thirds of parents were very or extremely concerned about managing their children’s behaviours, anxiety and emotion.

Excessive screen time was also a chief concern among participants, with nine in 10 reporting that their children use devices daily or almost daily.

More than 32,000 participants volunteered their responses to the online questionnaire between June 9 and June 22. Statistics Canada says a large proportion of participants were women who were born in Canada and had a bachelor’s degree or higher.

9:26 a.m.: More than 1.3 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, a historically high pace that shows that many employers are still laying people off in the face of a resurgent coronavirus.

The persistently elevated level of layoffs are occurring as a spike in virus cases has forced six states to reverse their move to reopen businesses. Those six — Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Michigan and Texas — make up one-third of the U.S. economy. Fifteen other states have suspended their re-openings. Collectively, the pullback has stalled a tentative recovery in the job market and is likely triggering additional layoffs.

Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the number of applications for unemployment aid fell from 1.4 million in the previous week. The figure has now topped 1 million for 16 straight weeks. Before the pandemic, the record high for weekly unemployment applications was fewer than 700,000.

8:37 a.m.: The head of the World Health Organization says former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark will lead a new panel to give an “honest assessment” of the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointments to the newly created Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.

The announcement comes after the WHO’s general assembly in May called for a comprehensive evaluation of the WHO and the world response to the outbreak. It comes after repeated criticism by U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration of the U.N. health agency over its handling of the pandemic and alleged deference to China, where COVID-19 first emerged.

7:57 a.m.: Serbia mulled how to curb accelerating coronavirus infections following two nights of clashes involving anti-lockdown demonstrators, while the virus showed no sign of slowing Thursday in the countries with the highest caseloads — the United States, India and Brazil.

The three nations on separate continents are accounting for more than 60 per cent of new confirmed cases, according to recent tallies from Johns Hopkins University. India on Thursday reported 25,000 new cases; the United States on Wednesday reported just short of the record 60,000 cases set a day earlier, and Brazil reported nearly 45,000.

Much of Europe appeared to have put the worst of the crisis behind it, at least for now. But Serbia has emerged as a new focus of concern — and of unrest. The country’s crisis team was expected to reimpose a ban gatherings in the capital, Belgrade and to limit the cafe and night club operations following a spike in infections that officials say threatens the Serbian health system.

7:55 a.m.: As Premier Doug Ford moves to give the Progressive Conservative government more permanent powers, he has extended Ontario’s temporary COVID-19 emergency orders until July 22.

Ford announced Thursday that he needed to so in order to “support our front-line care providers, protect our most vulnerable, and ensure we can rapidly respond to potential outbreaks or surges” of a virus that has killed more than 2,700 Ontarians since March.

“Our government is getting Ontario back on track and more people back to work, but at the same time taking steps to ensure we don’t undo the tremendous progress we have made together,” the premier said.

7:55 a.m.: Indonesia reported a record jump in daily coronavirus infections as a military academy and an industrial area emerged as the nation’s newest clusters, which President Joko Widodo called a “red signal.”

There were 2,657 new cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 70,736, health ministry said Thursday, while 58 more people succumbed to the disease, raising the death toll to 3,414. Indonesia has the highest number of cases and fatalities in Southeast Asia.

West Java, adjoining capital Jakarta and the most-populous province, reported 962 new cases after authorities found two clusters of infections. Both the areas have been isolated and under control, according to Achmad Yurianto, spokesman for the government task force.

Indonesia has struggled to stem the spread of the pandemic after easing of social distancing rules to allow resumption of economic activities triggered a surge in infections. Jokowi said relaxing of mobility rules should be carefully weighed against health and economic considerations.

6:15 a.m.: The chair of Toronto’s Board of Health is urging the province to take swift action to fight COVID-19 in the city’s northwest corner, which has been hardest hit by the virus, and bridge the stark socioeconomic divide that is putting residents in these neighbourhoods at risk.

“The social determinants of health, like income, race and ethnicity, and housing, affect who gets sick and who does not,” Councillor Joe Cressy said in a letter on Wednesday to Ontario’s health minister and chief medical officer of health.

“Now is the time for partnership and collaboration,” Cressy said. “I am asking you to help us stop the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable and impacted communities, and to address the social determinants of health that have created deep health inequities.”

6:12 a.m.: In Australia, which had initial success containing the outbreak, authorities on Thursday reported 179 new cases, most of them in the city of Melbourne, where authorities are battling a resurgence and have imposed a new six-week lockdown.

Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said six new cases were from a Melbourne high school which has become the state’s largest known cluster, with 113 people infected. More than 2,000 students and hundreds of staff are in quarantine.

6:10 a.m.: India on Thursday reported nearly 25,000 new coronavirus infections, as the disease continued its ominous spread through the nation of nearly 1.4 billion people.

The virus is showing no signs of slowing in the worst-affected countries: the United States, Brazil and India. The three nations are accounting for more than 60 per cent of new cases, according to recent tallies from Johns Hopkins University.

The U.S. reported nearly 59,000 new daily cases, just short of the record 60,000 cases set a day earlier, as President Donald Trump insisted that schools reopen in the fall. Brazil reported nearly 45,000 new cases.

6:06 a.m.: The coronavirus pandemic in Africa is reaching “full speed” and it’s good to prepare for the worst-case scenario, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief said Thursday, after a South African official said a single province is preparing 1.5 million gravesites.

Just a day after confirmed virus cases across Africa surpassed the half-million milestone the total was over 522,000 and climbing, with more than 12,000 deaths. With testing levels low, the real numbers are unknown.

South Africa has the most confirmed cases with over 224,000, and for the first time Gauteng province — home to Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria — has the country’s most cases with over 75,000, or 33 per cent.

With few windows and carpeting, the apartment has been retaining the heat. The heat wave gripping Toronto and the GTA adds a new layer to the closures and restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Wednesday, the city had experienced six consecutive days of temperatures rising above 30 C, prompting heat warnings from the city and new restrictions on water usage for smaller regions around the GTA.

Jarvis-Cross is one of the many Torontonians weathering the sweltering conditions without air conditioning, while also following physical distancing guidelines meant to keep people safe from the virus.

“Yeah, you can’t go swimming. People are going to the beach — I don’t think it's a good idea,” Jarvis-Cross said. Previously, “if I didn't have my office, I would work at a library because they’re air-conditioned. But (now) you can’t do that.”

Working from home during the heat wave has also meant a new set of challenges: her computer is overheating. “A lot of the work I would usually be doing, for my job … I can't really do as much as I would normally do because my computer overheats,” Jarvis-Cross said.

She’s struggling to sleep through the night. “I am not usually a person that has trouble sleeping, but I wake up … upwards of 10 times a night just because it's so hot,” Jarvis-Cross said. “And then you don't feel good any part of the day. I always just feel physically uncomfortable.”

Michelle Nochomovitz, who lives in the city’s west-end Bloorcourt neighbourhood, told the Star that poor insulation in her home means that while the winters are cold, the summers are sweltering.

The pandemic means that a job hunt that was underway before the shutdown has been put on hold. “Unfortunately, I still can’t afford a proper cooling unit or anything like that,” Nochomovitz said.

To cool off, she’s been drinking ice water and running fans around the apartment, while trying to dress in light clothing. When she can, Nochomovitz heads to the park because it is often cooler outside.

She estimated the temperature has climbed up to 35 C inside her unit.

“The problem this year, obviously with COVID is that you have to be so careful when you're out,” Nochomovitz said, noting that with high-risk friends and family members, she’s taking extra precautions to avoid getting sick — which means limiting trips out of the house. “I'm really trying to minimize any kind of exposure.”

In Toronto, “there are no bylaws that say you cannot have a window unit,” said Marva Burnett, president of ACORN Canada, an advocacy group for social and economic justice. “As long as they’re properly installed, it should be in the window.”

Burnett noted that at this point, there is no law mandating a maximum indoor temperature like there is for minimum temperatures in the winter.

“Tenants should be allowed to be comfortable and cool in their own units,” she said.

Torontonians aren’t alone in suffering through the hot weather, which has reached across Ontario this week. Further in the GTA, Krystal McLean said that it is often hotter in the 18th-floor apartment she shares with her mother than it is outside.

“My mom and I sit on the balcony a lot. Sometimes when we leave the balcony door open, you can feel waves of thick heat leaving our apartment,” she explained. “We get so exhausted sometimes because of the heat, there’s days where we don’t even cook or make food because we don’t have the energy.”

McLean said she hopes to see central air conditioning “considered as much of an essential as central heating during the cooler months.”

On Monday, the city opened 15 emergency cooling centres slated to remain open for the duration of the heat warning, open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and offering accessible and air-conditioned spaces for residents without access to a cool space.

The city has moved to implement measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 inside the facilities. Masks are being provided at the cooling centres for residents without them, the city said.

The heat was interrupted briefly Wednesday afternoon as a torrential downpour of rain drenched the city and caused severe flooding in several neighbourhoods. The city was put on a brief tornado watch before it was downgraded to a severe thunderstorm watch, Environment Canada indicated.

Prior to the downpour, though, an unusually low amount of rain landed in the Toronto area throughout the month of June.

Since June 10, the last time Environment Canada reported a significant downpour in the Toronto area, the city has experienced soaring temperatures that have prompted heat warnings from the city and water restrictions for smaller regions around the GTA.

Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, has dubbed it the “summer of dryness.”

“We’ve had an unusually low amount of rain,” said Phillips. “While the heat we’re experiencing isn’t record-setting compared to other years, it’s exacerbated by the sheer lack of rain and moisture.”

Toronto typically sees between 85 to 90 millimetres of rainfall in June, Phillips said. Yet only seven millimetres fell this June, less than 10 per cent of the month’s typical rainfall numbers.

Environment and Climate Change Canada issued a heat warning for Toronto on July 1 and extended it to the end of this week. The agency issues heat warnings when it forecasts two or more consecutive days with temperatures north of 31 C with minimum nighttime temperatures of 20 C.

The record for consecutive days over 30 C in Toronto was set in the summer of 1953, when the city faced 12 consecutive days of temperatures over 30 C.

Read', 'Rachel Mendlesonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'With Files Kate Allen', 'Jennifer Yang', 'Rachel Mendleson Is A Toronto-Based Investigative Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"The chair of Toronto’s Board of Health is urging the province to take swift action to fight COVID-19 in the city’s northwest corner, which has been hardest hit by the virus, and bridge the stark socioeconomic divide that is putting residents in these neighbourhoods at risk.

“The social determinants of health, like income, race and ethnicity, and housing, affect who gets sick and who does not,” Councillor Joe Cressy said in a letter on Wednesday to Ontario’s health minister and chief medical officer of health.

“Now is the time for partnership and collaboration,” Cressy said. “I am asking you to help us stop the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable and impacted communities, and to address the social determinants of health that have created deep health inequities.”

Cressy is calling on the province to take steps to “protect residents” in northwest Toronto neighbourhoods overburdened by COVID-19, including: providing increased access to testing; funding a proposal to create free accommodations for those unable to safely self-isolate at home; ensuring better protections for at-risk workers; and implementing a “more efficient and fully automated” system for reporting lab results to public health units.

The health ministry did not make Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, or Health Minister Christine Elliott available for an interview on Wednesday.

In a statement, a ministry spokesperson described several programs the government has developed “to protect our province’s most vulnerable,” including the ability to “rapidly deploy agile testing resources,” but did not specifically address the high rates of COVID in Toronto’s northwest corner or respond to questions about whether mobile testing units would be deployed there.

Cressy is also asking the province, which is responsible for testing, to share COVID-19 data it is poised to start collecting on race, income, language and household size with local public health units and affected communities — something the ministry told the Star it is “considering.”

“We are in the process of working with public health and privacy experts to determine how best to collect this data across all public health units,” the spokesperson added.

Toronto Public Health has been gathering data on race, income and household composition as part of its contact tracing protocol since May.

Cressy’s letter comes after data from Toronto Public Health made clear that the city’s northwest corner is bearing the brunt of the pandemic, with the release of a map showing COVID-19 cases by neighbourhood. The burden of disease is heaviest in Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown, where, according to the latest numbers, the rate of sporadic infections is 1,241 per 100,000 people — 22 times higher than in The Beaches, the city’s least-affected neighbourhood.

As the Star reported last month, these northwest neighbourhoods have some of the highest concentrations of residents who are low-income, racialized and living in cramped housing while working in higher-risk sectors like manufacturing. Residents and community workers told the Star that high rates of COVID were yet another example of how the “system has failed” the northwest corner, which spans a large swath of Toronto, wedged roughly between Dufferin Street and Highway 427 to the west, running south from Steeles Avenue to Eglinton Avenue.

The notion that the way residents in these neighbourhoods live and work is putting them more at risk during the pandemic was further emphasized by Toronto Public Health data released last week.

Kemi Jacobs, executive director of Delta Family Resource Centre, which has three locations in northwest neighbourhoods, said on Wednesday that the request for increased support from the province is “very timely.”

“For me, the key word is proactive. Now that we know, let’s not just sit back, let’s do something to prevent … as opposed to react,” she said.

Leticia Deawuo, who lives at Jane and Sheppard, and is executive director of the Black Creek Community Farm, said government must do more to stop the spread of COVID in the northwest corner. However, she said “we cannot lose sight” of the systemic changes that are needed to address anti-Black racism, improve working conditions and lift wages.

“We know that there are these deep inequities that exist,” she said. “So, what are they going to do in the long-term to make sure our communities can be healthy?”

In an interview, Cressy said he is “deeply concerned that we are entering a prolonged period in the arc of COVID where it’s going to continue to disproportionately affect — and indeed harm — the most vulnerable members of our society, and our city,” and that protecting these residents requires “a comprehensive intergovernmental response.”

“We don’t oversee the testing system. We don’t oversee the lab reporting system,” he said. “This work was required yesterday, we’d like to see it done today, and we’re raising it in this letter in the hopes that we will see movement on these issues as soon as possible.”

A lack of access to testing is of particular concern in the city’s northwest corner, Cressy said, where, despite the neighbourhood-level data released by Toronto Public Health more than a month ago showing high rates of COVID, “we have struggled to see a proactive and responsive provincial testing plan.”

This corner has historically been considered a “primary care desert,” with higher-than-average rates of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, as the Star has reported. Although testing rates had been high overall, the Star found there were barriers to accessing assessment centres because travelling by TTC while symptomatic is discouraged, and not everyone owns a car.

Toronto city council will debate the proposal from the board of health for the city to work with other levels of government to create voluntary, free accommodations for those who test positive for COVID-19 and can’t safely self-isolate at home. In his letter on Wednesday, Cressy said the data shows that infection rates in Toronto “are almost four times higher in neighbourhoods where more people live in overcrowded households.”

Cressy told the Star he is in “active conversations” with the federal government about this proposal and is “optimistic that funding is coming” from Ottawa. But he said the provincial government has not yet indicated a willingness to support the plan.

The ministry did not respond to questions about the proposal on Wednesday.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Sidhartha Banerjeethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Sidhartha Banerjeethe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-08,"MONTREAL—Quebec says it wants to gauge public interest before it recommends Quebecers download a smartphone application designed to alert them if they may have been exposed to COVID-19.

Éric Caire, minister in charge of digital transformation, urged Quebecers Wednesday to fill out an online questionnaire about their appetite for such a tool and what their concerns about the technology might be.

Caire’s public consultation initiative follows the announcement by the federal government in June that it intends to deploy a COVID-19 smartphone application in Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the made-in-Canada mobile app was ready for testing in Ontario.

Caire noted some provinces have expressed interest, but Quebec will be the first one to quiz residents on whether such an application would work in the province. A spokesperson for Caire said Quebec was studying Ottawa’s application, adding the province won’t make a decision until the public consultations are completed.

“What we want is to preserve the privacy of Quebecers, protect their personal information while deploying an application that could prove useful for the protection of our population and the fight against the pandemic,” Caire told reporters in Quebec City.

The purpose of the application is to notify people that they have been near an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

Caire declined to offer his own opinion about whether people should use the technology, but noted the experience has been mixed in other countries.

He said in Germany, the population was receptive to a COVID-19 application. In France, however, the app was “useless,” Caire said, in part, because of “anaemic” participation that hovered around two per cent.

“If no one downloads it, what is it useful for? So if people don’t want it, they won’t download it. If they don’t download it, it’s useless,” Caire said.

According to the documents produced by Caire’s office, the app would anonymously notify those using it when they have been near an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 within the preceding 14 days. “This application would exclude any form of geolocation by GPS. There will be no exchange of personal information.”

Instead, someone diagnosed with COVID-19 would be assigned a code in their smartphone that would be transmitted anonymously via Bluetooth to other nearby phones.

Caire said the questionnaire will be online until Aug. 2, adding it would take between four and six weeks for the app to be deployed in the province.

Quebec is preparing for a second wave of coronavirus, Caire said, “and in this context ... all options to fight a resurgence of the pandemic must be part of the reflection.”

On Wednesday, Quebec’s Health Department reported 13 additional COVID-19 deaths, bringing the total to 5,603 since the beginning of the pandemic.

Authorities said six deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while seven others reported Wednesday occurred before June 30. The number of people hospitalized decreased by 16 to 331, but one more patient was listed in intensive care compared with the prior day, for a total of 27.

The province also reported another 82 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of people infected to 56,079, including 25,534 cases that are considered recovered.

In Quebec’s Montérégie region, which has seen a recent spike in cases, the local health authority on Thursday opened a mobile COVID-19 testing clinic at a community centre in Mercier, southwest of Montreal. The town has seen several businesses and restaurants close after patrons and employees tested positive for COVID-19.

Health authorities say 50 cases in the region are linked to two house parties in late June.

On Monday, the latest day for which testing results are available, the province said it conducted 7,576 tests. Health authorities have said in recent days they are determined to increase testing capacity.

Joel Etienne, a lawyer for Dr. Jean Robert Ngola, has issued a statement saying the RCMP ruled out criminal charges.

A spokesperson for the RCMP did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.

“The legal team for (Dr. Ngola) is once again calling on Premier Blaine Higgs to issue a public apology for the unacceptable and unfounded public accusations the doctor has been forced to endure,” Etienne wrote.

Ngola said he travelled from Campbellton, N.B., to Quebec to pick up his four-year-old daughter because the girl’s mother had to attend a funeral in Africa.

He admitted that upon his return from the overnight trip, he did not self-isolate for 14 days, but he says that was consistent with practices of his colleagues and superiors, and he believes he may have gotten the virus from a patient or another health professional.

Etienne says Ngola was not “patient zero” and the premier needs to apologize.

At a news conference in late May, Higgs did not refer to Ngola by name but referred to an “irresponsible” health worker and said the matter had been referred to the RCMP.

Days later, Higgs walked back his remarks slightly and appeared to acknowledge a growing public outrage toward the doctor, telling people to leave the investigation into any wrongdoing up to law enforcement and the person’s employer.

Again Wednesday, Higgs said he wasn’t the one who made the doctor’s identity public.

“I don’t believe certainly that I did that. My comments that I made at that time, I stand behind those comments,” Higgs said.

The cluster of cases in the Campbellton area included about 40 people who tested positive for COVID-19, leading to two deaths.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-07,"As many as 270 seasonal workers with Toronto parks have opted not to return to work this summer due to safety concerns stemming from COVID-19.

Staff from the city’s Parks, Forestry and Recreation division have raised concerns to the Star about a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and training on how to properly use it, while distribution of PPE has been uneven across city programs.

Recreation staff have also said it can be nearly impossible to practise physical distancing properly, given the requirements of their jobs.

A City of Toronto spokesperson confirmed that approximately 270 camp staff have declined their summer work assignments, noting part-time employees who have previously worked at camp programs have the option of accepting or declining shifts.

“To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, CampTO programs will meet health guidelines designed in consultation with Toronto Public Health and in alignment with provincial health guidelines for day camps,” the city said in a statement to the Star.

“Guidelines include lower ratios and capacity, physical distancing, mandatory health screening and enhanced facility cleaning.”

According to city guidelines, staff and campers alike must be screened via a temperature check and fill a form each day. Face masks are mandatory indoors and staff have been provided with PPE, the city said.

However, the widespread refusal of city employees to return to work indicates “that the city needs to take the concerns of its employees more seriously,” said Dave Mitchell, president of CUPE Local 79, the union representing City of Toronto workers.

“The city had months to prepare for a return to work, yet the provision of personal protective equipment, proper training, and work site inspections were not adequate across many of its programs and work locations.”

He alleged that health and safety representatives requested pre-inspections of facilities before staff returned to work, but employees have returned to find broken equipment and safety issues.

“Instead of addressing the legitimate health and safety concerns of these employees, the city initially took an aggressive step by threatening to remove them from their Emergency Leave status and take away their right to return to their positions post COVID-19,” Mitchell said.

“Thankfully, after some productive talks, the city has had a change of heart and is working with us to try and address many of the issues presented by our members.”

The city’s camp program is seeing reduced enrollment compared with years past. Janie Romoff, the city’s general manager for parks, forestry and recreation, said CampTO is currently at about 70 per cent capacity through the summer.

“Some weeks are more full than others,” she said, adding in some locations there have been little interest and programs have been cancelled.

The city has adjusted programming based on where interest is.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-08,"EDMONTON—Sitting outside the hospital, away from the rain, Victoria Steepe says she’s scared.

She came to Edmonton’s Misericordia Community Hospital for a hip surgery, and she’s been here since April because of complications.

What has her worried now, though, is something else.

The west Edmonton facility has been grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19. Three people have died and 35 patients and staff members have been affected.

On Wednesday, health officials to put the facility on virtual lockdown. The hospital, which receives about 130 emergency patients a day, in normal times, won’t be taking anymore patients as it deals with the situation.

“It would probably kill me,” Steepe, a smoker with bad lungs, says of the virus.

“I want to go home, and not just because I’ve been here for so long. I don’t feel safe.”

Behind her, hospital staff decked out in personal protective gear sit by the front door. There’s very little foot traffic and, aside from some signs posted, little indication that this hospital is staring down an outbreak.

Steepe got in an argument with hospital staff about going outside, one of the few respites she has from the stifling room she’s been confined to, where she said, the air’s stale from the hospital not recycling it.

Her son drives up to the curb sometimes and they talk from a distance. She wears a mask and even gloves, at times. Steepe, who said she was once a nurse, insisted to the hospital staff she knew how to be safe outside: “I go above and beyond the protocols.”

“I’m out here more than I am inside,” she said. “The fresh air, the chirping of the birds, you don’t get that in the hospital.”

Alberta Health Services sent out a bulletin that said, as of Wednesday, there are 20 patients who have tested positive and 15 staff members. The hospital is run by Covenant Health, one of Canada’s largest Catholic health-care providers, which works in partnership with Alberta Health Services.

About 2,700 people work at the Misericordia and the full but lifeless parking lots flanking the building are a reminder of how many people are still inside, caring for patients.

Day procedures and visits are being postponed at the Misericordia but may be rescheduled at a different hospital, officials said. Visitors may be permitted during end-of-life situations.

Two units in the hospital are set aside for patients with COVID-19.

“The full facility outbreak extends to all adult and child services including the Emergency Department,” a statement from Alberta Health Services said.

“Patients should not visit the Misericordia and should instead visit one of the other hospitals within the Edmonton Zone or call 911 if needed.”

Hospital patients are being contacted and may be cared for or sent to a different hospital, it adds. Patients already in the hospital will continue to receive care.

Mothers in labour will be moved to Grey Nuns Community Hospital to deliver.

“The safety of our patients, staff, physicians and visitors remains our number one priority,” said Dr. Owen Heisler, chief medical officer with Covenant Health.

“Covenant Health, Alberta Health Services and our teams continue to work tirelessly and collaboratively, taking every possible step to respond with compassion to this challenging situation and to ensure a safe environment for care.”

Read', 'Apoorva Mandavillithe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Apoorva Mandavillithe New York Timeswed.']",2020-07-08,"After hundreds of experts urged the World Health Organization to review mounting scientific research, the agency acknowledged Tuesday that airborne transmission of the coronavirus may be a threat in indoor spaces.

WHO expert committees are going over evidence on transmission of the virus and plan to release updated recommendations in a few days, agency scientists said in a news briefing.

The possibility of airborne transmission, especially in “crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings, cannot be ruled out,” said Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, who leads the WHO’s committee on infection prevention and control.

She said the agency recommends “appropriate and optimal ventilation” of indoor environments, as well as physical distancing.

Agency staff fielded several questions from reporters about transmission of the virus by air, prompted by an open letter from 239 experts calling on the agency to review its guidance. Many of the letter’s signatories have collaborated with the WHO and served on its committees.

Experts who signed the letter welcomed the WHO’s announcement.

“We are very glad that WHO has finally acknowledged the accumulating evidence, and will add aerosol transmission indoors to the likely modes of transmission” for the coronavirus, said Jose-Luis Jimenez, a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado, Boulder. “This will allow the world to better protect themselves and fight the pandemic.”

In their letter, Jimenez and other scientists called on the WHO to recommend that people avoid overcrowding, particularly on public transportation and in other confined spaces. Public buildings, businesses, schools, hospitals and care homes should also supply clean air, minimize recirculating air, and consider adding air filters and virus-killing ultraviolet lights, they said.

“Public health agencies around the world take their cues from WHO, and hopefully this will lead to greater emphasis on wearing of face coverings and avoiding the three Cs: close contact, closed and poorly ventilated spaces, and crowds,” said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. “These measures will help slow the pandemic and save lives.”

WHO scientists said that for the past few months, the infection prevention committee has been weighing the evidence on all the ways in which the coronavirus spreads, including by tiny droplets or aerosols.

“We acknowledge that there is emerging evidence in this field, as in all other fields,” Allegranzi said. “And therefore, we believe that we have to be open to this evidence and understand its implications regarding the modes of transmission and also regarding the precautions that need to be taken.”

It will also be important to understand the importance of transmission by aerosols compared with larger droplets, and the dose of the virus needed for infection from aerosols, she said.

“These are fields that are really growing and for which there is evidence emerging, but it is not definitive,” she said. “However, the evidence needs to be gathered and interpreted, and we continue to support this.”

Other experts said it has been clear for some time that airborne transmission of the virus is possible but agreed that it’s not yet certain how big a role this route plays in spreading the virus.

“The question of how important it is for overall transmission remains an open one,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Still, he and other experts have said that the WHO is too slow and cautious in adopting precautions based on emerging evidence.

WHO scientists offered an explanation for their seemingly slow pace. On average, they review 500 new papers a day, many of which turn out to be of dubious quality, said Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO’s chief scientist.

As such, the scientists have to review the quality of each paper before including it in their analysis, she said: “Any guidance we put out has implications for billions of people around the world. It has to be carefully done.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Collin Binkleythe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Collin Binkleythe Associated Presswed.']",2020-07-08,"President Donald Trump launched an all-out effort pressing state and local officials to reopen schools this fall, arguing that some are keeping schools closed not because of the risks from the coronavirus pandemic but for political reasons.

“They think it’s going to be good for them politically, so they keep the schools closed,” Trump said Tuesday at a White House discussion on school plans for the fall. “No way. We’re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools.”

The White House’s roundtable gathered health and education leaders from across the nation who said schools and colleges are ready to open this fall and can do so safely. They argued that the risks of keeping students at home outweigh any risks tied to the coronavirus, saying students need access to meal programs and mental and behavioural health services.

“We want to reopen the schools,” Trump said. “Everybody wants it. The moms want it, the dads want it, the kids want it. It’s time to do it.”

But that bright outlook was met with skepticism by some beyond the White House. The president of the nation’s largest education union said Trump is more interested in scoring points for the November election than in keeping students safe.

“Trump has proven to be incapable of grasping that people are dying — that more than 130,000 Americans have already died,” said Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association. “Educators want nothing more than to be back in classrooms and on college campuses with our students, but we must do it in a way that keeps students, educators and communities safe.”

At the White House event, Trump repeated his claim that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons and not health reasons. The Republican president made the same claim on Twitter a day before, saying: “They think it will help them in November. Wrong, the people get it!”

Trump offered no evidence for the allegation, which has been criticized by health experts who say politicizing the issue will make it harder to work toward reopening schools. Jennifer Nuzzo, of Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 Testing Insights Initiative, said she was “deeply troubled” by the claim.

“When you make it about politics and just people trying to score points and get elected, I mean, I really think it’s a disservice to how incredibly important this issue is,” Nuzzo said in an interview. “And it really distracts from what I think we need, which is real solutions and a plan in order to make this happen.”

Whether schools and colleges should open this fall and how has been a topic of growing debate as the coronavirus continues to surge in parts of the United States. Trump applauded Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his state’s recent order to open public schools this fall. And Trump attacked Harvard University for its decision to hold instruction online for the fall term.

“I think it’s ridiculous, I think it’s an easy way out and I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said Tuesday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent mixed signals on the issue, saying students should return to the classroom but also noting that virtual classes present the lowest risk of COVID-19 spread. Speaking at Trump’s event, however, the agency’s director said unequivocally that it’s better for students to be in school than at home.

Dr. Robert Redfield noted that COVID-19 cases tend to be mild in young people, adding that the greatest risk is transmission from children to more vulnerable populations. He said the CDC encourages all schools to reopen with customized plans to minimize the spread of the coronavirus while giving students access to school services.

“It’s clear that the greater risk to our society is to have these schools close,” Redfield said. “Nothing would cause me greater sadness than to see any school district or school use our guidance as a reason not to reopen.”

The CDC’s guidance for schools recommends that students and teachers wear masks “as feasible,” spread out desks, stagger schedules, eat meals in classrooms instead of the cafeteria, and add physical barriers between bathroom sinks.

Some schools have announced plans to bring students back for only a few days a week, an option that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday said was unacceptable.

“It’s clear that our nations schools must fully reopen and fully operate this school year. Anything short of that robs students, not to mention taxpayers, of their future,” DeVos said.

During a call with governors, DeVos slammed plans by Virginia’s Fairfax County Public Schools to have families decide between fully remote instruction or two days a week at school. “A choice of two days per week in the classroom is not a choice at all,” DeVos said, according to audio of the call obtained by The Associated Press.

DeVos also criticized many schools’ attempts at distance education after the pandemic prompted them to move classes online last spring. She said she was disappointed in schools that “didn’t figure out how to serve students or who just gave up and didn’t try.”

The same thing can’t happen again this fall, she said, urging governors to play a role in getting schools to reopen.

Among those joining Trump on Tuesday was the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recently issued guidelines suggesting that schools aim to start the academic year “physically present in school.” Keeping students at home can lead to social isolation, the organization said, and prevent schools from identifying learning deficits, abuse, depression and other issues.

Students’ mental and emotional health — along with their parents’ — was repeatedly raised in the argument to reopen schools.

“Children’s mental health and social development must be as much of a priority as physical health,” first lady Melania Trump said at the round-table. “The same is true for parents. Many will be forced to make stressful choices between caring for their children and going back to work.”

But some are calling for greater caution. Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary under former President Barack Obama, has said the focus should be on making sure students can return safely.

“We all want children to go back to school,” Duncan said on Twitter. “The question is whether we care enough about our children to ALLOW them to go to school safely. Our behaviour, our commitment to shared sacrifice — or our selfishness — will determine what happens this fall for kids.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-08,"Canada’s military says a higher number of soldiers will be on Ontario’s roads this morning as they head home from their recent deployments to fight COVID-19.

The Armed Forces says about 500 troops will be travelling from CFB Borden, west of Barrie, to points across the province throughout the day.

The military members were part of Operation Laser, a mission launched in April to help provide support during the first wave of the pandemic.

The troops spent more than two months in seven long-term care facilities hit especially hard by COVID-19.

A report produced by troops stationed in the homes sounded the alarm about horrific conditions inside and prompted provincial and federal calls for systemic reform.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-07,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister were spotted Tuesday in a Toronto airport lounge not wearing mandatory masks to curb COVID-19.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced leaders sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online.

Scheer’s office said he was wearing a mask for his trip. A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Pallister was contrite.

“I lifted my mask to join some friends in conversation at the Toronto airport this afternoon,” he said in a statement.

“It was an error on my part, it won’t happen again.”

Toronto’s Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with Pallister and a couple of others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.

He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.

Scheer is in the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.

As for Pallister, Manitoba requires most people returning to the province from Ontario, Quebec or the Atlantic provinces to self-isolate for 14 days, but provides exceptions for truckers, health providers, politicians and some others if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.

7:21 p.m.: Mississauga is joining Toronto and Durham Region in requiring masks to be worn in all indoor public spaces.

Mississauga City Council approved the new bylaw to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, and it comes into effect Friday, the city said Wednesday evening.

The city said it will take an education and awareness approach to enforcement, followed by fines of less than $500 for both businesses and individuals.

The bylaw reflects recommendations made by health authorities at the federal, provincial and regional levels to wear face coverings in public where physical distancing may be difficult.

“We want to get life back to normal as soon as possible, allow more businesses to open more quickly, and get our city facilities reopened as soon as possible.” said Mayor Bonnie Crombie.

“To do this, we need to remain vigilant, practice physical distancing and good hygiene, but also wear a mask in indoor spaces where the spread of the virus can happen more easily.”

6:03 p.m: A lawyer for the doctor who was blamed for triggering a COVID-19 outbreak in northern New Brunswick in May says his client has been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing and wants an apology from Premier Blaine Higgs.

Joel Etienne, a lawyer for Dr. Jean Robert Ngola, has issued a statement saying the RCMP ruled out criminal charges.

A spokesperson for the RCMP did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Wednesday.

Ngola said he travelled from Campbellton, N.B., to Quebec to pick up his four-year-old daughter because the girl’s mother had to attend a funeral in Africa.

He admitted that upon his return from the overnight trip he did not self-isolate for 14 days, but he says that was consistent with practices of his colleagues and superiors, and he believes he may have gotten the virus from a patient or another health professional.

Etienne says Ngola was not “patient zero” and the premier needs to apologize.

5:33 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 38,232 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,740 deaths, an increase of 158 cases since Tuesday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

Wednesday’s report is somewhat elevated because it includes two days’ worth of case data in Toronto.

Starting this week, Toronto Public Health switched to reporting cases only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. As such, the provincewide count of COVID-19 cases reported each day should be expected to be higher than typical on those days, and vice versa. Before this week, Toronto had seen by far the most infections per day of any Ontario health unit.

Over the last seven days, the province’s 34 health units have reported an average of 142 new infections per day — well down from a sustained peak of nearly 600 cases per day, seen in late April.

Both cases and deaths have fallen sharply in Ontario in recent months.

Meanwhile, another five new fatal cases were reported Wednesday, all in Toronto; Amid the worst of the province’s epidemic, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Wednesday, the province reported 123 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 35 in an intensive care unit, of whom 26 are on a ventilator — numbers that are themselves near the lowest the province has reported since first publishing hospitalization data in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,700 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

5:00 p.m.: Via Rail is temporarily laying off about 1,000 unionized employees as the company copes with interrupted routes and reduced travel demand.

“Unfortunately, as we don’t anticipate ridership to be back to pre-COVID-19 levels in the foreseeable future, we had to make difficult decisions to deal with the situation as we gain a better understanding of the impacts of the pandemic on our operations,” Cynthia Garneau, Via's president and CEO, said in a statement Wednesday.

The layoffs take effect July 24. Affected employees will receive a temporary written layoff notice that respects their collective agreement's terms, the Montreal-based company said. It will maintain access to different programs for the employees.

The company is working to advance its service resumption plan and has seen some recent positive developments, though many routes remain interrupted.

4:34 p.m.: U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa that drew thousands of people in late June, along with large protests that accompanied it, “likely contributed"" to a dramatic surge in new coronavirus cases, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday.

Tulsa County reported 261 confirmed new cases on Monday, a one-day record high, and another 206 cases on Tuesday.

Although the health department's policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings “more than likely"" contributed to the spike.

“In the past few days, we’ve seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, so I guess we just connect the dots,” Dart said.

4:06 p.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4:03 p.m.:

There are 106,370 confirmed cases in Canada.

Quebec: 56,079 confirmed (including 5,603 deaths, 25,534 resolved)

2:40 p.m.: Seniors who survived COVID are now at risk from lack of air-conditioning in long-term care homes. Temperatures in Toronto have soared past 30 Celsius in the last couple of weeks.

Premier Doug Ford said in a news conference Monday he didn’t know that some homes don’t have ways to keep residents cool during heat waves. He pointed the finger at long-term care operators.

Read the full story from the Star’s Wanyee Li.

2:26 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford’s government has introduced a sweeping new piece of legislation it says will help the province’s economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The omnibus bill — dubbed the COVID-19 Recovery Act — proposes to change 20 pieces of current legislation that govern the province’s schools, municipalities, and justice system.

Municipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark says if passed, the bill would speed up environmental assessments, offer new consumer protections and help address unemployment.

Clark says the bill would also create an economic agency — Invest Ontario — to help attract more international investment to the province.

The bill also includes measures announced by Education Minister Stephen Lecce this week to end school suspensions for students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3.

2:15 p.m.: Finance Minister Bill Morneau has released his first full accounting of the pandemic relief, and so far, the direct aid he has rolled out since March totals about $228 billion, driving the deficit for this fiscal year up to an enormous $343.2 billion and counting.

The money appears to have formed a floor under the collapsing economy.

The fiscal snapshot lays it out, arguing that the federal money did indeed prevent a worst-case scenario. Without the federal spending, the Canadian economy would have contracted by about 11 per cent in 2020. With support, it’s expected to shrink by 6.3 per cent this year, according to private sector estimates.

Similarly, unemployment will hover just under 10 per cent on average this year; but without support measures, it would have averaged about 12 per cent.

1 p.m.: Four international film festivals are putting aside their traditional rivalries to try to keep film festivals alive.

The Toronto International Film Festival announced Wednesday that it has signed a letter of solidarity with the New York Film Festival, the Telluride Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival committing to “co-operation, information sharing and support of one another’s global events.”

“The art form we love is in crisis,” the statement says. “Our own organizations have seen unprecedented challenges to our work and our financial security. The pandemic caught each of us as we were preparing for the biggest event of our year in the fall of 2020. We knew we had to adapt. We decided to collaborate as we never have before.”

The news release didn’t specify what forms that collaboration will take but said the four festivals have “moved away from competing with our colleagues at autumn festivals . . . We are offering our festivals as a united platform for the best cinema we can find. We’re here to serve the filmmakers, audiences, journalists and industry members who keep the film ecosystem thriving. We need to do that together.”

12:52 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s top health official has revoked a special exemption for workers at Halifax-based Irving Shipbuilding that allowed them to travel to and from the United States during the pandemic.

Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, issued a statement Wednesday saying questions and concerns have been raised about the exception granted in June by the province’s public health department.

He said “very tight restrictions” were placed on the exemption, which he approved. He did not offer details about the nature of the concerns that were raised.

Strang, however, made it clear there will be no further company travel to or from the United States while the border between the two countries remains officially closed for non-essential visits.

He also said he has ordered some Irving employees to isolate themselves at home for 14 days and submit to COVID-19 testing.

12:52 p.m.: The Nova Scotia Health Authority has issued a warning to travellers who were aboard an Air Canada flight from Toronto that arrived in Halifax on June 26, saying passengers could have been exposed to COVID-19.

Air Canada flight AC 626 departed Toronto at 8:15 p.m. and landed in Halifax at 11:17 p.m.

Health officials said anyone on the flight could have been exposed to the virus, but added an investigation has indicated that passengers in rows 29 to 23, and in seats A to C, were more likely to be at risk.

Passengers in those seats are being asked to call 811 for advice.

Anyone exposed to the novel coronavirus on the flight may develop symptoms up to and including July 10.

12:03 p.m.: DavidsTea is seeking court protection from creditors so it can continue operating while it restructures and plans to close a significant number of its stores.

The Montreal-based company said Wednesday it will seek an order in Quebec Superior Court to allow it to restructure under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act.

It also plans to seek similar orders for its U.S. subsidiary under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The company said during the restructuring process it plans to continue operating online through davidstea.com and its wholesale distribution channel, which supplies grocery stores and pharmacies.

The chain’s stores have been shut since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It had warned in mid-June that it hadn’t paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June and that it may seek a formal restructuring.

12 p.m. (updated): The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus has hit 3 million, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University. But U.S. health officials say the real number of infections is probably 10 times higher, or close to 10 per cent of the population.

The numbers have been surging in recent weeks amid a rapid expansion in testing. But experts say the rise cannot be explained as just the result of more testing.

They say the outbreak is worsening, as shown by such warning signs as an increase in the percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus.

Four months, 3 million confirmed infections and over 130,000 deaths into the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, Americans confronted with an alarming resurgence of the scourge are facing long lines at testing sites and going a week or more without receiving a diagnosis. Some sites are running out of kits even as testing is ramped up.

Labs are reporting shortages of materials and don’t have enough workers to process the tests, leading to severe backups that could worsen as economies reopen and new infections emerge.

Scenes of testing sites turning away people and motorists waiting in the summer heat in long lines separated into numerous lanes by traffic cones have left Americans frustrated and wondering why the U.S. can’t seem to get its act together, especially after it was given fair warning over the past several months as the virus spread from China to hot spots such as Italy, Spain and New York.

11:53 a.m.: Quebec’s Health Department is reporting 13 additional COVID-19 deaths today, bringing the total to 5,603 since the beginning of the pandemic.

The province is also reporting another 82 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of people infected to 56,079, including 25,534 cases that are considered recovered.

Six deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while seven others reported today occurred before June 30.

The number of people hospitalized decreased by 16 to 331, but one more patient was listed in intensive compared with the prior day, for a total of 27.

On Monday, the latest day for which testing results are available, the province said it conducted 7,576 tests.

The province’s health authorities have said in recent days they are determined to increase testing capacity.

11:32 p.m.: A hospital in Edmonton is no longer admitting patients due to a full outbreak of COVID-19.

An outbreak at the Misericordia Community Hospital was first declared by Alberta’s chief medical health officer two weeks ago, and restrictions were tightened as case numbers increased.

Alberta Health Services says that 20 patients and 15 staff have tested positive. Three patients have died from the infection.

The hospital, which is run by Catholic health provider Covenant Health, is not allowing visitors except in end-of-life situations and is postponing day procedures.

11:10 a.m. (updated): Ontario’s new cases of COVID-19 are remaining steadily low, but there were nine deaths reported overnight.

There were 118 confirmed cases of coronovirus reported Wednesday.

But the nine deaths is an increase from two the day before and zero on Monday. It was the most reported in one day since June 25 when there were 10 deaths.

There are 123 people in hospital with COVID-19 — 35 in intensive care units. Of those, 26 are on ventilators.

Ontario completed more than 22,832 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

10:15 a.m.: At the outset of the pandemic, Robert Witchel, executive director of the Blue Jays’ charitable arm, suspected underserved communities across Canada and children who were already marginalized would be hurt the most.

The Jays Care Foundation wanted to support Indigenous communities, families enrolled in their Challenger Baseball program for kids with physical and cognitive disabilities, and children who were already facing significant barriers in their everyday lives — like those in Toronto Community Housing.

So the foundation created and adapted programming intended to support families in underserved communities this year, a $7.5-million commitment set to be announced Wednesday.

The Star’s Laura Armstrong has the full story.

9:20 a.m.: Brooks Brothers Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy, felled by the pandemic’s impact on clothing sales and its own heavy debt load.

The two-century-old apparel company is the latest to succumb as a nationwide lockdown during the coronavirus outbreak added to the woes afflicting old-line retailers. Neiman Marcus Group Inc., J. Crew Group Inc. and John Varvatos Enterprises Inc. each filed for bankruptcy since the virus took hold.

The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware allows Brooks Brothers to keep operating while it works out a plan to turn the business around and pay its debts. The company listed assets and liabilities of at least $500 million (U.S.) each in court papers, and a spokesperson said via email it had lined up a $75 million (U.S.) bankruptcy loan.

The pandemic has hit Brooks Brothers hard, shuttering office buildings and hurting demand for business wear as people worked from home. The retailer has been trying to sell itself since last year as many of its roughly 250 U.S. locations struggled with declining sales, Bloomberg reported earlier. It’s continuing to seek a buyer, according to the spokesperson.

9:15 a.m.: The CN Tower is scheduled to reopen on July 15, remaining open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. With new COVID-19 measures in place, the tower will offer timed tickets, allowing only four people to enter elevators at once. The restaurants will remain closed.

Meanwhile, the Royal Ontario Museum will reopen its doors to its members Thursday and the general public on Saturday. Visitors can book timed-entry tickets and the museum will be limiting the number of admissions.

8:45 a.m. Ascena Retail Group Inc., the owner of mall brands that occupy almost 3,000 stores in the U.S., is preparing to file for bankruptcy and shutter at least 1,200 of those locations.

The company, which owns brands such as Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant, could enter Chapter 11 as soon as this week with a creditor agreement in place that eliminates around $700 million (U.S.) of its $1.1 billion debt load. Lenders including Eaton Vance Corp. would assume control of the company, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter.

Ascena has experienced years of financial losses amid a boom in online shopping and slowdown in foot traffic at malls. The bankruptcy filing would allow the company to keep some of its brands operating while it shutters or sells others, the people said. Catherines and Justice are among the chains it’s considering to close or sell, they said. The plan is not final and certain details could change. Read the full story.

7:47 a.m. Global stock markets were mixed Wednesday as uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic sapped the buying enthusiasm that has been driving prices higher.

Wall Street appeared set to edge up on the open, with Dow futures up 0.1 per cent and S&P 500 futures 0.2 per cent higher. In Europe, France’s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent to 5,007, while Germany’s DAX was down 0.3 per cent at 12,580. Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat at 6,188.

Given the current murky outlook, investors are likely to cash in on recent gains, analysts said.

“Investors are trying their best to look through the knotty COVID-19 economic entanglement,” but the recent bullish mood remains on shaky ground, and could easily sour, said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, said in a report.

“It is impossible for investors not to grow weary and eventually, at some point, fall prey to the endless drip of negative COVID-19 stories and how the second wave virus will crush the market,” he added.

7:10 a.m. Technology used by New York City public health officials to spot cases of Legionnaires’ disease or a serious food-borne illness has now been fine-tuned to pick up potentially connected cases of the novel coronavirus.

It is the latest advancement in an effort by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to tease out potential links in clusters over time and, hopefully, trace back to the initial sources of infection.

“It’s not just about test, test, test everybody, although that’s important,” said Dr. Oxiris Barbot, New York City’s health commissioner. “It is about how you take that information and make smart decisions and really track down where transmission is actively happening.”

More than 200,000 people in New York City have tested positive for Covid-19 and more than 23,000 have died or are presumed to have died as of Tuesday from the disease, according to city data.

7:07 a.m. France’s new government would seek to preserve the economy should a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic force it to bring back lockdown measures, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Wednesday.

“We won’t survive, economically and socially, an absolute and generalized lockdown,” Castex told BFM TV and RMC radio, adding that he advocated more targeted restrictions.

6:49 a.m. Court proceedings to determine criminal sanity for a man who pleaded guilty to killing five people at Maryland newspaper have been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jarrod Ramos’ pre-trial hearings have been moved to August and a sanity trial was moved to December in the Capital Gazette murder case, news outlets reported.

This is just the latest delay after repeated postponements.

Ramos pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible by reason of insanity in October to all 23 counts against him for killing John McNamara, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, Rob Hiaasen and Rebecca Smith in the 2018 newsroom rampage at the Capital Gazette.

If found not criminally responsible, Ramos would be committed to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital instead of prison.

6:15 a.m.: The federal Liberals will lay out today how they see the COVID-19 pandemic affecting government finances for the fiscal year including an estimated deficit and a projected path for the economy.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is to release what the government has styled a fiscal and economic snapshot.

The Liberals have regularly updated MPs about total spending on emergency aid, which by last count amounted to over $174 billion, but have yet to put a figure on the deficit for the fiscal year.

The parliamentary budget office has suggested the deficit could be as deep as $252 billion.

Other private sector estimates suggest $300 billion wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibility.

Opposition parties have said they expect Morneau to provide a road map for reshaping emergency aid measures that are set to expire in the fall and keeping spending and deficits under control.

6:10 a.m.: Australia isolated the state of Victoria on Wednesday in a bid to contain the worsening spread of the coronavirus as the city of Melbourne prepared for its second lockdown, an example of a resurgent disease in places that initially succeeded in taming it.

Melbourne’s failure to curb the virus in the past three weeks is a starkly different pandemic experience to other parts of the country that have been reporting single-digit daily counts of infections if any.

6:06 a.m.: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he is confident that he will swiftly recover from the new coronavirus thanks to treatment with hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that has not been proven effective against COVID-19.

Bolsonaro said he tested positive for the new coronavirus on Tuesday after months of downplaying its severity while deaths mounted rapidly inside the country.

The president told reporters he underwent a lung X-ray on Monday after experiencing fever, muscle aches and malaise. As of Tuesday, his fever had subsided, he said, and he attributed the improvement to hydroxychloroquine.

He stepped back from the journalists and removed his mask at one point to show that he looked well.

6:03 a.m.: China on Wednesday defended the World Health Organization and lashed out at the U.S. decision to withdraw from the UN body.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the move was “another demonstration of the U.S. pursuing unilateralism, withdrawing from groups and breaking contracts.”

WHO is “the most authoritative and professional international institution in the field of global public health security,” Zhao said at a daily briefing.

The U.S. departure from the organization “undermines the international anti-epidemic efforts, and in particular has a serious negative impact on developing countries in urgent need of international support,” Zhao said.

The Trump administration formally notified the UN on Monday of its withdrawal from WHO, although the pullout won’t take effect until next year. That means it could be reversed by a new administration or if circumstances change.

6 a.m.: Africa now has more than a half-million confirmed coronavirus cases.

The continent-wide total is over 508,000, according to figures released Wednesday by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after South Africa recorded another day of more than 10,000 confirmed cases as a new global hot spot.

The true number of cases among Africa’s 1.3 billion people is unknown as its 54 countries continue to face a serious shortage of testing materials for the virus. “A tremendous problem, a real crisis of access,” the World Health Organization’s Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, said last week.

So far most testing has been concentrated in capital cities, but infections in many cases have spread beyond them.

Africa’s health systems are the most poorly funded and thinly staffed in the world, and already more than 2,000 health workers have been infected by the virus, according to the WHO.

6 a.m. Even if the CFL plays an abbreviated ’20 season in a hub city under the strictest of health-and-safety guidelines, an infectious diseases doctor believes there will still be positive tests for the coronavirus that could force the league play to end abruptly.

The CFL is reportedly looking at playing in a single hub or two hub cities to limit teams’ exposure to the virus. But Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at Toronto General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, said positive tests remain possible and could threaten play — just like in other leagues.

“The short answer is nothing in this era is going to be without risk,” Bogoch said. “There are certain things we can do to minimize the risk but as with anything, there’s going to be some element of risk of acquiring this infection.

“The league and players can work with medical professionals to make this as safe as possible but at the end of the day they’ll have to sit down collectively and decide, ‘Is this worthwhile.’ As individuals they’ll have to ask themselves, based on the protocols in place and individual risk perception, risk tolerance and risk threshold, ‘Am I willing to play?’”

5:55 a.m.: Ontario is expected to table a motion today to extend the province’s state of emergency until July 24.

The current state of emergency declared at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire July 15.

Premier Doug Ford’s office says the government wants to extend the measure to ensure there is no gap between that declaration ending and a new bill extending Ontario’s emergency measures taking effect.

Solicitor General Sylvia Jones introduced that bill yesterday, saying the province will need to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.

Jones’s bill gives the province the power to keep some pandemic measures in place for up to a year, even as the state of emergency ends.

While the motion to extend the declaration will be introduced today, the government does not expect to debate or vote on it until early next week.

5:53 a.m.: Canada’s military says a higher number of soldiers will be on Ontario’s roads this morning as they head home from their recent deployments to fight COVID-19.

The Armed Forces says about 500 troops will be travelling from CFB Borden, west of Barrie, to points across the province throughout the day.

The military members were part of Operation Laser, a mission launched in April to help provide support during the first wave of the pandemic.

Read', 'Margaryta Ignatenkostaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Margaryta Ignatenko Is A Breaking News Reporter', 'Working Out Of The Star S Radio Room In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-07,"TTC riders are questioning the agency’s priorities after protesters deliberately broke TTC mask rules without repercussion.

Protesters rode the system on Tuesday without face coverings, flouting the TTC’s “mandatory” mask rule, which the agency has admitted it doesn’t intend to enforce. It argues that its officers can’t tell, simply by looking, who is unable to wear a mask for medical reasons.

Upset riders took to Twitter on Tuesday to question the agency’s priorities given the heavy enforcement of fare evasion policy that included highly visible campaigns and hefty fines.

“Which bus would you rather sit on, one filled with fare evaders wearing masks, or a bus filled with people who paid their fare, but refuse to wear a mask? I know which bus I’d wait for,” Crystal-Rose Madore said in an email.

Madore and her family frequently used the TTC before the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I feel frustrated with the TTC. This morning it was made clear that the TTC prioritizes fare enforcement over the safety of the people who depend on public transit in our city. Both are bylaws, but only one is being enforced with its own squad, and it isn’t the one in regards to public safety.

“Brushing off concerns from the public over a group that is exploiting this unequal level of enforcement for their own ends makes me question how seriously this pandemic is taken by the TTC, I am concerned for the health and safety of riders and employees.”

Masks or face coverings have been mandatory when travelling on the TTC since July 2, with exemptions for riders under two years old and those with accessibility or health issues that prevent them from wearing a mask.

The TTC says it is reviewing the subway anti-mask protest at Dundas and University on Tuesday morning, but cannot enforce mask-wearing for riders who claim to have a medical condition.

“A customer only needs to state that they have a medical condition, we don’t require documentation. There is an exemption already in the policy for masks for those who have medical conditions,” the TTC wrote on Twitter in response to a rider.

In an email to the Star, TTC spokesperson Stuart Green said: “The TTC is not free of charge and unless that policy changes, we need to retain as much revenue to run the system as possible …We assess incidents of fare evasion on their individual merits and respond accordingly. If people need relief from fares, the city has a program to assist with that and in cases where the most vulnerable are trying to get to their destination, they are not ticketed.”

Among the protesters was a woman who was recently filmed getting ejected from a hospital for not wearing a mask. She told reporters that mandatory mask-wearing was the start down a slippery slope of losing freedoms.

“As of Monday, 84 per cent of TTC customers are already wearing face coverings so the message is getting through,” Green said.

The City of Toronto made masks mandatory in indoor public spaces on Tuesday, including shops, malls, and public transit to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Scientific consensus is that masks help the fight against COVID-19, especially by protecting others.

In March, the TTC suspended fare enforcement, announcing its inspectors would continue patrol but focus on “education and customer service” rather than giving out fines.

In June, the agency began deploying inspectors at key surface transfer points to “remind customers to pay their fare” according to a message on the site. Full enforcement activities, including fines for evasion, will resume in mid-July or August.

Read', 'May Warrenstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'May Warren Is A Toronto-Based Breaking News Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-07,"When 29-year-old Josh Cruddas developed a fever and fatigue in late June, he headed to the closest COVID-19 assessment centre to get tested.

The nasal swab at St. Joseph’s Health Centre on the Queensway was quick and easy. But then came the hard part: waiting for the results. Luckily they were negative, but he only found that out after six days.

Although the delay was “anxiety inducing,” the bigger issue is the “domino effect” that those extra days would have caused if he had been positive, he said.

“This has implications larger than just one guy waiting for a test,” he said. “It’s not just affecting the patient or the person who got tested, it expands to their contacts.”

Cruddas is one of three people the Star spoke to who experienced delays with test results at St. Joseph’s in the last month, as the city eases lockdown restrictions, and numbers of new cases drop, but every minute counts when it comes to stamping out new clusters of infection.

Unity Health Toronto spokesperson Hayley Mick said in an email that St. Joseph’s has seen a “sharp increase” in the number of people coming for tests with the expanded testing criteria. Since late May, the province has advised anyone with even one mild symptom, people without symptoms who fear they were exposed, and front-line workers, to get tested.

The hospital sees hundreds of people looking for tests each day, she said. They assessed 433 people in a 12-hour window on Monday, and an average of 300 people per day last week. The lab at St. Joseph’s “does not have the capacity to assess the swabs” and it sends them to be processed at “multiple sites within the Provincial Diagnostic Network, including Public Health Ontario Laboratories, and other hospital and private laboratories,” she said.

Swabs for the highest priority groups — including health-care workers and people living in group settings — are sent to the lab at St. Michael’s Hospital.

“Priority is placed on notifying people with positive test results. However, in recent weeks, some people have experienced delays in receiving their negative results,” Mick added.

Staff at the assessment centre, who were great, Cruddas said, told him to isolate and expect test results online within four days at the latest. They would only call if he was positive.

But four days later, after repeatedly calling the testing centre hotline and the hospital, he went back in person and the nurse told him his test hadn’t been processed yet, which made him nervous because it could have still turned out to have been positive. After six days the results finally appeared online.

In the meantime, Cruddas had taken it upon himself to reach out to contacts he’d seen, socially distanced, just in case. One family cancelled upcoming trips fearing they’d been exposed to the virus.

But at least he eventually got his results.

Sherri Stocks also faced a testing delay with her 82-year-old mother, who didn’t have symptoms but required a negative test to return to her Whitby long-term-care home. She and her sister had pulled her out in mid-June to ease her isolation after the death of her dog.

Her mother, she said, was tested at St. Joseph’s on June 16, but nine days and several voice-mails left on a testing hotline later, they were still waiting for the results. A St. Joseph’s manager eventually told her over the phone that the results had been lost.

“I can’t get mad at the health professionals, they’re all working so hard,” Stocks said.

“I expressed my disappointment and I was worried about, did they give her results to someone else? What if she was positive?”

Stocks took her mother for testing again, this time to Markham Stouffville Hospital, where she had the results (thankfully negative), within three days.

She praised Markham Stouffville’s patient portal, which shows every step and the time online. Stocks, a postal worker, said she would have appreciated something similar for St. Joseph’s.

“It would be nice if they had a process,” she said, “like following the package at Canada Post.”

Her mom was not the only one waiting on test results from St. Joseph’s that never appeared.

In mid-June, about 40 samples “were held up in transport and did not get to the testing sites in a timely manner,” said Unity Health spokesperson Mick.

When this mistake was recognized, the samples were no longer suitable for testing so patients were contacted and told to be retested.

At St. Joseph’s, tests have a three-to-seven day average turnaround time and are available on the province’s online portal, Mick said.

At St. Michael’s Hospital, which has in-house lab capacity and fewer people coming for tests, there’s an average turnaround time of two-to-four days, she added.

The average at the University Health Network COVID-19 assessment centre, across the street from Toronto Western Hospital, is between 12 and 24 hours, said spokesperson Gillian Howard.

Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and the University of Toronto, said he has not heard reports of delays at St. Joseph’s, or any other testing centres in the GTA. But said the standard should be about 24 hours for getting results back to people.

“You absolutely need rapid turnaround time of tests,” he said. It impacts the person being tested, as well as their family members, and is also crucial for starting contact tracing.

“Because if you have a positive test you want to really jump on that contact tracing right away and really start to inform anyone who is a possible close contact of that individual that they should adhere to a 14-day period of isolation,” he said, “so that if they are positive they don’t infect others in the community.”

Heather McGaw, 36, also waited five days for negative test results from St. Joseph’s and in the meantime missed her grandmother’s funeral because she didn’t want to go without knowing her status. She also emphasized how helpful and professional the staff were but found the delay “pretty stressful.”

Since she had symptoms, she was told to try to self-isolate away from her partner.

“We live in a one-bedroom condo, so we were trying to physically distance during that time while we were living in the same space,” she said.

But still she counts herself very lucky being able to work remotely that entire time.

“It’s hard to imagine if we were caring for a sick parent or if we had jobs that were not so secure, or something like that, to actually take those five days and follow the recommendation of isolating, I don’t know how people could actually do that for so long.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Colin Perkelthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Colin Perkelthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-07-07,"The Ontario government must release information about the prevalence of COVID-19 in provincial jails, as well as what preventive measures are taken to curb the spread, an activist coalition said Tuesday.

In a letter to Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, the coalition of Black, Indigenous and legal groups said they were also filing a freedom of information request to obtain the data.

“We are very concerned that there is no public information available about the current data related to COVID-19 testing and positive diagnoses in Ontario correctional facilities,” the letter states. “This information is vital for the health of all Ontarians, but especially for Indigenous and Black communities who are vastly overrepresented inside these institutions.”

The dearth of publicly available information on the coronavirus in provincial jails leaves families fearing for the well-being of loved ones and relying on sporadic local media accounts of outbreaks, the letter says. That complicates discharge planning, especially for Indigenous people returning to remote communities, it says.

In response, Jones’s office released figures showing Ontario’s jails have had 129 cases of COVID-19, of which four are active. The worst-hit facility was the now-temporarily closed Ontario Correctional Institute in Brampton, with 91 cases. The Toronto South Detention centre has three of the four ongoing cases.

In all, 5,739 tests have been done on a current inmate population of 5,886, the ministry said Tuesday. Some inmates have been tested more than once.

Evidence suggests inmates in correctional facilities are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus disease. In a recent affidavit filed in Federal Court, a medical specialist warned that jails and prisons were particularly prone to the transmission of infectious diseases, in part because inmates are frequently housed in close quarters.

“In addition to being congregate living facilities, prisons encounter issues with hygiene, proper cleaning and general overcrowding,” wrote Dr. Tim O’Shea, an associate professor at McMaster University.

Similarly, the federal prisons ombudsman recently called for the dissemination of anti-COVID plans.

Federally, at least 360 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least two have died. Scores of guards have also fallen ill.

The activists point out that Black and Indigenous people are overrepresented in provincial corrections by “staggering” margins.

“Given this backdrop, it is essential that disaggregated data about testing and outbreaks in correctional facilities is publicly reported,” the letter states. “This data is already collected and shared within the ministry.”

The ministry said last month the population at 25 provincial jails had fallen 31 per cent since March 31.

“We want to know how this reduction was achieved,” Emily Hill, with Aboriginal Legal Services, said in a statement.

A spokesman for Jones said 40 inmates near the end of their sentences had been released, while those serving weekend sentences have been granted temporary absences.

In addition, Stephen Warner outlined other anti-COVID measures, such as stopping non-essential inmate transfers, providing staff with protective gear, requiring guards and visitors to wear masks, placing new inmates in separate areas for 14 days, and proper interior cleaning.

“Inmates are also educated on methods to reduce the spread of illness, including COVID-19, and are provided cleaning products to keep their living areas clean, as well as toiletries such as soap, shampoo and toothpaste,” Warner said.

Other organizations in the coalition include the Alliance for Healthier Communities and the Black Legal Action Centre.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-07-07,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to provide a payment worth up to $600 to some disabled Canadians to help with additional COVID-19 costs remains in limbo.

The measure, announced on June 5, was contained in a piece of legislation that failed to pass later that month after the Liberals didn’t win unanimous consent.

Though the House of Commons is sitting Wednesday, no bills are expected to be introduced.

A spokesperson for Carla Qualtrough, the minister in charge of the file, says the government is still working on a way forward on the benefit program.

“This financial support matters and Canadians with disabilities can have confidence that we will continue to work to find a solution to deliver this supplement,” Marielle Hossack said in an email.

“We all benefit when everyone can participate equally in our economy, and society.”

The Liberals have accused the Tories in particular of holding up the aid, arguing they were the ones who refused to pass the bill back in June.

At the time, the Conservatives were pressing for a full return to Parliament, but had also disagreed with the plan to pass the bill within a single sitting so there was no chance for experts to weigh in or for amendments.

“The Conservatives’ choice to put politics ahead of helping people will have caused extra hardship for Canadians,” Trudeau told reporters during a stop at an Ottawa-area print shop in mid-June.

But Conservative MP Dan Albas said Tuesday the Liberals’ decision to include the measure in legislation raises questions about who exactly is playing politics.

He said that given the payment will go to Canadians who already receive the disability tax credit, the government has the information it would need to forward the money directly using an information-sharing agreement with the Canada Revenue Agency.

A bill isn’t entirely necessary, he argued, and at this point, the Liberals need to make clear which approach they will take, he said.

“The government should be helping those that need the support the most and part of that is to give them the certainty,” he said.

“The payment is important, but also knowing when the payment will be and by what means.”

The program would provide a one-time, tax-free payment to people who already qualify for the disability tax credit.

The maximum payable would be $600.

The Liberals are making separate payments to seniors, so those who receive the tax credit and are eligible for the old age security pension would receive $300, and those who have the tax credit and are eligible for both OAS and the guaranteed income supplement would get $100.

That doesn’t cover everyone who need the money, the NDP’s Peter Julian said Tuesday.

“We’re trying to convince the government to extend that benefit to all Canadians with a disability,” he said.

The NDP had objected to the original bill on other grounds, including a provision that could have led to jail time for those fraudulently applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

The Liberals had proposed hiving off the disability portion of the bill and delaying the other measures, but that failed as well.

The Conservatives have been steadfast in their demand for a total return to normal Parliamentary sittings that would provide full accountability and oversight of government activities.

At present, what’s happened most often is the gathering of a special COVID-19 committee made up of all MPs.

It gives them the chance to ask questions of the government for a few hours each sitting, and for the handling of some routine elements of Parliament, like the tabling of petitions or reports.

Wednesday’s sitting is a variation of that committee arrangement.

MPs will have the chance to press the government for around 90 minutes, before Finance Minister Bill Morneau tables a hotly anticipated fiscal “snapshot.”

The next scheduled sitting day for the House of Commons is July 22, and is expected to mirror the format for Wednesday.

Parliament is currently scheduled to fully resume on Sept. 21.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-07,"Sarah Campbell knew Jacob Taylor was the one when she saw the Brit for the first time in person at a train station in England, waiting to greet her on the platform.

“He was all dressed up, wearing a button-up shirt, chino and a blue blazer, with sunflowers in one hand and a coffee for me in the other. It was a scene out of a romantic movie you watched growing up,” the Stratford, Ont. woman recalled of their encounter in Durham in August 2019.

“I know it sounds cheesy, but it’s one of those moments you knew you’d be together forever.”

In February, Taylor, visiting from the U.K., proposed to Campbell amid the hustle and bustle of Pearson airport.

He was to return for their wedding on June 27 and they would settle in England, where she has citizenship through her mother.

The big day was postponed because the groom couldn’t get here due to Canada’s virus-based travel ban.

The couple was dealt another blow last week.

Sarah was diagnosed with cancer.

Because the pair aren’t married, Taylor is not exempt from the ban.

“It’s hard enough to hear the words, ‘You have cancer,’ ” said Campbell, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

She was set up with Taylor last June by their parents, who have been friends for years.

“It’s heartbreaking to have to have months of treatment without your fiancé, who should’ve been my husband by now if it wasn’t because of the pandemic.”

Although Britain has kept its border open to non-essential visitors from Canada, the 25-year-old Stratford woman cannot travel due to her medical conditions and treatment.

Their only hope hinges on Canada Border Services Agency making an exemption to Taylor’s visit.

So far, the couple, who last saw each other in February, have been told by Canadian officials that they are not legally married or considered common-law and no exemption will be granted despite the circumstances.

“It’s really frustrating being stuck over here in the U.K., when Sarah is going through all of what she is going through,” said Taylor, 21.

“We talked once about how we’re grieving the loss of our wedding day, and all of those plans, which is still so true, and then, added on top of that, the issues with Sarah’s cancer and the border closure.

“It’s a lot.

“At the moment, all we are being shown is utterly unnecessary cruelty.”

Ottawa has closed the border to the United States until July 21 and to international travel until July 31. While exemptions are granted to immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents, they are restricted to those who are married or have common-law status.

“We have seen the government allow special exemptions for NHL and MLB players to be allowed into Canada,” said David Edward-Ooi Poon, co-founder of Advocacy for Family Reunification at the Canadian Border, whose 2,200 members have launched an online petition to ask Ottawa to relax the ban against committed couples.

Poon, a family doctor from Regina, has been in a long-distance relationship with Alexandria Aquino, a nurse in Ireland, for almost two years. The couple had travelled back and forth regularly between the countries until March when the global pandemic hit and borders were closed.

“Does having a marriage certificate decrease a person’s risk of COVID-19? Does a hockey stick? We are not asking for open borders.

“We are just asking to be together.”

Campbell and Taylor were introduced on Instagram through their mothers on June 27, and they picked their anniversary as their wedding date.

After weeks of online dating and many “six-ish-hour video calls,” she travelled to England for 10 days last August to meet Taylor.

The two hit it off right away.

It wasn’t until February when they saw each other again, this time in Toronto.

Outside the arrival area at Pearson, Campbell walked up to Taylor, dropped to his knee and pulled out a ring.

“I was just sure. I think sometimes people over-think the creation of chemistry between themselves and another human. When we talk online with someone, and we’re just real with each other, rather than being closeted away behind a virtual façade,” said Taylor, who studies German and politics at the University of Bath.

“We can create real bonds with each other. Sarah and I have learnt over the year that it is possible to be with each other without being in each other’s physical presence.”

The couple said they were disappointed when the St. Andrews Church in Stratford cancelled their wedding reception in early May.

Shortly after, Campbell felt a lump in her neck and got tested. She had a biopsy on June 25 and the cancer diagnosis was confirmed July 2.

“Sarah and I were halfway through an episode of the British comedy series ‘White Gold’ when she got the call. It was so gut-wrenching to just see her face drop and see her fight back the tears. It was so shocking and horrendous, because I was unable to do anything to help,” Taylor recalled.

“That day made the distance feel 10 times worse than it already does, because I felt so useless and unhelpful.

“I want to be there to support her and look after her but I’m stuck over here.”

The pair had planned to have their second wedding for friends and relatives in the U.K. on July 4 and for her to stay after with him in England.

That wedding, too, was postponed.

Campbell and Taylor said they have reached out to the Canadian High Commission in London and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, as well as border services and MPs for help.

So far, they said they’ve been told there will be no exception granted due to public health concerns.

Campbell said the soonest she can have a surgery to remove the entire thyroid is in mid-August and she will need six weeks to recover before she can receive further treatment.

“We don’t want the border to be reopened. We understand the public health risks,” she said.

“All we are asking for is some compassion for people and for them to exempt Jacob (from the travel ban), so he could walk with me through this.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-07,"MONTREAL—Authorities in Quebec say they prefer that bars and restaurants follow public health directives instead of being forced by the government to collect the personal information of their patrons in case of an COVID-19 outbreak.

“We aren’t there yet,” Premier François Legault told reporters Tuesday when asked about requiring private businesses to keep a register of customers. New Brunswick, for example, requires bars, restaurants and other venues to collect such data to make it easier to trace people after an outbreak.

“Maybe in places like bars, if there is spread of the virus, we can ask for a register to trace people who were in contact with infected people,” Legault said. “But our first wish is for people to respect the two-metre rule and that there is no spread.”

On Monday, Legault’s health minister, Christian Dubé, threatened owners of bars and restaurants with closure after reports that some in the Montreal area weren’t following public health guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Dr. Horacio Arruda, the province’s director of public health, told reporters Tuesday that forcing businesses to collect the personal data of their patrons is not the Quebec way of doing things — for now.

“We could look at that,” he said, referring to a register. “We aren’t in the same culture of (collecting) personal information of individuals.” Arruda, like Legault, said he would prefer businesses just follow the rules.

On Monday, regional health authorities on Montreal’s South Shore said infected people who went to a bar in the area last week were tied to a cluster of 20 cases. In response to the outbreak, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante announced Monday her council would pass a bylaw requiring mask-wearing in indoor public places.

Legault said he wasn’t ready to give the same order provincewide. And he questioned how that Montreal bylaw would be applied.

“How would we do that in stores?” he asked, regarding the bylaw’s enforcement. “It’s something I’d like to discuss with (Plante).”

Meanwhile, Quebec reported 13 new deaths Tuesday attributed to the coronavirus, for a total of 5,590. The province said nine of those deaths occurred in the past 24 hours, while another four occurred before June 29.

Quebec also announced 60 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 55,997, including 25,458 cases that are considered recovered.

After posting a slight increase Monday, health authorities said hospitalizations diminished by 30 patients, for a total of 347. Among those in hospital, 26 patients are in intensive care, an increase of one.

Public health authorities conducted 5,318 COVID-19 tests on July 5, the last day for which data is available, representing a significant decrease compared with the past week.

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-07-07,"OTTAWA—A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they’re not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and air crews wear masks.

Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said they’re comfortable getting aboard with no in-flight physical distancing and a requirement to wear masks.

There’s more to it to keep flights safe, WestJet said in a statement last week after critics attacked its plan.

“What makes an airplane, and the entire journey, safe is the layers of enhanced cleaning, the wearing of masks and the hospital-grade HEPA filters that remove 99.999 per cent of all airborne particles,” the airline said.

“The hygiene standards we have now are world-class and backed by industry experts.”

Critics have also previously pounced on the airlines for another move: refusing to fully refund tickets for flights cancelled due to the pandemic.

Thousands of people have beseeched Transport Minister Marc Garneau to compel airlines to issue refunds, but he has refused, arguing that mandating reimbursements from a sector that’s lost more than 90 per cent of its revenue would cripple the industry.

But 72 per cent of those polled say they totally oppose his decision.

In lieu of refunds, the airlines have offered vouchers but the poll suggests that it may take a while before people will rebook previously cancelled trips: 85 per cent of those surveyed told pollsters they have no plans to travel outside the country by the end of the year.

The survey polled 1,517 people and can’t be assigned a margin of error because online polls are not considered truly random.

Pollsters were in the field between July 3 and 5, a historically popular few days for Canadians and Americans to be on the move between the two countries, given the July 1 Canada Day holiday and the U.S.’s July 4 Independence Day.

But the border remains closed to non-essential traffic, and the majority of Canadians surveyed said they feel it needs to stay that way. The current mutual closure agreement is due to expire July 21.

Of Canadians polled, 86 per cent said they totally disagreed with reopening the border at the end of July, allowing Americans back into the country.

Americans seem more eager both to head north and to welcome Canadians south; 50 per cent agreed the border should reopen and 36 per cent disagreed.

The potential for cross-border transmission of the virus has been a key factor in the decision to keep the border closed. Currently, rates of COVID-19 infection in the U.S. continue to climb, while in Canada the curve appears to be on a downward trajectory nearly everywhere.

Still, the survey suggests Canadians don’t feel they are out of the woods. Thirty-nine per cent believe the worst is yet to come, while 35 per cent believe the worst of the crisis has passed.

In the U.S., 42 per cent of those surveyed felt the darkest days are ahead, 25 per cent believe the U.S. is in the middle of the worst part now while 21 per cent think that’s already passed.

Face masks now mandatory in indoor places in Toronto

As of today, it’s now mandatory to wear face masks in Toronto.

Toronto city council voted to make masks mandatory in enclosed, public places last week following recommendations from the medical officer of health.

It will require “the person or organization who owns or is responsible for the operation of a facility or business to have a policy to ensure masks or face coverings be worn by the public in the enclosed public spaces under their control,” subject to some exemptions.

Toronto’s bylaw is meant to make masks mandatory in businesses like grocery stores and will not apply to children under the age of two or people who can’t wear masks for medical reasons.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city’s medical officer of health, said they’ve seen that making masks mandatory improves compliance, and that though there is greater risk of COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, wearing masks helps to prevent virus spread.

How Toronto’s COVID-19 mask push could take a lesson from safe-sex campaigns of the past

As Toronto and other jurisdictions move to make masks mandatory, Jill McDevitt, a sexologist, has been watching the accompanying debate with a sense of déjà vu.

The conversation around masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has felt like a fraught one since the pandemic began — muddied by mixed messaging and early confusion about transmission.

Scrolling through Instagram recently, she saw post after post raging against people not wearing masks. She found herself shaking her head. Public shaming didn’t make people practise safer sex, either, she said.

While condoms have become a pillar of public sexual health over the course of years, public health officials are struggling to sell the public on masks.

7:12 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford insists his push to extend the Progressive Conservative government’s sweeping COVID-19 emergency authority well into next year is not a pandemic power play.

“That’s something that is totally misunderstood,” Ford said Tuesday. “We’re doing it to help the people. I don’t want a power grab. I’m just not into big government, I’m just not. But we have to do it.”

His comments came after he announced plans to delay the end of the July 15 official state of emergency until July 24.

That’s to ensure enough time for the new Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act to pass in the legislature.

Ontario has been in a state of emergency since March 17, which restricts civil liberties in order to curb the spread of the virus that has killed more than 2,700 people here.

5:53 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 38,076 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,735 deaths, according to the Star’s latest count.

Those totals represent an increase of just 92 cases and one new death since Monday evening.

However, because Tuesday is the first off-day after Toronto Public Health switched to reporting only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting this week, the provincewide count of COVID-19 cases as reported by the 34 regional health units does not include any new infections in the city.

Prior to this week, Toronto had seen by far the most infections per day of any Ontario health unit.

On Monday, Medical Officer of Health Elieen de Villa explained that the unit made the change to thrice-weekly reporting because the pandemic is at the point where it is more valuable to dig deeper into the data “to better inform our actions to further reduce virus spread in our city.”

Both cases and deaths have fallen sharply in Ontario since May.

Amid the worst of the province’s epidemic, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Tuesday, the province reported 131 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 34 in an intensive care unit, of whom 24 are on a ventilator — numbers that are themselves near the lowest the province has reported since first publishing hospitalization data in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,691 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

5:07 p.m.: Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was spotted Tuesday in a Pearson airport lounge not wearing a mandatory mask.

Two separate photos of the bare-faced party leader sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online but his office says he was wearing a mask for his trip. A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.

Toronto’s Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.

The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with several others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.

5:03 p.m.: At least eight Mississippi lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus after working for weeks in a Capitol where many people stood or sat close together and did not wear masks.

Among those who have publicly acknowledged having COVID-19 are Lt.-Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, and House Speaker Philip Gunn.

The state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said Tuesday there are also at least 11 other suspected cases of the virus among legislators and Capitol employees. In addition, Dobbs said the highly contagious virus is spreading at parties and other social gatherings around the state.

4:51 p.m.: The federal government says it plans to slowly reopen Service Canada centres it shuttered in late March over COVID concerns.

Up to 90 centres across the country will gradually reopen in July, starting with 14 on Wednesday. Further openings are to be guided by public health advice as well as how many Canadians each centre serves.

The government has spent the past few weeks upgrading the centres to put up clear barriers at counters, signs to encourage physical distancing and reduce seating in waiting areas.

Personal protective equipment will also be provided to staff at centres that reopen.

4:07 p.m.: The United States officially notified the United Nations secretary-general of the country’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization, setting in motion the country’s exit from the global body.

President Donald Trump in May said he would withdraw from the WHO, accusing the organization of failing in the coronavirus pandemic and being a puppet of China. Trump also announced a funding halt to the WHO in a move that has drawn concern, including from U.S. allies.

The move, effective July 6, 2021, was confirmed by a U.S. senior administration official and the U.N.

A spokesperson for the U.N. noted that exit conditions include giving a one-year notice and “fully meeting” financial obligations.

3:18 p.m.: Death rates among immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa doubled in France and tripled in the Paris region at the height of France's coronavirus outbreak, according to a study from the French government’s statistics agency.

The INSEE agency’s findings are the closest France has come yet to acknowledging with numbers the virus's punishing and disproportionate impact on the country’s Black immigrants and the members of other systemically overlooked minority groups.

The study was the first in France to cross-reference deaths that occurred in March and April, when intensive care units were swamped with COVID-19 patients, with the regions of origin of the people who died.

3:15 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s promise to provide a $600 payment to disabled Canadians to help with additional costs in the COVID-19 pandemic remains in limbo.

The measure was contained in a piece of legislation that failed to pass in June and no replacement is on the agenda for a House of Commons sitting this week.

A spokesperson for Carla Qualtrough, the minister in charge of the file, says the government continues to work to find a solution but provided no details.

The opposition Conservatives and New Democrats say the Liberals have to find a way to make good on that pledge.

3:10 p.m.: The Ontario government must release information about the prevalence of COVID-19 in provincial jails as well as what preventative measures are taken to curb the spread, an activist coalition said.

In a letter to Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, the coalition of Black, Indigenous and legal groups said it was also filing a freedom-of-information request to obtain the data.

“We are very concerned that there is no public information available about the current data related to COVID-19 testing and positive diagnoses in Ontario correctional facilities,” the letter states. “This information is vital for the health of all Ontarians, but especially for Indigenous and Black communities who are vastly over-represented inside these institutions.”

1:45 p.m.: Just For Laughs says it won’t be hosting live performances as part of its Toronto festival this fall because of concerns about COVID-19.

The JFL42 festival was set to take place at venues across Toronto from Sept. 24 to Oct. 3. Organizers say they’re exploring ways to host the festival in a different format.

Tuesday’s decision impacts all in-person shows scheduled for this year, including a special performance from “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. The festival is set to return in 2021.

Organizers say people who purchased tickets to Noah’s show can either see him perform next year, or request a refund until Aug. 7.

12 p.m.: After the first day with no COVID-19 fatalities since early in the pandemic, Ontario is reporting two new coronavirus deaths.

But only 112 new cases were reported across the province.

“Our testing strategy is working,” Health Minister Christine Elliott told the legislature on Tuesday.

So far, 1,559,529 COVID-19 tests have been conducted in Ontario since January.

11:20 a.m.: Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro tested positive for COVID-19 in an escalation of the health crisis that has engulfed Latin America’s largest economy.

“I’m perfectly well,” Bolsonaro told CNN Brasil in a live interview, after announcing the result of his test.

He added he is taking hydroxichloroquine, an anti-malaria medicine he’s been touting as being effective against the virus though its use hasn’t been authorized by most health experts globally and could carry dangerous side effects.

The 65-year-old president, who during his campaign to reopen the economy called the virus “just a little flu,” has repeatedly disobeyed medical recommendations to avoid contamination, mingling in crowds without a face mask and giving people handshakes.

Late on Monday, however, a video posted on YouTube showed a masked Bolsonaro trying not to get too close to supporters who awaited him in front of the presidential palace. He told them he was following social distancing orders from a doctor after showing symptoms of the virus, and added that an exam had shown his lungs were “clean.”

Brazil has become a global hotspot for the virus, trailing only the U.S. with more than 65,000 confirmed deaths and over 1.62 million total cases. It has implemented an erratic response to the pandemic, with the president often clashing with state governors and even his health minister over quarantine measures and possible treatments. Brazil’s health ministry is currently headed by an interim chief after Bolsonaro fired his first minister and a second resigned.

Bolsonaro could be seen coughing during a Thursday broadcast on his social networks, when he sat next to six other people, none of whom wore a mask. Officials who were present included Regional Development Minister Rogerio Marinho and the chief executive officer of state-owned bank Caixa Economica Federal, Pedro Guimaraes. Since then, he has mingled with members of his administration and the general public, and had lunch with the U.S. ambassador to Brazil on Saturday.

11:10 a.m.: The U.S. government will pay vaccine maker Novavax $1.6 billion to expedite the development of 100 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by the beginning of next year, the company said Tuesday.

The deal is the largest that the Trump administration has made so far with a company as part of Operation Warp Speed, the sprawling federal effort to make coronavirus vaccines and treatments available to the American public as quickly as possible. In doing so, the government has placed a significant bet on Novavax, a company based in Maryland that has never brought a product to market.

Operation Warp Speed is a multiagency effort that seeks to carry out President Donald Trump’s pledge to make a coronavirus vaccine available by the end of the year, but the full extent of the project is still unclear. Officials have declined to list which vaccines and treatments are part of Operation Warp Speed.

11 a.m.: The parliamentary budget office says it could cost more than $98 billion to provide almost all Canadians with a basic income for six months beginning this fall.

That figure is the upper range of the scenarios the budget watchdog was asked to research as part of a report out this morning.

The idea of providing a basic income to Canadians has taken on more steam as millions have watched their jobs or earnings evaporate in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the federal spending of about $174 billion to provide a financial floor for individuals and businesses.

The cost for the federal government could range between $47.5 billion and $98.1 billion for six months of a granted basic income beginning in October, depending on how much is clawed back as incomes rise.

Budget officer Yves Giroux’s report says the average benefit to Canadians aged 18 to 64 would range between $4,500 and $4,800, with the number of recipients rising depending on the phase-out rate.

Giroux’s report says the government could repeal $15 billion in tax measures to offset the overall cost of a basic income program.

9:20 a.m.: It’s been a long, 105-day stretch since Ontario marked a 24-hour period with no deaths related to COVID-19. And that period couldn’t have come sooner, say doctors and epidemiologists who have been watching the pandemic unfold.

While the news Monday that we have reached a day with zero dead from the virus for the first time since mid-March is undoubtedly good, experts are warning that we should not begin to rest on our laurels lest the virus flare up amid relaxed restrictions.

One person in Ontario died from the virus on Sunday, a significant departure from the height of the pandemic in May, when more than 90 deaths were reported in one day.

9 a.m.: Toronto’s COVID-19 mask push could take a lesson from safe-sex campaigns of the past.

For sexologist Jill McDevitt, the public shaming about people not wearing masks is a bad reminder. Public shaming didn’t help promote the use of condoms for safe sex.

“If we’re talking strategy, (shame) doesn’t work,” she says.

8:20 a.m. Premier Doug Ford is moving to extend the Progressive Conservative government’s COVID-19 emergency powers past the province’s state of emergency, which expires next week.

The Canadian Press first reported that Solicitor General Sylvia Jones will introduce the potentially controversial legislation on Tuesday.

“It allows us to transition away from the declaration of emergency, which is an important signal to people that we’re on our way out,” Jones told CP’s Shawn Jeffords on Monday.

“But it also allows us to ensure that — because frankly, we don’t have a vaccine for COVID-19 — that we still can keep in place the important tools we need,” she said.

“We want to make sure that we’re not over-using the declaration of emergency.”

Jones said the bill will introduce additional reporting requirements to bolster oversight, including forcing the government to report any emergency order extensions to a legislative committee once every month and table a report on the use of the law six months after it expires next year.

8 a.m.: Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for about 1,000 pilgrims who will be allowed to perform the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca later this month, an experience that will be unlike any before because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The pilgrims will be only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that is packaged in plastic bottles, and pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged ahead of time. Pilgrims will also have to bring their own prayer rugs.

The guidelines were announced Monday as Saudi authorities prepare for a very limited hajj, which for the first time will not include pilgrims from outside the country. Instead, the kingdom said that 70 per cent of pilgrims allowed to make the pilgrimage this year will be from among foreign residents of Saudi Arabia and 30 per cent would be Saudi citizens.

7:58 a.m. Global stock markets were mostly lower Tuesday as investors grew anxious that the recent rally has gone too far amid gloomy economic forecasts.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, suggesting a pullback when U.S. markets open. The stock index closed higher for the fifth straight day on Monday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record.

The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.9 per cent Tuesday after reaching its highest level in nearly a month.

“Some investors will be taking profit after yesterday’s rally,’’ said Sebastien Galy, a macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management. “There’s been a real divergence between what the market believes and the reality of the economy.”

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Tuesday that unemployment rates in the world’s advanced economies will reach the highest level this year since the Great Depression.

7:40 a.m. The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board says the number of homes sold in the region in June was just shy of the mark set a year ago as the average selling price rose nearly 12 per cent compared with June 2019.

Home sales plunged earlier this year as the COVID-19 pandemic forced buyers to the sidelines, however sales have picked up as businesses have started to reopen.

The real estate board says there were 8,701 homes sale in June, down 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year.

On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in June were up 84 per cent compared with May.

The average selling price was $930,869, up 11.9 per cent compared with June 2019.

Toronto board president Lisa Patel says it’s still the early days of recovery, but barring any setbacks, she expects to see stronger market conditions in the second half of the year.

7:37 a.m.: Schools in Kenya will reopen in January and not September as planned earlier, with the number of the coronavirus infections in the country continuing to climb.

The East African nation has confirmed 8,067 virus infections since March when the first case was discovered, and the attendance of school in physical classrooms was suspended as part of measures to curb the spread. Kenya has tested almost 200,000 people, with about eight per cent of tests returning positive in recent days.

Schooling will remain one of Kenya’s most-affected sectors by the virus after President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday announced the lifting of restrictions on travel into and out of the nation’s two biggest cities. Kenyatta also said international passenger flights will resume from Aug. 1.

7:11 a.m.: Iran suffered its deadliest day of the coronavirus outbreak, as the country’s health minister said warnings about the spread of the disease had fallen on “deaf ears.”

Authorities reported on Tuesday that 200 people had died from COVID-19 over the past 24 hours, a sharp spike from the previous high of 163 recorded on July 5. The total death toll reached 11,931 out of 245,688 known cases.

“I repeatedly said to our people that it’s extremely dangerous to understate the situation,” Health Minister Saeed Namaki said on state TV just before the latest figures were made public. “Unfortunately, our pleas fell on deaf ears until we were gripped by a new wave” of infections.

The virus began surging again in May, around a month after Iran first started to loosen lockdown measures on its population of 82 million in an effort to keep its sanctions-hit economy afloat. Curbs have been reintroduced in some of Iran’s busiest port cities on the Persian Gulf, and wearing face masks in enclosed public spaces became mandatory nationwide from July 5.

7 a.m.: The towns of Kingsville and Leamington, Ont., are joining the rest of the province in Stage 2 of the government’s reopening plan.

Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that the communities, which were the final two towns in Stage 1 of the process, would move up as of 12:01 a.m.

Ford says COVID-19 outbreaks on local farms are under control and community spread of the virus is low.

Most of the Windsor-Essex region, except for those two towns, moved to the second stage of reopening on June 25.

The government dispatched a team from Emergency Management Ontario to the region last week to help co-ordinate health care and housing for hundreds of agri-food workers who have tested positive for the virus.

Ford said Monday he will be visiting the region soon, and thanked people in Kingsville and Leamington for their patience in recent weeks.

6:30 a.m.: South Korea confirmed 44 new cases of the coronavirus, a continuation of an uptick in new infections beyond the greater Seoul area.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday the additional cases took the national tally to 13,181 with 285 deaths.

It says 20 of the newly reported cases were locally infected patients, 12 of them in the Seoul metropolitan area and the rest eight from two central cities. The agency says 24 cases came from overseas.

6:30 a.m.: Australia’s second-largest city of Melbourne has been ordered into lockdown for a second time as coronavirus cases surge.

Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters that residents will be prohibited from leaving the metropolitan area for six weeks except to go to work or school, for care or care giving, for daily exercise, and for food and other essentials.

He said 191 more cases have been detected, the most in a single day. Australia has been among the world’s most successful countries in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with the exception of Melbourne.

The country has more than 8,500 cases and 106 deaths.

6:30 a.m.: India’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic has crossed 20,000 and its cases have passed 700,000. The country reported 467 new deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the toll to 20,160.

It also recorded 22,252 new infections, increasing the total to 719,665. The rate of new virus infections and deaths in India are now rising at the fastest pace in the last four months. Health officials fear the number of deaths could rise significantly in the coming weeks.

India has 1.3 billion people and has the third-most cases after the United States and Brazil.

6:25 a.m.: Almost 11 million students began taking China’s university entrance exam Tuesday after a delay as the country worked to bring down coronavirus infections.

The gruelling four-day exam known as “gaokao” can be a key determinant of a student’s future and was pushed back weeks from its scheduled date. The exam is believed to be the first mass gathering event since the virus outbreak and administrators are enforcing strict rules to prevent infections, including proof of wellness, social distancing and the wearing of masks.

All of the new infections China reported Tuesday were people returning from overseas. Shanghai authorities say the two cases confirmed there in the past 24 hours were students who had returned from schools in Britain and the United States.

6:24 a.m.: Saudi Arabia has issued guidelines for the 1,000 or so pilgrims that will be allowed to perform the hajj pilgrimage in Mecca later this month, an experience that will be unlike any before because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The pilgrims will be only be able to drink holy water from the Zamzam well in Mecca that is packaged in plastic bottles, and pebbles for casting away evil that are usually picked up by pilgrims along hajj routes will be sterilized and bagged ahead of time. Pilgrims will also have to bring their own prayer rugs.

The guidelines were announced on Monday as Saudi authorities prepare to carry out a very limited hajj, which for the first time will not include pilgrims from outside the country. Instead, the kingdom said that 70% of pilgrims allowed to participate this year will be from among foreign residents of Saudi Arabia while 30% would be Saudi citizens.

Saudi pilgrims will be selected from among health care workers and security personnel who have recovered from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The government said their selection represents a “token of appreciation for their role in providing care” during the pandemic.

5:23 a.m.: A new poll suggests turbulence ahead for airlines seeking public support for their current COVID-19 plans.

Seventy-two per cent of Canadians surveyed by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they’re not comfortable flying since a decision by some airlines to relax their own in-flight physical distancing requirements.

As of July 1, Air Canada and WestJet both ended policies blocking the sale of adjacent seats.

The measure was seen to align with a guidance document for the aviation industry issued by Transport Canada in April to help curb the spread of COVID-19.

Among other things, the department had suggested passengers should be widely spaced when possible, though they did not make it mandatory.

Airlines, however, are required to make passengers and aircrews wear masks.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-07,"As Toronto and other jurisdictions move to make masks mandatory, Jill McDevitt has been watching the accompanying debate with a sense of déjà vu.

The conversation around masks during the COVID-19 pandemic has felt like a fraught one since the pandemic began — muddied by mixed messaging and early confusion about transmission.

Toronto’s new rules, which come into effect on Tuesday, require facilities or businesses “to have a policy to ensure masks or face coverings be worn by the public in the enclosed public spaces under their control.”

Where some see a fresh challenge, McDevitt — a sexologist — sees reminders of past lessons.

Scrolling through Instagram recently, she saw post after post raging against people not wearing masks. She found herself shaking her head. Public shaming didn’t make people practise safer sex, either, she said.

“We’ve already tried this with condoms, and it’s going to fail,” she said. “They might deserve to be shamed, I don’t know. But if we’re talking strategy, (shame) doesn’t work.”

While condoms have become a pillar of public sexual health over the course of years, public health officials are struggling to sell the public on masks.

In some countries, such as China, citizens were already well accustomed to masks thanks to past outbreaks such as SARS. Others, such as Venezuela, Vietnam and the Czech Republic, moved swiftly to make cloth face coverings mandatory in many public spaces. Meanwhile, the United States has camped out at the other end of the global spectrum, with some anti-lockdown protesters taking mask mandates as an attack on their liberty.

In Canada, it’s been a moving target.

In late March, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, told Canadians that wearing masks could give people a false sense of security and that there were no benefits for asymptomatic people to wear them. But by early April, the messaging had changed to say that wearing non-medical masks could be an “additional measure” for protecting others around you. By late May, her position evolved again when she recommended that Canadians wear non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing of two metres was not possible, and she applied the advice to people who didn’t have symptoms.

Some public health observers say it’s unfair to criticize Tam and other officials — that they went with the best evidence before them and that evidence changed.

“For a long time, we didn’t know much about COVID-19 and the reliable evidence was quite limited,” said Katherine Fierlbeck, a Dalhousie University professor of political science specializing in health policy.

“As evidence mounted about how it was spread, then I think public policy followed suit,” she said. “We should be grateful for officials who are flexible in changing their strategies and positions based on best available evidence.”

But Amir Attaran, a professor of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa, doesn’t buy that argument.

Technically speaking, we may not have possessed evidence showing that masks worked to prevent the spread of this particular strain of coronavirus. But, he said, we did have evidence of its effectiveness for other respiratory infections.

Attaran said the current rollout of mandatory rules is coming months too late.

One of the best arguments in favour of mask wearing, he said, came early out of Hong Kong, which has reported only seven deaths during the pandemic.

“Hong Kong did not achieve that because it has lower population density. No way — it’s just about the most densely populated piece of the planet,” he said. “For Toronto to have an ongoing difficulty when Hong Kong put it down early and firmly, you can only find one conceivable explanation, which is masking.”

Last week, Toronto city council voted to make masks mandatory in enclosed, public places following recommendations from the medical officer of health.

Cynthia Carr, a Winnipeg-based epidemiologist, said the current science supports masking. While masks won’t prevent the spread of coronavirus entirely, she points to a widely reported study headed by a computer scientist from University of California, Berkeley that suggests U.S. cases would drop significantly if 80 per cent of the population wore masks.

“Just like a vaccine, not everybody has to be immunized to break the chain,” Carr said. “Masking, as part of a comprehensive strategy, including social distance and hygiene, that’s what we’re seeing now is the best way to break the chain of transmission.”

Will there be ugly scenes? There have been a few already. Days before Toronto’s new bylaw came into effect, a local woman drew online ridicule after she posted a video of herself refusing to wear a mask at St. Joseph’s hospital. In the video, staff can be heard saying, “please wear a mask, it’s policy,” but she refuses. The video ends before the woman says three security guards escorted her out. But a recent survey suggested that she might be an outlier.

A poll of 1,500 Canadians by the research firm Abacus Data found that most respondents would not object to mandatory mask-wearing policies. Only 14 per cent said they would oppose such a move, while a good majority would be supportive (62 per cent) or go along with it (24 per cent).

While those opposed tended to skew Conservative, Abacus officials said it would be an exaggeration to say there was a deep political cultural divide and that “hesitation to use masks seems more a function of where one lives, social conditioning, and population density than a philosophical or political barrier.”

The poll found that about one-third of Canadians already wear a mask when entering a public place such as a retail store, whereas about a quarter never do.

Men were much less likely to wear masks than women, and resistance was highest among the 45-59 age set. Mask wearing was most common in Ontario and Quebec and least common in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

A group is now working to get broad mask-wearing buy-in from the Canadian population.

Amy Tan is a University of Calgary professor of family medicine and organizer with Masks4Canada, a group representing health-care workers, front-line physicians, scientists and other concerned citizens that is advocating for the adoption of mask-wearing in all indoor spaces, crowded places (whether indoor or outdoor) and on public transit.

Asked about American-style resistance from civil libertarians, Tan said there is a chance there could be a spillover effect from the United States into Canada, but she hopes that appeals to Canadians’ sense of altruism will win out.

Fierlbeck, who is from rural Alberta, said there are some parts of Canada, including the Prairies, that have a bit more of a libertarian streak and “stroppy” constituents, so some politicians will have to weigh whether it’s worth it to take the political gamble of implementing mask-wearing policies.

Leaders and health officials, she said, need to lay out the rationale in plain language as well as the potential repercussions for society and individuals if they don’t comply. “No one wants to be spoken down to.”

Tan acknowledges the science on mask-wearing wasn’t there in the early stages of the pandemic and understands the desire among Canada’s top health officials at the time to take a measured approach; they were having to make rapid-fire responses under a deluge of information from around the world.

But now the science firmly says mask-wearing helps and should be made mandatory.

“We need to be very much clearing up the message,” she said. “This is a relatively small inconvenience for a potential great benefit.”

McDevitt, who is also a California-based sex educator, recently made a list of things that mask advocates could learn from sexual health educators that was shared widely.

While condoms in some form have been around for thousands of years, it wasn’t until HIV began to spread in the early 1980s that they became a matter of urgent public health policy, and advocates have learned a lot of lessons since then, she says.

The big one is that you can’t judge people into changing their behaviour, she said. “It’s going to make them feel more and more validated that people don’t understand whatever they feel is their particular reason why they don’t want to wear one or feel like they can’t wear one,” she said.

“The analogy to condoms here is like a latex allergy, right?” If someone is allergic to condoms, an educator will work with them to find out whether they’re trying to prevent pregnancy or an STI, and work with them to find another solution. “We don’t tell people to shut up and wear it anyway,” she said.

It also doesn’t help the cause to pretend that wearing a mask isn’t exactly fun, she says.

Much of the messaging has been “like, ‘Wear it and deal with it, otherwise, you’re rude and you don’t care about other people,’” McDevitt said. “But, can we acknowledge and have some empathy for the fact that this is not pleasant for people?” She notes that condom companies have made major strides in fit and comfort in recent decades, which has helped.

Going forward, she said, it’ll be important to make sure that the messaging is consistent, and masks are readily available. But a recent trip to the post office gave her hope.

Although the office had a sign encouraging everyone to wear masks, it wasn’t required. When McDevitt walked in, the lineup was a sea of masks. But while she was waiting a man entered without one.

“He’s standing there and more people come in line behind him wearing masks, and he finally says, ‘Can you hold my spot so I can go and get a mask on? I don’t want to be the only one with out one.’”

The moment sent her sexologist brain spinning, McDevitt says, because she realized she was watching the normalization of public health in real time. The man realized wearing a mask had become normal, and it made him adapt his own behaviour without anyone else having to do anything.

“No one wants to be the only one out,” she said. “When we’re like, ‘hey, all the cool kids are doing it,’ it’s silly, but it works.”

“Kevie, I wonder how much longer I will be alive?”

Pouring the eggs whisked by her one good hand into a frying pan on the stove in the communal kitchen, I added some chopped mushrooms, onions and peppers, then shredded cheese.

“Well, Mom, how much longer do you want to be alive?”

“No plans to go anywhere at the present time,” she chuckled, grasping her fork expectantly. “And I’m not dead yet!”

Norma Agnes Donovan, a Maritimer transplanted to Ontario in the 1950s, had a wonderfully oddball sense of humour. The “I’m not dead yet, I think I’ll go for a walk” line from the poor fellow in Monty Python’s The Holy Grail “bring out your dead” bit never failed to make her laugh, more so given her predicament. Hunched over in her wheelchair with age (92), severe arthritis, and devastating paralysis on her left side, she had a relatively low quality of life, but like the Dylan Thomas poem, she seemed to have no intention of going “gentle into that good night.”

This is a story about my mother’s battle with the COVID-19 virus that has swept the world and our experience with Ontario’s long-term-care system.

Her nursing home, Earlscourt Village in London, has on each of its four floors a “Harvest Room” kitchen for families to cook a meal and get together around a live-edge wooden table. Her birthdays were celebrated there, with family and former colleagues from her many years at London city hall. More of a scrambled and hard-boiled egg man, I learned to cook omelettes in that room five years ago when a stroke put our mother in long-term care. It was a meal she could help prepare and it was easy for her to swallow. At her feet, hoping for any spills, was always Toby, our Australian Shepherd. Earlscourt certainly had its issues, but it was very pet friendly.

We had a ritual, with Mom helping where she could. The sharp smell of onions being chopped and the sizzle of a bit too much butter in the pan on this particular day in early 2020 brought a smile, crooked because of the stroke, but a smile to be sure.

“Yum,” she said, readying herself for her weekly break from nursing home food she proclaimed “the absolute worst.” Our visits had developed a natural progression over the years. Food, chats ranging from the old days in New Brunswick to President Donald Trump (she was not a fan — “how much longer can he last?” she wondered), updates on family and her few surviving friends, reading her father’s diary, and before I left to drive home to Toronto, a couple of Python skits on her iPad. “Make sure it is charged before you go,” she would say from her comfy red recliner. “Oh, and move the fan a bit to the left please.”

Then COVID-19 arrived at Earlscourt and she caught it.

Sheila, a personal caregiver who had become Mom’s closest friend, was getting her ready for bed on Friday, April 3. “Norma has a fever and a headache,” the always vigilant Sheila reported to the staff down the hall and then in a phone call to me. At Earlscourt, they were already on high alert. A nurse who was caring for Mom and a lovely lady who was in the room next door tested positive the previous Wednesday. London Public Health did what was described to me third hand as a “rapid test” on Mom and the lady in the next room. Saturday night, a very shaken sounding but professional administrator at Earlscourt called me with the news.

“Your mom has tested positive for COVID-19.” So did the lady in the next room, the lady on the other side of Mom’s room, and others, including staff, over the next weeks.

I had been writing stories on the pandemic, talking to doctors, reading scientific papers. I feared the worst. If you take your mind back to the start of April, stories of extreme respiratory distress, ventilator rationing, and tough decisions (who can be saved and who cannot) were in the news.

But here’s the thing. Other than one day of fever and headache, Mom had no other major symptoms in the first week. I asked her about the nose swab for the virus, which many have complained is painful. “It tickled,” she said.

As each day passed from her diagnosis, the nurses at Earlscourt went out of their way to keep me posted on her condition. Their understanding was that the first 10 days were critical. She never developed any respiratory symptoms. No “crackles” in her chest when they listened. Not one single cough. One day a nurse told me “your mom may be 92, but she has the oxygen level of an Olympic athlete.” Too bad you never took up long-distance running, I joked with her over the phone.

Her doctor and my mom herself suggested her tolerance for the virus might be because she had sailed through life without a cold, the flu, or any respiratory issues. It was something — along with excellent grammar and arguably the best pie crust on earth — of which she was proud. Always took her flu shot too. Yes, a stroke had paralyzed her left arm and leg, but her lungs and heart were strong. Researchers of COVID-19 say that those with pre-existing respiratory issues are more likely to have serious effects from this virus.

With Earlscourt by then facing an outbreak of the virus on the first floor, the home, like others in Ontario, banned family visits. Sheila, her personal caregiver, was also banned. The Sheilas of the world, for those who have not experienced long-term care through a relative, play a vital role that fills the gaps in short-staffed homes, private and public. Typically, they have clients in several homes, and also deliver home care — looking after a senior or taking them to dialysis or other medical appointments. As a result of COVID-19 and concerns of spreading the virus between nursing homes, personal caregivers (paid directly by the resident or family) are usually asked to choose clients in one home, at least for now.

Over the five years Mom was in the privately owned Earlscourt, the newly built home (it’s physical layout includes a book-lined library, chapel, family room, etc.) had, like many facilities in Ontario, serious problems with staff shortages, food and management. Two years ago, when the ministry of health and long-term care stepped in and a management team was hired following complaints from family members, there were many improvements and by the time COVID-19 hit, the home was in a better place.

The first week after diagnosis, Mom was in surprisingly good spirits. “Can you believe that I, of all people, got this virus?” she said over the phone. Always a news junkie, she seemed at first to enjoy being part of the story. (The inspiration for one of my first investigations as a young reporter — Canadian Catholic priests being transferred from parish to parish following abuse allegations — came from my sharp-eyed mother piecing together small newspaper stories she spotted in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a decade before the Boston Globe’s Spotlight series in the U.S.)

Earlscourt assigned Danielle, a newly-minted and recently hired personal support worker (PSW) to care for Mom and the other COVID-19 positive ladies. Danielle had left retail and gone back to school because she felt her own grandmother, whom she adored, received poor care at the end of her life.

“I am going to treat your mom and the other lady like my grannies and do everything I can to make them happy and comfortable,” Danielle said. All Earlscourt residents on the outbreak floor had to stay in their rooms day and night. No dinner in the dining room, no group entertainment or physiotherapy, no book club or puzzles in the library. Loneliness was unavoidable. Each day, Danielle, wearing gown, mask and plastic face shield, looked after all of Mom’s needs and every afternoon she got Mom on the phone or FaceTime with me and my siblings. I reread my grandfather’s writings to her and, for a time, she was her normal self, spurred by the 1948 diary to recall events from her childhood.

The diary, loaned to me by my Aunt Janet (Mom’s sister) was filled with Grandpa Murray Northrup’s weather reports (it was a cold tough winter and short hot summer in Moncton), and stories of family and friend get-togethers and Murray’s own travels on buying trips to Montreal and Toronto for Eaton’s, taking in hockey games with business colleagues or a hit movie on his own after his calls for the day were done.

There were also deeply personal bits for Mom to reflect on and me to ask questions about, like this entry my grandfather made on Feb. 17, 1948: “I opened my big mouth tonight and said a lot of things to Norma that I would give my all to have never said. God bless her.” At the time, my mom was dating a young English boxer named Tom Donovan, who had arrived in Moncton after serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War.

I asked Mom what was that about? She explained that it was scandalous that Tom Donovan, a Catholic, was dating Norma, a Protestant. “I know my dad felt awful at what he said,” Mom recalled.

Tom Donovan left the Catholic Church and he and Norma Northrup were married in a Protestant ceremony, moving from Moncton to London, Ont. shortly after my sister Wendy was born. Three sons followed, of which I am the youngest.

Though her strength was failing, Mom was in a reflective mood one afternoon. “In those days you did not have conversations and talk about feelings openly.”

On week two after diagnosis, Mom had lost her appetite. I remember telling her that a colleague at the Star, May Warren, contracted the virus and had detailed her story and her “zero interest in food.” Still, Mom had no crackles in the lungs, no shortness of breath and no cough, dry or otherwise.

In addition to her loss of appetite, Mom, a prodigious water drinker, was drinking less. Dentures (the result of a lifelong sweet tooth and a love of sugar and cinnamon on toast as a youngster) no longer fit, so food had to be pureed. Calls became shorter. “I am just a bit tired, dear.” As her strength ebbed it was more and more difficult to transfer her between her bed and her recliner and so, confined to bed, Mom developed a bed sore, the first one in five years. As I know from many years of working with Toronto Star reporter Moira Welsh, an expert in long-term care, untreated bed sores can lead to infection and death. This one was being treated, but it was not improving because her intake of nourishment — she would drink a few sips of a protein beverage but nothing more — was so low.

Though there were no signs of respiratory distress, Mom’s oxygen levels were up and down. She was on oxygen, pumped from a mobile tank, but she found the tubes in her nostrils uncomfortable and kept pulling them out.

Two weeks after contracting the virus, Mom was deemed by public health a “resolved” case. While the ministry of health’s database suggests that she was at one point given a second test a week later, I have not yet been able to access the results. Still, her doctor told me she was deemed clear of the virus by the third week in April. When she continued to decline, the chief nurse at Earlscourt introduced me over the phone to the Palliative Performance Scale, an indicator of when a person is reaching the last stage of life. Mom was hovering around 30 per cent that third week. If she dipped down to 20 per cent or lower, the home — on lockdown due to the virus — would let family visit in full protective gear. A Catch-22 if ever I heard of one.

Let me tell you a little bit about my mother. She was a hard worker who enjoyed a cup of tea and two cookies. She was a secretary for many departments at the City of London and her favourite boss, the now retired John Winston of the economic department in the city, recently told me, “I will truly miss her kindness toward me and her dry sometimes wicked, intelligent sense of humour and perspicacious personality. Most importantly she exemplifies a goodness and a humanity that I deeply respect.” Mom wrote funny poems and stories about city and rural life (the one about her pitched battle with the mice and rabbits eating the 1,000 pine trees she planted as part of an Ontario government plan in the 1970s is hilarious) for the union newsletter at city hall. She loved reading and plays, laughed all the way through the satirical Book of Mormon, particularly the rude parts.

She was tough. Growing up, our family had very little money and most things we had to do on our own with what little we had. In our small renovation business, my dad made me reuse rusty nails by pulling them out of boards and hammering them straight. I have this image of my mother hanging wallpaper and painting late into the night on Labour Day weekend, as we prepared the small apartments we rented out to university students for the next group to arrive. And that lady could make cement. We poured our own sidewalks for these little houses we fixed up and for the rural home on 40 acres we built when cash flow, aided by Mom’s city hall salary, improved. Mom could do all of that and make an apple pie later in the day. She did not learn to drive until my father died and Mom, in her mid-50s, and living in the country, by necessity bought a green Austin Mini and enrolled in Young Drivers of Canada.

Sheila, and the Earlscourt staff, heard more than a few of those stories over the years. Mom was not a social person — her happy place was a cup of tea and an Agatha Christie mystery. Not a game player or puzzle doer, she had more to do with Earlscourt staff then residents, to a fault I used to tell her before learning to keep my mouth shut. When what turned out to be Mom’s final days arrived, and family was allowed in because she was now palliative, each one of the staff (all full-timers, an anomaly in long-term care) came in to chat.

What I learned about long-term care is the absolute importance of hiring people who care, taught to me by nurses Kani, Monique, Suni and others, and by PSWs Danielle, Tony, Cassandra, Rochelle, Taylor and Richard. (Talk about a second career, Richard was a 50-year-old forklift driver whose wife one day suggested he take PSW training because he wanted to help people.)

My mother’s end was awful and so different than my father’s death. Dad died suddenly in my arms of a massive heart attack when he was 58 and I was 21. Not so with Mom. When she slipped to 20 per cent on the palliative scale family was allowed in, wearing personal protective equipment — gloves, mask, shield and gown. She was gaunt, eyes open but unseeing. I spent full days at her bedside, reading the diary, telling her stories about the old days (like the time the ceiling in our kitchen, sagging from water blown in by a storm, fell on her head while she carried a tray to the table). Moira at the Star told me that “hearing is the last thing to go.”

There was still fight in her, and it brought to mind the poem by Dylan Thomas. “Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.” Her one good hand had an unearthly power. She would grab my gloved hand and pull and twist it, moving it from the bed, tight to her neck, rocking it back and forth. I swear she could have broken my fingers if I resisted. She said one thing over and over that sounded like “I want a bagel.” Now, my mother did not really like bagels. Was she saying “I beg of you?” I think so. Another time she said over and over, “I want to go home.”

I left on a Wednesday night, planning to return on Friday morning. Staff was sure she would live for a week in this condition. Thursday night, May 28, she was gone.

Earlscourt was declared clear of its outbreak on May 19. In total, there were 29 cases, all on the first floor where my mother lived. That included 11 staff, and 18 residents. Four resident deaths were attributed to COVID-19. My mother, who died of complications related to the virus but who was deemed clear of the virus, is not included among the four deaths.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If all goes well, his American partner will land at the Vancouver airport, successfully pass through border control and hop onto a connecting flight to Regina, where the cross-border couple will finally be reunited.

Then they’ll hunker down in seclusion for two weeks in their RV at a friend’s farm in Grenfell, Sask., where Barkey has been waiting not-so-patiently for the past two weeks.

That sounds pretty simple, but in a world complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border romances can encounter some heavy-duty road blocks.

“I just don’t want this to go wrong,” said Barkey, who hails from Barrie.

It’s been an arduous couple of weeks for Barkey, 65, and Cathy Kolsch, 60, of California.

A late-in-life love bloomed for the pair two years ago, and for the past year and a half, they’ve been travelling the world and living in their RV.

For many years, Barkey lived a regular life in Barrie as a salesperson for Purolator. When he retired, he decided to see the world, so he sold his home and his cottage and moved into his RV.

Kolsch joined him and they started a life together on wheels.

Their summers are spent in Barrie, split between their parked RV and his boat, which he docks at the Barrie Marina.

Last October, they left Barrie and headed south, parked the RV in California and then flew to Roatán, Honduras, where they met.

They spent much of the winter there and finally caught one of the last flights to California to fetch their RV on April 1.

But their trek across the continent back to Barrie came to an end in North Dakota when border officials told them they didn’t have the documents they needed to prove they are a common-law couple and refused Kolsch entry into Canada. Immediate family members are permitted into Canada under pandemic rules.

Barkey, in turn, was refused re-entry into the U.S. through the closed border as a Canadian visitor.

She was forced to turn around and go back to California, while Barker continued on to his friend’s farm.

“I’ve got her medication, I’ve got everything,” he said, explaining that all of their belongings are in the RV, which is their home.

Now, Kolsch is trying to cross the border again so they can be together. And Barkey said they’ve been diligently getting all the paperwork together prior to her Wednesday flight.

On Monday, Barkey started worrying that if they are unsuccessful this time, it could be weeks or months before they see each other again.

So, he bit the bullet, dropped $1,500 and hired an immigration lawyer to ensure they’re complying with all the rules and not missing anything. He will also have an agent on hand at the Vancouver airport if Kolsch hits a snag.

“We’ve been together for a year and a half and we both realize we were meant to be together,” he said. “We’re both retired and we want to spend our retirement travelling together.”

If all goes following the well-laid plan, the happy couple will point their mobile home east and make the trek back to Barrie in two weeks’ time.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Sidhartha Banerjeethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Sidhartha Banerjeethe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-07-06,"MONTREAL—Quebec’s health minister threatened owners of bars and other venues across the province on Monday, saying he won’t hesitate to shut them down if COVID-19 public health directives are not followed.

Describing the scenes at some establishments over the weekend as “unacceptable,” Christian Dubé told a news conference that by Thursday, he’ll release a list of actions the government will take to penalize those who he said are threatening the province’s progress in containing the coronavirus.

“Your responsibility is to ensure that public health directives are complied with,” Dubé said. “If the rules are not respected, we will close your venue.” He didn’t single out any bars or clubs, but local media published videos from some Montreal-area venues with crowded dance floors and little physical distancing.

Dubé’s warning came a day after health authorities urged people who ate at a restaurant last Tuesday on Montreal’s south shore to get tested for COVID-19. The Mile Public House noted Monday the infected patrons hadn’t yet been diagnosed and they didn’t catch the virus at the restaurant.

On Monday, Dr. Julie Loslier, a regional health director, told Radio-Canada that some of the cases at the bar were tied to a cluster of 20 cases on Montreal’s south shore.

The slight rise in infections in the Montreal area was worrisome enough for Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante, who said Monday that the city intends to make masks mandatory in all indoor public places.

“Our intention is that the wearing of face coverings will be mandatory in enclosed public places as of July 27, as is the case for public transit,” Plante wrote in a social media post.

Plante said the outbreaks could undermine the city’s efforts and could seriously hurt businesses trying to regain their footing after a prolonged closure due to the pandemic. “A setback would be a disaster for human lives and for our economy,” she said.

Dubé said the government is considering increasing the presence of police around places where people gather, such as bars and nightclubs. He added Quebec is also studying measures such as further limiting the occupancy of some venues and operating hours.

His message to owners and managers of bars, night clubs, beaches, swimming pools and racing venues was a simple one.

“Your responsibility is to ensure that public health directives are complied with,” Dubé said. “If the rules are not respected, we will close your venue.”

“Obviously this is not a step we look forward to taking, but we only need to look across the border to see what is happening in some American states,” Dubé said, regarding a marked increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in several southern parts of the U.S. that reopened bars, restaurants and beaches.

“There is no question of permitting a minority of offenders to endanger Quebec’s health and recovery.”

Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec’s director of public health, said his biggest concern is about small outbreaks around the province that could cause the number of cases to rise before the arrival of what he expects will be a second wave of infection in the fall.

“It’s clear if there are places where there are outbreaks we cannot control and there is transmission, we will have to do intervention,” Arruda said. “It could be regionally, it could be specific, or it could be a complete shutdown of this sector, which is something we’re not looking for, and why we’re asking people to respect things.”

Arruda said he didn’t regret opening bars — among the last establishments to reopen in Quebec — saying most owners have applied the rules and most patrons have respected them. But he said he isn’t above being the bad guy when it comes to closing down businesses.

“I’m telling you, if people don’t do what is supposed to be done, because it’s not only your life but the life of others (at risk), I will be a bad boy,” Arruda said.

Quebec reported three new deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, for a total of 5,577. The province also reported 74 more cases of the coronavirus, for a total of 55,937, including 25,378 cases that are considered recovered.

Hospitalizations rose slightly for the first time in more than a week to reach 377, an increase of six. Of those patients, 25 are in intensive care, one less than the prior day.

Public health authorities conducted 6,122 tests on Saturday, the last day for which numbers are available.

Read', 'Alex Mckeenvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Alex Mckeen Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Transportation', 'Labour For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-06,"VANCOUVER—In Vancouver’s historic Gastown neighbourhood, where cobblestone streets and some of the city’s oldest buildings are protected by its status as a heritage site, business owner Kim Briscoe thought she might encounter some pushback to her idea of turning the drab wooden boards temporarily shuttering her shop into a makeshift, street-facing gallery.

Instead, it started a grassroots movement that has transformed the same boards that symbolized the economic hardship brought on by COVID-19 into works of art symbolizing hope, perseverance and gratitude toward the province’s health-care heroes.

And as B.C. settles into Phase 3 of its economic recovery plan, with businesses reopening and residents getting out in the summer weather to meet one another and enjoy the city, the boards — no longer needed to protect shuttered storefronts — live on as an open-air gallery in the same neighbourhood that inspired them.

On Monday, Gastown’s Murals of Gratitude exhibition, officially organized by the Vancouver museum, was installed along the railway tracks at the very centre of the Gastown neighbourhood. As businesses reopened and boards came down, the museum curated the open-air gallery of artwork to be viewed in the neighbourhood until September.

“When I first saw the boards (for my shop windows) I realized we look like we’ve had a zombie apocalypse here in Vancouver,” Briscoe said, standing with the newly installed open-air gallery flanking the railway tracks of Vancouver’s central Waterfront Station. “But this turned out to be a good thing for everyone.”

Briscoe had boarded up her shop on a Saturday, resolved that the neighbourhood where she ran her art and framing shop for 35 years had become desolate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On a Sunday, before she even got out of bed, she had the idea that the boards could be more than just wooden slabs reminding everyone of the ongoing crisis.

They could also be canvases for local artists.

Briscoe called some artists who could paint portraits of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Canada’s public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam. The now-famous paintings became the first two of more than 35 works of art splashed across similar boards in Gastown — neighbouring businesses and artists were quick to participate in a project that eventually gained some city funding for paint.

All the murals are different in style, but espouse similar messages in substance: We will get through the pandemic, and our health-care heroes are fighting for us.

Amateur artist Jen Tsang, who lives in Gastown and works as a crime analyst by day, wanted to give the health-care workers superhero status in her piece — painting Deadpool and Wonder Woman to represent their fight against the coronavirus.

“It’s kind of like a comic book battle where I’ve made the COVID-19 disease into the super villain,” Tsang said Monday. “I wanted to make it really badass, but also really empowering and showcasing the power of our health-care heroes.”

The murals, done by more than 20 local artists, have attracted attention, including from Dr. Bonnie Henry, who was in the neighbourhood last Friday and stopped to view the portrait of her as well as the other murals.

Read', 'Kieran Leavittedmonton Bureau', 'Edmonton Bureau', 'Kieran Leavitt Is An Edmonton-Based Reporter Covering Provincial Affairs For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-06,"EDMONTON—Sitting outside the hospital, away from the rain, Victoria Steepe says she’s scared.

She came to Edmonton’s Misericordia Community Hospital for a hip surgery, and she’s been here since April because of complications.

What has her worried now, though, is something else.

The west Edmonton facility has been grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19. Three people have died and 35 patients and staff members have been affected.

On Wednesday, health officials to put the facility on virtual lockdown. The hospital, which receives about 130 emergency patients a day, in normal times, won’t be taking anymore patients as it deals with the situation.

“It would probably kill me,” Steepe, a smoker with bad lungs, says of the virus.

“I want to go home, and not just because I’ve been here for so long. I don’t feel safe.”

Behind her, hospital staff decked out in personal protective gear sit by the front door. There’s very little foot traffic and, aside from some signs posted, little indication that this hospital is staring down an outbreak.

Steepe got in an argument with hospital staff about going outside, one of the few respites she has from the stifling room she’s been confined to, where she said, the air’s stale from the hospital not recycling it.

Her son drives up to the curb sometimes and they talk from a distance. She wears a mask and even gloves, at times. Steepe, who said she was once a nurse, insisted to the hospital staff she knew how to be safe outside: “I go above and beyond the protocols.”

“I’m out here more than I am inside,” she said. “The fresh air, the chirping of the birds, you don’t get that in the hospital.”

Alberta Health Services sent out a bulletin that said, as of Wednesday, there are 20 patients who have tested positive and 15 staff members. The hospital is run by Covenant Health, one of Canada’s largest Catholic health-care providers, which works in partnership with Alberta Health Services.

About 2,700 people work at the Misericordia and the full but lifeless parking lots flanking the building are a reminder of how many people are still inside, caring for patients.

Day procedures and visits are being postponed at the Misericordia but may be rescheduled at a different hospital, officials said. Visitors may be permitted during end-of-life situations.

Two units in the hospital are set aside for patients with COVID-19.

“The full facility outbreak extends to all adult and child services including the Emergency Department,” a statement from Alberta Health Services said.

“Patients should not visit the Misericordia and should instead visit one of the other hospitals within the Edmonton Zone or call 911 if needed.”

Hospital patients are being contacted and may be cared for or sent to a different hospital, it adds. Patients already in the hospital will continue to receive care.

Mothers in labour will be moved to Grey Nuns Community Hospital to deliver.

“The safety of our patients, staff, physicians and visitors remains our number one priority,” said Dr. Owen Heisler, chief medical officer with Covenant Health.

“Covenant Health, Alberta Health Services and our teams continue to work tirelessly and collaboratively, taking every possible step to respond with compassion to this challenging situation and to ensure a safe environment for care.”

This Buffalo congressman thinks so,"['Edward Keenan', 'Edward Keenanwashington Bureau Chiefmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Edward Keenanwashington Bureau Chief', 'Washington Bureau Chief', 'Edward Keenan Is The Star S Washington Bureau Chief. He Covers U.S. Politics', 'Current Affairs. Reach Him Via Email', 'Ekeenan Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-06,"WASHINGTON—For Canadians in the U.S., it’s settling in that it could be a long time before they get to visit home. “Even among my friends and people who love me, it’s like, ‘Sorry for your loss, but we really don’t want you to come home,’” says Michelle Stafford, originally from Toronto and now living in Virginia.

Americans are hearing much the same. “The bottom line is, Canadians don’t want Americans over there,” says Rep. Brian Higgins, who represents Buffalo, NY residents in Congress.

Public opinion polls support that impression: in a Nanos survey reported Monday, 81 per cent of Canadians say the border should remain closed to non-essential travel for the foreseeable future. A Leger poll last month found a majority of Canadians think the current border restrictions should stay in place until at least the end of the year.

Though the restrictions are set to expire July 21, it’s likely they’ll be extended, as they have been each month since they were introduced in March. People I spoke to in the U.S. understand why, with American coronavirus cases rising to record levels. The Washington Post reported the Trump administration’s strategy is to hope Americans “learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day.”

But understanding it doesn’t make it easier for many Canadians, who congregate online to commiserate about being separated from fiances, children, or ailing parents. While restrictions allow Canadians to return for certain reasons, two-week quarantine requirements mean many cannot feasibly do it.

The restrictions are also felt in border towns and cities. “Forty-five per cent of people originating out of the Buffalo International Airport are from Southern Ontario. I’ve see figures that 70 per cent of weekend retail activity in Buffalo and Western New York is from Southern Ontario,” Rep. Higgins says, noting he and his friends grew up vacationing in Ontario towns such as Crystal Beach and Niagara on the Lake. “So, yeah, there’s a high, high level of frustration.”

But Higgins says he explains to his constituents that the numbers are clear that Canada has reduced the spread of the virus dramatically more than the U.S. “I think Canadian officials are concerned for the health and safety of their people. That, to me, is the only reason the border is not open.” The work of reducing the risks that would allow loosening restrictions is up to Americans, he says.

Still, Higgins and 28 other members of the U.S. Congress have issued a letter to U.S. and Canadian border authorities calling for the two countries to develop guidelines that would govern how the border might gradually reopen. “We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions,” the letter reads.

Authorities are tight-lipped about the progress of any such negotiations.

A senior U.S. administration official speaking on background responded, “We have been working with countries around the world to determine how we can safely reopen international travel while protecting the health of our citizens. We are very confident that we will figure out the best way to do this over the coming weeks.”

Katherine Cuplinskas, press secretary for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, wrote in a statement, “Our absolute priority is the health and safety of Canadians. That is why we want to be clear that decisions about Canada’s border are made by Canadians, for Canadians.” She says conversations are ongoing, while both sides agree the current border measures “have worked well in restricting non-essential travel while allowing essential crossings to continue unimpeded.”

How long those measures will remain in place is anyone’s guess. “I don’t know, and anyone who thinks they know you should be skeptical of,” Higgins says.

University of Toronto epidemiologist Colin Furness told CBC last week that he thinks the border restrictions could remain in place for another year or more.

“It could be closed longer than that,” Bill Anderson of the Cross Border Institute in Windsor says, “because of the fact that in Canada, people are very, very nervous about it.” But Anderson says the prospect of the virus persisting for years means it’s necessary for officials to start discussing ways to allow more people across the border for good economic or compassionate reasons — perhaps employing testing as a criteria for entry.

Chris Sands of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington says he thinks there’s some potential to expand existing trusted traveller programs such as Nexus to include some health information, or to introduce regional nuances into restrictions. “My view is that both governments need to start communicating about the how,” Sands says. “That doesn’t mean they have to rush to open, it just means they need to start talking to people about what it will take.”

Stafford and other Canadians in the U.S. I’ve spoken to already realize the idea of going home is basically off the table for the summer, and possibly the rest of the year.

“We have shifted gears,” Stafford says. Rather than going month-to-month following the news for any piece of information, she’s resigned to waiting. “OK, it’s gonna be a long time. That’s actually given me a little bit more peace.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A visibly frustrated Premier Stephen McNeil on Monday blasted those who have been ignoring public health guidelines upon entering Nova Scotia — after a man arriving in Halifax from the United States became the source of a COVID-19 outbreak on neighbouring Prince Edward Island.

Five people tested positive for the virus in connection with the case on the island, which had not seen an active case of coronavirus for more than two months.

The incident, which occurred before the Atlantic provinces established a travel bubble this past Friday, underscores how difficult it may be to stamp out coronavirus flareups even in a region that has made significant progress, given that success or failure can depend on the actions of so few.

New measures enacted by the Nova Scotia government will now require all travellers arriving from outside the Atlantic provinces to provide a phone number where they can be reached “24 hours a day, seven days a week,” McNeil said.

“There will be followup calls every day for 14 days. And if we can’t locate them after three tries, police will be called in to do an in-person check to make sure that that person is self-isolating where they said they would be,” he said.

“This case, along with number of reports of people from outside of the Atlantic bubble coming in and not self-isolating, has sparked a lot of questions and concerns about the Canada-U.S. border and about our own border,” McNeil told reporters.

“I am as frustrated as all of you. We have worked hard together and sacrificed so much in this province to help flatten the curve, only to have some people come into our province who think they are above it all — who think that the rules don’t apply to them. Guess what? They do.”

The man who was the source of the P.E.I. outbreak was on a student visa to study there, according to McNeil.

The man flew into Toronto from the United States, and was cleared by Canada Border Services Agency officers to board a flight for Halifax. He landed in Halifax on June 26.

He had intended to travel to P.E.I. but was refused entry to the island at Confederation Bridge because he did not have P.E.I.’s pre-screening approval, said Dr. Heather Morrison, the province’s chief public health officer.

He was required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving in the region, but did not.

The man is now being held by the federal authorities at their local quarantine facility at an airport hotel, the premier said. Public health officials in Nova Scotia are attempting contact-tracing for the traveller between the time of his arrival in Halifax on June 26 and July 4, when they were notified by P.E.I. of his connection to their cluster.

In P.E.I., public health officials first became aware of the situation Saturday, when three people in the province tested positive for the virus, the first such cases since late April. One of those cases was an essential worker in his 50s, who had been self-isolating since his return to the island. The other two cases were connected. One of those, a man in his 20s, had met with the traveller from the U.S. on June 26 in Nova Scotia, then returned to P.E.I. three days later.

Contact tracing on the latter two P.E.I. cases unearthed a further two cases on the island on Sunday. One of those new cases was a staff member at a long-term-care home in Charlottetown.

Morrison said that all residents of that home have since been tested, save one whose pre-existing medical condition made testing impossible. Residents and staff will be tested again Wednesday.

Both Morrison and Nova Scotia chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang reiterated on Monday that the P.E.I. cluster was infected before the Atlantic travel bubble was established.

On Friday, all four Atlantic provinces began to allow travel within those provinces without requiring a 14-day self-isolation. While that allowed families to reunite and East Coast residents to visit other provinces, long waits at checkpoints at P.E.I., Nova Scotia and New Brunswick borders frustrated many Atlantic Canadians over the weekend.

But Strang said Monday he still had no reservations about allowing free travel within Atlantic Canada.

“I said last week, as we opened up with the Atlantic bubble, that I was comfortable saying there was no greater risk if I travelled to another Atlantic provinces than if I travelled within Nova Scotia,” said Strang. “I’m very comfortable with that statement.”

“I know that people are concerned about COVID-19 being brought in here, from other provinces outside the Atlantic provinces, or from countries from around the world.

“Understand that that is our greatest risk. And that’s why we need to understand what is in place at the border and what we’re actively working on to strengthen those approaches.”

Read', 'Betsy Powellcourts Reporter', 'Courts Reporter', 'Alyshah Hashamcourts Reporter', 'Betsy Powell Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Crime', 'Courts For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-06,"After months of working remotely, Toronto defence lawyer Calvin Rosemond was pleased to be back in Superior Court on Monday, even if it meant making arguments wearing a mask while standing behind a Plexiglas shield.

“I’m doing everything I can to stay six feet away from everybody — keep my mask on all at all times. I haven’t taken it off at all,” Rosemond said during a recess through a black facial covering matching his lawyer robes.

“I’m fortunate, my mask seems to have pretty good audio through it.”

Ontario courtrooms began reopening Monday with a plethora of new safety protocols, including a requirement that visitors fill out COVID-19 screening cards, with optional contact tracing questions only to be used by public health officials for up to 28 days.

Inside the courtrooms, Plexiglas barriers have been installed around the judge’s dais, court clerk desks and at counsel tables — as well as around the jury boxes, though jurors are not expected to return for months.

Like many public spaces, everywhere you look there are hand sanitizer bottles and signs, directional arrows and instructions respecting COVID-19 physical distancing requirements.

Courts also have signs posted about the maximum occupants allowed per courtroom. At least on Monday, the signs were unnecessary at the Brampton courthouse, Old City Hall and 361 University Ave. court, which remained mostly deserted, save for the justice system participants and a smattering of accused.

Staff and visitors wandering the halls were all wearing masks, a day ahead of a city bylaw making them mandatory inside public spaces.

The reopening comes amid a growing backlog of trials. While bail hearings and guilty pleas were able to continue remotely after the courthouses closed in mid-March, there was no way for an accused person to have a trial — though Zoom trials are now being introduced as an option where all parties consent.

The Ontario Court of Justice had 144,041 cases pending in May compared to 116,068 than the year before, according to data from the Ministry of the Attorney General — a gap of about 28,000 cases. Not all of those cases will require trials, the majority of cases are resolved with guilty pleas or the charges are dropped before trial.

At the Superior Court of Justice, which typically hears more serious cases, there were between 819 and 900 jury trials scheduled between March 17 and Sept. 8 that are now postponed, according to the court. About 1,331 non-jury trials were set between March 17 and May 31.

In the week leading up to the reopening, unions representing lawyers and court staff called for a postponement, saying more needed to be done to make the courthouses safe, including training for court staff, clarity around how the requirement to wear a mask would be enforced, and the need for ventilation systems in the buildings to be assessed. Some locations have required additional Plexiglas to be installed.

Of the 44 courthouses slated to reopen first, only College Park court in downtown Toronto still does not meet safety standards, according to the ministry. It is unclear when that courthouse will reopen, though trials are being scheduled to start next week.

While the ministry has deemed the 1000 Finch courthouse in North York safe, the head Crown determined that the reopened courtrooms were not safe for Crown counsel due to concern about the ventilation system. A one-day trial that was set to start Monday was adjourned until later in the month as a result.

It is unclear when Crowns will return to that courthouse in person — if they do, it will be with full personal protective equipment including masks and face shields, a virtual scheduling court heard Monday morning.

The trials and preliminary hearings that began this week were scheduled before the COVID-19 closures. Courts are currently in the process of rescheduling trials that were postponed. At some courthouses, including Newmarket, it remains unclear which trials are set to proceed next week. Lawyers, accused persons and witnesses were instructed to attend court next Monday just in case a courtroom is available.

Like many of his peers, Rosemond has spent the last few months conducting bail hearings, some guilty pleas and pretrials by telephone. Those types of hearings will continue remotely.

Monday was his first day back in court, as counsel for an accused in a drug trafficking case, which — like most of the trials and preliminary hearings that began this week — was scheduled long before anyone had heard of COVID-19. The motion was held in the largest courtroom at the downtown Toronto courthouse, which is often used for jury selection. Jury trials are not expected to resume until the fall, and the ministry is considering all options including using alternative spaces like convention centres.

In addition to wearing masks — the judge removed hers after taking her seat — the lawyers were instructed to file all their legal materials electronically, to avoid potentially contaminated paper shuffling.

During this proceeding — about the validity of a search warrant — no witnesses were sworn in, negating the need for a member of court staff to hold out a Bible or Qur’an. But at a preliminary hearing in Brampton, the court took a new type of pause after the testimony of a police officer ended — the witness stand had to undergo a thorough cleaning before the hearing could continue.

What to know before going to court:

1. Masks are mandatory for the public.

2. You will be asked why you are coming to court, and asked whether you have symptoms including fever or a cough. An online screening tool can be done prior to going to court.

3. Do not attend the courthouse if you are experiencing signs or symptoms of COVID-19 or have been advised by a public health official, a physician or the Ontario Ministry of Health website to self-isolate.

4. Witnesses who have questions about an upcoming court date can contact the courthouse they are due to attend.

5. There may be delays entering, so arrive earlier than usual.

6. Cafeterias and, likely, water fountains will not be open.

Read', 'Max Martinlocal Journalism Initiative Reporter', 'London Free Press', 'Local Journalism Initiative Reporter']",2020-07-06,"Less than a week into July and crowding at beaches near London, Ont., continues to draw concerns and further restrictions from local officials.

Despite warnings that the Grand Bend beach could be closed if massive crowds — some as big as 7,000 — continue to flout social distancing rules, the lakeside town was as busy as ever this past scorching weekend.

Meanwhile, the Goderich beach enacted a “full capacity” policy, temporarily barring entry, for the first time Saturday.

Still, officials in both areas saw some improvement in behaviour and crowds this weekend.

“I think the weekend went OK,” said Lambton County Warden Bill Weber. “We’ll keep analyzing what happened this weekend, and if there was an area that needs tweaking, we’ll continue to do that.”

He said Saturday drew crowds similar to those on Canada Day, which were estimated at about 7,000 strong. Sunday wasn’t as crowded, but he noted the beach was full.

Beachgoers strolling nearly shoulder to shoulder down the Grand Bend strip remains an issue.

“There’s some separation there, but it could be better,” Weber said. “We need to not forget that COVID is still out there.”

Last weekend, more than 250 bylaw tickets were issued for drinking, smoking and not social distancing on the beach. Behaviour this weekend looked like an improvement, Weber said — an optimistic sign that the beach won’t need to be closed down.

“There are still a few bad actors; there’s still a few that may spoil it for the others that are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “We’re trusting that people will continue to be respectful in the area. As long as that continues, the beach stays open.”

Farther north on Lake Huron, Goderich officials had to temporarily halt access after the beach hit full capacity Saturday afternoon.

“Full capacity in a pandemic is a lot, lot smaller than regular capacity,” said Goderich Mayor John Grace. “Once we feel that there are significant pockets and we ought not to take too many people, then we shut it down.”

There’s no magic number that can cue shutdowns. Instead, the decision is reached through discussions between staff on the beach, the town’s operations director and the mayor, based on how crammed the beach feels.

Grace stressed it’s important for groups to be more than two metres apart, encouraging groups to maintain double that distance.

Shutdowns could last as little as 15 minutes or as long as it takes for people to disperse and room to open up. A system is in place to block foot and vehicle traffic to the beach whenever it needs to be closed off.

“It’s careful, cautious, visual observation,” Grace said. “We’d rather be safe than sorry, and that’s how we’re operating.”

While the beach wasn’t as busy Sunday, it was at capacity for about 20 minutes late in the afternoon.

The policy of shutting down the beach once it’s looking full will continue through the summer, Grace said. As decisions are made “minute by minute,” there’s currently no system in place for folks to check the status of the beach’s capacity before heading out.

But if the plan to temporarily close the beach when it reaches capacity doesn’t deter crowds, Grace was quick to say the alternative could mean no beach at all.

“We won’t take a chance. If it becomes too overwhelming, we’ll just close all the beaches,” he said. “Council will not hesitate to close all the beaches if it becomes problematic and we don’t feel our management plan is solid enough.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-06,"Toronto’s homeless advocates have relaunched a lawsuit against the city over unsafe shelter conditions.

In a notice of motion filed Friday, a coalition of public-interest groups alleges that the city has failed to follow a settlement agreement meant to ensure physical distancing standards within the shelter system.

The lawsuit, first launched earlier this year, alleges the city put people’s lives at risk amid the pandemic by not following public health distancing recommendations.

In a settlement reached in May, the city agreed to make efforts to keep two metres between shelter beds, end the use of bunk beds and make beds available for all shelter clients — including anyone who has received support since March 11, including those who left to live in tent encampments.

The settlement agreement required the city to give updates on compliance, something the advocates say has not yet happened.

“On June 15, the city told us that they had reached compliance — and we disagree,” said Jessica Orkin, a lawyer representing the motion. “So this motion is about the question of whether the city is in compliance with its obligations.”

In one case, Orkin said, a shelter reported its capacity had been reduced from 50 to 41 beds; meanwhile, the overall shelter system has seen a decrease of up to 1,000 beds. “What we can say is that there are many, many people who are unable to get beds who are entitled to those beds under the agreement,” she said.

In a statement, a spokesperson confirmed the city will be responding to the motion. “The City has complied with the agreement to use best efforts to achieve physical distancing across the shelter system and provide shelter beds to people who have been clients of the shelter system since March 11,” the statement read.

“City staff have spent numerous hours responding to communications from the applicants and have answered all questions arising from the information provided under the agreement,” it read.

The advocates say people seeking shelter space often wait on hold with the city’s central intake centre only to find out that there is no space available to them.

When space is available, clients must arrive at the shelter within two hours or risk losing the space, Orkin said, adding that there are “all sorts of circumstances that make it very challenging to get yourself and your belongings across the city to a shelter bed within two hours.”

Greg Cook, an outreach worker with Sanctuary Ministries, one of the organizations that filed the initial lawsuit, told the Star he continues to hear that those accessing shelter services are offered a bunk bed — a violation of the settlement agreement.

“A big part of why there are so many encampments in the city right now is because people just can’t get a bed,” Cook said, noting that while the city was successful in moving many people into hotels, there continues to be a lack of spaces available for those in need.

“They didn’t, in my opinion, get enough hotels (and) so weren’t able to equal the same amount of beds available in a system that was already full.”

In an affidavit filed in court, Doug Johnson Hatlem, a street pastor with Sanctuary, said it is his experience that the city’s shelter system “operates with almost no spare capacity,” while those seeking beds are often told to keep calling central intake in hopes of being directed to a space.

“Generally, there are no beds available, and the operator advises that you call back in an hour or two. Very occasionally, a bed is available,” Hatlem wrote.

According to data from the city, a total of 625 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in cases linked to shelter outbreaks. Four of those people have died.

So far, the risk to the general public is considered low by York Region Public Health.

“YRPH conducted risk assessments on the activities of these individuals while at work and determined the risk of COVID-19 transmission to the general public is low,” it said.

The health agency was first notified of the first confirmed case on June 27 and it’s “following up with the close contacts of these COVID-19 confirmed cases.”

Public Health has also “conducted a followup inspection of the facility reviewing,” and are “reinforcing infection prevention and control measures, physical distancing of employees and reaffirming the importance of employees not working while ill.”

During his video update last week, York Region medical officer of health Dr. Karim Kurji described how inspectors “have been going farm to farm” to make sure the “living conditions are fine in order to prevent any large-scale outbreaks in York Region in the farming community.”

Lopez Obrador is travelling to D.C. in part to celebrate the entry-into-force of the new North American free-trade deal and had expressed hope Trudeau would join as well.

Trudeau’s office says the prime minister will continue to work with both countries to ensure the agreement becomes a success and helps ensure North America emerges stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trudeau had been asked last week whether he’d attend the meeting, and had not mentioned either Parliament or the retreat as reasons not to go.

At the time, he did cite concerns about recent musings by Americans about tariffs on aluminum.

He also noted the extent of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the other countries.

The Associated Press reported earlier Monday that Lopez Obrador and Trudeau are expected to speak by phone ahead of the Mexican president’s trip to Washington.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-05,"Tony-nominated Broadway star Nick Cordero died in Los Angeles on Sunday at the age of 41 after a harrowing battle with COVID-19.

Cordero, who was raised in Hamilton and attended Ryerson University, had been hospitalized since April and was in an intensive care unit.

Cordero was known for his performances in “Rock of Ages,” “Waitress” and “A Bronx Tale: The Musical.” In 2014, he starred in the adaptation of the Woody Allen film, “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he also earned a Tony nomination.

His wife Amanda Kloots posted about his death on Instagram Sunday night.

“God has another angel in heaven now. My darling husband passed away this morning. He was surrounded in love by his family, singing and praying as he gently left this Earth,” she wrote.

“My heart is broken as I cannot imagine our lives without him. Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband,” she added.

Many celebrities reacted to the news on Twitter and Instagram.

American actor Mark Hamill tweeted, “Truly awful, heartbreaking news. Gone much too soon. My sympathies are with his immediate family, especially his wife and one-year-old boy. #RIPNickCordero”

Lin-Manuel Miranda, also famous for starring in Broadway musicals, tweeted: “Devastating. What a loss, what a light. Whole heart with Amanda and his family tonight.”

Here’s how some of the entertainment industry’s biggest stars are remembering Cordero:

Follow Her On Twitter""]",2020-07-06,"A Toronto woman is drawing online ridicule after a video she posted of herself refusing to wear a mask at St. Joseph’s hospital went viral.

Letitia Montana tweeted that she went with her son for a “suspected broken finger” to the emergency department at the hospital at 30 The Queensway on Saturday.

The video shows hospital staff asking her to wear a mask, which she refused to do.

“You are making me wear a mask otherwise you are going to deny me service,” she says to a staff member in the video.

The staff can be heard saying, “please wear a mask, it’s policy” in the background.

The video ends before Montana, who is identified in her Twitter bio as an insurance and investment advisor, said three security guards escorted her out.

In a statement to the Star, hospital network Unity Health Toronto said masks must be worn by everyone in St. Joseph’s Health Centre to keep patients, staff and visitors safe.

“This policy follows guidelines set out by Ontario’s Ministry of Health based on our best scientific understanding of COVID-19 and how it spreads,” the network said.

“We encourage all community members to seek care when they need it. At St. Joseph’s and any of our Unity Health Toronto sites, you will be asked questions about any COVID-19 related symptoms, to wear a mask and remember to maintain physical distancing in all parts of the hospital.”

The hospital did not directly comment on the video, which has been viewed 4.6 million times.

“I would like to thank the brave front-line heroes at St. Joseph’s Health Centre and across Ontario for putting themselves in harm’s way to care for us,” Health Minister Christine Elliott said in a statement.

“When seeking care, each of us should follow all protocols in place at hospitals to help protect front-line workers and other patients.”

The backlash to the video was swift, from celebrities to politicians.

“This is a new level of moronic and entitled,” actor George Takei tweeted.

“Proud of the healthcare workers who threw her out!,” tweeted model Chrissy Teigen.

Coun. Michael Ford (Ward 1, Etobicoke North) tweeted: Translation — “I don’t care about you or anyone else but you better care about me.”

City of Toronto chief communications officer Brad Ross replied to the video saying: “You’re doing social media all wrong, Letitia. Don’t make your name a verb. Put the camera away and don a mask inside public places, *especially* hospitals. Doing so protects others — you know, your fellow humans.”

After the backlash, Montana tweeted, “How easy it is for some of you to judge! The few times I put on a mask I could hardly breathe especially with the hot summer heat. This has lead me to do research on them & what I learned from the science is that they do compromise your health in more ways than one.”

Shortly after, she added, “I will not endanger my own life or that of my son to comply to the demands of some politicians.”

Non-medical masks and face covering will be mandatory in indoor public spaces in Toronto starting Tuesday to limit the spread the coronavirus. The requirement doesn’t apply to children under two or people who can’t wear masks for medical reasons.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
316,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/news/world/middleeast/2020/07/06/egypt-arrests-doctors-silences-critics-over-virus-outbreak.html,"Egypt arrests doctors, silences critics over virus outbreak","['The Associated Pressmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'The Associated Press']",2020-07-06,"A doctor arrested after writing an article about Egypt’s fragile health system. A pharmacist picked up from work after posting online about a shortage of protective gear. An editor taken from his home after questioning official coronavirus figures. A pregnant doctor arrested after a colleague used her phone to report a suspected coronavirus case.

As Egyptian authorities fight the swelling coronavirus outbreak, security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s handling of the health crisis.

At least 10 doctors and six journalists have been arrested since the virus hit Egypt in February, according to rights groups. Other health workers say they have been warned by administrators to keep quiet or face punishment. One foreign correspondent has fled the country, fearing arrest, and another two have been reprimanded over “professional violations.”

The coronavirus is surging in the country of 100 million, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. As of Monday, the Health Ministry recorded 76,253 infections, including 3,343 deaths — the highest death toll in the Arab world.

“Every day I go to work, I sacrifice myself and my whole family,” said a doctor in greater Cairo, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, like all doctors interviewed for this story. “Then they arrest my colleagues to send us a message. I see no light on the horizon.”

In 2013, el-Sissi, as defence minister, led the military’s removal of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, after his brief rule sparked nationwide protests. Since, el-Sissi has stamped out dissent, jailing Islamist political opponents, secular activists, journalists, even belly dancers.

Now the clampdown has extended to doctors who speak out about their working conditions.

A government press officer did not respond to requests for comment on the arrests of doctors and journalists.

In recent weeks, authorities have marshalled medical supplies to prepare for more patients. The military has set up field hospitals with 4,000 beds, scaled up testing and ordered companies to churn out face masks and other supplies.

But health workers are sounding the alarm on social media. Doctors say they are forced to purchase surgical masks with their meagre salaries. Families plead for intensive care beds.

The pandemic has pushed the Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a non-political professional group, into a new role as the sole advocate for doctors’ rights.

Last month, the union released a letter to the public prosecutor demanding the release of five doctors detained for expressing opinions about the virus response.

Another syndicate member, Mohamed el-Fawal, landed in jail last week, after demanding online that the prime minister apologize for comments that appeared to blame health workers for a spike in deaths.

Incensed doctors hit back, saying they’re undertrained, underpaid and under-resourced, struggling to save patients. So far 117 doctors, 39 nurses and 32 pharmacists have died from COVID-19, according to syndicate members’ counts. Thousands have fallen ill.

Security forces shut down a syndicate press conference that was to respond to the prime minister’s comments and discuss supply shortages, according to former leader Mona Mina.

“These doctors have no history of activism, they were arrested because they offered criticism of their very specific professional circumstances,” said Amr Magdi of Human Rights Watch, which has confirmed the arrests of eight doctors and two pharmacists. Two have been released, he said, while the rest remain in pretrial detention.

In one case, security agents burst into the home of Hany Bakr, an ophthalmologist north of Cairo, according to his lawyer and Amnesty International, over his Facebook post that criticized the government for sending aid to Italy and China while Egypt’s doctors were short of equipment.

In March, public prosecutors accused 26-year-old Alaa Shaaban Hamida of terrorism charges after she let a colleague call the government coronavirus hotline from her phone instead of first reporting the case to her managers, according to Amnesty International. Three months pregnant, she remains in pretrial detention.

Doctors in three provinces say administrators threatened to report them if they publicly expressed frustration toward authorities or failed to show up for work.

In one voice recording obtained by the Associated Press, a health deputy in a Nile Delta province can be heard saying, “Even if a doctor is dying, he must keep working … or be subjected to the most severe punishment.”

A doctor in Cairo shared WhatsApp messages with the AP from his manager, alerting staff that their attendance was monitored by state security. In two other hospitals in the capital, workers retracted letters of collective resignation over working conditions for fear of reprisals.

The suppression of criticism in Egypt is hardly unusual, analysts say, but the government has become more jittery as the pandemic tests its capabilities and economy.

With borders shut and planes idled, Egypt’s critical tourism revenue has vanished. Last week, fearing further economic fallout, the government reopened much of society and welcomed hundreds of international tourists to resorts, even as daily reported deaths exceeded 80.

“Because of Egypt’s constant attention to its image as a place open for tourism, open for business, open for investment, authorities appear particularly sensitive to divergent perspectives during the pandemic,” said Amy Hawthorne, an Egypt expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy.

At least 15 individuals have been arrested for broadcasting “false news” about the pandemic, said the UN human rights office. Four Egyptian journalists who reported on the outbreak remain in prison, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has labelled Egypt among the world’s worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China.

In March, Egypt expelled a reporter for The Guardian who cited a report disputing the official virus count. Egypt’s state information body summoned The Washington Post and New York Times correspondents over their critical coverage during the pandemic.

Despite growing human rights abuses, the international community counts on Egypt as a bulwark against regional instability, said a Middle East-focused rights advocate at the UN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss policy matters.

“There is no appetite,” the advocate said, “to address what is going on in Egypt let alone sanction them in any way for what the government is doing to their own people.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-06,"Physical distancing was impossible to maintain in often-overbooked courtrooms across Ontario on Monday, lawyers said as some provincial court proceedings resumed after shuttering for months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Toronto defence lawyer Daniel Brown, who serves as vice-president of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association, said the partial reopening was mired in confusion and chaos.

Too many matters were scheduled for the number of courtrooms available, prompting some prosecutors to suggest switching to virtual trials despite no planning or preparation for those cases to proceed remotely, Brown said.

There was also confusion surrounding the wearing of masks, he said, with only government staff such as Crown attorneys being provided with personal protective equipment, leaving other participants to bring their own.

“What we’re seeing is that many of the courtrooms that we were told had appropriate safety measures in place don’t, in fact, have those appropriate safety measures in place,” Brown said.

“So they’re coming up with Monday morning workarounds to try and address the absence of Plexiglas in important areas of the courtroom, or trying to deal with the fact that social distancing measures can’t be undertaken properly.”

Brown acknowledged the unprecedented challenges of restoring court services during a pandemic, but said it may have been more prudent to start with only a few courthouses in larger jurisdictions.

“There’s going to be growing pains with that process ... but we can’t rush the court system at the expense of the health and safety of the justice participants,” he said.

Toronto criminal defence lawyer Sherif Foda said the measures made cross-examination particularly difficult during his human trafficking case at Old City Hall.

“It’s a lot harder to get the right pace and to elicit evidence in a way that we’re used to, traditionally, in trials,” said Foda.

“It’s not particularly pleasant or conducive to litigation. It’s hard to speak, it’s hard to hear.... It’s a lot slower than we’re used to.”

Foda added that it was impossible to physically distance at counsel tables, where people had to sit within two metres of each other during court proceedings.

He said his courtroom did have Plexiglas shields, which mitigated the distancing issues.

Despite the challenges, Foda said his clients were happy with the reopening so they can start to move on with their lives.

Last week, Ontario’s Crown attorneys unsuccessfully sought to delay the return to in-person proceedings over fears related to the coronavirus.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys Association alleged the province hadn’t taken every measure to ensure workers were safe. The association said Monday it would be taking the outcome of reopening into account in its ongoing injunction application.

But a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General said the government had worked with public health experts to implement the phased reopening.

Jenessa Crognali said there were several other measures in place, including reducing the number of courthouse staff, enhancing cleaning measures, stocking personal protective equipment to distribute to courthouse staff and adding hand sanitizer stations.

“The health and safety of Ontarians and all court participants, including the judiciary, court staff, litigants and witnesses, is the Attorney General’s top priority,” said Crognali in a statement.

People trying to enter Old City Hall on Monday were also asked screening questions on Monday, and floor markers directed traffic within the courthouse.

Forty-two locations for the Superior Court of Justice and Ontario Court of Justice opened on Monday, and more courtrooms are gradually being added.

Two courthouses — College Park in Toronto and a facility in Guelph — didn’t open on Monday after officials said they didn’t have sufficient safety measures in place. The Guelph courthouse is now set to open Tuesday.

The Ministry of the Attorney General says its goal is for all courtrooms to open by November 1.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9:36 p.m.: President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil said Monday night he went to the hospital for a lung scan and would take a new test for the novel coronavirus.

He took those steps after developing symptoms, including a fever, according to a report from CNN Brasil.

Even as several of Bolsonaro’s aides have tested positive for the virus in recent months, the president has often eschewed precautions. He attended a luncheon Saturday hosted by the American ambassador in Brazil to celebrate the Fourth of July.

A photo taken during the lunch and posted on Twitter by Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo shows the president sitting next to the U.S. ambassador, Todd Chapman, giving a thumbs-up sign at a table decorated for the holiday. Neither was wearing a mask.

The president’s office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to emails from the New York Times about the president’s health.

9:30 p.m.: A hospital in Edmonton is tightening restrictions as COVID-19 cases continue to increase at the facility.

An outbreak at the Misericordia Community Hospital was first declared by Alberta’s chief medical officer of health on June 23 when six patients and two staff on one unit tested positive.

Alberta Health Services said in a news release Monday that there are now 18 patients and 14 staff members with COVID-19. Eight new cases were identified on the weekend.

“Two patients linked to this outbreak have passed away, and our sympathies are with their family members and loved ones at this difficult time,” said the release.

The health authority said the Misericordia is closed to new admissions and to transfers of surgical and medicine patients.

5:25 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Monday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting no new COVID-19 deaths since Sunday evening, by the Star’s count. It’s been 105 days since the regional health units last reported a day with no COVID deaths.

As of 5 p.m., the health units are reporting a total of 37,984 confirmed and probable cases, including 2,734 deaths, up a total of 185 cases since Sunday evening, according to the Star’s count.

The last time the units reported zero dead was March 23, back when the province had seen just six fatal cases total among a few hundred confirmed infections.

In the three and a half months since that early date, Ontario’s epidemic first grew to a frightening April-May peak that prompted a provincewide lockdown amid hundreds of deaths before the rates of infection and death began to fall nearly as sharply as they had risen.

Amid the worst of it in early May, the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day. All told, 2,728 people have died in Ontario since the last day the province saw zero deaths.

Earlier Monday, the province reported 118 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 36 in an intensive care unit, of whom 21 are on a ventilator — numbers that are themselves the lowest the province has reported since first publishing hospitalization data in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,689 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

5:14 p.m.: Toronto FC and the Vancouver Whitecaps finally left for Florida on Monday after delays related to COVID-19.

Vancouver was originally slated to depart last Wednesday, while Toronto was scheduled to take off last Friday for the MLS is Back Tournament in the Orlando area.

The Whitecaps had to delay their flight south because of a pair of inconclusive test results. That prompted more testing, which came back negative.

Toronto pushed its departure to Saturday, citing the need for more time to complete pre-travel coronavirus testing. The club had to postpone again after a member of its travelling party reported “experiencing symptoms,” requiring another round of testing.

The Montreal Impact arrived in Florida last Thursday.

5:01 p.m.: Public health officials are warning of potential fines for skirting public health orders as images from a St. John’s bar overflowing with patrons on the weekend draw criticism on social media.

Photos shared widely online Monday show dozens of people crowded outside and on the balconies of popular George Street bars The Rob Roy and Konfusion, and another shows people packed close together on a dance floor.

The provincial health department responded with a statement expressing concern about the scenes captured on the downtown bar strip known for attracting big crowds on weekends. It pointed to the potential for fines of $5,000 to $50,000 for businesss.

Bars and lounges are currently allowed to open in the province with reduced capacity, if physical distancing can be maintained.

4:46 p.m.: Physical distancing was impossible to maintain in often-overbooked courtrooms across Ontario on Monday, lawyers said as some provincial court proceedings resumed after shuttering for months because of the pandemic.

Toronto defence lawyer Daniel Brown, who serves as vice-president of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association, said the partial reopening was mired in confusion. Too many matters were scheduled for the number of courtrooms available, prompting some prosecutors to suggest switching to virtual trials despite no planning or preparation for those cases to proceed remotely, Brown said.

There was also confusion surrounding the wearing of masks, he said, with only government staff such as Crown attorneys being provided with personal protective equipment, leaving other participants to bring their own.

3:53 p.m.: (UPDATED) The City of Toronto will open multi-use fields for “team training” with a maximum of 10 people as of Tuesday. No matches or scrimmages will be allowed.

There are 700 city sports fields in 170 locations that will become accessible and available for permitting, a city press release said Monday afternoon.

The recreation amenities include fields for soccer, softball, lacrosse, baseball and cricket and other activities. Permits for outdoor sports facilities and multi-use fields will resume this week, the city said. Types of activities and the number of people allowed on the field will be restricted as a precaution.

It should be noted that the limit of 10 people per field includes “participants and coaches as well as parents and guardians, and no additional spectators are permitted.” The city also notes that scrimmages are not allowed — nor are activities likely to lead to a breach of the two-metre physical distance rule.

3:24 p.m.: New York state hospitals released more than 6,300 recovering coronavirus patients into nursing homes during the height of the pandemic under a controversial, now-scrapped policy, state officials said Monday, but they argued it was not to blame for one of the nation's highest nursing home death tolls.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration, which has taken intense criticism over the policy, instead contended the virus’s rampant spread through the state’s nursing homes was propelled by more than 20,000 infected home staffers, many of whom kept going to work unaware they had the virus.

A March 25 Health Department directive required nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients. The directive was intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But several relatives, patient advocates and nursing administrators who spoke to the AP at the time blamed the policy for helping to spread the virus among the state’s most fragile residents.

To date, more than 6,400 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in New York’s nursing home and long-term care-facilities.

2:30 p.m.: All previously announced concerts in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra’s 2020-21 season are being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the orchestra does intend to perform: just in different venues and smaller configurations.

In a news release, the TSO said it would “perform redesigned concerts and programs in communities across the GTA, including at Roy Thomson Hall, for audience and ensemble sizes that align with current health regulations.”

What that means exactly won’t be revealed until the fall, but CEO Matthew Loden said in the release that the TSO is “fiercely committed to continuing to perform for Torontonians as the pandemic situation permits.”

The orchestra is looking to evolve “in a way that reflects Toronto’s vibrancy, diversity and creativity,” he added, part of which involves performing outside its traditional venue at Roy Thomson Hall.

2:30 p.m.: The Shaw Festival has cancelled all performances and public events in the month of August due to the pandemic.

However, there’s still hope the Niagara-on-the-Lake theatre festival can return to its venues in September, according to CEO Tim Jennings, “even if in a more limited way.”

Whereas the larger Stratford Festival announced a blanket suspension of its 2020 season, the Shaw has been taking things month to month.

1:55 p.m.: Toronto’s homeless advocates have relaunched a lawsuit against the city over unsafe shelter conditions.

In a notice of motion filed Friday, a coalition of public-interest groups alleges that the city has failed to follow a settlement agreement meant to ensure physical distancing standards within the shelter system.

The lawsuit, first launched earlier this year, alleges the city put people’s lives at risk amid the pandemic by not following public health distancing recommendations.

The Star’s Jenna Moon has the full story.

1:10 p.m. (updated): Premier Doug Ford says the final two communities remaining in the first stage of Ontario's reopening plan will move ahead tomorrow.

Ford says Kingsville and Leamington, Ont., will move to Stage 2 as of 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.

He says COVID-19 outbreaks on local farms are under control and community spread of the virus is low.

The premier says he will visit the Windsor-Essex region in the coming days to thank the community for its patience.

Last week, the government dispatched Emergency Management Ontario to help co-ordinate health care and housing for more than 190 agri-food workers who have tested positive for the virus.

Most of Windsor-Essex, except for the two towns, moved to the second stage of reopening on June 25 after being held back because of the farm outbreaks.

1:06 p.m.: Prince Edward Island’s chief medical officer of health is warning that the five new cases of COVID-19 discovered over the weekend indicate the province is still susceptible to the novel coronavirus.

Dr. Heather Morrison said there were no new cases to report today, however, leaving the provincial total at 32.

Four of the five people recently infected are all in their 20s.

Three of them had come into contact with a fourth person who had travelled to Nova Scotia. The fifth case on the island is a man in his 50s who had travelled out-of-province.

Morrison says the five infected people are doing well self-isolating at home and all their contacts have so far tested negative.

1:05 p.m.: Virtual voting options are under review by the committee of MPs tasked with figuring out how to run Parliament in the COVID-19 era.

Speaker Anthony Rota told MPs today that virtual voting could be done using a special mobile app that would give MPs the option of voting from nearly anywhere.

MPs have been grappling since March with how they can fulfil their obligations when COVID-19 restrictions have largely precluded business as usual in the House of Commons.

Several compromises have been reached along the way, including a hybrid model that allows MPs to participate in person or virtually in debates or committee meetings.

But those debates and meetings have been limited in scope and the Opposition Conservatives have pressed for a full return to business.

The Liberals have said one thing that would need to be sorted out, however, is virtual voting to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission among hundreds of MPs who would otherwise pack the Commons chamber.

11:41 a.m.: Quebec is reporting three new deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, for a total of 5,577.

The province also reported today 74 more cases of the novel coronavirus, for a total of 55,937, including 25,378 cases that are considered recovered.

Hospitalizations rose slightly for the first time in more than a week to reach 377, an increase of six. Of those patients, 25 are in intensive care, one less than the prior day.

Public health authorities conducted 6,122 tests on Saturday, the last day for which numbers are available.

11:15 a.m.: Mayors from Ontario’s largest cities say the federal and provincial governments must provide emergency funding to municipalities to cover costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Large Urban Mayors’ Caucus of Ontario says upper levels of government must act now to prevent property tax increases, service cuts, and user fee hikes.

The group has been calling for several months for a least $10 billion in relief funding for municipalities across the country.

10:50 a.m. (updated): Ontario has reached an encouraging landmark with no new COVID-19 deaths reported in the province, the first time since March that that had happened.

Ontario is reporting 154 new cases of COVID-19 with 29 of the province’s local public health units reporting five or fewer cases and 18 reporting no cases at all.

Monday’s data shows there are six fewer active cases of COVID-19 in Ontario than the day before.

In Windsor-Essex, which has been a hot spot due to an outbreak among migrant farm workers, there were just four new cases.

The province completed roughly 17,303 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

10:15 a.m.: Celebrities shared their thoughts and memories after the death of Canadian actor and Broadway star Nick Cordero.

Cordero, who was raised in Hamilton and attended Ryerson University, had been hospitalized since April and was in an intensive care unit after falling ill with COVID-19.

Cordero was known for his performances in “Rock of Ages,” “Waitress” and “A Bronx Tale: The Musical.” In 2014, he starred in the adaptation of the Woody Allen film, “Bullets Over Broadway,” for which he also earned a Tony nomination.

10 a.m.: A Toronto woman is drawing online ridicule after a video she posted of herself refusing to wear a mask at St. Joseph’s hospital went viral.

Letitia Montana tweeted that she went with her son for a “suspected broken finger” to the emergency department at the hospital at 30 The Queensway on Saturday.

The video shows hospital staff asking her to wear a mask, which she refused to do.

9:47 a.m. Britain’s arts sector, largely shuttered since March because of the pandemic and warning of an imminent collapse, is being given a lifeline through what Prime Minister Boris Johnson described as a “world-leading” rescue package for cultural and heritage institutions.

The organizations will be handed about $2 billion (U.S.), the culture ministry said Sunday evening.

Johnson said in a statement that the money would “help safeguard the sector for future generations, ensuring art groups and venues across the U.K. can stay afloat and support their staff whilst their doors remain closed and curtains remain down.”

The money will go to a variety of recipients, including Britain’s “local basement” music venues and museums, he added, although he did not provide details. Museums in England were allowed to reopen Saturday, but it is unclear when theaters and music venues will be permitted to.

Although Johnson’s claim that the package is “world-leading” aligns with his tendency toward hyperbole and tub-thumping, the figure is on par with rescue packages for the arts in Europe’s largest nations.

9:32 a.m. U.S. stocks climbed as a huge rally in Chinese shares pushed a global equity benchmark toward a one-month high. The dollar fell for a fifth day and Treasuries dipped.

Automakers and insurers were among the best performers as the S&P 500 Index headed toward its fifth-straight increase. Uber Technologies Inc. jumped after the company agreed to buy Postmates Inc. in a $2.65 billion all-stock deal. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed more than 1 per cent. Copper was on the cusp of erasing this year’s losses after virus-related disruptions tightened supplies.

Global stock markets started the week in an upbeat mood after a front-page editorial in China’s Securities Times on Monday said that fostering a “healthy” bull market after the pandemic is now more important to the economy than ever. The Shanghai Composite Index posted its biggest advance since 2015, fueling bullish spirits around the world, even as investors kept a wary eye on the coronavirus infections sweeping parts of the U.S.

9:09 a.m.: Forty lobbyists with ties to President Donald Trump helped clients secure more than $10 billion (U.S.) in federal coronavirus aid, among them five former administration officials whose work potentially violates Trump’s own ethics policy, according to a report.

The lobbyists identified Monday by the watchdog group Public Citizen either worked in the Trump executive branch, served on his campaign, were part of the committee that raised money for inaugural festivities or were part of his presidential transition. Many are donors to Trump’s campaigns, and some are prolific fundraisers for his re-election.

They include Brian Ballard, who served on the transition, is the finance chair for the Republican National Committee and has bundled more than $1 million (U.S.) for Trump’s fundraising committees. He was hired in March by Laundrylux, a supplier of commercial laundry machines, after the Department of Homeland Security issued guidance that didn’t include laundromats as essential businesses that could stay open during the lockdown. A week later, the administration issued new guidance adding laundromats to the list.

Dave Urban, a Trump adviser and confidant, has collected more than $2.3 million (U.S.) in lobbying fees this year. The firm he leads, American Continental Group, represents 15 companies, including Walgreens and the parent company of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, on coronavirus issues.

Trump pledged to clamp down on Washington’s influence peddling with a “drain the swamp” campaign mantra. But during his administration, the lobbying industry has flourished, a trend that intensified once Congress passed more than $3.6 trillion (U.S.) in coronavirus stimulus.

While the money is intended as a lifeline to a nation whose economy has been upended by the pandemic, it also jump-started a familiar lobbying bonanza.

“The swamp is alive and well in Washington, D.C.,” said Mike Tanglis, one of the report’s authors. “These (lobbying) booms that these people are having, you can really attribute them to their connection to Trump.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

8:45 a.m. A businessman who has never held elected office has won the presidency of the Dominican Republic, according to results Monday, ending a 16-year run in power by a centre-left party.

Luis Rodolfo Abinader had won about 53 per cent of Sunday’s vote with most of the polling places reporting, topping Gonzalo Castillo of the Dominican Liberation Party, which has governed since 2004. Trailing far behind was three-time President Leonel Fernandez.

Castillo acknowledged “an irreversable tendency” in favour of Abinader and congratulated him, as did outgoing President Daniel Medina, who was barred by term limits from seeking a third four-year term.

The elections took place as the new coronavirus pandemic was sweeping across the Caribbean nation of some 10.5 million people. Abinader himself spent most of the past month in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 and the vote itself had been postponed from May due to the disease.

The Health Ministry on Saturday reported the highest daily count of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,241. The country has reported 794 deaths from the disease.

Voters were required to wear face masks and only one at a time was allowed into polling places, though those outside often appeared to ignore physical disancing recommendations.

Abinader, 52, is part of a family with extensive business holdings in the Dominican Republic, including hotels. While he has never held office, he finished second in the 2016 presidential election.

8:12 a.m. The Mona Lisa is back in business. Paris’ Louvre Museum, which houses the world’s most famous portrait, has reopened after a four-month coronavirus lockdown.

Just 7,000 visitors were expected on the reopening day Monday. That is a drastic plunge in numbers compared with before the pandemic, when the museum used to attract up to 50,000 visitors a day in the busiest summer months. Reservations and face masks are now required for visitors.

About 70 per cent of the giant museum, housing 30,000 works, is again accessible to visitors.

7:45 a.m. China’s tens of thousands of cinemas closed Jan. 23, months before the novel coronavirus forced similar closures around the world. They have, with limited exceptions, remained shut. The shutdown arrived just ahead of the usually lucrative Lunar New Year moviegoing season, and uncertainty over when they will reopen has complicated planning on both sides of the Pacific.

Without a clear road map, executives in China and the U.S. have looked for guidance from Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Chinese officials have offered limited financial relief to the country’s movie theaters, but an industry trade group recently projected more than two-fifths of the nation’s cinemas could shut down permanently.

The pandemic and its economic fallout appear to be leading to a plot twist for China’s film industry. In the past decade, the country has gone from an afterthought in the global entertainment industry to the world’s second-largest film market behind only North America, topping $9 billion in annual grosses. The country was on track to have 80,000 screens this year, showing a mix of Hollywood imports and domestic productions that have generated a growing share of ticket sales in recent years. Analysts at PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted 2020 was the year China’s box office would overtake the U.S.’s.

Conditions are so dire that the China Film Association, a state-backed industry guild, released a “Movie Theater Survival Status Survey Report” in late May that found 47 per cent of cinemas would run short on cash, and 42 per cent could face permanent closure. A fifth of cinemas surveyed laid off employees in the first two months of the shutdown to cut costs.

That is more dramatic than in the U.S., where there hasn’t been as thorough a study but theater executives privately expect that about 20 per cent of domestic locations could permanently close, particularly independent operations that were already struggling.

7:39 a.m.: Troops in Serbia set up an emergency 500-bed field hospital Monday, a day after neighbouring Kosovo re-imposed a nighttime curfew in four cities, as the Balkans battled to contain a surge in coronavirus infections that underscored the risks of swiftly easing lockdowns.

The makeshift hospital in a sports hall in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, is a “precautionary measure” as hospitals in the capital are reaching their capacity because of the coronavirus outbreak, the city’s deputy mayor, Goran Vesic, said. Serbian infections have returned to levels last seen at the peak of the pandemic in the Balkan country in March and April.

Serbia’s rising infections provide a chilling insight into how the virus, while retreating in much of Europe, can roar back if lockdowns are lifted too swiftly.

The country went from having some of Europe’s toughest lockdown measures to a near-complete reopening at the beginning of May. Soccer and tennis matches were played in front of packed stands, resulting in several players testing positive. Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic and other players also caught the virus following an event he organized in Serbia and the Croatian Adriatic resort of Zadar.

7:08 a.m. Thousands of South African students are returning to school Monday after nearly four months when their classes were closed to combat the spread of the new coronavirus.

Students in grades 6 and 11 are starting classes Monday, as the second stage of a phased reopening of schools. The first group of pupils, from grades 7 and 12, returned to classes last month.

Returning learners were required to produce indemnity forms signed by their parents granting them permission to resume classes.

South Africa’s government last week won a legal challenge permitting it to proceed with reopening schools. The lawsuit had said that schools should remain closed because of the danger of the disease spreading among learners and teachers.

However, in recent days the government has postponed plans for further grades to return to class amid a quickening speed in the rise of confirmed COVID-19 cases. South Africa has 196,750 cases as of Monday, more than 40 per cent of all the cases reported by Africa’s 54 countries. South Africa has recorded 3,199 deaths.

7 a.m.: The coronavirus pandemic has instilled extra unpredictability into the already fickle Paris Fashion Week. After first cancelling the July shows for menswear and Haute Couture, the French fashion federation has now organized an unprecedented schedule of digital-only events instead.

Top houses such as Chanel, Dior and Hermes are set to show their new Fall-Winter 2020/2021 couture collections or their Spring-Summer 2021 menswear collections online this week — but with no celebrity guests, no Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and none of the usual frenzied media circus.

No one from the public will be allowed to see the clothes in person at all, in fact, during this on-screen-only version of fashion week that starts Monday. Some shows will be live-streamed, and others may be pre-recorded.

The federation decided this spring that because of social distancing guidelines, Paris Fashion Week would skip in-person shows for a season, and return to normal, or, at least a new normal, in September, barring a second wave.

6:08 a.m.: Opposition parties have laid out their demands for the federal Liberal government as Ottawa prepares to update Canadians on the country’s finances after four months of COVID-19 — and where it expects the economy to head for the rest of the year.

Wednesday’s fiscal snapshot will be the first public assessment of the country’s economic and financial situation since the pandemic started in earnest in March, forcing provinces into lockdown and the Liberal government to start doling out billions in aid in lieu of a federal budget.

The snapshot is expected to give an idea of how the government sees the rest of the fiscal year playing out, including figures for a potential deficit.

But the Conservatives and NDP made clear Sunday that they want more than just numbers: they want action. That includes additions, changes and expansions to federal COVID-19 support programs along with more accountability and transparency.

6:05 a.m.: As Egyptian authorities fight the swelling coronavirus outbreak, security agencies have tried to stifle criticism about the handling of the health crisis by the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.

At least 10 doctors and six journalists have been arrested since the virus first hit Egypt in February, according to rights groups. Other health workers say they have been warned by administrators to keep quiet or face punishment. One foreign correspondent has fled the country, fearing arrest, and another two have been summoned for reprimand over “professional violations.”

Coronavirus infections are surging in the country of 100 million, threatening to overwhelm hospitals. As of Monday, the Health Ministry had recorded 76,253 infections, including 3,343 deaths — the highest death toll in the Arab world.

6 a.m.: The Philippines has seen a big recent spike in infections, raising the possibility its overcrowded capital may be placed back under a strict lockdown. The Department of Health reported 2,434 cases in recent days, the majority in metropolitan Manila, raising cases nationwide to more than 44,250, including 1,297 deaths.

6 a.m.: India has overtaken Russia to become the third worst-affected nation by the coronavirus after the country reported 24,248 new cases Monday.

India has now confirmed 697,413 cases, including 19,693 deaths. Russia has 680,283 cases. Indian authorities late Sunday withdrew a planned reopening of the famed Taj Mahal monument, after new cases were detected in the area.

India’s Culture Ministry had decided to reopen all monuments across the country on Monday after more than three months with a cap on the number of visitors and mandatory wearing of face masks.

After a strict nationwide lockdown, India has eased restrictions in most of the country except for the highest-risk areas.

6 a.m.: The hard-hit Australian state of Victoria recorded two deaths and its highest-ever daily increase in coronavirus cases on Monday as authorities prepare to close its border with New South Wales.

The death of the two men, one in his 60s and the other in his 90s, brings the national death toll from COVID-19 to 106.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said of the 127 new cases, 53 were among 3,000 people who have been confined by police to their apartments in nine public housing blocks since Saturday.

Andrews said the high number of cases reflected a daily record number of tests exceeding 24,500.

5:50 a.m.: Ontario’s courts will resume in-person proceedings today after being shuttered for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ministry of the Attorney General has said courtrooms will reopen gradually, with the goal of having all courtrooms operational by November 1.

The initial plan was to have 149 courtrooms in both the Superior Court of Justice and the Ontario Court of Justice open today for trials and preliminary inquiries in 44 locations, but on Saturday the ministry announced that two of those locations were not yet ready to reopen.

It says the College Park courthouse in Toronto and the Guelph courthouse did not have the necessary health and safety precautions in place.

Melbourne, capital of Victoria state with a population of just under 5 million, has locked down 12 areas after recording 127 cases overnight, its biggest daily increase.

Read', 'Laurie Monsebraatensocial Justice Reporter', 'Social Justice Reporter', 'Laurie Monsebraaten Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Social Justice For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-06,"Like most kids who end up in the care of children’s aid societies, Cheyanne Ratnam’s early life was filled with trauma.

At age five, she came to Canada with her family as a refugee.

When she was eight, she was sexually assaulted.

By 10, she was living with her best friend’s family for weeks at a time to escape what she describes as verbal and emotional abuse at home.

At 13, a violent outburst with her family landed her in a cell at a youth justice centre. Toronto children’s aid stepped in and moved her to a group home.

“It was the first real stability I had,” recalls Ratnam, 32. “I was shocked when they told me, at age 17, that I had to move out at 18. I had already suffered so much loss. I couldn’t believe it was happening again. I was completely unprepared.”

On June 25, the Ford government extended a pandemic-related moratorium on forcing young people like Ratnam out on their own. Until COVID-19, it was the rule — now suspended until Dec. 31 — that youth in care must move out of their foster or group home when they hit 18 and live independently, whether they are ready or not.

About 2,000 youths in extended society care (formerly known as Crown wards) turn 18 every year. The same moratorium also stops children’s aid societies from ending all financial and personal support at age 21.

Ratnam and other child advocates say the moratorium offers provincial officials time to rethink Ontario’s treatment of these vulnerable youths.

“Too many young people ‘age out’ to poverty, to homelessness. It’s a pipeline to the criminal justice system for some. And it exacerbates mental health conditions,” says Ratnam, co-founder of the non-profit Ontario Children’s Advancement Coalition (OCAC).

“We shouldn’t look at age when cutting people off support,” Ratnam says. “We should be looking at readiness indicators. And at the end of the day, the most important person to ask if they are ready is the young person.”

Ontario’s child protection system serves a monthly average of 12,060 children and youths taken from abusive or neglectful parents and placed in foster or group homes, living in the community or in other care. Fifty children’s aid societies — 12 of them are Indigenous agencies — receive $1.5 billion annually in provincial funding to care for these children and to help many more who remain with their families.

Ratnam and Wendy Hayes co-founded the OCAC in 2018 when Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government axed the independent child advocate’s office in a move that was roundly criticized.

Established in 2007, the advocate’s office helped children and youth from Ontario’s child protection system plead their case for justice, love and support through legislative hearings and numerous projects, reports, reviews and investigations.

In the spirit of continuing that advocacy, Ratnam has co-authored a letter to Todd Smith, minister of children, community and social services, and associate minister Jill Dunlop, calling on the government to create a new approach to helping youth in care transition into adulthood.

“Young people, who(m) the moratoriums exist to protect, now urge you to extend them until there is a youth-informed strategy in place to continue to protect them through the uncertainty in their lives,” says the letter by Ratnam and co-author Conner Lowes of Youth in Care Canada, a national youth-led advocacy organization.

“Other people have their parents past 18, the least we can give Ontario’s ... children (in the care of the province) is a chance to decide for themselves when they are ready,” they say. “We, the experts, recommend replacing age indicators with readiness indicators.”

Ratnam and Lowes want the government to meet with them as soon as possible “to discuss our request and how we might move forward together.”

Lowes, 19, who was forced to leave his Toronto foster home at age 18, says he was relatively lucky because he moved directly into a student residence at the University of Toronto, where he is studying philosophy and law.

“Many are still trying to find housing while still finishing high school,” he says. “Imagine the most difficult thing you’ve had to go through … and then imagine you didn’t have your parents to go through it with you. We go through this every day.”

Lowes says he hopes the government includes what he and Ratnam call “first voice advocates” — the experts — when future policy decisions are made.

“Just like any big decisions the government makes, they have experts at the table. So let’s get first voice advocates to help redesign the system,” he says.

“The reality is that after age 18, after foster kids and kids in care are kicked out, they don’t have their ‘parents’ anymore because the government isn’t supporting” the kids, Lowes says. “But everybody else gets to keep their parents.”

“The least Ontario could do is make sure their kids are ready” for this transition, he says.

If Ontario agreed to include first voice advocates, it would be “a huge step for youth in care in Ontario,” Lowes says. “And it would set a huge example for other provinces to follow.”

Nicole Bonnie, CEO of the Ontario Association of Children’s Aid Societies (OACAS), which represents 49 of the province’s 50 societies and Indigenous care agencies, says members know that “a one-size-fits-all approach does not support all young people’s chances for success.”

“We also know it disproportionately impacts youth from marginalized populations, including African Canadians, Indigenous, LGBT2SQ+ and those living with disabilities,” she says in an email to the Star.

Bonnie says the association is “supportive of those youth from care who have called on the government to extend the existing moratorium, meet with young people and develop a comprehensive and holistic protocol and policy for safe and supportive transitions out of the child welfare system.

“Meaningful change means listening and prioritizing their needs and supporting changes to the system based on what they have to say,” she adds.

A spokesperson for associate minister Dunlop says the government is aware Ontario’s child welfare system “has faced challenges for some time.”

“We are committed to listening and to finding approaches that respect the needs and identities of the children, youth, families and communities who use child welfare and residential services,” Alex Spence says in an email.

“To further, this work, the ministry would be pleased to meet with Cheyanne Ratnam and Conner Lowes to hear their proposed changes to how youth are supported when leaving care,” she says.

With everyone talking about getting used to “the new normal,” Ontario’s former child advocate Irwin Elman wants the province’s child welfare system to take this opportunity to decide what that new normal might look like for young people.

“Everybody knows what existed doesn’t work,” says Elman, who was completing his second and final five-year term as the province’s first independent child advocate when the office was scrapped.

Research shows people who grow up in the care of children’s aid societies are less likely to graduate from high school or go to university or college and more likely to experience unemployment, homelessness, poverty, mental health problems, young parenthood, poverty and the criminal justice system.

“Here’s the perfect opportunity to switch from an aging-out system to a benchmarked or outcomes-based system,” Elman says.

In most families, youth move out when they have a place to live, a stable source of income, a health card and other relevant identification, a family doctor, a dentist and mental health support, if they need it, as well as a personal network of friends and family, he notes.

“All these things should be in place before you can push a young person out of care,” he says.

Kim Snow, associate professor of child and youth care at Ryerson University, started an academic bridging program in 2005 for youth transitioning out of foster care and group homes.

Since then, the Voyager Program has enrolled 25 youths per year in grades 7 or 8 who can stay connected for as long as they want. The program has grown to more than 300 members, many between the ages of 21 and 35.

“Over the years, I have watched kids leave care and move into full-time jobs,” Snow says. “And I’ve seen kids with fetal alcohol syndrome leave without any ability to care for themselves. It’s illogical.”

“What I am hearing from young people is they are not ready, they are afraid and they end up in emergency rooms because of anxiety attacks,” she says.

Snow says the system needs to encourage more peer-to-peer mentoring and friendship development. Young people need to be “rooted” in schools, faith groups, clubs and sports. And no young person should leave the system without someone who cares deeply about them, she adds.

Snow and others say the impact of the pandemic on young adults from foster care and group homes between the ages of 21 and 35 — already struggling to make their way — has been “catastrophic.”

Some, between age 25 and 35, who have lost touch with all their support staff from their time in the system, and who were just starting their first jobs and getting on their feet, are reeling from becoming unemployed due to COVID-19, she adds.

And yet, most have few adults they can call on for support, she notes.

Many young adults are still living in their parents’ basements well into their mid-20s and early 30s, she notes.

“We took responsibility for these young people, and we need to follow through with each young person until they are on their feet,” Snow says. “Not until some date tosses them out the door, and we find them in jail or a shelter or on the street. No society can feel good about that.”

“With young people leading the charge, we are heading toward a moment of radical change that moves us away from a crisis-driven system that responds to abuse by removing kids, dislocating them and then repeating that cycle,” she says.

“Too many players are saying ... we need to revision it in another way.”

Toronto-based Free2Be, a housing-first program that grew out of WoodGreen Community Services’ social innovation hub in 2018, was designed by youth transitioning out of the child welfare system and is based on unconditional support.

“It gives youth the opportunity to test and experiment ... in a safe environment without the catastrophic consequences of rigid cut-off dates,” says program manager Erik Wexler.

“It’s a readiness-based model ... that says we’re here as long as you need us to be here,” adds Wexler, 40, who did not grow up in the child welfare system, but was homeless for about a decade during his teens and early 20s.

Unlike most other programs for youth transitioning from care, Free2Be has no strings attached. Participants don’t need to be in school, attend counselling or connect with a mentor.

“You don’t need to give something, simply to get something back,” he says. “You deserve as much as anyone else deserves … So we are here to give.”

The program offers income support, rent and transportation subsidies. Participants also have access to WoodGreen’s wide variety of services, including homework help, tutoring, child care, employment counselling and youth wellness programs.

It is open to young people between the ages of 17 and 24, but once admitted, they can stay for as long as they need support, Wexler says. The program serves about 40, but is hoping to expand with federal funding to about 50 this year.

“We need to take this work more personally,” Wexler says. “These young people are our children. If we are responsible for them, we need to do better.”

Ratnam, an independent consultant and public speaker who has taught social work at Seneca College and worked on various initiatives including youth homelessness and sexual assault, says she still suffers from the trauma of “getting kicked out” of her home at 18.

In the emotional lead-up to that milestone birthday, her grades fell, forcing her to complete another year of high school while living on her own. Ratnam subsequently dropped out of college and spent another year in turmoil until she enrolled in the social service worker program at Centennial College where she found her “calling.” She now holds a master’s degree in social work from York University.

“I would have stayed at least another year or two,” she says of her time in the group home. “I want to make sure things change for other young people. The time is now.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases rose by 212,326 in 24 hours, with the United States, Brazil and India showing the largest increases.

The previous record of 190,566 was set on June 28.

The WHO’s announcement comes as several states have paused reopening plans as cases have surged.

While Florida has approached New York’s daily case high mark, and passed 10,000 cases a day for four days in a row, Texas has warned that the state could run out of available hospital beds.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 57,718 daily new cases and 661 deaths on Saturday as the country approaches three million cases and 130,000 deaths.

Brazil, which has the second-highest number of cases, reported 37,923 new cases, with total of more than 1.5 million cases, according to the health ministry.

India reported a rise of 24,850 cases on Sunday, health officials said.

Russia and Mexico have also reported increases.

Globally, more than 11 million coronavirus cases and nearly 531,000 deaths have been recorded so far, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Over the weekend, England became one of many countries to lift lockdown restrictions when it allowed bars, restaurants and hair salons to reopen. Photos and videos of the reopenings showed people ignoring social distancing guidelines.

Is livestreaming the future of democracy?,"['Alyshah Hasham', 'Alyshah Hashamcourts Reportersun.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Alyshah Hashamcourts Reporter', 'Courts Reporter', 'Alyshah Hasham Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Crime', 'Court For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-05,"For the first time in Ontario, more than 20,000 people watched on YouTube while a judge read out his reasons for convicting an off-duty Toronto police officer of assaulting a Black teenager.

The livestream of the city council debate on whether the Toronto police budget should be cut was the most watched since the meetings began streaming on YouTube.

Deputations to city committee meetings can now be made by phone, as can deputations at a Toronto Police Services Board town hall.

The pandemic has forced the courts and municipal governments to adopt new ways of allowing public access and openness, and experts say the changes can have positive impacts in the future by breaking down barriers to participation, facilitating accountability and educating voters about the workings of public institutions. But, they stress, online participation is not a replacement for in-person access and comes with its own barriers including access to Wi-Fi, cellphones and computers that need to be overcome.

The recent record levels of public engagement have been driven by the groundswell of support for urgent changes to policing to address anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, as well as police responses to mental health crises.

This has also drawn attention to the barriers that prevent marginalized groups from being heard and consulted — from the need for child care to Black and Indigenous people feeling unsafe at courthouses, city hall or at Toronto police headquarters, to the time and expense of travelling to city hall from the most socially and economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, which are also those worst affected by COVID-19.

“It’s exciting to think about the ways in which we can allow for people to better participate in the process we’ve set up in order to make decisions,” said Brittany Andrew-Amofah, a senior policy analyst at the Broadbent Institute.

Online participation and access are essential, and “need to be seriously considered as a way to preserve our democratic systems that we’ve set in place and then strengthen them moving forward,” she said.

“An electorate that is fully knowledgeable about the decisions that are happening in our public realm … that is always a benefit to society,” Andrew-Amofah said. “It helps equip voters to know how to hold decision-makers accountable … And we know that systemic racism has been able to continue, to exist, because of how difficult and challenging it is to hold systems of power accountable.”

The city council policing debate on June 29 saw a high of 1,935 viewers at one time during the livestream — many more than the 933 for the 2016 vehicle-for-hire policy debate, according a city spokesperson. There were 9,280 unique viewers of the entire session, compared with 2,068 unique viewers of the 2018 special council meeting on the provincial government’s move to cut the size of council.

During the policing debate, Progress Toronto, a non-profit that pushes for socially progressive policies in municipal politics, hosted a watch party on Zoom attended by about 550 people, to discuss the issues and explain the often complicated process. It also provided the Twitter handles of councillors so that people could contact them directly during the debate,

“That makes it easier for them to engage (with the councillors) right there, live on the spot, so that they knew that there was scrutiny … that there was public accountability,” said Michal Hay, executive director of Progress Toronto. “We were trying to bridge the fact that people had not filled the council chamber.”

These moments of high civic engagement “deepen people’s understanding of the fact that there is a municipal government that is accountable to them” and can lead to continued participation in the future, she said.

Other municipal governments permit phone and video deputations, Hay said. One way that has been used by community advocacy groups is creating “ghost deputations,” whereby a statement is pre-recorded and played — though this means that questions can’t be asked of the speaker.

Both Andrew-Amofah and Hay stress the importance of having in-person participation when public health measures allow. Online access is a supplement, not a replacement, Andrew-Amofah said.

Meanwhile, advocates say more work needs to be done to facilitate online access for everyone, including measures like free public Wi-Fi and access to cellphones. In-person barriers could be solved by providing drop-in, on-site child care.

“Continuing to have the opportunity and the place for protest is very important,” Hay said. “There is definitely a loss when the gallery at city hall is empty.”

Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca’s decision in the case of off-duty police officer Const. Michael Theriault and his brother Christian Theriault, who were accused of beating 19-year-old Dafonte Miller, was livestreamed because the pandemic limited public gatherings, but there was still a need to maintain open courts. But a similar decision was made in 2016 by an Edmonton judge when he gave his ruling in a high-profile murder case. He decided it would improve public confidence in the justice system to have his decision heard in full.

Similar views were expressed after the Theriault decision: though the verdict was disappointing to many, the process allowed for a clear and detailed explanation of the law and how it could be applied to what happened.

“Most people’s views of the justice system and how the justice system operates are informed by what they see in fictionalized accounts on television shows and in movies,” said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a University of Toronto criminologist who researches policing and race, after the verdict. “You watch ‘Law & Order’ and in an hour a crime’s happened, they’ve found the suspects, all the interrogations and then there’s finding of guilt and perhaps a sentencing.

“Well, we just sat there for five hours while the judge read his (verdict).”

For police accountability to be effective, the community must understand and have confidence in the process, said Kate Puddister, an assistant professor at the University of Guelph who studies police oversight. “Transparency is key. My hope is this verdict, and the way it was shared with the community through livestreaming, aids in that transparency and legitimacy.”

The public livestream — which differs from the limited remote access available through the court teleconference lines and Zoom platforms — advances the principle of open courts, a crucial element of access to justice, she said.

“I hope we see more of this openness going forward, especially when dealing with cases that are so important to the community and its confidence in the justice system,” she said.

The attorney general of Ontario, Doug Downey, agreed.

“The access to justice that technology is allowing us to deploy is phenomenal,” he said of the livestreamed Theriault decision.

Downey said there will remain some areas of the justice system, such as child protection cases, that don’t allow for public access. And having trials accessible by livestream remains controversial, but more options are on the table than ever before.

“One of the biggest changes that has happened through this experience is the attitude towards technology,” he said. “Now we are seeing what is possible … and these are discussions we’ll have with the judiciary and justice partners.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jillian Kestler-D Amoursstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter']",2020-07-05,"CHARLOTTETOWN—Prince Edward Island reported two new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, bringing the weekend tally to five after the province went more than two months without a positive test.

In a news conference Sunday, the province’s chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, said the cases — both men in their 20s — were in close contact with a local man who had travelled to Nova Scotia and is also believed to have spread the virus to a worker at a seniors’ residence.

“This cluster of cases is a clear reminder that COVID-19 is still very much present in our province and we must remain vigilant,” Morrison said.

“At this point there is no evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in our province and the risk of transmission of COVID-19 within the province remains low,” she said.

The woman who tested positive for the virus worked at Whisperwood Villa, a seniors’ residence in Charlottetown, and listed nine close contacts — all of whom have tested negative for COVID-19, Morrison said.

Morrison said 140 staff members and 129 residents at Whisperwood Villa were also tested for COVID-19 on Saturday and their results all came back negative.

Four or five staff members and two residents still need to be tested, she said, and all the residents and staff members will be tested again later this week.

People who visited the residence last Tuesday also will be contacted for testing, Morrison added.

The fifth case on the Island is not believed to be related to the cluster of four cases. A man in his 50s who had travelled out-of-province was reported to have the virus on Saturday.

Before this weekend, the province’s last COVID-19 positive test came in late April.

Morrison said public health officials in P.E.I. and Nova Scotia have been in close communication to trace the COVID-19 cluster.

The P.E.I. man travelled to Nova Scotia for personal reasons on June 26 and returned to the Island on June 29, Morrison said.

He is believed to have come into contact with someone there who had travelled to the U.S., who has since tested positive for the virus and is now under quarantine in Nova Scotia, health officials in that province said.

Nova Scotia’s chief public health officer, Dr. Robert Strang, said in the email that the individual does not live in Nova Scotia, but was passing through the province on the way to P.E.I.

“As this individual is still within the 14-day isolation period required by the federal Quarantine Act, they are now being quarantined under federal authority in Nova Scotia. We will be able to provide further information as contact tracing work continues,” Strang said.

Morrison noted that the new COVID-19 cases are not related to seasonal residents of P.E.I. or to the Atlantic bubble.

As of Friday, residents of P.E.I., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador have been allowed to travel freely between the provinces without needing to self-isolate upon arrival.

Neal', 'Dndavid J. Nealmiami Heraldsun.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'David J. Nealmiami Herald', 'Miami Herald', 'David J. Nealmiami Heraldsun.']",2020-07-05,"MIAMI—It took three months, from early March to June 22, for Florida to cross 100,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases.

It took less than two weeks for the state to go from 100,000 to 200,000 cases — and the positive test rate keeps rising.

The 10,059 confirmed new coronavirus cases from Sunday’s Florida Department of Health update, the third highest single day total, behind Saturday and Thursday, shot the state’s pandemic case number to 200,111.

While there’s been an increase in testing over the last week, there’s also been a massive leap in the positive test rate. The average daily positive test rate from July 21 through Jun 27 was 9.94 per cent. The average for the next seven days: 14.47 per cent.

Another 29 deaths were reported around the state Sunday, bringing that total to 3,832.

As Broward County reset its single-day high for the second day in row, South Florida accounted for 46.3 per cent of the new cases, but slightly less than a third of the new deaths.

Throughout the pandemic, the daily case report numbers on Sundays have tended to be lower than the five days previous because fewer people work in labs and enter data on the weekends. So, Sunday reflects Saturday’s decrease in processing tests and reporting results.

Monday tends to be a reflection of a similar decrease on Sunday, but also a normal amount of data entry happening early Monday.

Hospitalizations

On Tuesday, the office of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed to the Miami Herald that the state would start reporting current hospitalization numbers for all counties some time this week.

The change comes following a surge of cases in recent weeks with public health experts and the non-profit COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer group that has become the most prolific coronavirus data collector in the country, pressuring the state to start reporting current hospitalizations. That metric, they say, is a clearer way of assessing the pandemic’s severity.

While the state hasn’t started reporting current hospitalization numbers, Miami-Dade has been and that number has risen 20 consecutive days, going from under 600 to 1,466 in that time.

On Saturday, Miami-Dade hospitalizations for COVID-19 complications hit a total of 1,466 patients, according to Miami-Dade County’s “New Normal” dashboard data. According to Saturday’s data, 174 people were discharged and 156 people were admitted.

Friday saw, for the first time, Miami-Dade’s ICU availability moving into Red Flag territory in the county’s daily coronavirus report. COVID-19 patients are taking up more than 70 per cent of available ICU beds.

Testing

Testing in Florida has seen steady growth since the COVID-19 crisis began.

Testing, like hospitalizations, helps officials determine the virus’ progress and plays a role in deciding whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders and loosen restrictions.

The recommended number of daily tests needed varies among experts, but the dean of the University of South Florida’s College of Medicine has told Gov. DeSantis that Florida needs to test about 33,000 people every day.

On Sunday, Florida’s Department of Health reported another 53,768 more people have been tested.

To date, 2,202,095 people have been tested in Florida. Of the total tested, 200,111 (about 9.1 per cent) have tested positive.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Polaris aircraft carrying about 70 military members and aircrew took off from Canadian Forces Base Trenton on July 2 after those on board had spent two weeks in quarantine at the Ontario base, Defence Department spokeswoman Jessical Lamirande said.

All military personnel deploying on overseas missions are required to undergo such quarantine measures as the Canadian Armed Forces has implemented strict measures to ensure troops do not carry COVID-19 to another country or spread the respiratory illness among their unit.

Yet despite those precautions, the plane was forced to turn around in midair after the military received word that someone at CFB Trenton who may have come in contact with the plane and passengers had tested positive for the illness.

“The health and well-being of our members and that of our allies and partners in Latvia is a priority,” Lamirande said in a statement. “As such, the decision was made to return the aircraft en route — rather than land in Latvia — to avoid the possible risk of spreading the disease.”

Those on board will now have to undergo another 14 days in isolation at the base before resuming their mission, though Lamirande played down any potential impact the delay would have on Canada’s mission in Latvia.

Canada has 540 troops in Latvia, where they form the core of a 1,500-strong multinational battlegroup established by the NATO military alliance three years ago. Similar battlegroups led by Britain, Germany and the U.S. have been established in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, respectively.

The battlegroups were created after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and began to support separatist forces in Ukraine’s eastern regions. That sparked concerns the Kremlin could launch similar efforts against the Baltics and other parts of eastern Europe.

The battlegroups are designed to defend against a Russian invasion, but their small size means they would almost certainly be overwhelmed in a real war. Instead, their main utility is to deter against Russian aggression, with the idea that an attack on one would draw in all of NATO.

The arrival of the 70 Canadian soldiers in Latvia was to mark the start of a rotation of troops, which the Armed Forces has decided will go ahead despite concerns about the pandemic.

Another group of soldiers is deploying to the Middle East as part of a similar rotation of Canada’s mission against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Lamirande said that deployment was not affected by the COVID-19 scare.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Pan Pylasthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Pan Pylasthe Associated Presssun.']",2020-07-05,"LONDON—It seems to have been more like a typical Saturday night than a drunken New Year’s Eve.

The reopening of pubs in England does not seem to have overwhelmed emergency services as many had feared ahead of the biggest easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown. But one senior police officer said Sunday it was “crystal clear” that drunk people struggled, or ignored, social distancing rules.

For the most part, people appeared to abide by the rules and rejoiced at the chance Saturday to lift a pint in the company of their mates. But in some places large crowds raised concerns that the deadliest outbreak in Europe may find fresh legs.

Chris Newell, a 33-year-old courier, travelled to trendy Shoreditch in east London to see friends.

“As long as everyone’s keeping their distance, we’re going to have a few drinks and just enjoy it and try and get back to a bit of normality,” he said.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vast majority of people did “the right thing” and abided by social distancing rules to stay at least one metre (over three feet) apart from members of another household if other safety measures were in place such as hand sanitizers.

“It was really good to see people out and about and largely, very largely social distancing,” he said on Sky News.

Police forces across the country said on the whole there were no significant issues.

“It’s vital that we don’t lose track of how far we have come and all act responsibly and play our part to minimize the spread of coronavirus,” said Bas Javid, a commander at London’s Metropolitan Police.

John Apter, chair of the Police Federation, who was on patrol in the southern England city of Southampton, said it was a busy shift, one that saw officers having to deal with naked men, “happy” drunks as well as “angry” drunks. He said the shift “managed to cope” but it was “crystal clear” that those who have imbibed one too many cannot, or won’t, socially distance.

Pubs and restaurants worked hard to get ready for the moment, spacing tables, putting some staff behind plastic counters and registering customers upon arrival. The wearing of masks is optional though, even for staff.

Rafal Liszewski, a store manager in the London district of Soho, voiced concerns about the swelling crowds on Saturday.

“Quickly everything got out of control and by 8-9 p.m. it was a proper street party with people dancing and drinking,” he said. “Barely anyone was wearing masks and nobody respected social distancing ... to be honest with that many people on one street it was physically impossible.”

Some fear the British government is being overly hasty, even reckless, in sanctioning the changes. The U.K.’s confirmed virus death toll of 44,220 is the third-highest in the world, behind the United States and Brazil. The reopening of bars and restaurants in the United States and elsewhere has been blamed for a spike in new infections.

David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the British government, criticized the latest lockdown easing. He said it looked like the strategy is to “maintain” the current level of about 3,000 new coronavirus infections per day across England in order to open up sections of the economy.

“We need to look at the fastest route out of COVID-19 and that is not the current route, and that means a better economic recovery as well,” he told Sky News.

The four nations of the U.K. — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are moving at different speeds out of the coronavirus lockdown. The restrictions in England, with a population of around 56 million, have been lifted the most, triggering concerns that Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being unduly influenced by a desire to kick-start Britain’s ailing economy.

Johnson’s office at No. 10 Downing Street, among many other places across the U.K., was lit up blue overnight to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of the formation of the country’s beloved National Health Service, which gives free health care to residents.

People across the country paid tribute to the NHS at 5 p.m. to say “Thank you” to the hundreds of thousands of staff who have worked selflessly throughout the coronavirus pandemic.

A Spitfire, the iconic Second World War fighter plane, flew over several eastern NHS hospitals, finishing over Cambridge, with the message “Thank U NHS” painted on its underside.

Read', 'Alex Moralesbloomberg', 'Alex Moralesbloombergsun.']",2020-07-05,"The head of England’s National Health Service set the U.K. government a challenge to fix the country’s social-care system within a year.

“We do not have a fair and properly resourced adult social-care system,” Simon Stevens, chief executive officer of NHS England, told the BBC on the 72nd anniversary of the founding of the service. He said he hoped the sector’s funding problems could be solved by its 73rd birthday.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC on Sunday that about 30 per cent of U.K. deaths from COVID-19 had been in care homes, a proportion he said compared favourably with other European nations. Yet the pandemic exposed weaknesses in the system, as care homes around Britain struggled to get the necessary protective equipment and outbreaks killed thousands of elderly residents.

“We must use this as a moment to resolve, once and for all, to actually properly resource and reform the way in which social care works in this country,” Stevens said.

Successive governments have grappled with how to fund adult social care as an aging population puts increased pressure on limited resources. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged in his manifesto for last December’s election to build a “cross-party consensus” on how to fund the sector.

“That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it,” Johnson’s Conservatives said in their manifesto.

Enormous problems

The opposition Labour party’s finance spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds, told the BBC on Sunday that the country had gone into the pandemic with 120,000 vacancies in the social-care sector, and that a national service to deliver the needed care could save costs elsewhere.

“We’re seeing enormous problems and these are not problems that don’t result in costs elsewhere in the system,” she said. “We know for example lots of people end up in the NHS because they’re not receiving that social care.”

The National Audit Office said last month that the situation in care homes had been exacerbated during the pandemic by the discharge from hospitals of about 25,000 patients into such homes, without them being tested for the virus.

That represented just three per cent of people discharged from hospital, and was a lower number than those discharged in the same period last year, Stevens said. “They were all because the clinicians felt that that was the medically appropriate thing to do,” he said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Sunday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

9:53 p.m.: Hamiton actor and Tony Award nominee Nick Cordero has lost his long battle with COVID and its after effects.

“God has another angel in heaven now,” his wife, Amanda Kloots, posted on Instagram on Sunday. “My darling husband passed away this morning. He was surrounded in love by his family, singing and praying as he gently left this earth.”

The 41-year-old Westdale Secondary School grad had been in the Intensive Care Ward of Cedars-Sinai Hospital for 13 weeks after acquiring the coronavirus at the end of March.

The ensuing 90-plus days were an excruciating roller coaster for him, his family and his growing legion of fans who were following every twist in the tragic story.

After a trip home to New York City to close an apartment, the Tony-nominated Broadway actor fell ill. Two tests for COVID came back negative but a third determined he had the virus. By this point, he was unconscious and on a ventilator.

9:23 p.m.: NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press on Sunday that the league and the NHL Players’ Association have agreed on protocols to resume the season.

Daly said the sides are still negotiating an extension of the collective bargaining agreement. A CBA extension is still crucial to the process, and the league’s board of governors and players’ executive committee and full membership must approve that and the return-to-play protocols.

If everything is ratified, it will end a pandemic-forced shutdown for 31 teams across North America that began in mid-March. Games would resume in late July or early August with 24 teams taking part in an expanded playoffs, finishing with the Stanley Cup being awarded in October.

The agreement was first reported by TSN. Assuming approval from owners and players, teams are expected to open training camps July 13 before travelling to two “hub” cities for games. It is widely believed that Toronto and Edmonton will be named the hub cities.

Returning for the playoffs is seen as a stirring victory for the NHL, which like other top leagues faced the prospect of losing millions more without the television revenue tied to the post-season. There were deep concerns about cancelling the rest of the season and word of positive tests didn’t help: 26 players since June 8, in addition to almost a dozen before that.

7:34 p.m.: As of 7 p.m. Sunday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,799 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,734 deaths, up 124 new cases and just a single death since Saturday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

The only fatality reported Sunday came in Toronto; the daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

The province has now seen six straight days with fewer than five reported deaths, a level that hasn’t been seen since late March in the early days of Ontario’s epidemic, when infections were low, but growing exponentially.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases reported Sunday came in a handful of health units.

Earlier Sunday, the province reported 139 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 39 in an intensive care unit, of whom 23 are on a ventilator — numbers that are all near the lowest levels in data that goes back to early April.

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

7:11 p.m.: The global number of new coronavirus cases reported on Saturday was highest on record, according to the World Health Organization.

Cases rose by 212,326 in 24 hours, with the United States, Brazil and India showing the largest increases.

The previous record of 190,566 was set on June 28.

The WHO's announcement comes as several U.S. states have paused reopening plans as cases have surged. Texas has warned that the state could run out of available hospital beds.

5:13 p.m.: A military plane carrying Canadian troops to Latvia was forced to turn around and return home because of concerns those on board might have been exposed to COVID-19.

The Polaris aircraft carrying about 70 military members and aircrew took off from Canadian Forces Base Trenton on July 2 after those on board had spent two weeks in quarantine at the Ontario base, Defence Department spokeswoman Jessical Lamirande said.

Canada has 540 troops in Latvia, where they form the core of a 1,500-strong multinational battlegroup established by the NATO military alliance three years ago. Similar battlegroups led by Britain, Germany and the U.S. have been established in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, respectively.

4:10 p.m.: Leaders in two of Texas’ biggest cities are calling on the governor to empower local governments to order residents to stay home as the state’s continued surge in confirmed cases of the coronavirus tests hospital capacity.

Austin Mayor Steve Adler, a Democrat, told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that he wants Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott to return control to local governments. He says hospitals are facing a crisis and that ICUs could be overrun in 10 days.

In the Houston area, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who is also a Democrat, says a stay-at-home order is needed.

Texas reported its highest daily increase in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases Saturday with 8,258.

3:12 p.m.: Two Americans have been charged for violating the Federal Quarantine Act.

On June 24, a 66-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman from Minnesota entered Canada at the border connecting International Falls, Minn., and Fort Frances, Ont.

Canada Border Services Agency told the man and woman to drive directly to their destination and quarantine for 14 days, but Ontario Provincial Police say they were observed making stops in Fort Frances.

Police say they are charged with failure to comply with an order prohibiting the entry into Canada and face a fine of $1,000.

2:46 p.m.: For the first time ever, Lebanon on Sunday hosted its annual music festival in the ancient northeastern city of Baalbek without an audience, a move organizers dubbed “an act of cultural resilience” to the global coronavirus pandemic as well as the country’s unprecedented economic crisis.

Held amid soaring Roman columns, the Baalbek International Festival was founded in 1956. This year, it’s being broadcast on local and regional TV stations and live-streamed on social media in an effort to spread “unity and hope.”

“We could not have an audience, since it is impossible to bring 2,000-3,000 people to Baalbek amid the coronavirus precautions, so we decided to bring Baalbek into people’s homes,” Nayla de Freige, the festival’s president, told the local LBC TV station.

The festival’s website said this year’s program, entitled “Sound of Resilience,” was “one of the first big cultural events and a premiere in the Middle East after the confinement due to COVID-19.”

The dramatic setting — a massive Roman forum — was always part of the festival’s magic. Sunday’s concert was held at the Bacchus Temple, which stands in front of six columns that remain from the Temple of Jupiter. The ruins date back to the second and third centuries.

Lebanon is currently being shaken by a severe economic and financial crisis, made worse in recent months by the coronavirus and lockdown restrictions. The financial crisis is rooted in decades of systematic corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s ruling elite, who critics say refuse to reform despite a nationwide uprising that erupted last October and a rapidly deteriorating economy.

1:55 p.m.: Quebec is reporting eight additional deaths due to COVID-19.

The province now has reported 5,574 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, but only one of those reported today is considered a new death.

Authorities say the other seven newly reported deaths occurred before June 27.

The province also reported 79 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 55,863.

On Saturday, the province had crept up over 100 daily cases for the first time since June 20. The number of hospitalizations and intensive-care cases decreased slightly for a total of 371 and 26 patients, respectively.

1:33 p.m.: As residents gather during hot weather, the City of Toronto is reminding everyone that alcohol consumption is not permitted in parks, beaches or public spaces. Fines are $300 as part of enforcement in beaches and parks.

The city says it received 69 complaints related to parks and issued three tickets on Saturday but these weren’t related to alcohol.

Since July 1, the city has “provided education to nearly 1,900 individuals which includes education on alcohol laws and other orders.”

“While visiting a beach or park, residents must practise physical distancing and avoid crowding,” a spokesperson said. “Provincial orders restricting gatherings of more than 10 people who are not members of the same household remain in effect.”

1:05 p.m.: The numbers in Florida get bigger and bigger.

It took three months, from early March to June 22, for Florida to cross 100,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. It took less than two weeks for the state to go from 100,000 to 200,000 cases — and the positive test rate keeps rising.

The 10,059 confirmed new novel coronavirus cases from Sunday’s Florida Department of Health update, the third highest single-day total, behind Saturday and Thursday, shot the state’s pandemic case number to 200,111.

While there’s been an increase in testing over the last week, there’s also been a massive leap in the positive test rate. The average daily positive test rate from July 21 through Jun 27 was 9.94 per cent. The average for the next seven days: 14.47 per cent.

Another 29 deaths were reported around the state Sunday, bringing that total to 3,832.

1:02 p.m.: U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has been better than expected so far, and it won’t be necessary to extend an emergency unemployment program that ends this month.

“We are doing well, we do need to be careful about the virus but I am just optimistic,” Scalia said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “It’s really important to again remember how much better than projected we’ve done so far.”

“Spending, retail spending, consumer spending generally, new home starts, all of these have been actually very encouraging economic indicators over the last about six weeks or so,” Scalia said.

As lawmakers prepare to resume talks about another round of stimulus later this month, President Donald Trump’s calls for tax relief —including a potential payroll tax cut —could be “an important part” of bringing more people back to work, said Scalia, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.

But the $600 weekly unemployment benefit established as part of the first round of stimulus shouldn’t be part of the next package, Scalia said.

“As we reopen the economy I don’t know that we need a benefit like that,” Scalia said. There will likely be a “lot of discussions toward the end of the month” between the White House and lawmakers about the next round of stimulus measures, he said.

12:07 p.m.: Prince Edward Island is reporting two new cases of COVID-19 linked to a positive case that was reported Saturday.

The province’s chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, says the two new cases had contact with a P.E.I. man in his 20s who had travelled to Nova Scotia. That man had interacted with someone who had been in the United States and was asymptomatic when he returned to the province on Monday.

Morrison says the two new cases are men in their 20s. She says the risk of community spread remains low.

P.E.I. reported three new cases of COVID-19 Saturday for the first time in more than two months.

11:02 a.m.: Iran on Sunday instituted mandatory mask-wearing as fears mount over newly spiking reported deaths from the coronavirus, even as its public increasingly shrugs off the danger of the COVID-19 illness it causes.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicized an image of himself in a mask in recent days, urging both public officials and the Islamic Republic’s 80 million people to wear them to stop the virus’s spread.

But public opinion polling and a walk through any of the streets of Tehran show the widespread apathy felt over a pandemic that saw Iran in February among the first countries struck after China.

On June 30, Iran saw its highest single-day reported death toll of the pandemic with 162 killed.

The new rules require those in Tehran’s subway, riding buses or indoors to wear them. The government said those seeking “public services” also will be required to wear a mask.

10:49 a.m.: New York City is preparing for Phase 3 of the reopening process Monday, but without indoor dining.

The city, which suffered terribly in the spring from the virus., will allow nail salons, tattoo and massage parlours to reopen at 50 per cent capacity, ABC reports.

New York state was seeing almost 800 deaths a day at the virus’s peak but recent numbers have been in the single digits or low double digits.

9:52 a.m.: The U.K. government says selected sports stars are to be exempt from quarantine requirements when competing in England.

However, those involved will instead live and work in “bubbled” environments behind closed doors, U.K. culture secretary Oliver Dowden announced on Sunday.

The new measures will allow Formula One, international soccer, golf and snooker events to take place. Competitors involved in these events will be granted quarantine exemptions.

9:09 a.m.:The hard-hit Australian state of Victoria has recorded 74 new coronavirus cases after announcing a record 108 new infections on Saturday.

The Saturday increase resulted in state Premier Daniel Andrews announcing a lockdown of nine Melbourne inner-city public housing blocks containing 3,000 people, where 27 cases have been detected.

Police are guarding every entrance of the housing estates and residents are not allowed to leave their homes for any reason.

Andrews said the residents will have their rent waived for the next two weeks and will receive one-off hardship payments of between about $750 and $1,500 (Canadian). The government said it would arrange the delivery of food and medical supplies to all homes.

Australia had for months been largely successful in keeping the virus at bay.

7:45 a.m.: Israel ordered thousands of people into quarantine after a contentious phone surveillance program resumed while Palestinians in the West Bank returned to life under lockdown amid a surge in coronavirus cases in both areas.

A statement Sunday from Israel’s Health Ministry said “many” messages had been sent to Israelis following the renewed involvement of the Shin Bet domestic security agency. The Israeli daily Haaretz reported that more than 30,000 people were notified they must enter quarantine since Thursday.

After imposing strict measures early on during a first wave of infections, Israel and the Palestinian territories appeared to have contained their outbreaks, with each reporting only a few dozen new cases a day in May. But an easing of restrictions led to a steady uptick in cases over the past month.

“We are in a state of emergency,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, adding that Israel would need to further clamp down to rein in the virus.

Israel is now reporting around 1,000 new cases a day, higher than its peak during the previous wave and it is set to reimpose restrictions in response, limiting occupancy in bars, places of worship and event spaces to 50 people. It is requiring citizens wear masks and has urged more stringent social distancing.

6:11 a.m.: The national immunity task force has started testing thousands of blood samples for COVID-19 antibodies and should be able to produce a more detailed picture of how many Canadians have been infected with the novel coronavirus within a couple of weeks.

It will be much longer, however, before we know more about what kind of protection against future infection having the antibodies provides, said Dr. Timothy Evans, executive director of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.

Plus, said Evans, most of the people whose blood is being tested will not be informed of the results because of how the blood is being collected for testing.

“There won’t be an opportunity for individuals to find out their status,” said Evans, who is also director of the McGill School of Population and Global Health.

At least 105,000 Canadians have tested positive for COVID-19 since the coronavirus was identified in January, while many others were sick but couldn’t get tested because provinces were limiting who could access the procedure until just a few weeks ago.

Evans also said a significant number of people get the infection and show no symptoms and will have no clue they were ever sick. Evans said immunity testing in other countries has suggested the actual infection rate is 10 to 20 times more than the number of confirmed cases.

Saturday 8:32 p.m.: Mexico topped 30,000 COVID-19 deaths Saturday, overtaking France as the country with the fifth-highest death toll since the coronavirus outbreak began.

Officials reported 523 more confirmed coronavirus deaths for the day, bringing the nation’s total to 30,366 for the pandemic. Mexico’s total confirmed infections rose by almost 6,000 to 251,165, about on par with Spain, the eighth highest caseload.

Also Saturday, about 200 street vendors briefly blocked several major avenues in downtown Mexico City on Saturday to demand they be allowed to sell again amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Saturday 6:47 p.m.: Officials across the U.S. pleaded with Americans to curb their enthusiasm for large Fourth of July crowds Saturday even as President Donald Trump enticed the masses with a “special evening” of tribute and fireworks staged with new U.S. coronavirus infections on the rise.

People wandered the National Mall in baking heat and took shade under the scattered trees while, not far away, music wafted from a party on the White House South Lawn. To come: the “Salute for America” celebration with Trump’s speech from the White House grounds, a military air show and a more ambitious fireworks display than has been seen in years.

The crowds on the Mall were strikingly thinner than the one gathered for last year’s jammed celebration on the National Mall. Many who showed up wore masks.

At the White House, several hundred invited guests assembled on the sweeping South Lawn, gathering around tables decorated with flowers and small U.S. flags as a military rock band played. Most guests were unmasked.

Trump’s guests were doctors, nurses, law enforcement officers and military members as well as officials from the administration, said Judd Deere, deputy White House press secretary. He said the event was a tribute to the “tremendous courage and spirit” of front-line workers and the public in the pandemic.

Saturday 5:30 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Saturday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,675 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,733 deaths, up a total of 117 new cases since Friday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases were reported in a handful of health units. Only Windsor-Essex (35 new cases), Peel Region (25 cases), York Region (21 cases) and Toronto (20 cases) reported increases in the double digits. The 20 cases in Toronto were the fewest in any day since March 26.

Meanwhile, just two more fatal cases were reported — both in Toronto. The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported 150 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 39 in an intensive care unit, of whom 26 are on a ventilator — numbers that are all near the lowest levels in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,687 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Mia Rabsonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Mia Rabsonthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-07-05,"OTTAWA—The national immunity task force has started testing thousands of blood samples for COVID-19 antibodies and should be able to produce a more detailed picture of how many Canadians have been infected with the novel coronavirus within a couple of weeks.

It will be much longer, however, before we know more about what kind of protection against future infection having the antibodies provides, said Dr. Timothy Evans, executive director of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.

Evans also said a significant number of people get the infection and show no symptoms and will have no clue they were ever sick. Evans said immunity testing in other countries has suggested the actual infection rate is 10 to 20 times more than the number of confirmed cases.

There are multiple prongs to the task force’s plan to figure out the true infection rate here, starting with running antibody tests on 40,000 samples collected from people who donated blood to Canadian Blood Services and Hema Quebec since May. Evans said about 1,600 of those samples are being run through the test kits every day now, and analyses are already under way on the results.

“Hopefully within the next two weeks we will have an initial first number,” he said.

The first results will reveal how many samples showed antibodies, but include no specifics like whether they are male or female or where they live.

“By the end of the month of July, we expect to have a more broken down picture of what we call the seroprevalence, the presence of antibodies in the blood, that will look at it by age group and geographic location,” Evans said.

Evans said Canadian Blood Services can’t trace back the samples to the actual patients who gave them, so positive antibody tests will not be reported back for anyone who donated blood outside of Quebec. He said Hema Quebec said it might be possible to identify the patients but hasn’t yet decided if it will do so.

Another testing program is now beginning on 25,000 blood samples taken from pregnant women, using blood routinely drawn during the first trimester to screen for sexually transmitted infections and check for immunity to other illnesses like rubella. COVID-19 antibody testing will be added to that list for all pregnant women in Canada, going back all the way to December. The women will be informed if they test positive for COVID-19 antibodies, said Evans.

Evans said there are also about 30,000 blood samples held in provincial labs that are being tested for antibodies.

He said together these projects can provide a piecemeal picture of the infection rate across the country, though it won’t be a truly representative sample until a national household survey can be run. That isn’t going to happen until the portable antibody tests become reliable, but a plan is being developed with Statistics Canada so it’s ready when the tests are.

“We’d love to have a test that didn’t require a formal blood draw, but rather a pin prick but we’re not quite there yet,” he said. “There’s some things on the horizon. We’re trying to get those validated quickly but we still haven’t got what I would call a good portable test that could be used in the home.”

The tests the task force is using now require only a small amount of blood — less than 1/20th of a teaspoon, generally — but it is still more than what comes from a finger prick.

Evans said understanding how many people got infected can help drive policy decisions about where to vaccinate first, the impact specific public health measures might have had in some settings like long-term care centres, hospitals and schools, or communities that have been hit particularly hard.

The task force also has a two-year mandate to try to look at what kind of protection someone has from having antibodies, as well as how long the levels of antibodies last in a person’s blood. Evans said those studies are just getting underway and will take time, including looking to see whether people who have the antibodies get infected during a second or third wave of the pandemic.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-05,"When the Museum of Vancouver closed in March, the acquisitions team was already thinking deep into the future, strategizing how they’d preserve this pandemic moment in time.

Museum people tend to see the world a little differently. Take last year, when the city of Vancouver approved a ban on plastic straws. The museum’s acquisitions team made sure to snag a couple for the permanent collection, so the citizens of the future can see what they looked like in person.

During the pandemic, they have had to be nimble to save items from the dumpster of history.

As the lockdown in British Columbia eased and businesses started to reopen, many of the murals that had been painted on the boarded-up storefronts were being tossed away, said museum spokesperson Lorenzo Schober. The museum worked with a local business improvement association to help curate an outdoor art show, and it plans to keep a few of the murals for its permanent collection.

It also acquired a pair of John Fluevog shoes made in honour of B.C.’s provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry. They plan to collect COVID-19 signage when it is no longer needed.

Across the country, museums and arts professionals are collecting materials and planning for future acquisitions that reflect people’s experiences with COVID-19.

Months of lockdowns have made people across the country “desperate to reconnect,” and the possibility of using art to create conversations can be healing, said Ulrike Al-Khamis, director of collections and public programs at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto.

“People have been turning to art to overcome isolation, to stay sane and healthy,” said Al-Khamis, who also teaches in the department of art history at University of Toronto.

The museum management knew the importance of “reacting in the moment” so it reached out to the public for submissions of art depicting things that have provided a sense of comfort, stability and hope. The museum will add these submissions to their pre-existing “Sanctuary” exhibition and plans to work with a renowned Pakistani artist to create a special project with these items in the future.

Guelph Museums sent out a similar call for artwork and objects that would help tell the story of Guelph during COVID-19.

Usually, they collect items years after an event occurs, so this was a new approach, manager Tammy Adkin said in an email. More than 50 people have submitted artwork, items and suggestions, including locally created masks, face shields, hand sanitizer, photographs of through-the-window visits at long-term-care homes, photographs of signs supporting front-line workers, written reflections from students, and painted rocks planted in front of a local hospital with messages of love and support.

“I’ve been so touched by the very personal stories people have shared about how their lives have been impacted — separation from elderly parents, struggles with home-schooling, and inspiration to rally as a community,” Adkin wrote. “What is essential is that we recognize this pandemic is affecting different people in different ways, and we need to ensure that we are representing the entire story of the impacts.”

Irina Mihalache, the director of the Master of Museum Studies program at the University of Toronto’s faculty of information, agrees that future exhibits on the pandemic should reflect the social inequalities revealed by the virus, because the pandemic and the protest movement surrounding anti-Black racism are intertwined, she said. From what she has seen, museums seem to be taking that direction.

“Hopefully, 10 years from now,” she said, an exhibit will show “how things have changed based on those realizations. That’s my hope that I have for museums.”

In the early days of lockdown, the Glenbow Museum in Calgary asked people to send letters and emails about their lives in this moment. They launched “Dear Glenbow” with a few prompts — What brings you joy right now? What is your daily life like? What are you worried about? Have you learned anything new? What should our descendants learn about this time in our lives?

A couple of people have written about Black Lives Matter. “It’s been a pretty intense period all around,” said museum spokesperson Jenny Conway Fisher. “I’m really happy this is a potential outlet and a way for people to share how they’re feeling.”

Everyone is experiencing the pandemic differently, she said, depending on factors like privilege and geography.

“It’s important to capture that variety of experience because it isn’t one thing,” she said. “There are so many cascading impacts, economic and social and personal — but in order to get a sense of it, you need those individual stories.”

So far, they’ve received about 250 letters, 460 emails and 20 social media posts. In a time when people have felt helpless and uncertain, the project has given focus — “I'm going to tell my story, and it's going to mean something,” she said.

A boy who developed a 3D-printed ear protector for masks sent one with a letter. Children wrote about how surprised they were to miss school; how happy they were to spend more time with family. Some people have written about difficulties at work, loved ones who died of COVID-19, and the pain of family separation.

They are collecting letters until the end of July. (Torontonians are welcome to write, she said: “The thread is only made richer if we witness other people’s experiences across the country.”) The collection will be used later as a resource, and eventually, as an exhibit, pending permission requests.

In April, the Museum of Vancouver launched a similar outreach campaign encouraging citizens to document lockdown life by tagging their social media posts with #isolatingtogethermov. They’ve had hundreds of digital submissions that live on their website.

Traditionally, museums have collected items many years after an event — and often receive donations from families when a loved one dies. One risk in asking for submissions in the moment is the potential performative element.

People “might not necessarily be genuine or authentic in what they collect because they're thinking, ‘Oh the museum is collecting from me I have to send them the best representation of my COVID behaviour,” Mihalache said.

Curators at the ROM have already started collecting artisan-made and sustainably produced facemasks for the museum’s textile collection.

Swarupa Anila, the senior vice-president for exhibition and gallery development at the ROM, believes that one of the themes artists will explore are the intersections of racial and economic disparity through the lens of the pandemic.

“I think artists have often shown us what has been and needs to be broken, to see solutions differently,” she wrote in an email.

When it comes to physical artifacts, Mihalache can all but guarantee that the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Fashion Institute of Technology will have a mask exhibit. Masks are already being collected heavily as a focal point of this moment: a tool, a point of protest, a fashion statement.

As she reflects on the many items and narratives that will likely be collected, Mihalache said it’s important that specific voices are given space in exhibits, like grocery store workers. And when museums collect, they need to remember the needs of the community over their own.

“You have to ask what is the need? Why am I bothering this community,” she said. “Is the collecting going to be a support to them, or is it going to be a form of exploiting them to make the museum look better?”

Museums have to be accountable to people about what they are going to do with these stories, and they should approach any collecting in a spirit of solidarity, she said.

“You’re collecting fragile objects or memories from people who might be experiencing trauma, from people who maybe have lost people during these times, and you’re also collecting funny videos from people who are doing yoga with their cat or dog.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We do so on the front lines providing health care, keeping our food safe, educating our children or making sure that government cheques are written and delivered in a timely fashion. And we do so as generous “care-mongers” accompanying a child with a disability into the hospital to assist with her medical needs, stepping in to support overworked staff at long-term-care homes where an outbreak has occurred, sewing and distributing masks for those who are homeless, making sure an elderly neighbour gets groceries and is socially connected, and taking care of all matters great and small on the home and neighbourhood front.

This rich mixture of paid care and natural caring is getting us through the pandemic. It proves that social resilience is a balance of naturally supportive relationships and professional supports. Too much intervention undermines natural caring and increases dependency. Too little and individuals, families and communities are left on their own to deal with economic realities and changing life circumstances that are not their fault and beyond their control.

Getting that balance right after the pandemic will help us reweave our social safety net. Its flaws have been exacerbated by the pandemic especially for people with disabilities, seniors, those who experience systemic racism or mental illness and who are poor, homeless or in an abusive relationship.

Promising responses from governments could lead people to conclude that reforms like Basic Income and cleaning up long-term-care facilities are just around the corner.

Saying it is so doesn’t make it so.

How can we make sure this opportunity for real change doesn’t slip through our fingers?

Here are five ways civil society can preserve the best of the social innovations that have emerged during the pandemic and build a supportive apparatus around them.

Unify within and across movements

A unified, transparent and democratic movement of grassroots organizations, non-profits, coalitions, individuals and allies working in harmony enhances the power, authenticity and influence of civil society. Creating this network of networks is easier said than done.

Many non-profits have lost touch with the people they serve. Or they see their role as service provider rather than a core participant in civic discourse. Bridges have been burned. Ego, territoriality and competition for scarce resources create mistrust. Differing views on strategy can lead to misunderstanding, animosity and resentment. And the time devoted to strengthening community cohesion and consensus can tempt some to make haste and go it alone.

In my experience, every hour of strategy, advocacy and policy must be matched by five hours of attention to group dynamics. Since there aren’t any admission criteria to belong to a movement, we will have to work with people we don’t like, don’t know and don’t trust, and who we think aren’t pulling their weight or are part of the problem.

That’s why the connectors, peacemakers and bridge builders in our midst are as important as the strategists and analysts.

Privilege the imagination

The discipline of imagination is key to monumental versus incremental reform. Designing social policy without an imaginative sense of your destination means your best efforts will land you toward the front of the status quo, but not ahead of it. Imagination helps you transcend the limits of what seems naturally possible and morally acceptable.

The imaginative question isn’t “what needs to be changed about our existing social safety net,” but: “what kind of caring society do we want?”

A focus on the imagination helps you assemble possible futures and proven innovations into a cohesive whole. It encourages you to incorporate the diverse ideas of people who were previously treated as helpless clients and ensures that solutions start with those who are most at risk, most marginalized and who face multiple social barriers.

Science, medicine, technology, the arts and other fields leap wildly over the status quo by privileging the power of imagination. Civil society needs a similar combination of design thinking, scenario planning, dedicated funds, voices from the trenches, and social innovation labs to leap over the existing social care system and move the dial on justice, equity, inclusion and accessibility in Canada.

Engage with popular culture

Tommy Douglas, an early champion of universal health care in Canada, understood that popular support precedes political boldness. He observed that the job of a leader is to engage with the public so that when the change arrives, they ask, “what took you so long?”

Such preparation should not be a manipulative attempt to shift people’s views or to push a particular solution or program but a genuine effort to understand the daily challenges people experience, the language they use to describe them and the solutions that will help.

Team up with the artists in our midst. The inescapable truth of making the world a better place is that we must touch hearts as well as minds.

Artists make feelings, hunches, fears, dreams and desires visible. They use their art to bridge the silos that divide us. They tell stories that matter to us. They bring beauty and joy into the conversation and create phrases, symbols and images that appeal to most people. That’s why troubadours are as important as specialists.

Support community problem-solving. Our ingenuity in the face of adversity defines us as a species. “Ordinary people” are constantly inventing themselves out of their predicaments. The majority of social care advances that we now take for granted originated with these “passionate ordinaries” — people motivated by necessity and inspired by love because someone or something they care about is vulnerable, under siege or in trouble.

Make sense of where politics is going

Hockey fans know the importance of skating to where the puck is going. Similarly, it’s important to pay attention to the changing and evolving path of politics — not the large-P politics of partisan instincts, rather the small-p politics of citizens making concrete their ethical commitment to each other.

That commitment includes the personal measures individuals take to protect the health and safety of fellow citizens and their collective outrage when our social care institutions fail to do so.

Despite their imperfections, social institutions play a critical role in redistributing resources and making society more just and equitable. We now need to address their flaws and rewrite the social contract between civil society and government. This requires a politics that has people engaged, in between trips to the voting booth, that turns away from desperation and cynicism, and that enables people to shape policies that affect their lives. That means taking advantage of fair and inclusive consultation processes such as e-democracy, civic lotteries and citizen reference panels.

Analyze the learning curve

The corona curve may be flattening but the learning curve is spiking. Fresh insights about the way the world could work are emerging.

It would have been unimaginable six months ago for a recently laid-off young mother to fill out an electronic form and receive income replacement (CERB) in her bank account a few days later. A new balance in favour of state intervention versus the role of the market has materialized. The social hierarchy is inverted as our collective vulnerability becomes a fact, not an assertion. We now realize how dependent we are on front-line people and caring citizens to be safe and healthy.

Disaster response specialists advise that we base our recovery recommendations around those we relied upon during COVID. They suggest we make note of newfound leaders, champions and accomplices, including the strange bedfellows who have risen to the occasion; former allies who sat on their hands; managers who resisted change or tried to manage the unmanageable; celebrities and businesses whose interventions were genuine and not self-serving; and the new ways that non-profit organizations are merging and co-operating.

It’s particularly important to chronicle the myriad examples of natural caring that happen every day, everywhere, by just about everyone to ensure they never become invisible again.

Government will continue to exercise its power after the pandemic. Civil society, including its philanthropic supporters, must do so, too. Emergencies remind us that people are caring, generous and selfless.

It’s time to erase the free-market snare that individuals are solely responsible for their successes and failures. The pandemic has revealed that a caring society is a do-it-together, not a do-it yourself, project. And that government and civil society in partnership keeps it so.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers are debating the issue,"['Denise Grady', 'Dgdenise Gradythe New York Timessun.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Denise Gradythe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Denise Gradythe New York Timessun.']",2020-07-05,"One way to quickly see if a coronavirus vaccine works would be to immunize healthy people and then deliberately expose them to the virus, some researchers are suggesting.

Proponents say this strategy, called a human challenge trial, could save time because rather than conducting tests the usual way — by waiting for vaccinated people to encounter the virus naturally — researchers could just infect them.

Challenge trials have been used to test vaccines for typhoid, cholera, malaria and other diseases. For malaria, volunteers have stuck their arms into chambers full of mosquitoes to be bitten and infected. But there were so-called rescue medicines to cure those who got sick. There is no cure for COVID-19.

For both ethical and practical reasons, the idea of challenge trials for a coronavirus vaccine has provoked fierce debate.

In a draft report published last month, the World Health Organization said that challenge trials could yield important information, but that they would be daunting to run because of the potential of the coronavirus “to cause severe and fatal illness and its high transmissibility.”

The report, by a 19-member advisory panel, provided detailed guidelines about the safest way to conduct challenge trials, recommending that they be limited to healthy people ages 18-25 because they have the least risk of severe illness or death from the virus. The virus would be dripped into their noses.

But the panel also said its members split nearly in half over several major issues. They were divided over whether trials should be carried out if no highly effective therapy had been identified to treat participants who got sick; over whether studies in healthy young adults could predict the efficacy of a vaccine in older people or other high-risk adults; and over whether challenge trials could really speed vaccine development.

In the United States, government researchers say that although their primary focus is on traditional clinical trials, they have already begun preparing for human challenge trials, in case they are needed to test either vaccines or treatments. The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases “has begun investigations of the technical and ethical considerations of conducting human challenge studies,” a spokeswoman, Jennifer Routh, said by email. The institute is also developing strains of the virus that could be used to infect participants.

Routh said that toward the end of 2020 the institute would use data from standard clinical trials to assess future human challenge studies, “should they be needed and should they be deemed safe and ethical to employ.”

Citing concerns about putting healthy people at risk, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the institute, said in an interview, “If something like that takes place, it has to be done with absolute intense examination by a group of independent ethicists and independent people who have nothing to do with the trial.”

But the National Institutes of Health, the umbrella organization for the institute, offered a more cautious assessment, saying the government “is not planning to support human challenge studies for Covid-19,” in an email from a spokeswoman, Renate Myles. “There is an expectation of sufficient natural transmission for efficacy studies that will be launched as early as summer 2020. The development of a human challenge model would take longer than this timeline and human challenge studies have a number of serious ethical considerations.”

Among the staunchest advocates of challenge trials is Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center.

“I haven’t really heard convincing ethical counter objections,” he said in an interview.

A challenge trial could take advantage of the lower death rate in people ages 18-29, Caplan and Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccine expert and professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, suggested in an article published in April in the journal Vaccine.

“Despite the danger, we believe it is ethical to ask now for volunteers who would be informed about the known and unknown risks,” they wrote.

Other researchers have made similar arguments.

“Such an approach is not without risks, but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally,” a team led by Dr. Nir Eyal, a bioethicist at Rutgers, wrote in March, in an article in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Eyal’s group suggested choosing an age range of 20-45, and even proposed using a control group that would receive a placebo shot rather than the vaccine but would still be exposed to the virus, so at least some would almost certainly fall ill.

“I think that’s a little bit cuckoo,” Caplan said. “That’s too risky.”

There is no highly effective treatment for COVID, and no sure way to predict who will recover quickly and who will become severely ill.

“Multiple measures would be put in place to ensure that, prior to consenting, potential participants fully comprehend the unusual risks involved in the study,” Eyal’s group wrote.

Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, sharply questioned any form of a challenge trial for COVID, saying that participants cannot be fully informed about the risks, because too little is known about the virus.

“There are too many uncertainties,” he said.

Although it is not common, healthy young people have inexplicably become critically ill from the virus, and some have died.

“All we need is one of those cases in the course of a vaccine trial where we intentionally infected somebody with this coronavirus,” Kahn said. “What would we say then? Was it worth it?”

Several vaccine makers had lukewarm reactions to the idea. Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson, said the company would consider challenge trials only if a treatment became available. He also said larger, traditional Phase 3 trials would provide more safety information.

Dr. Tal Zaks, chief medical officer of Moderna, which expects to begin Phase 3 vaccine trials this month, said in an interview that the question of a challenge trial “will likely be moot as it relates to our development.”

“If such a model were available we would look at it, but I’d hate to put people in harm’s way,” Zaks said. “We are right now leading this race and it might be relevant for other vaccines behind us.”

Other vaccine makers are considering the idea. Dr. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, which developed a coronavirus vaccine that is already in Phase 3 testing, said there was “potential utility” in challenge trials for vaccines and treatments. He said his institute, which has conducted such studies in the past for malaria, typhoid and other diseases, might perform one for COVID before the end of the year, to test vaccine efficacy. He said the studies were also a good way to compare vaccines.

The trials would be acceptable even without a treatment, he said, because the participants would be young and fit, and exposed to only a low dose of the virus, so any illness that occurred would most likely be “self-limiting.”

But Hill added: “Having a treatment would be helpful. By the time we get to doing this, there may be one.”

Caplan argues that the first few vaccine candidates are likely to fail, and that it will be increasingly difficult to recruit the 20,000 or 30,000 people needed for each subsequent trial. Challenge trials in small numbers of participants could more quickly identify products that do not work, letting researchers scrap them and reserve larger studies for more promising candidates.

Another cause for concern is that challenge trials would enroll far fewer patients than traditional studies of vaccine efficacy, which generally include tens of thousands of people. Smaller studies may miss rare side effects that could become a serious problem once a vaccine is given to millions of people.

“The number of people who will have received the vaccine at the time of licensure will be very small in comparison to the usual Phase 3 efficacy trials,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University and a member of a group that will review vaccine data as advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Because many vaccine candidates involve new technologies, “that’s all the more reason you need a large safety base,” Schaffner said.

Challenge trials might also be seen by the public as a means of cutting corners, and undermine confidence in coronavirus vaccines, he said, adding, “I think it’s not a great idea.”

Advocates say volunteers for a coronavirus challenge trial would be young and healthy, without chronic health problems that would put them at high risk of complications or death from the virus. They would also be people who have a “substantial” risk of catching the disease anyway — even without being deliberately exposed — because they live in hot spots with high transmission rates, or because of their jobs or living conditions, proponents say. Eyal’s group suggested an age range of 20-45.

During a trial, they would be quarantined and monitored closely, and if they became ill would receive the best known treatment — possibly the antiviral drug remdesivir, or convalescent plasma from people who had recovered from the illness. But so far, remdesivir’s benefits have been described as “modest,” and studies of convalescent plasma are still underway. The steroid dexamethasone lowered the death rate in one study, but is recommended only for those who become severely ill.

The article by Eyal’s group struck a chord with Josh Morrison, 34. Eight years ago, he donated a kidney to a stranger, and now runs an advocacy group for kidney donors. The opportunity to save someone else’s life meant a great deal to him, and he sees challenge trials as a chance to do it again.

“If it could lead to a speedier creation of a vaccine for the disease Covid-19, we are willing — without reservation — to have doctors infect us with the novel coronavirus,” he and Sophie Rose, 22, a graduate student in epidemiology, wrote in The Washington Post.

Morrison, who had a brief career as a corporate lawyer, has begun organizing others who are interested in volunteering into a group called 1DaySooner. So far, about 30,000 people from 140 countries have signed up online saying they might participate in a challenge trial. Donations of $700,000 have enabled him to hire three full-time staff members.

“There are significant risks in childbirth and kidney donation,” Morrison said in an interview. “No one should take them lightly but they are things we allow people to consent to. I hope for an effective treatment by the time a trial would be conducted, but if not, I do think it would be reasonable to go forward with challenge trials.”

His hope is that an established research centre will conduct the trials. Much of his efforts have gone toward finding a company to produce batches of the virus for use in the studies.

“Our goal is not to manage the manufacturing process or trial process ourselves,” he said. “Our goal is to make the preconditions, so that if challenge trials would be useful, they’re available. ”

So far, donors have offered a total of $1 million for virus production, if Morrison can find a vendor. He said he had a promising candidate, but declined to name the company.

Several vaccine makers have expressed interest in challenge trials, but the discussions have been confidential, so he could not reveal which companies, he said. But he believes the trials will happen.

Read', 'Donovan Vincenthousing Reporter', 'Housing Reporter', 'Donovan Vincent Is A Housing Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-04,"Clarification (July 4): An earlier headline on this article should have made clear that it referred specifically to two Toronto hospitals which no longer have COVID-19 patients in their ICUs.

As the number of COVID-19 cases in Ontario declines, some hospitals in Toronto are now reaching new milestones — zero coronavirus patients in their intensive care units.

Humber River Hospital marked the moment in a tweet on Friday, noting that it was the first time since March 14 that there were no coronavirus patients in the ICU.

“Thank you go the 6th floor staff and physicians that have bonded together and provided exceptional care in this pandemic. Today is a day to celebrate at (Humber River Hospital),” said the tweet, which included a photo of staff in the ICU.

Humber River serves a section of the city that has been hit hard by the pandemic — Toronto’s northwest corner, where a higher proportion of racialized, low-income people live in cramped housing. The Star has been reporting on high rates of coronavirus infections in this part of Toronto and neighbouring regions.

“The northwest section of Toronto had the worst outbreak in the GTA and that’s the area we service,” said Dr. Jamie Spiegelman, an internal medicine and critical care specialist at Humber River Hospital, in an interview Saturday.

North York General Hospital also marked a milestone on Friday, with zero coronavirus patients in its ICU.

“It’s obviously very positive,” CEO Dr. Joshua Tepper said Saturday, adding that hospitals must be conscious of how easily the virus can spread again if proper masking and physical distancing aren’t maintained, as the rising number of cases in the U.S. has shown.

North York General had to delay serious surgeries and cardiac treatments when the ICU was full of COVID-19 patients; now, those treatments can resume, Tepper said.

St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto had four COVID-19 patients in its ICU as of Friday.

The 20 new coronavirus cases reported in Toronto’s on Saturday were the lowest daily total since March 26, according to the Star’s latest count.

While “holding our breath” for fear of the anticipated second wave of the virus, the medical team at Humber River is prepared for a return of COVID-19, Spiegelman said.

“This time around we know how to treat patients; we know the risks, what precautions we need to take,” he said, noting that no ICU nurses or doctors at Humber River had contracted COVID-19.

“We know the virus is very contagious, so in terms of the (personal protective equipment), we know exactly what we need and don’t need in terms of protecting our staff.”

Spiegelman listed the PPE worn by staff, including “impervious gowns, gloves — we double-glove every time we go to see these patients — N95 masks, face shields, and a bonnet (hair net).

“That’s all we need. A lot of places in the U.S. use higher acuity, mechanical N95 masks and we found that that wasn’t really what we need,” Spiegelman said. “It hinders your treatment of patients, makes you hot, and you’re sweating underneath the hazmat suits.”

He added: “We found we really didn’t need to do that in our ICU, partially because the air circulation in our ICU is good. Everyone room is individualized, rather than shared rooms with many patients.”

The peak of COVID-19 patients in the 48-bed ICU at Humber River hit around late March with 20 cases, Spiegelman said (the remaining cases were not COVID-related), and about 20 people had to be transferred around that time to other ICUs in Toronto hospitals.

“We were over-our-heads busy,” the doctor recalled.

Throughout the crisis the medical team and staff celebrated every “win” — when a patient survived and left the ICU, Spiegelman said.

The first COVID-19 patient treated in Humber’s ICU was there for around three months.

“No one expected him to survive, but he just left the hospital and went to rehab this past week. So that was a big win. He was around 60 years old,” Spiegelman said.

“We didn’t know what to expect initially. He was so sick, needed so much oxygen. There were times we were concerned he had brain damage from lack of oxygen because his oxygen saturation went down so low.

“The fact that he recovered after a tracheostomy and all the feeding tubes … is a little bit of a miracle, I think. We’ve never treated this disease, so we didn’t know what we were treating.”

There were also tragic cases of younger people who died from the virus, Spiegelman said.

“We know the basic risk factors for getting critical illnesses from COVID — people with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity … But we don’t understand who survived and who doesn’t. We had patients who were stable for a month, cleared the virus, but ended up getting multi-organ failure and dying. There is some inflammatory response to this virus that we don’t understand quite yet,” he explained.

Nurses and doctors at the hospital have now returned to regularly scheduled shifts.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of 9 a.m., more than 2,000 tickets had been sold and more than 1,000 vehicles had scheduled a visit through the recently opened drive-thru safari, Toronto Zoo CEO Dolf DeJong said.

The zoo closed on March 14 amid the COVID-19 lockdown and has been hosting the drive-thru visits for a limited number of guests since May 23. Beginning June 29, those with memberships were given the first opportunity to return and explore the zoo on foot.

“We’ve just really been blown away by the community support we’ve received,” DeJong said.

A campaign led by the Toronto Zoo Wildlife Conservatory raised half a million dollars to ensure the animals continued to be fed throughout the closure, he said. The drive-thru safari has drawn about 1,000 cars per day.

Referring to Saturday’s reopening, DeJong said, “We were delighted with how people complied. Everyone indoors was wearing a mask, and … even outdoors, with the heat, people were still wearing masks.”

The zoo hosted 160 members of the Scarborough Health Network and their families on Saturday, he added.

To ensure contactless payment and physical distancing, zoo visitors must pay for tickets in advance online, and are then provided with a time slot. Tickets cannot be purchased by phone.

Face masks are mandatory in all indoor spaces and guests are asked to follow a one-way trail as they make their way through the zoo. Signage is posted throughout the site to guide people along.

“Throughout this entire pandemic, we’ve worked really closely with our partners in the city, and the medical officer of health and her team,” DeJong said.

The zoo is offering 20 per cent off the regular admission price because some attractions have yet to reopen. With the discount, adult tickets cost $22 each and children’s tickets are $14.

The African Savanna site, the Australasia Pavilion, the Indo-Malaya Pavilion, the Malayan Woods site and part of the Americas section, including the Mayan Temple and pavilion, won’t be accessible until further adjustments.

Read', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-04,"OTTAWA — Migrant workers and other non-permanent residents — many of whom have been working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic — took to the streets in cities across Canada on Saturday, calling on Ottawa to grant them greater rights and protections.

Temporary foreign farm labourers, care workers, international students and undocumented workers who have been working throughout the pandemic as “essential workers” say they are being left behind by the Canadian government.

“Our people are literally starving. People are dying, not even to grow food, but to grow flowers and grapes for wine. Domestic workers are trapped in homes by employers who won’t let them out because migrants are seen as carriers of disease,” said Syed Hussan, executive director of Migrant Workers Alliance for Change.

“COVID-19 has exacerbated an existing crisis.”

Many migrant workers have fallen ill and cannot access medical treatment, while others have not received wage top-ups offered to other essential workers.

Meanwhile, migrant or undocumented workers and asylum seekers who have lost employment due to the pandemic are ineligible for emergency income supports such as the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit, making them even more vulnerable.

It all stems from their non-permanent status in Canada.

Canada’s labour laws, social services, health care and education systems offer different levels of access to non-permanent residents — a reality that advocates have long decried as intrinsically unjust. The pandemic has now exacerbated those inequities and has placed migrant workers at significant personal risk, Hussan said.

“What we weren’t planning for is the absolute misery and chaos that would be caused in a public health pandemic,” he said.

Demonstrations organized by the Migrant Rights Network were held Saturday in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax in front of offices of members of Parliament, including the office of federal Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino.

Around 100 protesters plastered Mendicino’s Toronto office windows with posters of Juan Lopez Chapparo, Bonifacio Eugenio Romero, and Rogelio Munez Santos — three migrant workers who died from the COVID-19 virus in June while working on Ontario farms.

Their demands to Mendicino and to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were simple: provide full immigration status to all migrants who are working in Canada.

Alina Przybyl, a member of Migrant Students United, says the struggles migrants face in Canada are wide and vary from person to person, but that all migrants in Canada face a two-tier immigration system that favours the wealthy and privileged.

“I can’t speak for everyone but I think I can say that everyone (who has migrated to Canada) has a story like what we’re hearing here,” Pryzybyl said.

Participants in the Montreal demonstration, which was attended by a few hundred people Saturday morning, held signs that read, “Status for all” and “We are all essential,” among others.

“It feels very sad that people who have been providing essential services to our society have been left behind,” said Elroy Ribas, a migrant worker from Mexico.

“One of the things that made me feel very proud about living in Canada is that people care. But in this context we haven’t seen that.”

The federal Liberals have said they are working on a program to grant permanent residency specifically to asylum-seekers working in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many of their refugee applications are in limbo due to a backlog at the Immigration and Refugee Board and further delays caused by the pandemic, meaning their status in Canada remains uncertain in the long term.

But Hussan says the government should commit to regularizing the status of all non-permanent residents, not just a select few.

“Everyone must have the same rights, the same protections. That’s only possible if everyone has the same status,” Hussan said.

Floriane Payo, an asylum seeker from Cameroon who came to Canada last year, joined the rally in Montreal on Saturday to demand status for herself and others who’ve been working throughout the COVID-19 pandemic who are not in the health-care sector.

Payo was working in a call centre in Montreal at the height of the pandemic in March and April, but the company closed temporarily in April, she said, after a worker tested positive for COVID-19.

It would be unfair for the government to regularize the status health-care workers only, she said.

“We too are essential workers,” said Payo.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-04,"CHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. — Prince Edward Island reported new COVID-19 cases for the first time in more than two months, announcing three new cases on Saturday — including one person who worked at Charlottetown seniors home.

Dr. Heather Morrison, the province’s chief public health officer, told a news conference that all three cases were Islanders who’d travelled within Canada — the first cases in P.E.I. since April 28.

“This is disappointing news, but we have said consistently that we need to be prepared for more cases and we are,” Morrison said, noting none of the cases are related to seasonal residents or the opening of the Atlantic bubble this week.

One, a man in his 50s, was an essential services worker who’d travelled outside the province and was self-isolating.

Two other cases are believed to be linked — a man in his 20s who’d gone to Nova Scotia and had interacted with someone who had been in the U.S. and was asymptomatic, returning to the island on Monday.

The other case was a close contact of the male, a symptomatic woman in her 20s who worked at Whisperwood Villa, a seniors’ residence in Charlottetown where management was advised Friday evening and residents were being tested starting on Saturday as a precaution.

Morrison considered the risk of transmission low, given the woman wore PPE.

None of the residents have exhibited new symptoms of COVID-19, but the province planned to test all residents and staff as well as visitors from Tuesday.

“She did wear appropriate PPE while working and does not provide direct personal care to residents,” Morrison said of the positive case.

“She left work as soon as she was not feeling well.”

Still, all indoor and outdoor visits are cancelled until further notice at the home, where residents will now undergo twice daily temperature checks in addition to twice daily screenings, with no communal dining.

For all three new cases — which brought the province’s COVID-19 confirmed cases tally to 30, contact tracing has begun.

Premier Dennis King said the new cases haven’t changed anything in terms of the so-called Atlantic bubble for now.

The four Atlantic Provinces lifted travel restrictions within the region early Friday, permitting residents of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and P.E.I. to travel to any of the other three provinces without self-isolating for 14 days after arriving.

A P.E.I. Health Department spokesperson said the province received 5,200 applications for entry — a requirement under the Island’s rules — for the first three days of the bubble.

“We will take the next 24 to 48 hours to allow the contact tracing and chief public health office to do what they are prepared to do and we will let the information guide us at that time,” King said.

“We’ve said from the very beginning if we need to pull back we would, and if the public health information and the epidemiology points in that direction, then we would be prepared to make a decision on pulling back early next week.”

King described the news of new cases after more than two months as a “gut shot.”

Asked about the reaction of those locals hostile to the bubble, he said the three cases are a reminder to everyone that the virus remains a threat.

Read', 'Choe Sang-Hunthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Choe Sang-Hunthe New York Timessat.']",2020-07-04,"SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA—On New Year’s Day, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, called for a “frontal breakthrough to foil the enemies’ sanctions.” The strategy meant finding new sources of income, legal or illegal, and mainly from China.

Sending North Korean workers to China. Bringing more tourists from there. Smuggling banned cargo, like coal or oil, across the border at night or between ships on high seas.

But there was one thing Kim did not foresee: the coronavirus.

Barely three weeks after Kim unveiled his New Year’s resolution, North Korea shut down ​its border with China to protect itself against the emerging outbreak in the city of Wuhan. It was no ordinary border​ closure.

China accounted for 95 per cent of the North’s trade. Consumer goods, raw materials, fuel and machine parts smuggled into the North across their 870-mile (1,400-kilometre) border kept North Korean markets and factories sputtering along, despite United Nations sanctions designed to curb the Kim regime’s nuclear ambitions.

With the border sealed, the North’s official exports to China, already hobbled by the sanctions, have crashed even further. In March, they were worth just $610,000 (U.S.), according to Chinese customs data — down 96 per cent from a year earlier. The North’s newly opened ski and spa resorts are empty of Chinese tourists, and its smuggling ships sit idle in their ports.

The virus has isolated the North Korean economy as no sanctions could. It has devastated the regime’s ability to bring in money through legal and illegal trade, leaving it scrambling to protect the country’s diminishing foreign currency reserves.

“To North Korea, COVID-19 is a black swan. None of its policy-makers saw it coming,” said Go Myong-Hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, South Korea.

​North Korea claims it has had no coronavirus cases. But it was one of the first countries to shut its border, aware that its woefully underequipped public health system made it particularly vulnerable to mass infection.

The pandemic could hardly have come at a worse time for Kim, whose attempts to win sanctions relief in talks with United States President Donald Trump have been fruitless. North Korea’s recent acts of hostility toward South Korea, including the destruction of the inter-Korean liaison office in the North, have been seen in part as acts of economic desperation.

“If you peel North Korea’s problem like an onion, at the core is its economy, and its economic trouble comes down to whether it can lift sanctions,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.

The North Korean economy has languished for decades, hobbled by communist mismanagement, a famine in the late 1990s and the gradually tougher sanctions imposed by the UN since 2006, when the North carried out its first nuclear test.

Kim has tried to boost the economy with domestic reforms aimed at creating a “socialist system of responsible business operation.” Factories and collective farms were given more incentives to increase productivity, including the right to keep surpluses.

Kim also ramped up exports of coal, iron ore, textiles and seafood to China, achieving economic growth of 3.9 per cent in 2016, the highest since the late 1990s, according to South Korea’s central bank.

But the North also rapidly expanded ​its weapons ​programs, testing three intercontinental ballistic missiles in 2017 as well as what it said was a hydrogen bomb. In response, the UN Security Council tightened the noose around the North’s economy by banning all of its major exports.​

The economy shrank by 3.5 per cent in 2017. It contracted by 4.1 per cent the following year, with its exports to China plummeting 86 per cent.

By February 2019, when Kim and Trump held their second summit, in Vietnam, the North Korean leader was desperate ​for relief​. The Security Council had required China, Russia and other countries to expel all North Korean workers by ​December, which threatened to deprive the North of another key source of income, estimated at $500 million to $1 billion a year.

But Kim’s hopes of easing the sanctions ended when the Vietnam talks collapsed.

In his ​grim New Year’s message​, Kim seemed determined to slog through the sanctions, asking North Koreans to prepare to “tighten our belts” again. He also vowed to boost his nuclear weapons program further, hoping that a more advanced nuclear arsenal would give him more leverage with Trump or his successor. He threatened to end his moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, warning that ​the world would soon witness ​his “new strategic weapon​.”

State-run television echoed that sentiment later in January, in a broadcast about Kim’s brief meeting with Trump last summer on the inter-Korean border. “We don’t intend to sell our pride and national power for some spectacular economic transformation,” Kim was quoted as telling Trump after the U.S. leader promised the North a better economic future if it gave up its nuclear weapons first.

At the time, Kim had reason to be so defiant.

After hitting bottom in 2018, his country’s trade with China grew 15 per cent last year, according to data compiled by the Korea International Trade Association. It exported practically anything not banned by UN sanctions: cheap watches assembled with Chinese components, artificial eyelashes, wigs, mannequins, soccer balls and tungsten.

China also sent more tourists to the North after Kim’s third summit with its leader, Xi Jinping, in June 2018. Tourism was one North Korean industry that had not been affected by the sanctions, and Kim has been busy building massive resort towns.

The North also continued to circumvent the sanctions. Last year, it exported $370 million worth of coal in illicit ship-to-ship transfers to Chinese barges, according to the UN. And despite the ban on work permits for North Koreans, China allowed many to be employed on short-term tourist or student visas, according to analysts and news reports​ in South Korea​.

But the trade imbalance with China created its own concerns.

Even as the sanctions hit the North’s exports hard, the country continued to buy cooking oil, flour, sugar and other consumer goods as well as construction materials from China. The imports were needed to keep its industries going as well as the unofficial markets that have helped many people to survive as the North’s food-rationing system fails to meet the population’s needs.

Since 2017, North Korea has reported a trade deficit of more than $2 billion every year. In comparison, the North’s total exports last year were $260 million.​

“The clock is ticking, and the bomb could explode any time,” Kim Byung-yeon, a​ Seoul National University​ economist​, wrote in December, predicting that the North’s foreign currency reserves would shrink by $1 billion a year, leading inexorably to a crisis.

North Korea has tried to replenish its coffers with revenues from illegal smuggling and cybertheft as well as “loyalty donations” from ​what are known as donju — tradespeople with political connections who have hoarded foreign currency obtained through smuggling​ and other enterprises.

Kim’s government also runs shops in Pyongyang, the capital, where the moneyed class spends foreign currency on imported goods. And it has profited by selling Chinese smartphones to an estimated six million cellphone subscribers in the country.

“The debate has been about how quickly or slowly the North’s foreign currency would diminish,” Go said. “But there is no doubt now that COVID-19 has accelerated the speed.”

​Recently, signs have emerged of growing stress on the North’s economy, especially its foreign currency reserves.

The government recently issued public bonds for the first time in 17 years, reported Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that uses informants inside ​the ​North. Kim tested the elites’ loyalty by asking them to buy bonds with foreign currency, it said.

Authorities have also cracked down harder on the use of foreign currency in markets in an effort to shore up the won, the local currency, said Jiro Ishimaru, a chief editor at Asia Press International in Japan, who has monitored the North Korean economy for years with the help of correspondents there.

To save on foreign currency, ​Kim has encouraged his people to produce more goods at home, like snacks, cosmetics and beverages. But COVID-19 has hit those sectors as well because they depended on Chinese raw materials to produce the goods.

“Kim Jong Un thought he could survive with tourism revenues, smuggling and Chinese help,​ but his plans have crumbled because of the coronavirus,” Ishimaru​ said. “If the virus has taught him anything, it is how dependent his economy is on China.”

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Saturday. Web links to longer stories if available. This story is no longer being updated.

8:32 p.m.: Mexico topped 30,000 COVID-19 deaths Saturday, overtaking France as the country with the fifth-highest death toll since the coronavirus outbreak began.

Officials reported 523 more confirmed coronavirus deaths for the day, bringing the nation’s total to 30,366 for the pandemic. Mexico’s total confirmed infections rose by almost 6,000 to 251,165, about on par with Spain, the eighth highest caseload.

Also Saturday, about 200 street vendors briefly blocked several major avenues in downtown Mexico City on Saturday to demand they be allowed to sell again amid the coronavirus pandemic.

6:47 p.m.: Officials across the U.S. pleaded with Americans to curb their enthusiasm for large Fourth of July crowds Saturday even as President Donald Trump enticed the masses with a “special evening” of tribute and fireworks staged with new U.S. coronavirus infections on the rise.

People wandered the National Mall in baking heat and took shade under the scattered trees while, not far away, music wafted from a party on the White House South Lawn. To come: the “Salute for America” celebration with Trump’s speech from the White House grounds, a military air show and a more ambitious fireworks display than has been seen in years.

The crowds on the Mall were strikingly thinner than the one gathered for last year’s jammed celebration on the National Mall. Many who showed up wore masks.

At the White House, several hundred invited guests assembled on the sweeping South Lawn, gathering around tables decorated with flowers and small U.S. flags as a military rock band played. Most guests were unmasked.

Trump’s guests were doctors, nurses, law enforcement officers and military members as well as officials from the administration, said Judd Deere, deputy White House press secretary. He said the event was a tribute to the “tremendous courage and spirit” of front-line workers and the public in the pandemic.

5:30 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Saturday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,675 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,733 deaths, up a total of 117 new cases since Friday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases were reported in a handful of health units. Only Windsor-Essex (35 new cases), Peel Region (25 cases), York Region (21 cases) and Toronto (20 cases) reported increases in the double digits. The 20 cases in Toronto were the fewest in any day since March 26.

Meanwhile, just two more fatal cases were reported — both in Toronto. The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported 150 patients are currently hospitalized with COVID-19, including 39 in an intensive care unit, of whom 26 are on a ventilator — numbers that are all near the lowest levels in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,687 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4:46 p.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4:46 p.m.

There are 105,317 confirmed cases in Canada.

4:43 p.m.: Migrant workers and other non-permanent residents — many of whom have been working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic — took to the streets in cities across Canada on Saturday, calling on Ottawa to grant them greater rights and protections.

Temporary foreign farm labourers, care workers, international students and undocumented workers who have been working throughout the pandemic as “essential workers” say they are being left behind by the Canadian government.

“Our people are literally starving. People are dying, not even to grow food, but to grow flowers and grapes for wine. Domestic workers are trapped in homes by employers who won’t let them out because migrants are seen as carriers of disease,” said Syed Hussan, executive director of Migrant Workers Alliance for Change. “COVID-19 has exacerbated an existing crisis.”

Demonstrations organized by the Migrant Rights Network were held Saturday in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Halifax in front of offices of members of Parliament, including the office of federal Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino.

4:34 p.m.: A First Nation in southern Alberta has implemented a curfew as its health workers monitor more than 200 people for signs they may have developed COVID-19.

Siksika Nation Chief Ouray Crowfoot said in video messages posted on Facebook that as of Thursday there were 21 known COVID-19-positive cases with links to the community west of Calgary, and that five separate and unrelated case clusters had been uncovered in the previous 12 days.

Crowfoot said that as of Wednesday, 258 Siksika Nation members were under “active investigation and daily followup” by the community’s health services team — a number he said had quadrupled in only three days.

On Friday, councillors approved a temporary curfew from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time, with exceptions that Crowfoot said can be made on an as-needed basis for work or other reasons.

4:11 p.m.: Quebec reported more than 100 new cases of COVID-19 for the first time in two weeks.

The province’s Health Department says authorities registered 102 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections in the province to 55,784. That’s the most since June 20, when the province reported exactly 100 cases.

The province also added six additional deaths linked to the novel coronavirus — three new and three others that occurred before June 26 — for a total of 5,566.

The number of hospitalizations and intensive care cases decreased in numbers released on Saturday. Hospitalizations were down by 17 for a total of 375, while the number of intensive-care patients dropped by four to 27 cases. The province has reported 25,280 recoveries.

2:35 p.m.: Florida reported a record number of coronavirus cases Saturday, the latest sign that the virus is surging in many parts of the United States, casting a pall over Fourth of July celebrations.

Officials and health authorities warned people to take precautions or simply stay home on Independence Day, as confirmed cases are climbing in 40 states. The U.S. set another daily record Friday with 52,300 newly reported infections, according to numbers kept by Johns Hopkins University.

The U.S. has more than 2.8 million confirmed cases — about a quarter of worldwide infections, according to the tally.

Florida reported 11,445 confirmed infections Saturday, bringing the statewide total to more than 190,000.

12:58 p.m.: Prince Edward Island is reporting three new cases of COVID-19 for the first time since late April, including one person who worked at a Charlottetown seniors home.

Dr. Heather Morrison, the province’s chief public health officer, says the three cases include a man in his 50s and two people in their 20s. None of the cases are related to seasonal residents or the opening of the Atlantic bubble this week.

The man in his 50s was an essential worker who had recently travelled outside the province and has self-isolated since returning home.

The other two cases are connected and involve a male in his 20s who travelled to Nova Scotia and came into contact with someone from the United States and is asymptomatic.

The female is connected to that person and is symptomatic, and worked at Whisperwood Villa, a seniors’ residence in Charlottetown where residents will be tested.

She wore protective equipment on the job, did not provide direct care to residents and left as soon as she felt unwell.

12:32 p.m.: Two of California death row’s most notorious inmates apparently died from COVID-19, bringing the number of inmates across the state to die after contracting the coronavirus to at least 24.

The men, convicted child killer Scott Thomas Erskine and Manuel Machado Alvarez, both died on July 3, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.

Both men were being treated at outside hospitals after being sickened by coronavirus inside San Quentin State Prison, where the virus has run rampant for nearly two weeks. Nearly 1,400 inmates, one in three housed in the famed Marin County facility, have tested positive for the virus, and the prison accounts for more than half of all infections in the CDCR system, according to its coronavirus dashboard.

In total, 5,280 inmates have been infected with the coronavirus in the state’s prisons since April, with 1,441 new cases since June 19.

12:22 p.m.: The Toronto Raptors will face their first competition in more than four months when they play the Houston Rockets in a scrimmage on July 24.

The NBA released the scrimmage schedule Saturday ahead of the July 30 restart. Each team will play three exhibition games at Disney World in Orlando.

The Raptors will also face Portland on July 26, and Phoenix on July 28.

Toronto opens the eight-game seeding round on Aug. 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers.

The NBA shut down March 11 due to COVID-19. The 22 teams playing in the seeding round are scheduled to arrive in Orlando next week.

12:07 p.m.: The MLS Is Back tournament match between FC Dallas and the Vancouver Whitecaps has been postponed after six FC Dallas players tested positive for COVID-19.

The group stage match was scheduled to take place Thursday. MLS officials announced the postponement Saturday and said a new time and date would come later.

FC Dallas confirmed Wednesday that players had tested positive upon their arrival in Florida for the month-long tournament. The entire FC Dallas delegation is quarantining in their rooms at the walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resort.

Vancouver’s team is scheduled to arrive in Orlando on Monday.

FC Dallas will now play its first tournament match July 15 against the Seattle Sounders.

12:01 p.m.: Frances Tiafoe has tested positive for the coronavirus and withdrawn from the All-American Team Cup tennis tournament in Atlanta.

Tiafoe was scheduled to face Tennys Sandgren on Saturday in the weekend tournament involving eight top American men’s players at Life Time Fitness in Peachtree Corners. The event is allowing a limited number of fans and not requiring masks, though will provide them if requested.

Tiafoe defeated Sam Querrey on Friday, but was showing symptoms after the match and a test was positive.

Tiafoe, a 22-year-old who reached the 2019 Australian Open quarterfinals, left the event site and was replaced by Christopher Eubanks. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic and three other pro players had tested positive for the virus after playing in a similar exhibition event in Europe. The pro tennis tours are suspended until August.

Tournament officials said they had begun deep cleaning and sanitizing the event site, along with alerting people who may have been exposed.

10:50 a.m.: (Updated) The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 10:50 a.m.:

10:28 a.m.: The Toronto Zoo has opened its doors again to the public with safety precautions in place for visitors.

Visitors must now book their tickets in advance online within certain time slots due to a reduced capacity. Tickets will not be available on-site and all visitors will be required to wear masks inside closed buildings.

Restaurants inside the zoo are open as well as the gift shop and the African Rainforest Pavilion and Giraffe House. Rides, lockers, drinking fountains, all rental services and manual coin machines remain closed.

The zoo had earlier opened to members.

10:15 a.m.: The North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit says it has declared a COVID-19 outbreak at Belvedere Heights long-term-care facility in Parry Sound.

In a release, the health unit states, “The two individuals who tested positive are staff at the long-term-care home. The individuals are currently in isolation. No residents at Belvedere Heights have tested positive for COVID-19.”

The North Bay Parry Sound catchment area has experienced some of the lowest COVID-19 positive test rates in the province. In the district, the Belvedere Heights outbreak is the third documented in a retirement or long-term-care facility. The other two outbreaks in the district are considered “resolved.”

In the North Bay Parry Sound district, as of today, the health unit is reporting 14,195 total tests administered, with 33 positives resulting in 29 cases resolved, one death, one in isolation, plus the two most recent positives in Parry Sound.

According to the health ministry, “An outbreak in a long-term-care home is declared with a single, laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident or staff member. When only asymptomatic residents and/or staff with positive results are found as part of enhanced surveillance testing of residents and/or staff, it may not be necessary to declare an outbreak. An outbreak may be declared over when there are no new cases in residents or staff after 14 days.”

9:36 a.m.: Courthouses across Ontario are set to resume some in-person hearings Monday, according to the Ministry of the Attorney General, despite unions representing Crowns and court staff saying safety concerns remain unresolved.

“More precautions are required to adequately ensure courthouses are safe,” Paul Cavalluzzo, the lawyer representing the Ontario Crown Attorneys Association, said Friday.

Courthouses have been closed to in-person hearings for more than three months.

9:26 a.m.: U.S. media reported that Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., and a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign, has tested positive for coronavirus.

“After testing positive, Kimberly was immediately isolated to limit any exposure,” said Sergio Gor, chief of staff for the Trump Victory Finance Committee, quoted by CNN. Gor said she was asymptomatic and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, tested negative.”

Guilfoyle is a top fundraiser for the campaign.

Guilfoyle tested positive in South Dakota before the president’s Mount Rushmore celebration, CNN reported.

9:21 a.m.: Authorities in northeast Spain ordered the lockdown of El Segria county around the city of Lleida, home to over 200,000 people, after health officials recorded a jump in 60 cases in 24 hours. The outbreaks are linked to agricultural workers in the rural area.

The area is in Catalonia, west of Barcelona.

9:17 a.m.: The pints are being poured and the unkempt hairdos are being cut and styled as England embarked Saturday on its biggest lockdown easing yet.

In addition to the reopening of much of the hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, for the first time in more than three months, couples can tie the knot once again and people can go and see a movie at the cinema.

Museums and libraries have also reopened but gyms, swimming pools and nail bars remain shut. Restrictions on travel and social contact have been eased — people from different households can now go into each other’s homes, for example.

“Let’s not blow it now,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said as some in England rushed to restaurants or barbers for the first time in more than three months.

Friday, 6 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting 37,558 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,731 deaths, up a total of 164 new cases since Thursday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases were reported in a small handful of health units. Just Toronto (80 new cases), Peel Region (21 cases) and York Region (20 cases) reported increases in the double digits; of the remaining 31 units, just Windsor-Essex saw more than five new infections.

Meanwhile, three more fatal cases were reported Friday, two in Toronto, one in the Southwestern region. The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported 155 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19, including 40, who are in an intensive care unit, of whom 25 are on a ventilator. These numbers are all near the lowest levels in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,682, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

Read', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-04,"OTTAWA—Canada’s sex work laws are creating undue harm and contribute to human rights violations during COVID-19, sex workers and human rights advocates say, which is why they’re now pushing Ottawa to stop enforcing them.

Amnesty International Canada has joined a number of rights and sex work advocates in a lobby effort asking federal Justice Minister David Lametti for a moratorium on prostitution laws.

“We need to make sure the existing laws on the books aren’t enforced,” said Jackie Hansen, women’s rights campaigner for Amnesty International Canada.

“Government has put them in a position where they won’t provide them income supports and yet will criminalize them if they work. That just needs to stop.”

They say decriminalizing sex work would help ease the burden workers have faced by taking away police surveillance of their work and their lives.

“Because sex work is not recognized as work, the labour standards and protocols that other industries are receiving right now are not available to the sex industry,” says Jenn Clamen, national co-ordinator of the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform.

Businesses employing sex workers often operate in the shadows, so as they reopen they have no way to formalize and co-ordinate safety protocols or access supports for personal protective equipment, which are available to other industries, Clamen said.

These groups have also been raising alarm about how the criminalization of sex workers has caused them to remain ineligible to receive emergency income supports despite seeing their incomes disappear overnight when the pandemic hit.

There are provisions in Canada’s prostitution laws that make workers immune from prosecution, but not from arrest, which has led many workers to prefer to remain undocumented, their incomes undeclared.

This means they don’t have the necessary paperwork to prove eligibility for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit — a program being administered through the federal tax system.

“Criminalization is a direct barrier for accessing CERB and is a direct barrier for sex workers accessing other legal and social, medical supports in the community,” said Jelena Vermilion, executive director of Sex Workers’ Action Program (SWAP) Hamilton.

Vermilion, who is also a sex worker, says organizations like hers have been raising money through grassroots campaigns to provide aid to those who are struggling. But despite the relative success of some of these local initiatives, this aid has only been able to offer $50 or $100 gift cards and cash transfers to workers.

“That doesn’t pay rent at the end of the day,” she said.

“A lot of us are not surviving. It’s really pushing people who don’t have the option to access CERB into destitution, into further entrenched poverty. It’s going to cause people who were already on the margins, just surviving, to be ruined.”

The federal government has shovelled out millions in COVID-19 aid to shelters, sexual assault centres and a number of organizations that serve women and marginalized groups, including a $350-million investment to support charities and non-profit organizations serving vulnerable populations.

Clamen says these funds, while necessary, are not providing the help sex workers need.

Middle-class Canadians who lost their jobs are getting access to income supports, but sex workers are being helped by charities giving out gift cards, she said.

“The $100 grocery card that dictate where sex workers or people who don’t have income should shop or get their groceries is an extremely paternalistic response to people who actually need income supports,” Clamen said.

“The money needs to go into the hands of people.”

While they continue to push for more direct financial aid, Amnesty International Canada, the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform and other rights advocates say halting the enforcement of the laws that criminalize their lives would do much more.

“This is about the human rights of sex workers. When you are just furthering marginalization and you are furthering inequality, this is not where we want to be,” Hansen said.

“In a pandemic it can’t be a response that leads to some groups being disproportionately marginalized and impacted because government finds it hard to figure out how to handle this issue.”

In a statement Friday, Lametti’s office says officials are “aware of the specific concerns” that sex workers and advocates have highlighted but offered no comment on whether it is considering this legal move.

“We continue to engage with individuals and groups affected by the former Bill C-36,” the statement said, referencing the federal prostitution law brought in under the Conservative government of former prime minister Stephen Harper.

That law is up for its mandatory five-year review this year, which Lametti’s office says will provide “an appropriate forum for parliamentarians to examine the full range of effects that this",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter', 'Tess Kalinowski Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Real Estate For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-04,"Architect Joanne Lam and her husband Eric Martin had long been aware that their typical Toronto life was missing the close community they experienced growing up – she in Hong Kong, he in North Bay.

That absence became acute when COVID-19 kicked in.

“Two weeks into it, that’s when the sense of isolation really hit,” said Lam.

Like a lot of people with young children, she and Martin, a designer, longed for just a couple of hours to themselves. At the same time, she said, they could feel the loneliness gripping her parents and single friends.

Lam has been working on concepts designed to facilitate co-living — shared arrangements that foster resiliency and affordability.

“In a co-living space you could be sharing with your family members. You could be sharing with friends. You could also be sharing with friends of friends or even complete strangers,” she said.

“We are all experiencing a different kind of isolation. If we had all been in a co-living situation to begin with, we would have already had this built-in community. It would make us, as a bubbled household, resilient because there’s always somebody there who could help out, and there are spaces to be alone if you don’t want to interact with other people.”

The GTA has been mired in a housing supply and affordability crisis for years. COVID-19 showed us just how vulnerable we are financially and socially when it comes to sheltering ourselves from the insidious threat of the virus.

If people were seeking new models of housing before the pandemic, the last three months have proved how badly the region needs more bricks and mortar — and more options for everything from how we habitate to how we finance our homes.

“If we’ve learned anything out of this crisis it’s that a safe place is a key thing for health and ability to withstand these kinds of events,” said Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) chair Derek Ballantyne.

Home has never been more important. But it’s become all too obvious that many of us don’t have the home we need, said real estate agent Lesli Gaynor, who specializes in co-ownership housing.

Gaynor helps people connect with one another, and find the bricks and mortar and financing it takes to establish the kind of communal arrangements that the traditional building and lending institutions haven’t necessarily embraced.

She expected her phone would stop ringing when the lockdown began. Instead, she has been surprised by how many people have called because they are exploring new models of living and owning a home — people who never thought they would consider co-owning.

“I think people realize how fragile they are financially,” she said.

There are many people who have seen their income diminished or disappear, who are wondering if they can afford to keep the homes they worked so hard to buy, she said.

But it goes deeper. Gaynor said the pandemic has also shown us what the future looks like without community connections — what can happen if we aren’t able to live independently because of age or disability.

People are frightened, said Gaynor. They are thinking about how they can avoid being part of the crisis that has afflicted the long-term-care sector.

Most people suspected there were issues in senior care, but now they are forced to confront the reality that “institutional care is not sustainable in a healthy way.”

“The forced feeding, the stuff that the military was uncovering…Nobody could cover it up any more,” said Gaynor.

She and Lam are among the experts who say COVID-19 is an opening for a bigger dialogue about redistributing the wealth and the space apportioned to real estate.

In January, Lam and Gaynor’s booth at the Interior Design Show surveyed visitors to identify which household spaces and property they would be willing to share. No surprise: most people preferred a private bathroom.

But respondents were overwhelmingly willing to share indoor and outdoor recreation space. They were split on allowing others to use their fine china, but most were happy to share books.

Now Lam and Martin’s company, Picnic Design, has embarked on what she calls her most exciting experiment — a “proof of concept.”

They have purchased a two-storey house in the west end with a plan to create a co-ownership property where each of three or four owners get generous private space, but share a yard, laundry room, kitchen, guest space and living areas.

Lam says they are not developers, so the project isn’t being built with an eye to a profit. It’s the bricks and mortar that she hopes will help fuel the grassroots demand that would force institutions — cities, banks — to make co-ownership with built-in community a more accessible option.

There are hurdles to jump at city hall, but the best-case scenario is to build it in about two years, said Lam.

It’s one of the many small solutions that nibble around the edges of Toronto’s persistent issue, which is affordability, said CMHC’s Ballantyne.

But the virus’s deepest impact on housing might well be how we view it in relation to the city’s most vulnerable. COVID-19 has made it more difficult to look away from the housing crisis, he said.

“I think we’ve been able to think we’re dealing with the issue by building more shelter beds,” said Ballantyne. “There is probably a greater will now and a greater interest in finding permanent housing solutions for very low-income and individuals facing the greatest challenges.”

That extends to Toronto’s persistent rental housing issues, said Cole Webber, of Parkdale Community Legal Services. He says COVID has pushed the already high pain threshold of renting to an excruciating level.

Nothing less than a prohibition against COVID evictions is going to save as many as 13,000 Toronto tenants from being pushed out of their homes, he said.

But the 15-year tenant advocate says there is inspiration as well as exhaustion in the activism that has begun to swell around issues such as above-guideline rent hikes and unacceptable living conditions.

“It’s been amazing to see in particular some of the neighbourhoods in East York and Scarborough, which are largely immigrant and racialized districts where a lot of people have kept their heads down for a long time about the conditions of their housing, about their struggles to pay rent, about evictions,” said Webber.

“You see tenants in Goodwood Park, in Crescent Town, Teesdale, these east end apartment districts, who have organized, who have brought demands to landlords about above-guideline increases, about the poor conditions they’re living in,” he said.

Webber says that small “mom-and-pop” landlords, who rent out their basements, have a limited role in Toronto’s rental troubles.

But those homeowners could also have a role in creating more affordability, said Jake Fry, a laneway home builder in Vancouver, who is the co-founder of non-profit Small Housing BC.

Its premise is to maximize the potential of city land by building more units on single-family lots. It’s a way of bringing in more revenue to city and creating more smaller, affordable homes, he said.

His company, Smallworks, has built about 300 laneway homes in the last 10 years and Fry says sales have doubled since the COVID lockdown.

One large lot might accommodate five households — either through townhomes or a mix of reconfigured space, including laneway and basement suites.

The homeowner lives in one unit and three others could be sold at market price. Because of the higher density, however, those homes would be more affordable. The final unit would go at a deeply discounted price and is designated “affordable” in perpetuity.

The property owner comes away with more profit than they would if they were selling to downsize into a small condo and they have the option of putting some of that back into staying in one of the units on the same property — likely larger and more upgraded than the alternative.

“This has a benefit all round. Cities, which are now struggling for money, will now have a bit more revenue through taxation,” said Fry. “We’re struggling with affordability but now we’re looking at private owners playing the role and finding a solution.”

About 85 per cent of the laneway homes he’s built were made to solve family issues — adult children, who couldn’t afford to buy; seniors who can’t keep up big houses.

Fry thinks many of those clients would benefit from Small Housing BC’s value proposition. The non-profit is working with the city of Vancouver to establish three projects and come up with a province-wide model. It would act as a province-wide program administrator.

Fry, who knows Toronto, says the idea could work in places such as Leaside or Etobicoke. Suburban land has been underutilized, he said.

“Homes are about about 30 per cent bigger than they were in the 1970s and ’80s and they’re housing about 30 per cent less people.”

Revising our ideas about housing

We need to change our attitude and our practices when it comes to appropriately sheltering more Canadians, say the experts. Here are some of their ideas for rethinking the affordability problem.

Choose homes over investments

We have to stop treating housing as an investment and start treating it as homes, says Eric Swanson, executive director of Generation Squeeze, a research and advocacy group for adults aged 20 to 40.

But changing that attitude would mean severe pushback from homeowners, banks and mortgage companies, which are all invested in appreciating real estate values.

Gen Squeeze suggests that we shift our taxation system to rely less on income and find ways of capturing the huge gains being generated by real estate. At the same time, we have to protect homeowners from a correction, should the market fail to generate that wealth.

“The more we expect home ownership to be profitable, the more housing becomes unaffordable,” he said.

Reduce our economic dependence on real estate

Generation Squeeze founder, UBC professor Paul Kershaw says real estate, rental and leasing generates about 13 per cent of Canada’s GDP. Yet, the sector accounts for less than 2 per cent of employment. That compares to the construction industry, which generates about 7 per cent of GDP and about 8 per cent of employment.

“We need to get our heads and hearts wrapped around that very dynamic and say that, going forward we don’t want to rejuvenate our economy by organizing around an economic strategy that imagines real estate will continue to grow faster than the jobs it produces and the wages that are in the economy more generally,” he said.

“We will never solve the problem of unaffordability if we don’t say that,” said Kershaw.

Make room for everyone

We need to change our zoning to ensure everybody who wants to live in our communities can find a place and that we build out the appropriate housing forms and density to accommodate that, he said.

CMHC chair Derek Ballantyne thinks there is opportunity in Toronto to open up the “yellowbelt” — the 75 per cent of neighbourhoods zoned for single-family homes — to other forms of housing.

“This is not about coming down a residential street and putting in eight-storey buildings. It’s about selective intervention and it’s about allowing parts of the yellowbelt to intensify,” he said.

Ballantyne said there are intelligent ways of adding more homes to those neighbourhoods that does not destroy their character. In fact, studies show they improve the quality of life, shops and services available to residents.

Because the land would come onto the market as small parcels, it would be less expensive than the cost of assembling large building sites.

“It would be a way for people to be able to afford buying into those neighbourhoods,” said Ballantyne.

Buy rather than build

Instead of trying to build our way our of homelessness and the crisis in affordable housing, which is the current government strategy, perhaps we should look at buying existing rental housing, said Ballantyne.

Buying and renovating or retrofitting buildings is expensive but costs less than building new. It also adds to supply faster. But there is no magic that will make it cheaper to operate those buildings, he said.

Acquiring inventory was used in the 1970s. The early community housing programs included a significant amount of acquisitions because it was the cheapest way to keep families housed for affordable rates, said Ballantyne, who formerly headed Toronto Community Housing Corp.

“It’s not going to be simple because you’re competing with REITs (real estate investment trusts) and other large landlords for a similar inventory. But there may well be a way to incent through tax treatment or other policies the sales of buildings for affordable housing purposes to non-profits or other organizations,” he added.

Build prototypes

Give people structure – bricks and mortar – to explore different housing configurations, including co-ownership, say real estate agent Lesli Gaynor and architect Joanne Lam.

“If options were presented in a different way,”said Gaynor, “people would co-house or co-live or combine on some level.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Katie Daubsfeature Writer', 'Feature Writer', 'With Files Alex Boutilier', 'Bruce Campion-Smith', 'Tonda Maccharles', 'Alex Ballingall']",2020-07-03,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is being investigated for the third time by the federal ethics watchdog, this time for his government’s decision to outsource management of a $900 million COVID-19 student grant program to the WE Charity, where the prime minister’s wife is an “ambassador and ally,” as well as a podcast host.

It’s the third conflict of interest complaint NDP ethics critic Charlie Angus has made to the watchdog about the prime minister.

Angus also wrote to the office about prime minister’s role in the SNC-Lavalin affair and the Trudeau family vacation to the Aga Khan’s private island in 2016, both instances where Trudeau was found in violation of the federal Conflict of Interest Act.

“Now he’s up for a hat trick,” Angus said.

“What I found exceptional with this one is that I wrote the letter this morning and this afternoon the ethics commissioner responded. I’ve never, ever seen him respond that quickly” Angus said of Ethics Commissioner, Mario Dion. “This tells me this has been on his radar for some time.”

In his letter, Angus detailed a potential breach of the act involving preferential treatment, citing the Trudeau family’s close ties with the WE organization. He also noted that the group has “received a series of single-source contracts” from the government. “If preferential treatment has been given … it would be another significant breach of the public trust and the act by this prime minister,” he wrote.

The government’s decision to outsource the student grant program to the charity founded by Craig and Marc Kielburger has come under fire since it was announced June 25.

The Conservatives called for an investigation by the auditor general, and Conservative MP and Ethics Critic Michael Barrett wrote to the ethics commissioner on June 28 with concerns about the prime minister’s connections to the charity.

Trudeau has appeared at WE rallies, and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, is an “ambassador and ally” for the charity and hosts a podcast on mental health for the organization.

As he faced criticism this week, Trudeau said the decision was made not by him, but by the public service, because WE, a Toronto-based charity, was the only “organization that was capable of networking and organizing and delivering this program on the scale that we needed it.”

Then things quickly shifted.

Early Friday afternoon, the government backtracked and said the civil service would be managing the program, not WE.

By early evening, Dion’s office confirmed that the prime minister was being investigated under the Conflict of Interest Act, for possible contraventions of subsections of the law, involving decision-making, preferential treatment and the duty to recuse.

Dion could not be reached for further comment.

A spokesperson from the Prime Minister’s Office said they would co-operate with Dion’s investigation.

“We will, of course, collaborate with the commissioner and answer any questions he may have,” the spokesperson said Friday night.

Barrett, the Conservative ethics critic, said the prime minister should have recused himself.

“We know from one of the principals at the WE group that it was the Prime Minister’s Office who personally informed them that they would be administering the program,” he said.

“That’s very problematic.”

Barrett was referring to a recording, obtained by several media outlets, in which WE’s co-founder Marc Kielburger told a conference call that Trudeau’s office reached out one day after the grant was announced in April.

Kielburger later said he misspoke, that it was a public servant who had called.

Representatives of WE could not be reached for comment Friday evening.

Barrett said the fact that this is the third investigation by the ethics watchdog shows a pattern that the prime minister and his office put “friends first” and “believe that they’re above the law, above the rules,” he said.

Barrett called for more serious penalties for breaching the act.

“I think that Commissioner Dion will probably need his investigators to have a permanent dedicated revolving door to the PMO, they’re there so often,” he said.

In 2019, Dion found that Trudeau broke the law when he applied inappropriate political pressure on then-attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to intervene in a prosecution to spare SNC-Lavalin a criminal conviction.

The fallout from the scandal took its toll on Trudeau’s government. Trudeau’s principal secretary Gerald Butts resigned, Wilson-Raybould quit her cabinet post and Treasury Board president Jane Philpott later resigned to protest the way the government handled the matter.

Both women were later ejected from the Liberal caucus.

At the time of his ruling, Dion wrote that Trudeau’s actions and the interventions by his senior staff with Wilson-Raybould were “tantamount to political direction,” and he rejected Trudeau’s defence that he acted to protect the “public interest.”

In 2017, then-conflict of interest commissioner Mary Dawson said the prime minister broke several laws in accepting a 2016 family vacation at Bells Cay, the Aga Khan’s private island, in December 2016.

In her damning report, Dawson blamed the prime minister and his family for accepting rides to the island on private aircraft organized by the Aga Khan’s staff.

Dawson wrote that Trudeau knew about the Aga Khan’s official dealings with the federal government and that should have been warning enough.

“Mr. Trudeau failed to arrange his private affairs in a manner that would prevent him from being placed in a conflict of interest. Neither Mr. Trudeau, nor his family, should have vacationed on the Aga Khan’s private island,” she said.

Trudeau apologized and said he would clear all future personal travel with the ethics commissioner.

Angus called the number of investigations “without precedent.”

He said the prime minister has built up a lot of goodwill across Canada during the pandemic and questions why the government would want to privatize the management of a grant program when the civil service has done a very efficient and targeted job providing relief to Canadians.

“That’s going to be the question, and it’s going to damage the prime minister’s credibility on his whole COVID response,” he said.

Read', 'Douglas Quanvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Dqdouglas Quan Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter', 'Douglas Quanvancouver Bureaufri.']",2020-07-03,"VANCOUVER — Minutes before showtime inside Auditorium 1 at Scotiabank Theatre in downtown Vancouver, it happened.

A woman at the end of my row coughed.

I turned to my right. OK, good, she’s masked. So was I.

Surveying the roughly 18 others seated in the auditorium, I realized no one else was.

For a fleeting moment early Friday afternoon, I wondered if I’d made the right decision to volunteer for this assignment: documenting the first day of the reopening of theatres across much of Canada.

But as I scanned the quiet, cavernous theatre, I detected no hint of pandemic-related nerves. A few moviegoers chomped on their popcorn. Others played on their phones.

Among those taking in a movie were friends Martine Dubuc and Alison Wald from Squamish, B.C., who were looking to make a day of it in the big city and reclaim a bit of normalcy.

“I miss seeing movies,” Wald told me.

“It just felt good to get out of town,” Dubuc added.

It was that sort of attitude that Cineplex was banking on as it reopened theatres not only in British Columbia, but in Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Landmark Cinemas chain of theatres also reopened doors Friday in B.C. and Saskatchewan. Both chains had reopened some theatres in Alberta a week ago.

It’s been a turbulent few months for the industry, questions swirling about whether theatre chains could survive an extended shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In its first quarter this year, Cineplex reported a net loss of $178.4 million. Revenue fell to $282.8 million from $364.6 million, while attendance plunged to 10.7 million from nearly 15 million a year ago.

In an attempt to woo customers back, both chains are offering discounted tickets and have introduced “enhanced cleaning protocols” along with social distancing measures.

Toronto-based Cineplex says seating capacity has been reduced by 60 to 80 per cent, depending on location, to ensure proper physical distancing. Between showtimes, the auditorium seats and handrails are “wiped down with industrial-grade cleaning products.”

Concession stand offerings have been pared down to popcorn and a few other items.

True to billing, the moment I walked through the front doors Friday, a masked employee was ready, waiting to wipe down door handles. After I presented my e-ticket on my phone, I took the escalator to the concession stand where I paid for a soda from another masked employee standing behind Plexiglas.

The only surface I touched was the screen of the soda dispenser. But there were hand sanitizing stations everywhere.

Those of us in Auditorium 1 were spread comfortably throughout the theatre.

Landmark, which is based in Calgary, has adopted similar safety and cleaning measures, though its CEO, Bill Walker, says they disinfect their auditorium seats by spraying a fine mist over them — a process known as “fogging.”

“It’s odourless and biodegradable,” he says. A “hygiene officer” is deployed every shift to ensure cleaning is up to snuff, the company says.

While employees at both chains are requiring staff to wear masks, guests are only “encouraged” or “welcome” to wear them.

That did weigh on me before I stepped into the theatre. In an interview last month with culture and entertainment website Vulture, Dr. Robert Lahita, a professor of medicine at New York Medical College, said: “You know how the air is in a theatre: It’s not circulated very well. If you don’t wear a mask, you take your chances.”

Fortunately, Friday’s 12:15 p.m. showing of the slick psychological horror film The Invisible Man — filled with creaking floors and what’s-around-the-corner dread — proved to be the perfect escapist antidote to my pandemic worries.

Neither Landmark nor Cineplex would say what kind of guest turnout they’d had in the past week in Alberta other than to say they were “pleased” or “pleasantly surprised.”

“I think there’s a lot of pent-up demand to get out and do something,” Walker said.

For now, patrons will have to settle for older movies (Cineplex says Bloodshot and The Invisible Man were the most popular titles this past week in Alberta, while Trolls World Tour and Jurassic Park were big hits at Landmark Cinemas).

Hollywood has slated new releases for later this summer but the timing is uncertain.

“I think specialized films will go first. Cult movies or art films, or things you wouldn’t expect to be sold out or be disappointed by a sparse, one-third full theatre,” said Paul Moore, a sociology professor at Ryerson University who studies the history of movie-going.

Big blockbusters will likely be delayed in hopes of reaching sold-out crowds, he said.

Moore said those predicting that coronavirus will spell the demise of movie theatres may be jumping the gun.

“That sense of going out, anticipating a blockbuster movie or well-reviewed film with a group of people, that’s a priceless social experience,” he said.

But when I ask how eager he is to get back into the theatre, he admits a bit of apprehension.

“In my imagination, I’d love to see a summer blockbuster with a sold-out crowd on opening day, but whenever I get a little too close to strangers at the grocery or on the sidewalk, I’m instantly aware that I just couldn’t sit through a movie with strangers right now, no matter how clean the theatre was.

“As for distancing the audience, it may as well be streaming at home if I’m basically seeing it on my own and not enjoying it together with others.”

But for Reagan Eve and Giulio Recchioni, who also attended Friday’s reopening, the small crowds didn’t bother them. After rain cancelled their beach-going plans, they settled on the movies.

“Just to relive some sense of normalcy,” Eve said. “It’s been a rough couple of months.”

While I’m generally not a fan of the horror genre, I enjoyed my two-hour distraction on Friday afternoon.

Mind you, I’m not sure I’m in a rush to return. These days, the real world seems scary enough.

Read', 'Grant Laflechestandard Reporter', 'Standard Reporter']",2020-07-03,"When the paramedics came, Edward Schanck knew it was the end.

He knew it was the last time he would see his home, his wife and his daughter. The virus had won.

His lungs were being crushed under the weight of pneumonia. The fatigue was debilitating. The novel coronavirus had stolen his energy and it was about to take his life.

“He said to me ’I’m not coming back,’” said Michele Schanck White of her last conversation with her father on the day he was taken to hospital. “I said ’Dad, don’t say that,’ but he said he was tired of fighting.”

That was April 7, one day after the 87-year-old was tested for COVID-19 at his residence at the Lundy Manor retirement home in Niagara Falls.

He died on April 8.

The next day his wife Barbara Schanck, 83, was also taken to hospital. COVID-19 had a lethal grip on her too. Her family was not allowed in the home to comfort their dying and grieving mother because of the pandemic lockdown.

She died on April 10.

“We couldn’t be with her,” said Schanck White. “She lost her husband, my father, and no one could be with her.”

Schanck White and her family were gripped with fear for weeks before Edward and Barbara died. COVID-19 was hitting long term care and retirement homes across Ontario like a grenade. Lundy Manor was locked down on March 30, which prevented anyone from visiting the residents to limit the spread of the potentially deadly virus.

But it was too late.

The virus was already in the home, likely travelling in with staff who also worked at other long term care facilities, according to Niagara’s public health department.

On April 2, Schanck White said her family’s fears were realized when Lundy Manor’s executive director sent a letter to the family of residents to inform them of the home’s first COVID-19 related death.

“We are in the fight of our lifetimes here and our staff, and managers are doing absolutely everything in our powers to prevent this horrible outcome,” wrote Greg Fortier. “I, as the leader, feel deeply responsible and guilty for this loss.”

Fortier wrote there were other infected residents, but could not provide an exact number. He outlines the cleaning measures the home was taking and make a plea for donations of protective equipment.

By the time the outbreak was declared over on June 1, 41 of Lundy Manor’s 91 residents contracted COVID-19. Nineteen of them, including Schanck White’s parents, died.

The home made headlines across Ontario when it was revealed it held a “pub night” for residents after the provincial government issued emergency orders to fight the pandemic on March 17.

It is now the subject of a $20 million class-action lawsuit by the families of residents which alleges the operators of Lundy Manor “failed to take all reasonable, necessary and protective measures to ensure the residents and staff of Lundy Manor were safe.”

Since the lawsuit was filed, the home’s spokesman said the home would no longer provide public comment about COVID-19’s impact on the facility.

The suit’s allegations have not been proven in court.

Fortier’s admission of remorse did little to stem Schanck White’s fears at the time. It does less to salve her grief now. Her family has yet to join the suit against Lundy Manor for fear of losing money from Barbara and Edward’s estate if the suit fails.

But she agreed with the action’s characterization of Lundy Manor.

“I think it was mismanagement. They failed terribly,” Schanck White said. “They should have done more to keep the residents safe ... We have to live every day with the loss of our parents, who were beautiful people, beautiful parents and grandparents.”

When Edward and Barbara moved into Lundy Manor in November 2018, it was supposed to be a safe place to spend their twilight years together. Although four years older, Edward was in better health than his wife. But helping her and taking care of their Niagara Falls home had become too much.

Schanck White said their first choice was to move to Seasons retirement home in nearby Welland — which would also suffer a deadly COVID-19 outbreak around the same time as Lundy Manor — but a unit at Lundy Manor came up first.

Although not their first choice, it seemed like the best decision for them at the time, Schanck White said. Her parents were comfortable. They remained active and made regular use of Lundy Manor’s common areas to play Bingo and euchre.

The idyllic times would not last. On March 10, a British Columbia man in his 80s became Canada’s first recorded COVID-19 death. The next day the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 a global pandemic.

The virus spread and Schanck White’s concern for her parents deepened.

She visited Lundy Manor to see her parents on March 14. She did not know it, but it would be the last time she would see them in person.

Three days later, the Ontario government declared a state emergency. Lundy Manor would not enact physical distancing rules until March 26 and imposed its lockdown on March 30.

“After the lockdown I went there to drop a package off, but I couldn’t see them,” Schanck White said. “I had to wave at them through a window.”

In that time span, life continued in Lundy Manor much as it always had. The Schancks still enjoyed their euchre games. March 28 was the date of the pub night which earned the home the wrath of Premier Doug Ford. Niagara’s public health has told The St. Catharines Standard that eight people attended the pub night.

The Schancks did not attend, but their daughter said she was worried the virus could strike Lundy Manor, putting them in the pandemic’s firing line.

“We were scared. We were nervous. But we were hoping and praying (Lundy Manor) was equipped to handle it and were following all the health ministry’s guidelines,” Schanck White said.

Then came the April 2 letter from Fortier.

“Today is a tragic day for Lundy Manor and I feel the need to report to everyone that we have lost a resident to this pandemic,” he wrote. “Everyone within the Lundy Manor family feels this loss and is devastated.”

Fortier, who wrote he would be forever changed by the home’s first COVID-19 death, urged the family to support the home if its staff recommends a resident be sent to hospital.

“We plead that you agree with our opinion,” he wrote. “We respect and appreciate everyone’s reluctance to leave their homes and at any other time we would respect those wishes. But due to the limitations we now face in terms of staff we cannot promise the amount of care your loved one may need until we get some relief.”

Within days, Edward felt the first signs of his novel coronavirus infection. He was tested for COVID-19 on April 6, but his oxygen levels were crashing and he was sent to the St. Catharines hospital the next day.

As he predicted, Edward never returned home.

Schanck White called her mother on April 8 to tell her that her husband was gone. It was their final conversation.

Barbara’s fever was spiking. Schanck White said her mother was “a little delirious.” Like her husband, Barbara had severe pneumonia. With her oxygen levels declining, she was also was brought to the hospital, where she tested positive for COVID-19.

In the space of two days, Schanck White’s world crumbled.

“We’re devastated,” she said. “Elderly people move into retirement homes and think they will be safe. They weren’t safe.”

Read', 'Morgan Lowriethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Morgan Lowriethe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-03,"MONTREAL—Canada has failed in its duty to protect vulnerable elders in long-term care, according to a highly critical report that examines the issue in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

The report released Friday by the Royal Society of Canada found the pandemic was a “shock wave” that exposed many long-standing deficiencies in the system and caused high levels of “physical, mental and emotional suffering” for seniors.

“Those lives lost unnecessarily had value,” reads the report by a working group that was chaired by Dr. Carole Estabrooks at the University of Alberta.

“Those older adults deserved a good closing phase of their lives and a good death. We failed them.”

The working group, which was created by the Royal Society’s COVID-19 task force of scientists and researchers, said the causes of the failure are complex but are rooted in what they called “systemic and deeply institutionalized implicit attitudes about age and gender.”

It found that 81 per cent of Canada’s COVID-19 deaths have come in long-term-care homes, far higher than what is reported in comparable countries, including a 31 per cent figure in the United States, 28 per cent in Australia and 66 per cent in Spain.

The authors say Canadian homes have allowed staff-to-patient ratios to drop and have increasingly shifted to an unregulated workforce in recent years, even as patients are living longer with diseases that require increasingly complex care, such as dementia.

“(Those unregulated workers) receive the lowest wages in the health-care sector, are given variable and minimal formal training in (long-term care), and are rarely part of decision-making about care for residents,” reads the report, which notes that many of these workers report being overworked and suffering from high rates of burnout.

In contrast, the proportion of registered nurses has fallen, and many residents lack access to comprehensive care including medical, health and social services and therapies, even though the needs are greater than before.

The report notes that authorities have failed to listen to the voices of long-term-care residents and those who care for them — both groups overwhelmingly composed of women. Women are also more likely to be the unpaid caregivers who are increasingly called upon to fill the gaps in the system, the authors said.

Long-term-care homes were uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19, combining an already-sick patient base with a disease to which nobody has immunity, the report says. Homes in Canada are often older and feature shared bedrooms and bathrooms, which made containing COVID-19 a challenge.

However, the report also notes that basic infection controls and personal protective equipment were often lacking and that many employees worked in multiple facilities, increasing the chances of spreading the virus.

“We have a duty to care and to fix this — not just to fix the current communicable disease crisis, but to fix the sector that enabled that crisis to wreak such avoidable and tragic havoc,” the authors wrote.

The report makes nine recommendations, which it says are geared towards addressing a workforce crisis that leaves homes understaffed and employees underpaid and overwhelmed.

The authors called on Ottawa to develop federal national standards for staffing and training, and to make provincial funding contingent upon meeting them.

The federal government should also ensure data is collected on resident quality of life, care standards and worker satisfaction and ensure it is analyzed by a third-party body, the report says. That data should also take into account disparities caused by race, ethnicity, gender identity, poverty and other vulnerabilities.

Provinces must “immediately implement appropriate pay and benefits, including sick leave, for the large and critical unregulated workforce of direct-care aides and personal support workers” and offer them ongoing training and mental health support, the report’s authors said.

Unregulated staff should be offered full-time work, and provinces should evaluate “one workplace” policies that prevent employees from moving from site to site, the report concludes.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Raneem Alozzistaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Raneem Alozzi Is A Breaking News Reporter', ""Working Out Of The Star'S Radio Room In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter""]",2020-07-03,"With Toronto’s summer in full swing, the urge to run headfirst into the first body of water in sight is intensifying.

Environment Canada has put out a heat warning for the city until early next week, with highs of 32C expected on Saturday and Sunday.

Social distancing measures are still in place and complicating the fun.

Before you dive in this weekend, here are some things you should know:

Where can you take a dip? Ten of Toronto’s 11 beaches are open for lakeside fun. (Rouge Valley Beach is closed.)

On Canada Day, visitors packed Wasaga Beach, a two-hour drive from Toronto, prompting the town to schedule shut down most of the beach area as of July 9. The town is determining how it will limit capacity in the parking lots.

Beach-goers also packed Ashbridges Bay in Toronto on Canada Day, but that’s yet to prompt any shutdowns. Premier Doug Ford said Friday that there won’t be any provincial orders on beaches and the issue is at the discretion of the chief medical officer.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, the associate medical officer of health with the City of Toronto, said people still need to exercise caution if they arrive at a beach and find it crowded.

“We are still advising (people) to avoid public gatherings and large crowds where physical distancing cannot be maintained, including beaches,” she told the Star.

“If a beach is busy, we recommend you be flexible with your plans and come back at a less busy time.”

City-run pools and have also reopened, and have limits on the number of people who can enter to ensure social distancing, Dubey said.

The City will continue to monitor litter, alcohol, improper parking, bonfires and DJs around beaches.

Could I get fined? Bylaw officers and police will also continue to have a presence at beaches and parks where there are splash pads.

Provincial orders restricting gatherings of more than 10 people who are not members of the same household or social circle remain in effect,” Dubey said.

Fines for violating a provincial order under the Emergency Measures Act can range from $750 to $100,000, and include up to one year in jail.

Can COVID-19 be spread through the water? At this time, there’s no evidence that the coronavirus can be spread through water, Dubey said.

“COVID-19 spreads mostly through direct contact with the respiratory droplets of someone who is infected with the virus through coughing, sneezing or talking, even when someone does not have or has not yet developed symptoms,” she said.

“This is why it is so important for everyone to practice physical distancing, keep six feet away from others, wash our hands often, and stay home if we are sick.”

When it comes to masks, the City isn’t advising you attempt to wear them while swimming, she said. Instead, you should wear them before heading into the water when you notice distancing yourself from others isn’t possible. You should also wear them while indoors if you’re using a changing room.

How will measures differ at City-run pools? If you’re heading to a City pool, everyone must sign in before entry, even if they are not swimming. Visitors will also be required to answer COVID-19 screening questions, and provide their first name and contact information.

The procedures will help the City with contact tracing if re-opening leads to a spike in infections.

Only two people will be allowed in pool changing rooms at the same time. Once your swim session has ended, you will leave through the site’s emergency exit, unless you need to use a washroom.

Following the heat warning issued by Environment Canada, the City has announced that extended pool hours are now in effect. This is the first time this summer that pool hours have been extended.

Alex Duff Pool, Earlscourt Park/Giovanni Caboto Pool, Monarch Park, Parkway Forest, Smithfield Park and Sunnyside Park/Gus Ryder Pool will be open, weather permitting, until 11:45 p.m. and may continue to operate with extended hours until the heat warning ends.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-03,"Kids and teens may be at less risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults but their well-being has been affected by the lockdown measures, according to a study just released.

Last May, in the middle of the pandemic that has forced people into lockdown for weeks, Maximum City surveyed some 356 young people aged nine through 15 in the GTA. The results show the impacts of COVID-19 are different and unevenly distributed among the kids, said Maximum City’s director Josh Fullan.

There’s a group of kids who are “doing just fine,” even some who are “thriving” under these new circumstances — with freedom away from school and more time with parents. But there’s another group of kids who are “really struggling.”

“This is the group that we need to be concerned about,” Fullan said. “They’re showing a confluence of negative factors such as less time outside, more time with technology, less physical activity, less engaging school and less social connections.”

Among the findings, the study showed that the majority of respondents — 72 per cent — are going outside their homes less than once a day. Seventy-three per cent reported spending more time with technology, and nearly half of the respondents admitted to spending “too much time” with screens.

Only 28 per cent of those surveyed said they’re feeling happier now than before the pandemic, something Fullan said is “concerning” from both physical and mental health aspects.

Maximum City, a multidisciplinary group of designers, teachers and urban planners who work on issues of youth and engagement in urban settings, is still sorting through the various components of the data to pin down the factors that contribute to how children and youth are feeling during these pandemic times. They have yet to do a deep analysis of the findings based on socio-economic factors such as household income or ethno-racial background of respondents.

But in a general sense, a study that’s in the works looking at children and youth nationally shows that kids in large Canadian cities, particularly Toronto, are impacted more negatively by the lockdown measures than their peers in smaller towns and rural areas.

That makes sense for Fullan. Compared to elsewhere in Canada, young people in Toronto have fewer places to play outside of their home and less space inside their homes. They feel less safe when they go outside, they’re less physically active, and the feelings they report since the pandemic tend to be for the worse, he said.

“I think that’s concerning for an urban nation like Canada,” he said, noting nearly two in five people in Canada live in the 15 largest cities.

“It’s something that requires a dedicated policy response from governments.”

As various parts of the country continue to ease into reopening phases, Fullan said it’s clear that kids need more support to be physically active and outside, away from screens. They also need more collaborations and interactions with their teachers and peers. That’s one of the key ingredients that’s missing from the current online school experiences, he said.

Toronto Public Health recently released its map showing the city’s neighbourhoods that have been the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. It showed the areas stricken by economic and social inequalities were the most vulnerable. Fullan would not speculate if further analysis of the findings from the Maximum City study would show similar trends.

Last year Maximum City did a study for the City of Toronto Children’s Services looking at the child friendliness of nine communities. The highest score any neighbourhood received for kids’ safety and well-being was 64 out of 100. The average 52.

“That was the time before the pandemic,” said Fullan, noting there was already a sense of lower safety and well-being among Toronto kids.

The online survey involved 356 responses from nine- to 15-years-olds and a parent or guardian living in the Toronto census metropolitan area. It was done between May 8 to 26. A full description of the survey’s methodology along with results and questions are available online.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-03,"HALIFAX—With an increasing number of Nova Scotians complaining on social media about seeing cars with American plates entering the province, Premier Stephen McNeil has pledged to keep a closer watch on those showing up at the border from outside Atlantic Canada.

However, McNeil also warned Nova Scotians not to jump to conclusions about the people in those cars, saying most of them are probably Canadian citizens coming home after living or working abroad.

The premier made the comments today as the four Atlantic provinces lifted travel restrictions for residents to reflect the region’s relatively low and stable COVID-19 infection rates.

Residents of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, P.E.I. and Newfoundland and Labrador can now travel to any of the other three provinces without self-isolating for 14 days after arriving — but isolation remains the rule for anyone arriving from outside the region.

Even though the Canada-U.S. border is closed to non-essential travel, Canadians citizens living in the United States are allowed to enter Canada, as long as they have a passport.

McNeil says Nova Scotians’ growing concerns about people coming from the United States has prompted his government to ramp up its efforts to keep track of those entering the province who are not coming from another part of Atlantic Canada.

Read', 'Annie Karnithe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Annie Karnithe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence postponed a planned trip this week to Arizona after Secret Service agents set to travel with him tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms, two administration officials said Thursday.

Pence had been scheduled to visit Arizona on Tuesday, but multiple factors related to the spread of the virus foiled those plans, according to a person familiar with Pence’s travel.

A swift rise in new cases in the state has overwhelmed testing centres in recent days, and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, ordered bars, gyms and movie theatres closed this week. In an apparent acknowledgment of outbreaks erupting across the South and the West, the vice-president cancelled his plan to headline a “Faith in America” campaign rally in Tuscon on Tuesday and then tour Yuma with Ducey.

Instead, Pence opted for a shorter visit to Phoenix on Wednesday, where he participated in a public health briefing at Sky Harbor International Airport.

“Help is on the way,” Pence said at a news conference with Ducey at the airport, after descending the steps of Air Force Two wearing a mask, the latest sign of the administration’s evolving stance on face coverings.

But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to be in proximity to the man who is second in line for the presidency were some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms of COVID-19, or tested positive, was first reported by the Washington Post.

A spokeswoman for Pence did not respond to a request for comment.

Catherine Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, said late Thursday that the agency does not comment on how it protects principals in government. But she added that “the health and safety of our workforce, their families, and that of our protectees remains the agency’s highest priority.”

Still, the latest illnesses among the small circle of individuals who interact directly with the vice president were a reminder of the dangers of carrying on with campaign and official government travel as the pandemic rages on.

At least eight campaign staff members who helped plan President Donald Trump’s indoor rally last month in Tulsa, Okla., have tested positive for the virus, either before the rally or after attending, the campaign said. On Thursday, after Herman Cain, a former presidential candidate who had been at the president’s rally in Tulsa, said he had been hospitalized for the coronavirus, a Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, made it clear that Cain had not seen the president in person while at the event. “Mr. Cain did not meet with the president,” Murtaugh said.

In May, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, tested positive for the coronavirus, as did a military aide to Trump.

The president, however, has continued to promote an optimistic message that the worst of the pandemic has passed, even as he has suspended planned campaign events and aides who have worked the ones he has staged have fallen ill.

“We’d like to see churches open quickly,” Trump said at a news conference Thursday morning, praising the latest job numbers, even as the country reported more than 53,000 new cases. “A lot of people would have wilted. We didn’t wilt. Our country didn’t wilt.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Ian Adamswasaga Sun', 'Wasaga Sun', 'Ian Adamswasaga Sunfri.']",2020-07-03,"The public’s “blatant disregard” for the rules of social distancing has resulted in Wasaga Beach laying out a plan to shut down the majority of the main beach area by July 9.

The only access permitted would be three walkways to reach the water, and so the public can access businesses along what was Beach Drive.

Anyone who chooses to flout the new rules by walking on the municipal portion of the beach will also face a hefty fine: $750.

The rules do not apply to beach areas under the auspices of Wasaga Beach Provincial Park.

The decision during an emergency council meeting Thursday came after a busy Canada Day that saw the road — which, with high water levels, is currently the main beach area as it’s under 60 centimetres of sand — packed with beachgoers.

The town’s emergency management co-ordinator and deputy fire chief, Craig Williams, called the disregard for social distancing and gathering recommendations on Canada Day, and the previous two weekends, “human behaviour at its worst.”

The beach area, a two-hour drive from Toronto, would be closed to the public by July 9 and “for the foreseeable future.”

The municipal lots would be reduced in capacity by half.

Mayor Nina Bifolchi said while the previous two weekends on the beach had been busy, the crowds on Canada Day “took it to a whole new level.”

Bifolchi told Simcoe.com that the town’s pandemic command team had little choice but to make that recommendation “for the health and safety of our community and our residents.""

“Over the last weekend and on Canada Day, the blatant disregard for social distancing and the rules (for the pandemic) were completely ignored by those visiting the beach area,” she said.

Council also directed the mayor to send a letter to the OPP and Ontario Parks expressing the town’s frustration with what has been seen as inaction on the part of both provincial agencies to enforce the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which mandates that groups be limited to 10 people or fewer.

Bifolchi said the letter would be asking both agencies to work more in partnership with the municipality to enforce the rules.

The town is still determining how it will limit capacity in the parking lots. The beach area under the control of the town will be fenced off, with signs indicating the area is off limits and anyone disregarding the bylaw will be subject to a fine.

Bifolchi said the command team will continue to monitor the parking situation, “and if we feel we need to close it beyond that, we will do that.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dr. Wajid Ahmed says he issued the public health order requiring the isolation of workers to protect them from the virus.

He made the decision after 191 workers at the unidentified greenhouse tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend.

Ahmed says today that if there is further risk to workers on local farms he may issue additional orders.

Premier Doug Ford said Thursday the work stoppage will not encourage local farmers to participate in efforts to combat the virus.

Ahmed says he did not take Ford's comments as criticism of his policy, and that he and the premier agree protecting workers is the top priority.

A group representing greenhouse growers in Ontario's Windsor-Essex region said the work stoppage has escalated fears about testing for the virus.

The Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers said in a statement that the public health order has contributed to anxiety among both farmers and workers.

The growers group said it is working with the sector and the provincial government to address those fears as on-farm testing continues.

Ontario reported 165 new cases of COVID-19 and two new deaths related to the novel coronavirus Friday.

The total number of cases now stands at 35,535, which includes 30,909 marked as resolved and 2,682 deaths.

The province reported 179 resolved cases over the previous day.

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Friday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

6 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting 37,558 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,731 deaths, up a total of 164 new cases since Thursday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases were reported in a small handful of health units. Just Toronto (80 new cases), Peel Region (21 cases) and York Region (20 cases) reported increases in the double digits; of the remaining 31 units, just Windsor-Essex saw more than five new infections.

Meanwhile, three more fatal cases were reported Friday, two in Toronto, one in the Southwestern region. The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported 155 patients are hospitalized with COVID-19, including 40, who are in an intensive care unit, of whom 25 are on a ventilator. These numbers are all near the lowest levels in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,682, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:43 p.m. There are 105,027 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, according to The Canadian Press, including 8,663 deaths, and 68,658 cases resolved.

This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario; see this file.):

Quebec: 55,682 confirmed (including 5,560 deaths, 25,158 resolved)

Ontario: 35,535 confirmed (including 2,682 deaths, 30,909 resolved)

Alberta: 8,202 confirmed (including 155 deaths, 7,505 resolved)

Saskatchewan: 796 confirmed (including 14 deaths, 711 resolved)

Manitoba: 314 confirmed (including seven deaths, 302 resolved), and 11 presumptive cases

Nunavut reports one case presumed to be COVID-19.

3:08 p.m.: Soon after the four Atlantic provinces lifted travel restrictions within the region early Friday, heavy cross-border traffic was reported across the Maritimes.

Residents of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island can now travel to any of the other three provinces without self-isolating for 14 days after arriving — a change that has created a so-called Atlantic bubble.

Video footage from the Confederation Bridge showed a steady stream of vehicles heading to P.E.I. after midnight when the restrictions were lifted.

2:55 p.m.: A new report on the COVID-19 crisis in long-term care homes has concluded that Canada failed in its duty to protect its elders.

The report released today by the Royal Society of Canada found the pandemic was a “shock wave” that exposed many long-standing deficiencies in the system.

The group’s COVID-19 task force of scientists and researchers said the causes of the failure are complex but are rooted in what they call systemic and deeply institutionalized attitudes about age and gender.

2:45 p.m.: The mayor of Ottawa says he’s working to make cloth masks mandatory indoors in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 while restarting the economy.

Jim Watson says he and a councillor will bring forward a motion on July 15 to create a bylaw mandating the use of masks in indoor public spaces.

He says the move will help protect the community from increased transmission of the novel coronavirus while also giving businesses the chance to reopen.

Watson’s announcement comes after several other Ontario cities made similar moves, including Toronto and Windsor.

Toronto’s bylaw was passed last week and comes into effect on July 7.

Premier Doug Ford has resisted calls to make masks mandatory across the province, saying a regional approach is best given the relatively low infection rate in some parts of Ontario.

2:30 p.m.: A top Canadian government health official says the Toronto Blue Jays aren’t guaranteed to get an exemption for the regular season.

The Blue Jays got clearance to hold training camp in Toronto starting this week. But the regular season will require players to frequently travel back and forth between the United States.

“That’s a totally different ballgame,” Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s Deputy Chief Public Health Officer, said Friday.

Njoo said it’s too early to say if an exemption will be granted, but said health officials will examine a plan. He noted a lot of American states that have teams are seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases.

“We have to look at it very carefully,” Njoo said. “Our priority is to safeguard the health and safety of all Canadians.”

Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro said the team hopes to know within 10 days where it will play regular-season games.

MLB requires an exemption to a requirement that anyone entering Canada for nonessential reasons must self-isolate for 14 days. The U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel until at least July 21. There is wide expectation that will be extended.

Public Health Agency of Canada spokeswoman Marie-Pier Burelle said the Blue Jays were granted exemption for training camp in Toronto on “national interest grounds.”

The Blue Jays are moving their camp from its spring training complex in Dunedin, Florida, where players reported for intake testing. The team will create a quarantine environment at Rogers Centre and the adjoining Toronto Marriott City Centre Hotel, which overlooks the field.

The Blue Jays will use four locker rooms and employ social distancing during training camp. They will not play exhibition games with other teams during training camp. Precautions at the hotel include contact-less check-ins and discouraging the use of elevators.

Njoo called the training camp plan “minimal risk.”

Shapiro said visiting teams would not leave the confines of Rogers Centre and the hotel attached to the stadium if the regular season plan is approved. Players’ union spokesman Chris Dahl said the association had not yet signed off on the plan.

COVID-19 cases are surging in Florida as health officials reported a new single-day record total of 10,000 new cases in a day recently, and before this week several Blue Jay players and staff in Dunedin had tested positive. Ontario reported 165 new cases Friday.

Shapiro said the players prefer to be in Toronto.

2:30 p.m.: With an increasing number of Nova Scotians complaining on social media about seeing cars with American plates entering the province, Premier Stephen McNeil has pledged to keep a closer watch on those showing up at the border from outside Atlantic Canada.

However, McNeil also warned Nova Scotians not to jump to conclusions about the people in those cars, saying most of them are probably Canadian citizens coming home after living or working abroad.

“There are lots of stories circulating, conversation on social media about Americans and others who are coming into our province and not self-isolating,” the premier told a virtual news conference.

“If this is true, this is not acceptable. If you commit to self-isolating for 14 days, we expect you to keep your word.”

2:25 p.m.: The Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario says it plans to revoke the liquor licence of a Toronto club accused of hosting a secret indoor party attended by up to 150 people.

The AGCO says it has suspended Goldie’s licence while it begins the revocation process.

It says the move is related to “serious violations related to public safety.”

Earlier this week, police alleged that between 125 and 150 patrons were allowed to enter the club on June 26 for a party where no social distancing regulations were enforced.

Police said the owner, manager and corporation will be charged with failure to comply with an order made during a declared emergency.

Investigators noted the establishment doesn’t have outdoor seating or a patio of any sort.

Bars and restaurants are currently only allowed to serve customers in outdoor settings in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19.

1:55 p.m.: Emergency Management Ontario teams have been dispatched to Essex County to help local officials house, feed and arrange medical care for almost 200 workers who tested positive for COVID-19 at an industrial greenhouse that was effectively shut down by the outbreak.

“It’s all hands on deck down there,” Premier Doug Ford said Friday.

The teams are aiding the Red Cross and staff from the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit as they try to contain the outbreak at the massive Leamington greenhouse operation that grows tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.

The Star’s Rob Ferguson has the full story.

1:25 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford apologizes for saying farm workers in Windsor-Essex hid from COVID-19 testing, saying he received “misinformation” on Thursday. Here’s that earlier story.

12 p.m.: Windsor’s medical officer of health is defending his decision to order a work stoppage at a local greenhouse with a COVID-19 outbreak after farmers and Ontario’s premier said the move will make growers less likely to co-operate with testing efforts.

Dr. Wajid Ahmed said Friday that he issued the public health order after 191 workers at an unidentified greenhouse in the Windsor-Essex region tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend.

Ahmed said he may issue additional orders if there is further risk to workers on local farms.

“The evidence in this particular farm pointed to the fact that there is an ongoing risk,” he said. “And that risk needs to be mitigated and controlled to protect the workers . . . and it may happen again, if there is any risk, and I don’t think that anyone would disagree.”

12 p.m.: The province announced Friday that Canadian Forces personnel who were deployed to some of Ontario’s hardest-hit long-term care homes are leaving the facilities.

The soldiers were deployed to the homes in April after the province requested their help from the federal government.

A report from the soldiers in May highlighted shocking conditions in some of the homes, with allegations such as rooming COVID-19 positive patients with uninfected ones, insect infestations and aggressive resident feeding that led to choking.

Ford praised the work of the Canadian Forces members in the seven long-term care homes.

“From providing relief to our frontline workers, to taking care of our loved ones in long-term care homes, they have been there for their fellow Canadians when we needed them most,” he said in a statement.

The government said inspections at all of the military-supported homes have been completed and provincial inspectors remain on site.

11:55 a.m.: Quebec is announcing 19 new deaths due to COVID-19, including seven that occurred in the last 24 hours.

The other 12 deaths occurred before June 25, bringing the province’s total to 5,560. There were also 89 new cases reported, for a total of 55,682.

Hospitalizations dropped below 400 with a decline of 19 people from the 411 reported Thursday. Of those, 31 are in intensive care.

Health authorities completed 8,662 tests on July 1, which remains well below the province’s stated goal of 14,000 tests per day.

11 a.m.: When COVID-19 hit, Paintbox Bistro, a restaurant located in Regent Park, quickly transformed into a store. Why? The goal was to keep her staff employed and continue providing a resource to feed lower-income residents.

The Star’s Karon Liu has the full story.

10:20 a.m. (updated): Youth Minister Bardish Chagger says the WE organization won’t manage the federal government’s $900-million program to pay students and fresh graduates for volunteer work this summer.

In a statement this morning, Chagger says it’s a “mutually agreed upon decision.”

Since the charity founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger was announced as the manager of the program last week, the sole-sourced deal has been criticized because of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s close relationship with the group.

Trudeau and Chagger have said repeatedly that the recommendation to use WE for the work came from the public service, not politicians.

10 a.m.: All those warnings from small cottage country mayors to stay away this spring haven’t discouraged Torontonians from hunting for vacation homes, realtors say. In fact, the pandemic is boosting those real estate numbers.

9 a.m.: Outdoor patios at restaurants and bars have been given the green light to grow, allowing more people to dine or have a drink in the open air as summer gets into full swing.

Premier Doug Ford said the government has amended emergency orders to cut red tape and allow municipalities to quickly pass temporary bylaws clearing the way during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The measure follows consultations with chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams and a push from Progressive Conservative MPP Gila Martow (Thornhill), who proposed the idea in May to help restaurants and bars struggling to stay afloat selling take-away food, beer, wine and spirits.

8:25 a.m.: The public’s “blatant disregard” for the rules of social distancing has resulted in Wasaga Beach laying out a plan to shut down the majority of the main beach area by July 9.

The only access permitted would be three walkways to reach the water, and so the public can access businesses along what was Beach Drive.

Anyone who chooses to flout the new rules by walking on the municipal portion of the beach will also face a hefty fine: $750.

The town’s emergency management co-ordinator and deputy fire chief, Craig Williams, called the disregard for social distancing and gathering recommendations on Canada Day, and the previous two weekends, “human behaviour at its worst.”

The beach area would be closed to the public by July 9 and “for the foreseeable future.”

The municipal lots would be reduced in capacity by half.

Mayor Nina Bifolchi said while the previous two weekends on the beach had been busy, the crowds on Canada Day “took it to a whole new level.”

7:18 a.m. The scale of coronavirus infections in English care homes was laid bare on Friday, adding to the pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson over his handling of the pandemic.

A survey of more than 9,000 institutions found that 56 per cent had at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 since the outbreak began, according to the Office for National Statistics. In total, 11 per cent of all care-home residents tested positive for the disease, almost double the rate in the community as a whole.

The government has come under fire for its failure to shield vulnerable people in care homes, with the ONS now estimating that over 19,000 residents in England and Wales died from the virus as of June 12. In the initial stages of the outbreak, some hospitalized residents were discharged into the facilities without a negative test to show they weren’t carrying the disease.

Speaking on LBC Radio on Friday, Johnson described the significant loss of life in care homes as “absolutely tragic” and promised a “proper examination.”

“Far too many lives were lost in care homes and we mourn for everyone,” he said. “I bitterly, bitterly regret every single loss of life that we’ve had. Whether an earlier lockdown would have made the crucial difference is something we will have to look at.”

Staff working arrangements also influenced levels of infection. Those that employed more workers from agencies, or had staff working across multiple sites, showed a greater spread of the virus. There was also evidence that care homes that provide sick pay had lower levels of infection, as staff were more likely to take time off work.

7 a.m.: The pandemic has dinged the auto sector, but one part of the industry is faring better than it was before the crisis: used cars.

Sales of used vehicles in the U.S. have roared back after dropping 38 per cent in April, when states were shut down and some dealerships were forced to close. In June, used-vehicle sales rose 17 per cent above the pre-pandemic forecasts, according to research firm J.D. Power.

A confluence of factors is drawing buyers to the used-car lot. Some have used federal stimulus checks on their purchases, dealers and analysts say. Interest rates have fallen during the pandemic, to about 4.73 per cent on average for a 36-month used-car loan, from about 5 per cent in early March, according to Bankrate.com.

Meanwhile, many dealers are having trouble getting new vehicles from the factory, after the health crisis forced auto makers to close their plants for nearly two months this spring. That has led salespeople to more readily redirect customers to the used-car lot, dealers say.

The used-vehicle market’s swift recovery is a relief for dealers and auto makers, which have seen other areas of their businesses upended by the pandemic.

6:10 a.m. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un urged officials to maintain alertness against the coronavirus, warning that complacency risked “unimaginable and irretrievable crisis,” state media said Friday.

Despite the warning, Kim reaffirmed North Korea’s claim to not have had a single case of COVID-19, telling a ruling party meeting Thursday that the country has “thoroughly prevented the inroad of the malignant virus” despite the worldwide health crisis.

Outsiders widely doubt North Korea escaped the pandemic entirely, given its poor health infrastructure and close trade and travel ties to China, where COVID-19 emerged late last year.

Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with similar symptoms to the disease.

Experts say the country’s self-imposed lockdown is hurting an economy already battered by stringent U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program.

The Korean Central News Agency said Kim during the politburo meeting of the Workers’ Party “stressed the need to maintain maximum alert without a slight self-complacence or relaxation” as the virus continues to spread in neighbouring countries.

The agency said Kim sharply criticized inattentiveness among officials and violations of emergency anti-virus rules and warned that a “hasty relief of anti-epidemic measures will result in unimaginable and irretrievable crisis.”

The North’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper published several photos of Kim at the meeting, which were the first state media images of him in weeks. Neither Kim nor the ruling party officials who participated were wearing masks.

5:01 a.m.: Toronto’s northwest corner — which has been hardest hit by COVID-19 — is part of a larger hot spot of vulnerability that extends beyond the edges of the city, suggesting a broader regional cluster of high infection rates that defies boundaries and is exploiting socioeconomic inequalities, according to experts and public health data.

Officials are still trying to puzzle out why Toronto’s northwest corner has seen the city’s highest infection rates, and who, exactly, has been impacted most.

Recent reporting from the Star found that these neighbourhoods have some of the highest concentrations of residents who are low-income, racialized and living in cramped housing while working in higher-risk sectors like manufacturing. These findings were echoed Thursday by newly released data from Toronto Public Health showing that neighbourhoods with these characteristics were correlated with higher case counts.

5 a.m.: The four Atlantic provinces are lifting travel restrictions within the region today, with an agreement that’s causing a mix of anxiety and excitement among people in the region.

Residents of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island can now travel to any of the other three provinces without self-isolating for 14 days after arriving.

The premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick have hinted restrictions could soon be lifted for visitors from the rest of Canada if all goes well.

Some residents have criticized the so-called “Atlantic bubble” over fears the novel coronavirus could re-emerge in the region, but health officials are encouraging people to trust the science behind the decision and keep following health measures.

4:16 a.m.: South Africa’s reported coronavirus cases are surging.

Its hospitals are now bracing for an onslaught of patients, setting up temporary wards and hoping advances in treatment will help the country’s health facilities from becoming overwhelmed.

The spike comes as the country has allowed businesses to reopen in recent weeks to stave off economic disaster after a strict two-month stay-at-home order worsened already high unemployment and drastically increased hunger.

In Johannesburg, the largest city, health officials said they are considering reimposing some restrictions to try to slow the spread of the virus.

4 a.m.: A group representing greenhouse growers in Ontario’s Windsor-Essex region says a work stoppage at a local farm due to a COVID-19 outbreak has escalated fears about testing for the virus.

The Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers says in a statement that the public health order has contributed to anxiety among both farmers and workers.

On Wednesday, the region’s medical officer of health issued an order that required an unnamed farmer whose greenhouse has an active outbreak involving 191 workers to isolate those employees and stop work.

The medical officer of health for Windsor-Essex issued the order after a rash of positive tests over the weekend.

The growers group says it is working with the sector and the provincial government to address those fears as on-farm testing continues.

Premier Doug Ford said Thursday the work stoppage will not encourage local farmers to participate in efforts to combat the virus.

6 p.m.: Interest payments were already draining the bottom line at Cirque du Soleil Holdings LP before the pandemic froze its revenues, according to a report by the monitor in its bankruptcy protection case.

Ernst & Young, the firm overseeing Cirque’s restructuring under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada, said its net loss increased to $80 million last year from $10.2 million in 2017.

“During that period, the applicant’s financial position deteriorated as a result of the losses sustained and the increasingly debt heavy capital structure,” the monitor said in a report.

The pandemic hit the 36-year-old company just as it emerged from a string of acquisitions that helped it diversify from its original acrobat-based shows. The deals, which included Blue Man Productions Inc., help Cirque increase revenue to $1.04 billion last year from $882 million in 2017, but also put it deeper into debt.

As of March 31, Cirque owed its first lien creditors $901 million and its second lien creditors $154 million. It also owed $32 million to shareholder Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and an equal amount to Fonds de solidarite des travailleurs du Quebec, the monitor’s report said.

Montreal-based Cirque filed for protection from creditors on Monday after the coronavirus forced it to close shows around the world. A creditors’ group has said a proposal by existing shareholders — TPG, the Caisse and China’s Fosun International Ltd. — to restructure the live performance company is “doomed to fail” and there is no chance they will accept it.

The shareholders’ group proposed refinancing the company with new capital and giving creditors a 45% equity stake in exchange for wiping out most of its debt. Now the company will go through a process to see if another investor can improve on that offer.

Cirque had $1.47 billion in liabilities at the end of 2019, about five times shareholders’ equity.

Thursday 5 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,389 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,728 deaths, up a total of 154 new cases since Wednesday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases reported Thursday came in a small handful of health units. Just Toronto (77 new cases), Peel Region (23 cases) and York Region (21 cases) reported increases in the double digits.

New infections are down sharply, even in these regions. In Toronto, for example, the long-term average rate of new infections has fallen from 196 per day in early June to just 53 daily as of Thursday.

Four more fatal cases were reported Thursday, all in Toronto.

The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier, the province reported the Canada Day holiday meant it had incomplete information on the number of Ontarians currently hospitalized with COVID-19. The most recent totals of patients hospitalized, in the ICU or ventilated in Ontario hospitals were near the lowest levels in records that were first made public in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,680, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

Thursday 2:45 p.m.: More than three million Canadians either lost their jobs or had their hours significantly reduced due to COVID-19, according to Statistics Canada.

And now that economies across the country are reopening, some people are looking to change course, having realized their careers aren’t as viable as they may have been pre-pandemic.

Many are going back to school to pursue an entirely new profession — for example, Ryerson University’s Chang School of Continuing Education saw a 15 per cent jump in its spring enrolment, according to dean Gary Hepburn, even after the school’s in-person courses had to be cancelled.

Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-03,"Allison Gibson not only felt the pressure of keeping Paintbox Bistro in business during the pandemic, but to also help the surrounding Regent Park neighbourhood with jobs and access to healthy food.

Since April, the restaurant and catering company, at the corner of Dundas St. E. and Sackville St., has been transforming into a food store. Through a partnership with a local grocery start-up called Nibbly, Gibson has been filling the former restaurant space with shelves of product and rehiring her staff. This week, the food shop is open for pickup orders and same-day delivery. In addition, a separate initiative is underway to offer groceries at a reduced cost to help feed lower-income area residents.

“We’re a for-profit business but from the beginning we made a commitment to put the money back into the community,” said Gibson, Paintbox’s director of operations as well as Nibbly’s operations manager. “We prioritize hiring people who live in the neighbourhood. We partnered with schools, organizations and charities to give people jobs. We always paid a living wage, give peer mentoring and job training, support single mothers and people in precarious situations. Come as you are and we’ll help you.”

Paintbox opened eight years ago, dubbing itself a social enterprise where the goal is to provide job opportunities for neighbourhood residents by operating as a bistro, caterer and event space. Gibson is well aware of the challenges in Regent Park, a historically under-resourced neighbourhood that’s been going through mass gentrification in recent years.

It’s why, she said, it’s important that the Nibbly store will be accessible to lower-income residents, particularly Black families as they are more likely to experience food insecurity in the city.

In addition to the online grocery delivery and pickup model that many restaurants and stores have already pivoted to, Gibson said Nibbly will also offer a subsidized delivery option and set up a community corner store where area residents can purchase items with slightly damaged packaging (but otherwise perfectly edible) at a discount. Nibbly will also create food baskets of pantry items for families in need.

The idea for Paintbox turning into a grocery and prepared foods operation came at the last minute, Gibson said. As the pandemic hit in March, and events and gatherings were cancelled at rapid speed, Paintbox lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in catering business.

“Not having money coming in meant I couldn’t hire or train people,” she said. “It was inevitable that we had to declare bankruptcy. We didn’t want to do it, but we had a deadline date in April. It just so happened that the night before I was on the phone with the founders of Nibbly.”

The grocery start-up needed a space for their operation while Paintbox had a restaurant and catering space sitting empty. Both businesses had common goals of funnelling money into local charities and non-profits so Nibbly’s founders also brought Gibson on as an operations manager since she was already familiar with the needs of the neighbourhood and knew who to hire.

Despite restaurants now opening their patios and building Plexiglas shields in their dining rooms in anticipation of further loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, Gibson said she plans on Paintbox being a retail operation for a while to ensure the safety of her employees and to meet the needs of residents opting to stay home rather than eat out. She also said they’ll be expanding delivery zones throughout the GTA as the staff gets used to the new operation.

“You need the profits to make a difference and divert funds back into the community. When we were producing a $500,000 event, instead of driving a Maserati we were paying people $18 to $20 an hour and providing mentorship,” she said. “We work with the city of Toronto, I am on an United Way advisory board and we partnered with Dixon Hall and the Yonge Street Mission. If you’re not helping others, what are you doing right now?”

Officials are still trying to puzzle out why Toronto’s northwest corner has seen the city’s highest infection rates, and who, exactly, has been impacted most.

Recent reporting from the Star found that these neighbourhoods have some of the highest concentrations of residents who are low-income, racialized and living in cramped housing while working in higher-risk sectors like manufacturing. These findings were echoed Thursday by newly released data from Toronto Public Health showing that neighbourhoods with these characteristics were correlated with higher case counts.

This week, public health units across the GTA — including Toronto, Peel, York and Durham — held an inaugural meeting to discuss how to address common issues related to COVID-19, including how to better transfer information and identify cross-border patterns. The next meeting will focus, in part, on Toronto’s northwest corner, “given the possible inter-jurisdictional impact,” Toronto associate medical officer Dr. Vinita Dubey said in an email.

Unlike Toronto, Peel does not have just one geographic region where the highest COVID infection rates are concentrated. Its map of COVID cases has several patches of darkly shaded areas, indicating where rates are highest.

But one hard-hit cluster appears next to Toronto’s northwest corner, just across the highway dividing these two regions. The neighbourhoods that straddle this border share similar socioeconomic characteristics, census data suggests.

For example, the Peel neighbourhood with the highest community infection rate is in Malton, with 1,094 COVID cases per 100,000, on par with some neighbourhoods in northwest Toronto — and 30 times that of the Peel neighbourhood with the lowest COVID burden.

In that Malton neighbourhood (defined by census tract), 26 per cent of households are low-income, more than double the average in Peel. There are also higher rates of overcrowding, with 23 per cent of homes classified as unsuitable, meaning there are not enough bedrooms to accommodate the households living there.

Meanwhile in York, which shares Toronto’s northern border, the public health unit’s COVID map shows that one area where infection rates have been higher is along the southwestern border with Toronto. Workplace outbreaks, including in Vaughan’s manufacturing sector, have also largely infected workers who live in Toronto, according to medical officer Dr. Karim Kurji.

“We’ve known for quite some time that there are significant linkages between places such as northeast Brampton, North Etobicoke and southwest York,” said Dr. Lawrence Loh, medical officer with Peel Region.

“I still remember when we had our first few cases in Peel Region, the interconnections we (saw) when we conducted contact tracing … it became very clear that there are no invisible walls that exist between Toronto and Peel and York.”

Viruses don’t stop at regional borders; nor do the systemic issues that make certain people more vulnerable to COVID, said Nation Cheong of United Way Greater Toronto, whose research has mapped a growing number of low-income neighbourhoods in Toronto’s northwestern corner, and across the border, in Peel.

These are some of the same neighbourhoods highlighted on the COVID maps released by Toronto and Peel, that show the uneven way the virus is affecting communities across the GTA.

“When you overlay the maps, you see a direct correlation,” Cheong said. “What this clearly shows us is that growing income inequality, and the vulnerability that is inherent with that, has no boundaries.”

Toronto’s associate medical officer of health, Dubey, said “cross-border connections and shared risk factors are very common” among Peel, Toronto and York, which are “neighbouring health units.”

Many Peel communities closest to Toronto’s northwest corner are also “very closely connected across employment and cultural lines” to their Torontonian neighbours across Highway 427.

This part of Peel is the logistics, warehousing and manufacturing hub of the GTA because of its proximity to the airport, Loh added. This hub may also be an important employment region for people living in Toronto’s northwest corner, where Mississauga and Brampton are among the top four workplace destinations for residents in these neighbourhoods, according to Statistics Canada data.

These “are places where people are precariously employed and where people can’t necessarily work from home,” Loh said. “Pretty much all of the outbreaks we have seen, at least in the city of Brampton, have been related to facilities of that nature: shipping facilities or warehouses, or large manufacturing or processing plants.”

In mid-June, Peel released preliminary findings from its collection of race-based data on COVID cases, finding that a “disproportionate burden of illness is experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups.”

The most commonly reported races were South Asian (28 per cent), East/Southeast Asian (16 per cent) and Black (15 per cent). White was reported for 27 per cent of cases; according to census data, people who are not visible minorities make up 38 per cent of Peel’s population.

For Varsha Naik, executive director of The Regional Diversity Roundtable in Peel, “definitely race is a factor in considering the impacts of COVID and considering how well supported individuals are in these communities.”

“Looking at certain neighbourhoods being harder hit, you cannot miss the point in asking the question, why is that so? Is the quality of life a factor? Is poverty a factor? Is race a factor? Is lack of sufficient resources in certain communities a factor?” she asks.

“Yes, we are all at risk, but we are at different (levels of) risk.”

In one Peel census tract near Toronto’s northwest, 23 per cent of people are low-income, 22 per cent live in unsuitable housing, and 13 per cent work in manufacturing — some of the highest proportions in the region. This area has the fifth-highest COVID rate in Peel.

One Brampton neighbourhood, which has the region’s fourth-highest infection rate, is just a few minutes’ drive from Toronto’s northwest corner, on the border with York. This census tract is almost entirely made up of visible minorities (94 per cent) and has the region’s highest percentage of residents who work in retail (16 per cent) — a sector that employed many essential workers during lockdown.

York Region medical officer Dr. Karim Kurji said he first started investigating the possibility of clustering along his region’s southern borders about a month ago, when Dr. David Williams, Ontario’s medical officer of health, saw data from Toronto that showed clustering in its northwest corner.

According to Kurji, Williams asked him and Peel Region to investigate “whether there were any clusters in the northwestern part of Toronto ... around the border between Peel and York region.”

“At that time, I think we did see some concentration in York Region that was abutting on those areas,” he said. “Our hypothesis was that there are many workers that live outside the region, and it is possible that they are living on the borders of York region.”

Kurji said his health unit is still exploring these questions. He agrees that workplace outbreaks in York — particularly in the manufacturing sector of Vaughan — could be affecting specific Toronto neighbourhoods like the northwest corner where employees are potentially concentrated.

As of June 22, York Region had 475 cases tied to workplace clusters or outbreaks (defined as two or more cases), largely in manufacturing plants and warehouses — and nearly half have infected workers from Toronto.

Vaughan, meanwhile, is a leading work destination for residents of Toronto’s hardest-hit northwest neighbourhoods, according to data from Statistics Canada.

“We really have to try and pursue this virus wherever we think it’s hiding,” Kurji said.

Experts agree that it’s right for public health resources to focus on Toronto’s northwest corner, where COVID rates have been highest, but those efforts must extend beyond the regional border.

“One question is — are we seeing just one (hot spot)? Or are we just seeing the Toronto portion of a larger hot spot?” asks Dr. Stephen Hwang, director of the MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions at St. Michael’s Hospital. “Is it truly restricted to that area?”

When Canada’s Atlantic premiers announced a travel bubble for the four eastern provinces last week, Elayne Lord’s business suddenly picked up.

Lords Seaside Cottages in Cape Traverse is a seven-kilometre drive southeast of Borden-Carleton, where the Confederation Bridge sets down in P.E.I. after spanning the Northumberland Strait from New Brunswick.

Almost immediately after the travel bubble announcement, Lord received cottage bookings from four New Brunswick families for this first weekend. Booking 40 per cent of her units in one fell swoop — she has 10 cottages on seven acres of land — was a relief in a summer in which the pickings have been slim.

“It’s like three nights, two nights, that kind of stuff … usually I’m (renting) weekly,” said Lord. “(But now) when somebody says, ‘Can you take two nights?’ I’m like, ‘Whatever. I’ll take it.’ I’ll take whatever. Get me through the summer to get me through the winter.”

But with that relief came trepidation, as the island on Friday opens to outsiders for the first time in almost four months.

After isolating itself, P.E.I. has only had 27 coronavirus cases; and the last sufferer recovered several weeks ago. The island has been COVID-19-free since then.

Some, like Lord, are worried that streak might be about to end.

So she’s bought a board to tell visitors they’re not welcome if they can’t follow social-distancing rules. She’s stocked up on hand sanitizers in all the cottages.

“It’s a little nerve-racking,” she said Thursday.

She can’t afford to be sick, because with so few bookings she hasn’t been able to hire anyone to help out with the cottages. On top of that, she’s looking after her elderly mother.

“If people don’t want to play by the rules, they’re going to be asked to leave,” she said. “That’s just the way it is right?

“My mom’s 88. I look after her. So I need to be safe and everybody that comes needs to be safe.”

While the Atlantic travel bubble is a cause for small consternation, balanced with the need for business, the next potential stage, for people like Lord, is even more troubling.

“I really don’t want the Americans coming over,” she said. “And I really don’t want Quebec and Ontario. I know that sounds bad or whatever, but it’s just too dangerous.”

In Newfoundland, St. John’s resident David Brake was in the process of planning a late-July trip to Prince Edward Island with his two children on the eve of the travel bubble’s opening.

While he would usually plan a vacation further afield, Brake decided to take advantage of the travel bubble this year and visit a new province, scheduling a flight to Halifax, with plans to stop in New Brunswick on the way to P.E.I.

He said he’s confident the trip will be safe for his family, given the low coronavirus case numbers at the moment.

But he’s pondering how his holiday might be perceived by neighbours upon his return, with many Newfoundlanders still skeptical about whether it’s safe to venture off the island that has so far beaten back the virus.

“If I’m not isolated because nobody asked me to, am I going to be a pariah for two weeks? Are my children going to be a pariah for two weeks?” he asked.

An online petition asking Newfoundland and Labrador to keep its borders closed has generated nearly 15,000 signatures this week.

“Our province has been slowly healing and going back to normal, we want to keep it that way,” the petition reads. “This is not the time.”

Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, Newfoundland and Labrador’s chief medical officer of health, addressed fears that the province is moving too fast in a news conference this week, pointing to low case numbers while encouraging residents to trust in science.

Nova Scotia, the most populous province in the region, has reported three new COVID-19 cases this week, two related to travel to the U.S. and the third involving a temporary worker who arrived from outside Canada.

Speaking after a cabinet meeting Thursday, Premier Stephen McNeil addressed concerns about the bubble, telling Nova Scotians the economic opportunity won’t come at the expense of their health.

“Our tourism sector needs this, and we need to try to make it work, but I want to reassure all of you that if we see a spike of COVID, we will re-evaluate,” McNeil said.

For those planning trips to another province, some identification and preventive measures will be required.

Adults travelling to Nova Scotia must show proof of residency in one of the four provinces in order to enter without having to isolate for 14 days.

Prince Edward Island is asking visitors to fill out a form with details including proof of residence, health declarations and planned arrival and departure dates for each person.

New Brunswick has a similar pre-registration for travel planned, but it is not online yet, and the province has advised travellers to be prepared for lineups for the next several days.

Newfoundland and Labrador will require two pieces of ID establishing residency.

Marine Atlantic, a Crown corporation running ferry services between Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, said it’s seen a spike in bookings, with 3,000 reservations booked in the first six days following the Atlantic bubble announcement.

A statement said the bump “exhausted” capacity, which had been limited to allow for proper distancing and adherence to public health measures. The company will be slowly increasing passenger limits in coming weeks.

While tourism operators welcomed the news, some say the Atlantic bubble won’t bring in enough revenue for their businesses to survive.

Carol Alderdice, president of the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick, said visitors from within the region won’t be enough to help struggling businesses through the difficult year.

She said Atlantic Canadians typically account for just over 30 per cent of tourism visits in the province, and most operators are eager to see restrictions on entry eased for visitors from elsewhere in Canada, especially Ontario and Quebec.

“It’s definitely not enough to make up for the season, absolutely not,” Alderdice said from Fredericton.

COVID-19 has made it worse,"['Jenna Moon', 'Jenna Moonstaff Reporterthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Jenna Moonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Jenna Moon Is A Breaking News Reporter For The Star', 'Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-02,"The issues faced by Canada’s migrant workers aren’t new, but COVID-19 has amplified them and brought the issue under the microscope in recent weeks.

In Windsor-Essex, the last region in Ontario yet to move to stage two of the province’s reopening plan, the spread of the virus through agri-food workers has led to the deaths of three people, with hundreds more falling ill.

Speaking to the Star Thursday, Syed Hussan, the executive director of Migrant Workers Alliance For Change, said that systemic inequality for migrant workers means a lack of even the most basic of support. On Saturday, the Migrant Workers Alliance For Change will be hosting a sit in at the office of Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino, while the Migrant Rights Network will be rallying nationwide.

The groups are calling for full immigration status for non-permanent residents, so that migrant workers can protect themselves during the pandemic.

Who is classified as a migrant worker?

Migrant workers refers to anyone that is a non-permanent resident of Canada, such as those who are temporary foreign workers, undocumented workers or international students in low-wage positions, Hussan explained.

“For us, when we’re saying migrants and migrant workers, we’re actually talking about all non- permanent residents in the country. That means temporary foreign workers in the agricultural sector or domestic work,” as well as working refugee claimants, he said. “The reason for that is that all of these people are coming into the country with temporary status — and most of them don’t get them resident status.”

By not securing permanent resident status, workers end up shut out of services and are unable to assert their basic rights, Hussan said.

Around 750,000 temporary permits are being issued each year, he said. “Many of them can’t renew those permits, many of them can’t get permanent resident status and so they then become undocumented.”

What issues do migrant workers face?

The rights afforded to permanent residents Canadian citizens are largely non-existent for migrant workers.

Seeking health care is particularly challenging. “If you’re undocumented, you have no access to health care. If you’re a migrant, you may not have it for three months. You may not have it while you’re renewing permits,” Hussan said, noting his network is aware of people who are undocumented giving birth at home because they couldn’t afford hospital fees.

Additionally, workers do not have access to high-paying jobs, and are working in precarious, low-wage positions. There are virtually no paths to complain about unsafe working environments and labour rights typically do not extend to migrant workers.

“They are excluded from labour rights and protections in most cases. And because of the temporary immigration status, speaking out against a bad boss is dangerous. It can mean deportation. It can mean homelessness, it can mean that you’re being kicked out of the country,” Hussan said.

Migrant workers might be paying into EI or CPP, but are unable to access the services linked to those payments.

Beyond that, many migrant workers are separated from family and cannot visit with them. “They can’t visit their families. Sometimes you’re separated from your children for (up to) 25 years,” Hussan said. “All of this creates a situation of grave instability and precarity, which has a substantial deteriorating effect on your personal emotional health and well-being of your community.”

How has COVID-19 made these situations worse?

The pandemic has had “disastrous” consequences for Canada’s migrant workers, Hussan said. “First and foremost is that the shutdown of the economy and the lack of access to any of them or most of the emergency income supports meant that people started starving.”

Some workers have missed paycheques for four months, meaning that they need loans from friends or community members. Meanwhile, fees have not gone down. “Tuition, for example, for international students has gone up. Domestic workers have (been) trapped in the family’s homes,” he said.

“Where you are working, your work is intensified. You’ve been locked down, but many other people have lost working wages. So it’s basically created a spiral of a crisis, which is impossible to recover from. There’s no return to normal.”

Read', 'Ben Spurrtransportation Reporter', 'Transportation Reporter', 'Ben Spurr Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Transportation. Reach Him Email At Bspurr Thestar.Ca Or Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-02,"Starting next week, one of the few enclosed public spaces in Toronto where residents won’t be required to wear a face mask will be on a GO Transit vehicle.

On Thursday, the TTC made it mandatory for passengers on the city-owned transit system to wear a mask in order to fight the spread of COVID-19, and Toronto’s new bylaw requiring face coverings in a wide range of indoor spaces will go into effect next Tuesday. When it does, Torontonians will be required to wear masks in settings from retail stores to houses of worship, from grocery stores to community centres.

But while Metrolinx, the provincial agency that oversees GO Transit and the UP Express, is “strongly encouraging” its riders to wear face coverings, it hasn’t enacted a mandatory mask rule for its passengers.

Agency spokesperson Anne Marie Aikins said throughout the pandemic Metrolinx has followed the advice of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams, “and will continue to do so regarding face coverings.”

Despite Metrolinx figures indicating only between 30 and 50 per cent of GO passengers are wearing face coverings, Aikins said the approach of merely encouraging mask use has been effective. Out of a workforce of more than 4,300, 12 Metrolinx employees have either tested positive for COVID-19 or been deemed a “probable” case, and “we have not experienced an outbreak related to GO or UP,” she said.

Metrolinx has instituted other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including frequent vehicle cleaning, and signs and floor markings to help people stay the recommended two metres apart. The agency said Thursday it’s launching a pilot of installing plastic dividers between seats on five GO trains and 30 buses to prevent riders from being exposed to airborne respiratory droplets that can carry the virus.

GO Transit carries far fewer people than the TTC. Daily ridership on the provincial commuter network is now less than 30,000, but before the crisis hit it exceeded 270,000, compared to about 1.8 million for the TTC.

Despite the mismatch in the size of the two organizations, Councillor Joe Cressy, chair of Toronto’s board of health, said it was important for the provincial and city transit agencies to be on the same page. Complicating the issue is there are some places, like the city-owned Union Station, where the two systems intersect.

“Mask usage only works when nearly everybody does it, and that requires consistent policies and consistent communications,” he said.

On Tuesday, on the advice of Toronto Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, council voted to ask the province to enact a bylaw that would complement the city’s by mandating masks in enclosed spaces under provincial jurisdiction, including transit.

“This is to ensure that all enclosed spaces in Toronto will be protected so we can continue to reduce virus spread in our city,” Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto Public Health’s Associate Medical Officer of Health, said in a statement.

In response to questions about why the province’s top doctor hasn’t required transit users to wear masks, Ministry of Health spokesperson Christian Hasse said Dr. Williams “has stated repeatedly that it is recommended that everyone wear a face covering when they will not be able to physically distance properly. If people are unsure if they should wear a mask — they should err on the side of caution and wear one.”

Dr. Colin Furness, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, said that by encouraging mask use instead of mandating it, Metrolinx is sending the message that “we’re not serious about safety.”

“I would advise nobody to ride on a GO train at all… until they put a (mask) policy in place,” Furness said.

The set fine for not wearing a mask on the TTC is $195, but the agency has said it expects voluntary compliance will be high and strict enforcement won’t be necessary. On the first day of the new rule, mask use was far from universal, at least according to anecdotal accounts. On Thursday a Star photographer observed many people not wearing masks on the Dundas streetcar.

Despite fears that public transit could be a particularly high-risk environment for the spread of COVID-19, there is little evidence directly linking outbreaks to transit systems. Some experts believe that has more to do with contact tracing methodology than an absence of transmission, however.

Read', 'Jennifer Pagliarocity Hall Bureau', 'City Hall Bureau', 'Jennifer Pagliaro Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering City Hall', 'Municipal Politics For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-02,"The city of Toronto is being asked to provide voluntary housing where people who test positive for COVID-19 can self-isolate, if they live in overcrowded areas and can’t distance from others at home.

The request from the city’s board of health comes after it heard Thursday about updated Toronto Public Health data on marginalized groups who are more at risk of contracting the virus.

That includes the group that is the most “underhoused” — where the number of people per household exceeds the typical capacity — which had the highest case rate at 568 per 100,000 residents.

Toronto Public Health told the board Thursday this trend was the most “pronounced” of all the characteristics it looked at in its study, with the case rate being almost four times higher among people living in areas with high levels of overcrowding.

The recommendation approved by the board Thursday asks council to request city staff work with public health agencies at the provincial and federal level “to support Toronto Public Health’s work on the establishment of a volunteer isolation/quarantine centre system, as well as other methods to achieve effective isolation for individuals who are unable to safely and effectively isolate at home.”

“The risk of COVID-19 shouldn’t depend on where you live, how much you make, or how many bathrooms you have in your home,” board chair Coun. Joe Cressy said in a statement. “We need to do everything we can to mitigate vulnerabilities to this virus, and to make sure everyone has an equal opportunity to reduce transmission and protect their loved ones.

“In this case, that means working with our government partners to make sure people have somewhere to go if they can’t safely self-isolate at home.”

The Toronto Public Health data also confirmed earlier reports that case rates are higher in the lowest-income areas with newcomers, and that Black and other people of colour are over-represented in the case data.

While the city overall has met key indicators to allow Toronto to move to Stage 2 of the province’s reopening, which saw patios, hair salons and other services open, the Star previously reported how the city’s northwest corner has been hardest hit, looking at the differences in workplaces, housing and access to health care as risk factors.

The city, meanwhile, said it is preparing to return community centres across the city to their regular uses. The roughly 200 homeless residents living in those centres as temporary shelter sites were being moved to hotels.

In a news release, the city said it planned to open new locations to be able to maintain physical distancing between all shelter beds and that, to-date, almost 290 people sleeping in outdoor encampments have been moved to hotels, temporary or permanent housing.

On Thurdsay, Premier Doug Ford announced $150 million in relief for municipalities to help improve homeless shelters and create housing opportunities.

When it was pointed out that amount spread among all municipalities would do little to help cities like Toronto, Ford said the province was “committed” to giving more money to municipalities, but blamed the federal government for holding up an agreement.

Tory, noting the “urgent” nature of the city’s need for funds, said he hoped that money would be matched by the federal government and any bureaucratic disagreements sorted soon. He said given the city bears an unequal responsibility for homelessness in the region, it would be pushing to a fair share of the $150 million.

Toronto expects to have at least a $1.5 billion shortfall by the end of this year as a result of the pandemic.

Read', 'Michael Tuttonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Michael Tuttonthe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-07-02,"HALIFAX — Nova Scotia has announced its third recent case of COVID-19 involving people arriving from outside the country, with the latest being a temporary foreign worker from Mexico.

The string of new infections comes after the province had gone three weeks without any new cases.

Premier Stephen McNeil said Thursday the temporary foreign worker tested positive for the virus during his initial 14-day quarantine period. The worker has remained in isolation since testing positive.

The two other individuals with COVID-19 both were Nova Scotians who had travelled to the United States.

On Wednesday, the province announced that passengers on a flight from Toronto to Halifax last week may have been exposed to COVID-19. The Nova Scotia Health Authority said the potential exposure occurred June 26 on WestJet Flight 248.

In the latest case, McNeil said the protocols in place for temporary foreign workers worked.

“Public health is doing the important work of contact tracing .... It’s a very good reminder to all of us that COVID-19 is still present in our province,” he said.

The cases acquired by Nova Scotians in the United States come amid a growing spread of the virus in many American states.

The number of new confirmed novel coronavirus cases in the United States climbed to a high of more than 50,000 per day on Thursday, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.

McNeil meanwhile confirmed that Atlantic Canadians will be allowed to travel throughout the region as of Friday.

McNeil said this is being permitted despite the recent cases in Nova Scotia because the presence of the virus in the four provinces remains low, and the tourism industry is struggling.

Read', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Star', 'Toronto Star', 'Evelyn Kwong Is A Star Digital Producer Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-02,"Less than a month after opening, a popular Parkdale burger joint has shut down over a rent dispute.

Aunty Lucy’s owner Chieff Bosompra says that his business, which opened June 3 cooking out of Duggan’s Brewery at Queen Street West and Brock Avenue, will close after serving customers on Canada Day.

“It feels slightly disheartening to be strong-armed,” Bosompra says. “But in business you need to be able to read the room and that’s something he didn’t do — raising the rent by 10 times a month later is never OK.”

A post Wednesday afternoon on the brewery’s Instagram disputes Bosompra’s story.

“We invited them in at the heat of the epidemic. RENT FREE, please just cover the utilities they might generate, around, $600 a month we thought,” the post read. “We agreed to a one month pop up. A good deal, a steal, just ask anyone in the business. Turns out they were so successful they actually used around $2,500 in utilities, garbage, lots of gas etc in costs for the month, that’s a lot of burgers.”

The post said Bosompra’s business has only paid $500, although both sides have known about the extra costs for a while now.

“We were told by Aunt Lucy’s that that they wanted to stay but are not willing to pay ANY RENT (and it turns out any of the extra costs we incurred for them being here),” the post read. “Well, so who is going to help pay the landlord? Seems not Aunt Lucy’s.”

Throughout the last few weeks, Bosompra said that Duggan’s Brewery owner Michael Duggan had congratulated him on the success of his new venture.

Bosompra said he inquired about extending their agreement — which was never signed in a contract — after his restaurant fulfilled thousands of orders in a month and sold out on multiple occasions.

Last week, Bosompra said, he was approached without warning by Duggan who told him that for the month of July, he’d need 10 times the rent he paid for June.

Unable to fulfill the amount, and after consulting with realtors who agreed that the rent for just the kitchen space was way overpriced, Bosompra said he offered to meet Duggan halfway with the rent. Bosompra said he also offered to help him market his brewery and run his Instagram account.

“I felt like we tried hard to meet him halfway and offer him cash value to help him with his beer sales. I have no malice toward him, but he was stuck on a number I couldn’t meet,” Bosompra said.

The Star was unable to reach Duggan for an interview.

Bosompra is now working with commercial real estate agents to quickly find a short-term spot where they can set up for the summer months.

Premier Doug Ford says the app is meant to enhance the province’s contact tracing strategy.

He’s previously said it could play a key role in helping contain the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses reopen their doors.

The app will be voluntary, and will notify users based on a number of criteria, including if they were within two metres of a person who tests positive for the virus and if that contact took place over an extended period of time.

The province didn’t give a new date for the app’s launch.

Read', 'Technology Reporter', 'Science', 'Kate Allen Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Science', 'Technology For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-02,"With Ontario’s race-based COVID-19 data collection beginning “imminently,” health experts say crucial unresolved questions will determine whether those efforts help alleviate the pandemic’s brutal disparities, or cause more harm.

Regulatory changes came into effect last Friday that mandate the collection of information on race for all newly reported COVID-19 cases province-wide, along with data on income, household size and languages spoken. Data collection is beginning once training for public health units and changes to data entry systems are complete, according to a health ministry spokesperson.

Community organizations, researchers, doctors and public health experts have called for the collection of this data, pointing to the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in areas with more racialized, low-income and newly immigrated residents.

But health researchers said the question of how this data is managed and used is even more important than whether it is collected.

“The collection of race-based data is not the outcome,” said Camille Orridge, a senior fellow at the Wellesley Institute and longtime advocate for health equity data collection. “The outcome is to have the information and use the information to reduce disparities. That’s the goal.

“We need to be clear with people who are collecting the data — government, etc. — that there are a number of things that must be answered before we come to the table to give up the data,” she said.

Orridge cited a list of questions, including whether the data will stay in Canada, whether it will be sold in any form to the private sector, how artificial intelligence will be used with the resulting databases. And most importantly, for her: whether the racialized communities most affected will have oversight and input on whether the data is being used to answer questions and create policies that counter the pandemic’s unequal toll.

She cited a phrase often used in the world of Indigenous policy: “Nothing about us, without us.”

Alexandra Hilkene, the health ministry spokesperson, said “We’re currently in the process of finalizing the terms of reference for the working group that will report to the ministry and help ensure we interpret the data accurately. The group will include policy experts from racialized communities.”

In Toronto, some of the neighbourhoods most affected by COVID-19 have case rates 14 times higher than the least affected neighbourhoods. Those hard-hit neighbourhoods are all clustered in the northwest of the city, an area that has been historically underserviced and has higher rates of poverty, inadequate housing, and other symptoms of systemic disadvantage.

The city’s most affected areas also have significantly higher percentages of Black residents than the least-affected areas, and higher percentages of Southeast Asian and other racialized groups. But health experts say these area-based analyses, which rely on matching the postal codes of known cases to census data, are less revealing than collecting the data directly from individuals.

Toronto, Peel Region and some other health units have already begun collecting this data, but officials argued that it should be mandated province-wide to provide a complete picture. After weeks of urging, the province made regulatory changes to the Health Protection and Promotion Act to mandate the collection of race and sociodemographic information for COVID-19.

But now that the government is about to begin collecting that data, it shouldn’t be exclusively available to them, said Arjumand Siddiqi.

“I would worry that if the data stays in the domain of the government, or if they handpick a small group of people to use it and no one else sees it, we have to rely on what those people tell us,” said Siddiqi, Canada Research Chair in population health equity and a professor at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

Making the data available more broadly ensures that independent researchers can check the work of others, rebut flawed analyses and conclusions, and ask different kinds of questions.

But Orridge said it’s also important to ensure that the researchers who do get access to race-based COVID-19 data have real relationships in and accountability to the communities that are most affected.

“We have researchers who have no connection to the communities having access to the data, and making their careers on the use of that data,” said Orridge.

“We’ve got to make sure that the data, when it’s being used and published, always has a context, so that we don’t further stigmatize communities.”

LLana James, a doctoral candidate at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine who researches race-ethnicity, health data, privacy, AI and the law, noted that Ontario and Canada collect health data in a legal framework that has failed to catch up to the massive technological changes that have occurred, especially in the last decade with the rise of machine learning.

“We have one of the lowest thresholds for legal use of data in the developed world,” said James, noting that technology companies see Ontario as an attractive market for lucrative health-care data, and contrasting Canada’s poor data privacy protections with Europe’s robust framework.

James provided critical comments on the province’s proposed regulatory changes to begin collected race-based COVID-19 data, and believes the current, government-driven data efforts will not help Black, Indigenous and other racialized communities.

Race-based data assumes that “we need to know the race of the person, not how racism is functioning. Those are two completely different scientific questions,” James said.

“We have 400 years of data about what happens to Black people during pandemics,” said James. “We have hundreds of years of race-based data, and it’s changed very little. It’s the will to act (that’s missing), not the will to collect more stuff.”

Like Orridge, however, she believes that any data collection that avoids harm must be centred in and directed by communities. James is the co-lead of REDE4BlackLives, a research and data collection protocol that provides a framework for the ethical engagement of Black communities in Canada.

“Black communities, like Indigenous communities, know exactly what they need,” says James. “They know who advocates for them. They know who shows up for them. And they know who to trust, because they see it with their own eyes.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Thursday. This file is no longer being updated. Click here to read Friday’s coverage.

5 p.m. Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,389 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,728 deaths, up a total of 154 new cases since Wednesday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

As has been the case in recent weeks, the vast majority of new cases reported Thursday came in a small handful of health units. Just Toronto (77 new cases), Peel Region (23 cases) and York Region (21 cases) reported increases in the double digits.

New infections are down sharply, even in these regions. In Toronto, for example, the long-term average rate of new infections has fallen from 196 per day in early June to just 53 daily as of Thursday.

Four more fatal cases were reported Thursday, all in Toronto.

The daily rate of deaths has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier, the province reported the Canada Day holiday meant it had incomplete information on the number of Ontarians currently hospitalized with COVID-19. The most recent totals of patients hospitalized, in the ICU or ventilated in Ontario hospitals were near the lowest levels in records that were first made public in early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,680, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system. In the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:33 p.m. There are 104,654 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada, according to The Canadian Press, including 8,638 deaths, and 68,232 cases resolved.

This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario; see this file):

Quebec: 55,593 confirmed (including 5,541 deaths, 25,034 resolved)

Ontario: 35,370 confirmed (including 2,680 deaths, 30,730 resolved)

Alberta: 8,108 confirmed (including 154 deaths, 7,405 resolved)

British Columbia: 2,916 confirmed (including 174 deaths, 2,590 resolved)

Nova Scotia: 1,064 confirmed (including 63 deaths, 998 resolved)

Saskatchewan: 795 confirmed (including 14 deaths, 701 resolved)

Manitoba: 314 confirmed (including seven deaths, 302 resolved), 11 presumptive

Newfoundland and Labrador: 261 confirmed (including three deaths, 258 resolved)

New Brunswick: 165 confirmed (including two deaths, 158 resolved)

Prince Edward Island: 27 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Repatriated Canadians: 13 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Yukon: 11 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Northwest Territories: five confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Nunavut reports no confirmed cases, but one presumptive case.

2:45 p.m.: More than three million Canadians either lost their jobs or had their hours significantly reduced due to COVID-19, according to Statistics Canada.

And now that economies across the country are reopening, some people are looking to change course, having realized their careers aren’t as viable as they may have been pre-pandemic.

Many are going back to school to pursue an entirely new profession — for example, Ryerson University’s Chang School of Continuing Education saw a 15 per cent jump in its spring enrolment, according to dean Gary Hepburn, even after the school’s in-person courses had to be cancelled.

2:30 p.m.: The federal government has extended the mandatory quarantine order for most people entering Canada until the end of August to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Any travellers entering the country — by land, air or sea — will have to isolate for 14 days, whether or not they are showing any symptoms of COVID-19.

The order made under the Quarantine Act, which first came into effect in late March, was set to expire at midnight Tuesday, but will now remain in effect until Aug. 31.

It carries penalties that include six months in prison or a fine of up to $750,000, which could go up to $1 million if the person caused death or bodily harm by wilfully and recklessly breaking the rules.

The updated version of the order also clarifies that travellers must wear non-medical masks while they are entering the country or are in transit to the place where they will isolate, unless they are travelling in private vehicles.

The order does not apply to people who cross the border regularly to ensure goods and services continue to flow, or anyone entering to provide essential services.

2:25 p.m.: Atlantic Canadian provinces will lift travel restrictions within the region starting Friday, with some identification from visitors required.

Adults travelling to Nova Scotia must show proof of residency in one of the four provinces in order to enter without having to isolate for 14 days.

2:15 p.m.: More than a dozen caregivers expressed concerns and worry about the lack of socialization for their preschoolers during the pandemic in response to a social media callout by the Star.

Many of them noted signs of regression, behavioural issues, shyness and sadness in their kids.

2:10 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford says migrant workers are “hiding” from COVID-19 testing going on in Windsor-Essex — a region struggling with outbreaks on farms.

Ford says efforts to ramp up testing on farms is being hindered by a lack of co-operation from the workers themselves.

The premier urged migrant workers to get tested for the virus and promised they would not be sent home if they tested positive.

Ford says the government has been working with local health officials and municipalities to address a spike in COVID-19 cases that has held Leamington and Kingsville, Ont., back from reopening.

The Windsor-Essex Health Unit ordered a work stoppage at one local farm Wednesday after 191 workers tested positive for the virus over the weekend.

Both Ford and the health unit declined to name the farm where the outbreak has occurred.

2 p.m. (updated): Florida’s Department of Health on Thursday confirmed 10,109 additional cases of COVID-19, setting another single-day record and pushing the state’s total confirmed cases to 169,106.

Previously, the highest single-day total was reported on Saturday with 9,585 cases.

There were also 67 new deaths announced Thursday, bringing the statewide death toll to hit 3,617. One additional non-resident death was also announced, bringing the statewide non-resident death total to 101.

On Thursday, the state was still only providing total hospitalization counts — 325 hospitalizations were added, bringing the statewide total to 15,150.

More than half of the new deaths but less than half of the new cases were in South Florida.

—Miami-Dade County reported 2,304 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 18 new deaths. The county now has 40,265 confirmed cases and 1,018 deaths, the highest in the state.

—Broward County reported 961 additional confirmed cases of the disease and nine new deaths. The county now has 17,116 known cases and 394 deaths.

—Palm Beach County saw 412 additional confirmed cases and 11 new deaths. The county now has 14,859 confirmed cases and 523 deaths.

—Monroe County reported 26 additional cases of the disease and one new death. The Florida Keys now have 296 confirmed cases and five deaths.

1:55 p.m.: Nunavut is reporting what may be its first case of COVID-19.

Dr. Michael Patterson, the territory’s chief public health officer, says there is a presumptive infection of a worker at the Mary River Mine, 176 kilometres southwest of Pond Inlet.

He says the person recently travelled to Nunavut for the job and is isolating from co-workers and doing well.

All known contacts have also been placed under isolation.

Nunavut reported what was thought to be the territory’s first case of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet in late April, but it later turned out to be a false positive.

1:06 p.m.: Nova Scotia has announced its third new case of COVID-19 this week, with the latest affecting a temporary foreign worker.

The string of new infections comes after the province had gone three weeks without any new cases.

Public health authorities say the likely source of infection for all three is travel outside of Canada.

Premier Stephen McNeil says the new case highlights the importance of public health directives, particularly the 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival in Nova Scotia from outside Atlantic Canada.

1 p.m.: Toronto’s board of health has approved a proposal that would see the city move towards creating voluntary accommodations for those who test positive for COVID-19 but can’t self-isolate at home.

The proposal calls for the city to seek help from the provincial and federal governments in setting up so-called isolation centres.

The plan must now be presented to the full Toronto city council at its next meeting later this month.

The recommendation was put forward by the city’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, who noted many Torontonians share their living space with others.

Documents filed with the board say other cities, such as New York and Chicago, have set up such facilities where people who test positive for the virus can isolate themselves for free.

Toronto previously created similar accommodations for people experiencing homelessness who need to isolate due to COVID-19.

12:43 p.m.: Public Health Ontario CEO Peter Donnelly, who went on medical leave in early April as COVID-19 was starting to peak, says he will not return because of “cardiac symptoms.”

12:40 p.m.: Nine more NBA players have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 25 of 351 players tested positive since testing began on June 23.

12 p.m.: Several college students in an Alabama city organized “COVID-19” parties as a contest to see who would get the virus first, officials said.

Tuscaloosa City Councilor Sonya McKinstry said students hosted the parties to intentionally infect each other with the new coronavirus, news outlets reported.

McKinstry said party organizers purposely invited guests who tested positive for COVID-19. She said the students put money in a pot and whoever got COVID first would get the cash.

“It makes no sense,” McKinstry said. “They’re intentionally doing it.”

11:30 a.m.: Quebec is reporting another 14 deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus, for a total of 5,541.

Authorities said today eight of the deaths occurred in the past 24 hours, while six occurred before June 24.

The province is also reporting 69 additional COVID-19 cases, for a total of 55,593, including 25,034 cases that are considered recovered.

Eleven fewer patients are in hospital with the disease, for a total of 411 patients, including 32 in intensive case, a reduction of one.

Authorities conducted 8,703 COVID-19 tests on June 30 — the last day for which testing data is available — which remains below the government’s 14,000 daily testing target.

Despite the continued downward trend in infections and deaths, Quebec remains by far the province hardest-hit by the virus.

11:15 a.m.: Ontario is reporing that more than 24,300 tests were completed for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours

11 a.m.: The Miami Herald reports that Florida’s Department of Health on Thursday confirmed 10,109 additional cases of COVID-19, breaking another single-day record and pushing the state’s total confirmed cases to hit 169,106.

Previously, the highest single-day total was reported on Saturday with 9,585 cases.

10:30 a.m.: With Ontario’s race-based COVID-19 data collection beginning “imminently,” health experts say crucial unresolved questions will determine whether those efforts help alleviate the pandemic’s brutal disparities, or cause more harm.

Regulatory changes came into effect last Friday that mandate the collection of information on race for all newly reported COVID-19 cases province-wide, along with data on income, household size and languages spoken. Data collection is beginning once training for public health units and changes to data entry systems are complete, according to a health ministry spokesperson.

Community organizations, researchers, doctors and public health experts have called for the collection of this data, pointing to the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in areas with more racialized, low-income and newly immigrated residents.

But health researchers said the question of how this data is managed and used is even more important than whether it is collected.

9:30 a.m.: Alongside 51 other Canadians, WhiteFeather Hunter has signed an open letter to Dr. Theresa Tam and each provincial chief medical officer calling for support for those struggling with persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

The group, who connected through an online support network for those who contracted the virus, are asking for the greater public awareness about the possibility of prolonged symptoms.

Without broad access to testing in the early days of the pandemic, people that signed onto the open letter say they were presumed positive or had close contact with a confirmed case, but fell into a gray area where they could not access a test. Due to the persistent symptoms, they are unsure if they remain infectious and cannot pass screening questionnaires that could allow them to access certain medical services.

7:01 a.m.: President Donald Trump’s July Fourth celebration on the National Mall will feature one of the largest fireworks displays ever and as many as 300,000 face masks will be given away to those who want them — but despite health concerns from D.C.’s mayor, no one apparently will be required to wear them.

Trump made no mention of the masks or of the pandemic overall in a tweet Wednesday on his Independence Day pIans. He thanked corporate donors for supporting “what will, without question, be a special evening.”

6:52 a.m.: More than three million Canadians either lost their jobs or had their hours significantly reduced due to COVID-19, according to Statistics Canada.

And now that economies across the country are reopening, some people are looking to change course, having realized their careers aren’t as viable as they may have been pre-pandemic, the Star’s Rosa Saba writes on why these Canadians are now looking to switch careers entirely.

6:17 a.m.: It started with an excruciating sore throat and 10 days of headaches. Then, a dry cough — a classic sign of COVID-19 — crept in as well.

WhiteFeather Hunter has been battling with persistent symptoms consistent with the novel coronavirus for months but was not initially tested for the virus when she fell ill in March.

She’s not alone. Alongside 51 other Canadians, Hunter has signed an open letter to Dr. Theresa Tam and each provincial chief medical officer calling for support for those struggling with persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

6:04 a.m.: The TTC’s pandemic recovery plans will enter a crucial new phase on Thursday, when the transit agency will start requiring its passengers to wear masks, and will lift restrictions instituted earlier in the crisis to allow for social distancing on its buses.

The changes come as ridership, particularly on the bus network, continues to rebound from the dramatic drop caused by the pandemic, a trend that has made eliminating crowding increasingly difficult and compelled the agency to institute other measures to contain the spread of the virus.

5:21 a.m.: New Zealand’s health minister resigned following a series of personal blunders during the coronavirus pandemic.

David Clark had earlier described himself as an “idiot” for breaking the nation’s lockdown measures and then last week appeared to blame a beloved health official for border lapses, generating an angry response from the public. Clark said he was becoming a distraction from the country’s virus response.

5:13 a.m.: China reported three new cases of coronavirus, including just one case of local transmission in the capital Beijing, appearing to put the country where the virus was first detected late last year on course to eradicating it domestically, at least temporarily.

5:10 a.m.: South Korea reported 54 new cases as the virus continues to spread beyond the capital area and reach cities like Gwangju, which has shut schools and tightened social restrictions after dozens were found infected this week.

Health Minster Park Neung-hoo during a virus meeting expressed alarm over the rise of infections in Gwangju, which had one of the smallest caseloads among major South Korean cities before this week. Park urged the city’s residents to refrain from unnecessary gatherings, maintain distance from others and wear masks.

5:04 a.m.: The Philippine government is shifting defence spending and putting on hold military modernization projects to help finance the response to COVID-19. Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told a news forum that $260 million from his department’s budget was shifted to the pandemic campaign.

Defence spokesman Arsenio Andolong told The Associated Press the country’s military modernization program may be set back by up to three years after its annual allocation was also slashed by $348 million, which will be used to fight the virus.

5 a.m.: India’s number of coronavirus cases passed 600,000 on Thursday with the nation’s infection curve rising and its testing capacity being increased.

The 19,148 new cases reported in the past 24 hours raised the national total to 604,641, with nearly 100,000 of them in the past four days.

A total of 17,834 people have died so far due to the virus, according to India’s Health Ministry.

More than 60 per cent of the cases are in the worst-hit Maharashtra state, Tamil Nadu state, and the capital territory of New Delhi.

However, the western beach of state of Goa, a popular backpacking destination, opened for tourism on Thursday with the state government allowing 250 hotels to reopen after more than three months. Tourists will either have to carry COVID-19 negative certificates or get tested on arrival.

4 a.m.: A new mobile app meant to help with contact tracing of COVID-19 cases won’t roll out across Ontario today as planned.

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Health says the province is still working with the federal government and the app is expected to launch soon.

The province will be the first to use the COVID Alert app, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said it should be ready for downloading in the rest of the country later this summer.

Premier Doug Ford says the app is meant to enhance the province’s contact tracing strategy.

He’s previously said it could play a key role in helping contain the spread of COVID-19 as more businesses reopen their doors.

The Star’s Rob Ferguson has the story.

12:05 a.m.: California closed bars, theatres and indoor restaurant dining all over again across most of the state Wednesday, and Arizona’s outbreak grew more severe by nearly every measure as the surging coronavirus crisis across the South and West sent a shudder through the country.

The run-up in confirmed cases has been blamed in part on what’s been called “knucklehead behaviour” by Americans not wearing masks or obeying social-distancing rules as economies reopened from coast to coast over the past two months.

“The bottom line is the spread of this virus continues at a rate that is particularly concerning,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in dramatically expanding the round of closings he announced over the weekend.

The shutdown announcement, which came just ahead of what is expected to be a busy Fourth of July weekend that could fuel the spread of the virus, applies to 19 counties encompassing nearly three-quarters of California’s 40 million people, including Los Angeles County.

Confirmed cases in California have increased nearly 50% over the past two weeks, and COVID-19 hospitalizations have gone up 43%. Newsom reported nearly 5,900 new cases and 110 more deaths in 24 hours.

Thursday 7:33 p.m.: The Cuban government opened the island’s northern and southern cays to tourism Wednesday amid strong measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the country to shut down travel in late March.

Cuba, which according to official figures has had 2,348 cases of COVID-19 and has had 86 deaths, is seeking to attract international tourists to the island’s many cays.

Tourists will undergo a rapid PCR test upon arrival to identify possible infections and will not be able to visit the big island itself. Cuban nationals are prohibited from having contact with foreigners and from staying in hotels equipped for international tourism, the official press reported.

Cuban-Americans will not be able to travel to visit their relatives until the island is fully open to tourism. The government has not announced dates for a full opening.

The changes come as ridership, particularly on the bus network, continues to rebound from the dramatic drop caused by the pandemic, a trend that has made eliminating crowding increasingly difficult and compelled the agency to institute other measures to contain the spread of the virus.

TTC CEO Rick Leary said the pivot in strategy indicates local officials have done a good job of containing the pandemic, and riders feel safe taking transit again as the city opens up.

“All of a sudden you’re seeing those (ridership) numbers creep up. For me, that’s a positive sign,” he said in an interview.

Leary said throughout the crisis the TTC has adapted its operations based on advice from Toronto Public Health on how to keep riders and employees safe, and the changes coming Thursday “are very much in line with that approach.”

Not wearing a face covering on the TTC will technically come with a $195 fine, but Leary has said the agency plans to encourage people to comply by using education, not enforcement.

Visual and audio messages on vehicles and in stations will remind riders of the mask requirement, and the TTC is deploying 100 COVID-19 “ambassadors” to help spread the message.

People with conditions that prevent them from covering their faces won’t be required to wear masks, nor will children under the age of two. Leary urged riders not to confront passengers who aren’t using a face covering.

“I think they have to be understanding of others. We want to make sure that people understand, not everybody can (wear a mask),” he said.

Leary said the TTC is aiming to get at least 90 per cent of customers wearing masks. Although the agency has said compliance rates will be monitored “to determine if further actions are needed,” Leary stressed that the TTC wouldn’t move quickly to start cracking down if uptake isn’t high initially.

“We’re going to give this some time,” he said.

The other significant change coming Thursday is the resumption of all-door boarding and fare box collection on buses.

That’s a reversal of policies the TTC announced in March, when it restricted passengers to using the rear doors only, and stopped collecting cash, tickets and tokens on buses in an effort to keep drivers apart from riders.

Leary said while ridership on streetcars and subways remains at about 18 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, bus routes have reached about 37 per cent. That’s up from late April, when systemwide demand was about 14 per cent of normal.

This past weekend bus ridership hit about 43 per cent of pre-crisis levels, which Leary interpreted as a sign people aren’t just using transit for essential trips as they were earlier in the pandemic.

“People seem to be using a bit more discretionary travel on the TTC, and that’s great,” he said. “The ridership and the revenue is definitely a plus.”

About 18 per cent of bus trips now exceed the TTC’s COVID-19 guideline that stipulates buses should carry a maximum of 15 people. The CEO has previously conceded even that guideline isn’t low enough to ensure riders can always stay the recommended two metres apart.

As riders return the TTC has little choice but to put less emphasis on social distancing. Earlier in the pandemic, the TTC used signs to block off seats and keep passengers apart, but Leary said riders have been removing the signs and the agency will now stop replacing them.

Carlos Santos, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, which represents more than 11,000 TTC workers, said some of his members are concerned about the resumption of all-door boarding.

He said drivers are particularly worried about reopening the two seats behind driver cabs, which allow passengers to sit close to operators. Santos said the union is working with the TTC to find ways to seal off the cab.

Santos said his wider concern is that the TTC continues to operate only about 85 per cent of regular service, which leads to more crowded vehicles.

In April the agency announced 1,200 temporary layoffs as a result of lower ridership demand, and so far about 450 workers have been furloughed, according to the union.

With the transit agency projecting up to almost $600 million in losses and increased costs related to the pandemic by the end of the year, Santos called on the provincial and federal governments to provide emergency operating funding that would allow the TTC to restore full service.

“Our vehicles are starting to fill up. Our members that have been laid off, they should have been called back already,” he said.

According to the latest figures, 66 TTC employees have tested positive for COVID-19.

In July the TTC also plans to resume fare enforcement activities, starting with warnings but moving to fines by mid-July or August.

On Tuesday, Coun. Gord Perks moved a motion at council requesting the TTC look into eliminating its special constable unit, citing concerns about use of force and racial bias.

Council defeated his motion, but voted in favour of another, introduced by Mayor John Tory, to ask the TTC to conduct a review of the unit’s mandate.

Leary defended restarting enforcement to the Star, noting that “unfortunately” fare revenue makes up two-thirds of the TTC’s annual operating budget, the highest portion of any transit agency in North America.

“We have to make sure that we collect the fares,” he said.

WhiteFeather Hunter has been battling with persistent symptoms consistent with the novel coronavirus for months but was not initially tested for the virus when she fell ill in March.

She’s not alone. Alongside 51 other Canadians, Hunter has signed an open letter to Dr. Theresa Tam and each provincial chief medical officer calling for support for those struggling with persistent COVID-19 symptoms.

Due to the persistent symptoms, they are unsure if they remain infectious and cannot pass screening questionnaires that could allow them to access certain medical services.

Additionally, the pervasiveness of false negative tests could mean that those struggling were incorrectly diagnosed. A study published in early May has shown that testing can produce false negatives, particularly in the early days of illness. After 21 days from symptom onset, the chances of a false negative can be as high as 66 per cent.

The Star has spoken to three people who signed the letter that have all experienced symptoms consistent with the illness but were never diagnosed with the virus.

Hunter, who was working on her PhD in Australia at the time she first fell ill, had no fever and no travel history, though her partner had recently returned from a trip abroad.

“We went to the COVID clinic together and they wouldn’t test us,” she explained to the Star by phone Tuesday. “And their reason for not testing me was because I hadn’t travelled, even though my partner had travelled. And they wouldn’t test him because he didn’t have a fever.”

Over the course of several weeks, her cough seemed to abate. The couple returned to Canada in early April. “Within … three or four days, all of my symptoms came back,” Hunter said. “I started getting really severe chest pain and pressure on my chest, feeling like someone was actually standing on my chest.”

The pain was so intense that it felt like a heart attack, prompting her to take an ambulance to the hospital. Though she was denied a test while in Australia, Hunter was finally able to be tested for the virus in mid-April, a full month after her symptoms originally appeared. “A few days later, the test came back negative,” she said.

“I was perfectly healthy before this. I was cycling 200 kilometers a week when I was in Australia. I was kind of at the peak of my health,” Hunter said. “I’ve never had health issues like this. I’ve never been a sick person.”

Elisa Harvey-LaPlante became ill at the same time the Ontario began to shutter for the lockdown. She has been riding out residual symptoms that have never cleared and wasn’t tested until the end of May. That test came back negative.

“I still definitely also have like a small coughing fit every day. I definitely still have phlegm in my lungs. That is not great. And I don’t know what that means long-term.”

She said she wants to see broad healthcare support offered to people that have experienced persistent symptoms but do not have a positive test.

Emily Shepard became sick toward the end of March. It’s not clear where she became infected, and initially she thought it was the remnants of a cold. With no sense of smell and a pressure in her chest, Shepard began to suspect that she had COVID-19.

She was not tested for the virus, following the advice of doctors to self-monitor and isolate at home. Shepard said that her symptoms match those of people who were able to test positive for COVID-19.

Weeks on, Shepard continues to have fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath due to her illness. Several times, she has thought her symptoms were over only for them to return.

“I would get better and think, ‘yeah, I’m on the mend,’ and then I would go back to being worse,” Shepard said. “I stopped even updating on Facebook, because I just thought, I don’t want to say that I’m getting better when clearly I don’t know what’s going on here.”

Shepard was in good health before contracting the virus. “At this point in the summer, I would love to be out on my bike on the lakeshore or in the middle of the woods,” she said. “My symptoms have stopped me from doing that. I’ve had so many relapses that now, even when I have a good day and feel like I’m on the mend, I’m afraid of doing anything that might set me back.”

All three hope that coming forward with their stories and the open letter can prompt government research into the long-term repercussions of COVID-19 and an updated public health policy that reflects the possibility of prolonged illness.

“If the government does listen to us and does do something about the public health policies or other systems to support people in an ongoing way, that will be amazing,” Shepard said. “But if they don’t, the least I hope we can do with our letter is to let … people know, if they don’t already, that they are not alone.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Robert Cribbstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Robert Cribb Is A Toronto-Based Investigative Reporter For The Star. Reach Him Via Email', 'Rcribb Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-01,"The good news: Toronto and Edmonton are expected to be named hub cities for the National Hockey League’s impending post-COVID-19 return, bringing the promise of cultural reinvigoration, economic boon and unprecedented home-ice advantage for the Leafs and Oilers throughout the playoffs.

The bad news: With the arrival of hundreds of athletes, coaches, trainers and support staff to the downtown cores of the two cities comes new risks of a fresh wave of COVID-19 cases that could hit low-wage service staff hardest and quickly erase months of progress toward reopening the economy.

It is a cost-benefit analysis that divides health and economic experts and raises fascinating questions about social priorities, the true economic benefits of sporting events and the forensics of managing a massive influx of people from one the world’s hardest-hit COVID-19 countries.

“If these guys are staying at two hotels in the two cities, that doesn’t mean COVID-19 stays on the teams,” said David Fisman, an epidemiologist and professor at U of T’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

“It potentially spills into housekeepers, concierges, drivers, kitchen staff … From a purely public health point of view, equity point of view, and probably even from an economic point of view, I don’t think I’d allow this in Toronto, if it were my call.”

If convening hundreds of hockey players can be accomplished safely, why not any number of other vital public services, says Fisman.

“The NHL can pull out all the stops and make disease control ironclad for multimillionaire hockey players, but we can’t have as thoughtful a plan or approach for our schools?” he said. “The lack of equity in terms of how this plays out, the risk it potentially introduces and the message it sends at a time ICU’s are again filling up across North America — sorry, it seems pretty frivolous.”

While research shows sporting events do not typically bring economic riches to cities, this time is different, says David Raiha, adjunct research professor at the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey Business School.

He estimates the potential economic uptick from playoff hockey during a pandemic when there is little other entertainment available could hit $75 million for each hub city.

“Both these cities have an enormous amount of underutilized capacity. There’s all sorts of people waiting around to be employed for one reason or another.”

The big winners will be hotels, food services, entertainment, transportation, security and logistics firms, he says.

“If things go well and there’s no outbreaks that come as result of this, the cities are definitely better off,” he said. “But if it leads to a wider outbreak in the cities and more prolonged lockdowns and restrictions, it won’t take a whole lot to wipe out the benefit entirely.”

Quantifying those odds is difficult. The league has said it will implement a “rigorous daily testing protocol” when games resume, including tests every evening that would produce results by the next morning. But health experts say even the most effective testing regime will still miss some percentage of infections.

“It’s not going to take much to trigger more mini outbreaks, especially with people coming from the U.S. where there are cases going on,” said Christopher Labos, a Montreal-based epidemiologist.

“It takes a lot of people to put on a sporting event. If you think of the number of interactions in a day, from hotel staff cleaning rooms to food servers, all it will take is for one person to be COVID-19-positive for there to be more cases.”

Earlier this week the NHL confirmed 26 players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8 on top of another 11 previously identified.

The best protections for athletes are the same as those we’ve been hearing for months from public health officials.

Those arriving from the U.S. will be screened and forced to quarantine in their hotel rooms for two weeks to ensure they aren’t bringing in new cases. After that, they will be required to show strict adherence to physical distancing rules (with the notable caveat that they will be coming into intensely close contact with dozens of other players on the ice each game).

“It’s not a great idea,” said Labos. “If the NHL had cancelled the season and started in the winter, I would have been OK with it. We have to look at what is critical and necessary and what we can live without for a while.”

Andrew Morris, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital, says the NHL’s plan to concentrate players in two cities to reduce travel is more responsible than what some other sports leagues have been proposing.

And the all-Canadian choices of Toronto and Edmonton as host cities is smart given their relatively lower COVID-19 rates compared with most places in the U.S., he says.

“If this were Dallas and Miami or Phoenix we were talking about, it would be a totally different discussion. I would be saying, ‘Crazy.’ ”

There will still be infections, he says.

“That’s a no-brainer. But what they should be aiming for is no outbreak.”

And if the COVID-19 numbers start to spike in Toronto or Edmonton over the next several weeks, the analysis shifts again.

“If the prevalence of disease is different in August or September, it’s going to be totally different,” he said. “The worst-case scenario is that we have a substantial outbreak facilitated by athletes, spread through staff they interact with related to food, equipment and facilities. Those people will be taking the disease back home to their communities.”

Richard Powers, associate professor at the Rotman School of Management who specializes in sports marketing, called the news of a Toronto-Edmonton base for the remainder of the NHL season “fantastic.”

“This is best-case scenario as far as Canada is concerned. This is a kick start to the economy in both cities. It sends a strong message that Canada has responded responsibly. For the NHL, the best chance they had of finishing the season was going to be in an environment that respected COVID-19 and now they have that.”

Still, it remains a “big gamble,” he said.

“It’s a huge risk. But you have to give it to the NHL. They’re smart. They know what they’re doing. They will have established their tolerance level. And if they hit it, they will not hesitate to cancel it.”

And, as a lifelong Leafs fan, he sees another hometown advantage.

“This is Toronto’s chance. We’ve got home ice advantage to get the Stanley Cup. Finally. This is part of our overall plan for domination. It’s played right into our hands.”

The effects on children may be lasting.,"['Kelly Glass', 'Kgkelly Glassthe New York Timeswed.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Kelly Glassthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Kelly Glassthe New York Timeswed.']",2020-07-01,"Kourtney McGowan was furloughed in March, when the preschool she worked at closed during the coronavirus shutdown. The relationship with her longtime partner quickly crumbled under the pressure. They broke up “due to mental health issues” that she said started to appear with both of them being stressed out and inside all day.

McGowan said she waited almost a month to receive unemployment benefits in California, and the financial setback was a huge blow. “Every day I’m trying to play catch-up,” she said.

As McGowan’s workplace prepared to reopen, she met another obstacle many parents are faced with as states loosen restrictions: child care. She called the program her eight-year-old son previously attended, but it had no plans to reopen.

Hoping to return to work, McGowan asked her boss for a more flexible schedule. “I can’t have my son in my office for eight hours every day,” she said. Her boss said no. She had no plan for reliable child care, and her job replaced her.

More than 36 million Americans are unemployed in the aftermath of countrywide pandemic shutdowns. McGowan is one of the 1.7 million Black women who was working pre-coronavirus and wants to continue working but is left without a job.

According to research from the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, working-age adults, children and Black Americans will fall below the poverty line at the highest rates as a result of the coronavirus pandemic’s economic effects.

At the intersection of those vulnerable groups are Black children, who are already disproportionately represented in America’s poor. According to data from the American Community Survey and analyzed by the Kids Count Data Center, a non-profit tracking the well-being of children in the United States, 32 per cent of Black children live in poverty, compared with 11 per cent of white children and 26 per cent of Hispanic or Latino children.

“The COVID-19 public health and economic crisis certainly is hitting deep within the economy, and it’s affecting every single type of American,” said Bradley L. Hardy, associate professor of public administration and policy at American University. Though many families will certainly feel the stress, “We have some real concerns for Black families for a whole range of historical reasons,” he said.

The reasons that are particularly relevant in this moment are the unemployment rate of Black women, the long-term stress of racism on children and the lack of household wealth that Black families have.

The unemployment rate for Black women continues to increase.

The most recent jobs report revealed a familiar inequity: Black and Hispanic workers are having a harder time finding jobs. Before the pandemic, Black households in particular had higher unemployment rates than white households.

Black mothers’ workforce participation and earnings are crucial to the economic health of Black children, said Kristen E. Broady, dean of the college of business and professor of economics at Dillard University. The vast majority of Black mothers are the primary breadwinners for their households. They are more than twice as likely as white mothers, and more than 50 per cent more likely than Hispanic mothers, to be either the sole providers in a single-parent household or married and bringing in the same amount or more than their partner, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a non-partisan policy institute.

As states open up and workplaces start to bring back employees, the unemployment rate for white men and women and Hispanic men and women is improving, while the unemployment rate for Black women continues to increase.

Even these figures may be understating the unemployment problem for Black women, said Jessica Fulton, vice-president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a public policy think tank. “You have to have lost your job and be looking for work,” she said. “If you’re a single mom, for example, and you are not looking for a job because your kids are at home, you don’t get counted.”

“A lot of Black children are in households where there’s just Mom working or there are two parents both working in order to make ends meet,” Fulton said. “This is potentially going to impact Black children disproportionately.”

While unemployment is a strong predictor for child poverty, poverty is only one part of the story.

Toxic stressors over time can lead to long-term physical and mental health issues.

Eileen Condon, a nurse practitioner and post-doctoral associate at Yale University School of Nursing, and her colleagues examined the stressors related to the coronavirus pandemic and how they disproportionately harm disadvantaged and marginalized families.

Poverty, food insecurity and housing insecurity are major sources of pervasive stress, Condon said. When a child experiences toxic stress, their stress response is “essentially always activated.” “Over time, the inflammation and the adrenalin and all of the things that are going on in the body start to wear and tear on all of the different systems,” she said, “and that is what leads to poor physical and mental health outcomes for children who experience early adversity.”

Vicarious racism, or second-hand exposure to racism that Black children may experience watching or hearing about the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, is also a source of pervasive stress, Condon said.

Hardy said, “We know quite a bit from the child development literature about how these sorts of stressors really impede child development.” While these early stressors predated the COVID-19 crisis, the effects of the pandemic and exposure to the deaths of these Black Americans will exacerbate the potential for toxic stress, he said.

Black children are also being left behind in the education system at all levels. For children from pre-K through high school, both Broady and Hardy said uninterrupted access to the hardware and internet necessary to successfully participate in online learning is another huge concern. According to data from Pew Research Center, even before education went fully digital because of the pandemic, Black and Hispanic students were unevenly affected by the lack of access to high-speed internet services.

“Such infrastructure concerns are very real for Black families, and certainly some of them will be fine, but disproportionately, that’s going to be a major issue,” Hardy said.

Black households have less wealth than white households.

According to Federal Reserve data, Black households typically have one-tenth of the wealth of a typical white household. The lack of wealth of Black households is an issue for Black children, as any unexpected emergency — like a pandemic — can cause food and housing insecurity and stress for children when there is no financial cushion.

It’s also a concern for the future prospects of Black children. For a 2018 study on racial disparities in economic mobility, economists examined longitudinal data from the U.S. Census Bureau of nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989 to 2015 and found that Black children born into poverty were twice as likely as white children to stay there.

Though poverty rates for Hispanic Americans are similar to those of Black Americans, they are almost as likely as white children to move out of poverty as adults. Additionally, the researchers found that Black children born into higher income groups have a harder time staying in those income brackets. The study’s authors were careful to note that their findings suggest neither parental marital status, education level nor children’s difference in ability could explain away this intergenerational mobility gap.

“American public policy has made it very difficult for Black Americans to accumulate and sustain wealth in general,” Hardy said. The Black-white wealth gap has persisted despite increasing numbers of Black women attaining college degrees. Hardy cited America’s well-documented history of segregation, excluding Black Americans from the GI Bill and educational attainment, redlining policies that segregated communities and devalued homes in Black neighbourhoods, and “plain racial labour market discrimination” as reasons Black families have less wealth to help protect them from the devastating effects of an economic crisis.

“If you put it all together,” Hardy said, “then Black parents are going to have quite a bit less to leave to their children.” The pandemic is exacerbating the existing economic inequalities for Black families and is subsequently worsening the future economic outlook for Black children, despite all best efforts by Black parents like McGowan to work their way up.

The prospects aren’t great for McGowan, whose certifications are in child care, because service sector jobs in which Black women are overrepresented have had some of the biggest cuts. Her son, who she said seems unaware of their current financial struggles, is suddenly anxious about death and dying. He’s in counselling, and she’s thinking about going back to college. “We do what we got to do,” she said.

For now, McGowan said she will see what the future holds. “Raising Black boys is hard in itself,” she said. “I’m just trusting God.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here’s some tips for how to deal with that,"['Laura Armstrong', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reporterwed.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Laura Armstrongstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Laura Armstrong Is A Star Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-01,"Masks are here to stay, at least for the near future, but for all the important good they do in the fight against the spread of COVID-19, covering your face can also come with downsides.

The foggy glasses. The sore ears. Overheating in a heat wave. And what to do when you’re eating on those brand new patios? They’re the small drawbacks of protecting others by masking up when you can’t ensure two metres of physical distance.

Masks are not meant to feel natural, said Dr. Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, an associate professor of biology at York University. Any circumstance that calls for wearing a mask means being vigilant and careful in order to protect yourself and others.

“A face mask remains protective gear,” said Golemi-Kotra. “It is not meant to make us feel like we’re having a normal life, it is not normal.” Golemi-Kotra has experienced the dreaded foggy glasses.

Here are some ways to get more comfortable with your mask while staying safe.

Sore ears

Avoid using a mask with ear loops. Golemi-Kotra suggests a mask with long strips that can be tie behind the back of the head, and not just because it gives the ears a break.

“Those ensure a better fit because you can adjust according to your face size,” she said.

Alternatively, ear loops can be secured to something at the back of the head, like a paper clip. Some healthcare professionals sew buttons onto the sides of their scrubs caps as an alternative to ears. That could also be done with a ball cap or other head gear.

If your mask has to loop around your ears, Golemi-Kotra said putting vaseline on and around the ears should lessen any friction.

Foggy glasses

Foggy glasses occur when the air a person is exhaling is warmer than the air outside. When breath touches the lens, the moisture condenses. Foggy glasses shouldn’t be as big an issue through the summer as in the spring, said Golemi-Kotra.

In cooler temperatures, foggy glasses can be avoided by ensuring the mask fits snugly around the nose, so there is no air escaping out of the top.

“A mask should have a metal strip at the nose part to mask sure the mask fits around the nose,” said Golemi-Kotra. “Try to make an effort to mould the mask around the nose well.”

If that doesn’t work, sewing extra cloth around the part of the mask that sits on the nose could make it more secure.

Overheating

While foggy glasses are less likely to occur in summer, overheating becomes a bigger concern.

“There is no real way around it,” Golemi-Kotra said. “It’s a mask. As you expel the air, it will prevent the air from coming out freely.”

Overheating is more likely to happen outside than in climate-controlled indoor areas. Golemi-Kotra said to avoid outdoor crowds as much as possible. She also suggests avoiding exercising in the heat.

“If you’re just outside and there aren’t many people around, don’t wear a mask,” she said. “As long as you maintain safe physical distance, there shouldn’t be any concern about getting infected.”

Eating

For those braving outdoor patios or munching on-the-go, storing the mask while eating is important.

“I’ve seen people putting (their mask) in their pockets or on the table. It just defeats the purpose,” said Golemi-Kotra, who said a mask can pick up or spread bacteria that way.

She suggests putting a mask between two sheets of paper towel and placing it in a Ziploc bag during a meal. After eating, wash or disinfect hands before putting the mask back on.

Hanging a mask off one ear or moving it down to the chin while eating, or any time, is also a no-no. Doing so can expose the eyes and nose to any virus or bacteria the mask might have been contaminated with, said Golemi-Kotra.

“A face mask, yes it’s used to protect others but you don’t want to become a contaminating agent for your own self by picking up other germs by not handling it properly.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jillian Kestler-D Amoursstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter']",2020-07-01,"Passengers on board a flight from Toronto to Halifax last week may have been exposed to COVID-19, Nova Scotia’s public health agency said Wednesday as it reported a new confirmed case of the virus.

The Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) said the potential COVID-19 exposure occurred June 26 on WestJet flight WS 248 from Toronto to Halifax.

The flight left Toronto at 10 a.m. and landed in Halifax just after 1 p.m. that day, the agency said in a statement.

“Those on the flight should self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19,” it said.

The news came as Nova Scotia confirmed that it had identified a new COVID-19 case on Tuesday, the second case announced in as many days after the province went three weeks without any new infections.

The government said the new case is a Nova Scotian who travelled outside of Canada.

The other active case was identified June 29 and is also travel-related.

“The new cases this week show that COVID-19 is still very much here,” Premier Stephen McNeil said in a statement Wednesday.

“So please continue to follow public health directives and advice, look out for your fellow Nova Scotians and do all you can to keep COVID-19 under control.”

The Nova Scotia Health Authority said anyone on the Toronto-Halifax flight may have been exposed to COVID-19, but passengers in seats A to C in rows 16 through 21 are at greater risk of exposure.

It asked those passengers to call 811 for advice and to self-monitor for potential COVID-19 symptoms.

In an email to The Canadian Press, Morgan Bell, a spokeswoman for WestJet, said the NSHA advised the company today about the potential COVID-19 exposure on the flight.

“The public health authority has jurisdiction, and a process, for notifying guests on board the flight, we are providing all necessary information as required,” Bell said.

She said WestJet also has a process in place to notify crew on affected flights.

Nova Scotia has reported 1,063 cases of COVID-19 and 63 deaths so far during the pandemic.

As of Friday, residents will be allowed to travel between Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island without needing to self-isolate.

People have been asked to abide by local public health directives and avoid travelling if they exhibit any COVID-19 symptoms.

Read', 'Morgan Lowriethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Morgan Lowriethe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"MONTREAL—Quebec’s traditional July 1 moving day has always involved a certain amount of chaos, as thousands of people simultaneously pack up their belongings and move to new homes.

But this year, advocates say the hunt for a new apartment has been more difficult than ever, as COVID-19 exacerbates a housing crisis brought on by low vacancies, rising rents and a wave of tenants being displaced by landlords hoping to retake their dwellings or capitalize on their property values.

Veronique Laflamme, the spokeswoman for the housing rights’ group FRAPRU, says some 1,200 households across the province have called different organizations seeking help in finding a new place to live — twice as many as last year. Of those, at least 322 had yet to sign a new lease on the eve of moving day.

In a phone interview, she said COVID-19 has not only led to major job losses but also caused hardship for those already struggling to pay their rents, including those on social assistance or in low-income jobs.

Those vulnerable people “risk being adding to the ranks of the unemployed who lost their jobs and find themselves in a greatly vulnerable situation.”

She said the pandemic made viewing apartments more difficult, especially in hard-hit Montreal, where the vacancy rate sits at a 15-year low of 1.5 per cent, and affordable apartments are becoming scarce.

A recent study compiled by a renters’ rights group, the Regroupement des comites logement et associations de locataires, found that provincially the prices listed online for apartments available for rent averaged $1,044 per month — some 30 per cent higher than the average rent being paid by current tenants, according to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s numbers. In Montreal, the figure was 43 per cent higher.

Laflamme said nearly half of those who called for aid this year are leaving their previous apartments unwillingly. Among those forced out, she said, are a growing number of so-called “renovictions,” when tenants are displaced because of major renovations, and rents are subsequently hiked.

Collin Kenwood, a 44-year-old Montreal renter, says he’s well aware of the problem.

Kenwood, who is disabled, said he thought he’d gotten lucky last year to find a one-bedroom basement apartment he could afford for himself and his dog in Montreal’s central Plateau-Mont-Royal neighbourhood, but the situation has since become a nightmare.

Video provided by Kenwood shows water dripping from the ceiling of the bathroom, which he said caused chunks of ceiling to fall. He says the building’s landlord has consistently dragged his feet on repairs, instead pressuring him and other tenants to find another place to live so major renovations can be carried out.

“He’s trying to muscle people out,” said Kenwood, who has filed a formal notice with the province’s landlord and tenant rental board, asking the owner to address a leak in the ceiling, a deteriorating living room wall and a broken stove.

But in a response to Kenwood’s filings, which The Canadian Press has viewed, the landlord accuses Kenwood of violating several rules, including keeping a dog despite a no-pet clause, blocking access to rooms in the building, causing other tenants to leave the building and storing property without having access to a storage unit.

A document Kenwood says is his lease does not specify that he cannot have animals, and he says he had a verbal agreement to store his belongings in the building. He says the accusations are unfounded.

The landlord and tenant rental board has not ruled on the case.

Three other current and former tenants who spoke with The Canadian Press described a series of problems with the building, ranging from leaking ceilings to intermittent hot water, broken locks and, in one case, a stove giving off electric shocks. All said the landlord was slow or neglected to fix issues, while all but one said they’d been asked orally when they were moving out.

Philippe Holas, who is in the process of moving out, said the landlord waited a month to fix a leaky ceiling, and did not respond promptly when hot water stopped working. He said the landlord told him and his roommate they should find another apartment, warning them the place would become “uninhabitable” due to major construction.

Holas said he has also filed a formal notice with the rental board. The other two tenants interviewed have not filed notice with the board.

When reached by phone, landlord Morrie Cuttler said the tenants’ claims are “completely inaccurate,” and he denied failing to carry out repairs.

“Whatever issues (there are) in the building are being looked after,” he said.

He said his family has owned the building for 80 years, housing hundreds of tenants, and he attributed the complaints to a disgruntled tenant. He denied trying to get tenants to leave improperly.

Robert Beaudry, the city councillor responsible for housing, said Montreal is currently in a housing crisis caused by a vacancy rate below one per cent in many neighbourhoods.

He said the city is working with local housing organizations to help people who can’t find apartments, in some cases renting them storage units and hotels temporarily.

Montreal is also taking action against the so-called renovictions by drafting stricter rules for landlords who wish to subdivide or enlarge their units in central neighbourhoods.

But while the city is doing what it can, he noted that many responsibilities, including most enforcement and construction of subsidized housing, require the province’s help.

The Quebec government has stepped up during the pandemic, offering emergency rent supplements for those who risk homelessness, interest-free loans for up to two months’ rent and support for cities.

However, Laflamme says COVID-19’s lasting economic effects will mean that many more people will be in trouble once emergency government aid runs out, while eviction hearings that were temporarily paused due to the pandemic will soon resume.

Read', 'Giuseppe Valiantethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Giuseppe Valiantethe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"MONTREAL—The owner of a fireworks company in small-town Ontario says COVID-19 has forced the cancellation of dozens of shows he’d typically put on leading up to Canada Day — but his sales haven’t been totally extinguished.

Victor Anber, who owns K&H Fireworks in Tecumseh, Ont., said usually he’d have 60 major shows at this time of year, but all have been cancelled, along with other Canada Day celebrations that have been dropped as officials across the country limit gatherings during the pandemic.

But private sales ahead of Canada Day have surged for Anber and other fireworks companies across the country as Canadians look to recreate official displays with do-it-yourself shows in backyards and open fields.

Anber said he had been running three shifts, 24 hours a day, to keep up with orders ahead of Canada Day. He added that he knows of other companies that had to shut down their online order web pages because they couldn’t keep up with demand.

“I’ve never seen this in my entire life,” he said in an interview Wednesday.

K&H Fireworks primarily sells to corporate or government clients, but Anber said consumer sales have doubled this year compared with the same period in 2019. It’s not enough to make up for the corporate market, however.

He hasn’t hired the roughly 100 seasonal workers who normally help out his 18 full-time employees, he said. And despite the growth in the consumer market, he said, “this is going to be a slow year.”

Not so for Gary Colquhoun, owner of Fireworks Atlantic in Yarmouth, N.S., whose company sells primarily to individuals.

Sales have recently exploded, he said.

COVID-19 devastated revenues earlier in the year, he said, but in the past two weeks, he’s collected five months’ worth of orders.

“In other words, people are ready to shoot some — I think,” said Colquhoun. “Especially since they cancelled all the Canada Day fireworks and professional shows.

“I think backyard shows are going to be the thing.”

He said his company has been completely swamped with orders on stock that has since sold out. “I am expecting to have a very good year to tell you the truth.”

And while companies that sell fireworks are seeing a rekindling of sales, the people whose job it is to put on the shows are not doing well at all.

Julie Manchini, general manager of Pro FX Inc., a pyrotechnic company whose clients include the Calgary Stampede as well as the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers NHL teams, said the market has dried up almost entirely.

With the stampede cancelled and the NHL season on hold, Manchini said times are tough.

“Until we can all congregate again I’m not sure where we’ll be at,” she said Wednesday.

But she said she sees some hope the recent popularity of drive-in concerts.

The Edmonton Journal reported in mid-June that country artist Brett Kissel held eight sold-out shows at the city’s River Cree Resort and Casino parking lot. About 180 vehicles showed up to watch what was described as “Canada’s first-ever drive-in country music concert.”

Manchini said if those kinds of shows continue, her company might see some pyrotechnic work in the coming months.

Toronto police said between 125 and 150 people were inside Goldie nightclub at 619 King Street West on Friday.

Patrons were allowed to enter through the back of the building, and social distancing measures weren’t enforced, police said.

The club has no outdoor patio or seating areas, and it has no permit for outdoor service of any kind, police said.

Outdoor patios have been allowed to reopen in Toronto starting June 24 as the province gradually allows businesses to reopen during the pandemic. But indoor service has not yet been permitted.

Police said the owner, manager and corporation will be charged under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act with failure to comply with an order made during a declared emergency.

“We like to see every club open, because that means more businesses, and more jobs. But there are rules right now that say in the interest of public health, they shouldn’t be,” Mayor John Tory told reporters when asked about the charge during an unrelated briefing on Canada Day.

“There are many businesses that are cooperating, they’re playing fair, some people are not . . . and we have to do something about that,” he added.

The incident was investigated by Toronto police and information has been sent to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.

A representative from the nightclub couldn’t be reached by phone or email.

Wearing a mask in Saskatchewan isn’t mandatory now, but chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab says it may become a rule if there’s an uptick in transmission rates.

“I may give a recommendation to wear a mask all the time when you’re indoors, in a setting where you can’t reliably maintain two-metre separation,” he said.

For now, everyone should be carrying around reusable cloth masks that they can wear in situations where they can’t keep physical distance from others, he added.

“Everyone should wear a reusable cloth and that protects everyone else,” Shahab told The Canadian Press in a recent interview.

“I think this is something that we need to now learn to carry with us.”

Premier Scott Moe has said that if people feel more comfortable wearing a mask, they should do so.

He said he has a few disposable masks and has worn one.

“Not all the time, but for instance when I go for a haircut,” he told a recent news conference.

Shahab said what’s top of mind for him in the coming months, as more people begin to socialize, is how the province can sustain more public interaction without having a second wave of infections.

“We’ll have to learn to manage it without having to go into lockdown,” he said. “There’s tremendous human, economic, financial cost to that.”

So far, Saskatchewan has largely been spared some of the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of case numbers, deaths and outbreaks in long-term care homes such as those in Ontario and Quebec. The province has seen outbreaks in its far north region and in Hutterite colonies in the south.

As of Tuesday, the province reported 88 active infections out of a total of 785 cases. Five people remain in hospital and 13 have died.

The government has been steadily rolling back public health restrictions it introduced in March and April to slow the spread of the virus.

Shahab, who now considers it a good day when he works 12 hours instead of 20, estimates that social mixing has returned to between 50 to 60 per cent.

When students return to schools in September, he believes that will rise to about 80 per cent.

“Between 60 to 80 is the danger zone,” he said.

As more people move their gatherings indoors with the change in seasons, he said wearing a cloth mask is going to become more important.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Shashank Bengalilos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times']",2020-07-01,"PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN—The boys struck out from their village in Pakistan’s rugged tribal belt and came to this frontier city to work at Maula Khan’s drink stand, a wooden cart shaded by an umbrella on a road bustling with migrants, war refugees and swerving rickshaws.

Umar Gul and Muhammad Siraj stood in the 108-degree heat, pouring freshly squeezed lemons mixed with jaggery into steel cups for 12 cents a serving. They were far from home, but when the coronavirus pandemic closed their elementary school in March, their families needed them to work.

“I decided to support my parents,” said Umar, a 14-year-old who was in the fourth grade. His 13-year-old cousin Muhammad, whose father owns the lemonade cart and demanded the boys join him, was in the grade below. Neither is counting on returning to school when classes resume.

“I’m not sure,” Umar shrugged, his shoulders slumped under a loose-fitting shalwar kameez. “My father doesn’t have enough money for my education.”

Experts warn that the COVID-19 pandemic could force millions of children in developing nations out of classrooms for good and into the workforce, reversing two decades of hard-won progress against underage labour and exposing vulnerable girls and boys to hazardous conditions, physical stress, emotional trauma and exploitation.

“In precarious households that are economically vulnerable, they have to make a decision every day, how to spend their income and how to generate income,” said Cornelius Williams, associate director of child protection at UNICEF.

“If these families go below the poverty line, they may have to make these ugly choices.”

Months-long economic lockdowns and the threat of a prolonged global recession have worsened hardships for poor families, especially those who depend on informal jobs and lack social protections. In low- and middle-income countries, the number of children living in poverty could rise 15 per cent by the end of 2020 to 672 million, according to UNICEF and Save the Children, an international charity.

Nearly two-thirds of these children live in Africa and South Asia, in countries where child labour is entrenched despite legal prohibitions, rising school enrolment and economic modernization. The International Labor Organization estimates there are 152 million victims of child labour worldwide working as farm hands, herders, miners, weavers, shop assistants, domestic servants — often as part of a family business.

Child rights advocates have spent decades persuading governments, employers and parents that child labour is not only dangerous but also prevents societies from growing more educated and creating better-paying jobs.

The campaign has worked: About 100 million fewer children are working today compared to 20 years ago, according to U.N. agencies.

The U.N. had set a target of eliminating child labour by 2030. But experts worry that the economic shock will force parents to choose between their children’s future and daily survival.

“The danger is that we will lose that trajectory,” Williams said. “That target would become impossible.”

Although some medical evidence suggests that children are less susceptible to COVID-19 infections than adults, the pandemic’s toll on young people goes beyond health.

In war-torn Yemen, humanitarian aid is drying up, threatening children with starvation. Reports of child abuse are increasing in developed nations such as Singapore and the U.S. Pediatricians warn that keeping kids out of school could be worse in the long run than the disease itself.

Worldwide, more than 1.5 billion students have been affected by school closures. Like many countries, Pakistan tried to shift to online learning and televised classes.

But in the rugged, impoverished tribal zone along the Afghan border, such measures were effectively impossible.

Internet access in the region is almost nonexistent: Wi-Fi connections are prohibitively expensive, and the government has blocked mobile 3G and 4G service since 2016 as part of its war against a long-running insurgency. Most households get only three to four hours of electricity a day.

Even before the pandemic, Pakistan had some of the world’s worst education statistics, with 44 per cent of school-age children not attending classes. Education through age 16 is free under the law, but the cost of books, uniforms and other expenses weighed on families in the tribal belt.

With more than 200,000 COVID-19 infections and low testing rates, Pakistan has not said when schools will reopen.

Umar and Muhammad, who started school years late because their families had been displaced by fighting in Bajaur, were both good students, fond of Urdu language classes, with hopes of enlisting in the army.

But when the shutdown hit, the family’s calculation was simple.

“We are poor,” Muhammad’s father Maula Khan said, “and we need extra hands to help us earn.”

The drink stand generates about $3.50 a day for the family of seven to live on in Peshawar, home to large numbers of migrants from the tribal districts and refugees from the war in Afghanistan. Maula Khan, his ankles swollen from standing beside the cart all day, said working was the best thing for the boys’ future.

“This will train them to start their own lemonade stands,” he said.

The legal working age in Pakistan is 15, although the law is rarely enforced by provincial authorities. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which includes Peshawar, labour inspectors even lack funds to conduct site visits, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Labor Department.

Pakistan hasn’t carried out a child labour survey since 1996, when 3.3 million children ages 5 to 14 were found to be working. Activists say that fewer children today toil in industrial jobs, but they continue to be employed in large numbers in agriculture and — particularly for girls — as domestic help, where abuse is common.

“Socioeconomic inequities will increase after the pandemic, and it will be worse for the most vulnerable,” said Iqbal Ahmad Detho, a member of Pakistan’s national child rights commission.

A relief package introduced by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s debt-ridden government gave 12 million families a one-time payment of about $71. That amount, less than the monthly minimum wages set by provinces, was widely denounced as inadequate.

The government projects that at least 12 million people will lose their jobs and 10 million will fall below the poverty line — an 18 per cent increase — due to the pandemic.

“We are not against educating our children, but poor families rely on child labour to pay the bills,” said Hamid Khan, who runs an auto repair shop in Peshawar’s busy Shoba Bazaar.

As he spoke, a 14-year-old employee was busy unscrewing nuts and bolts and washing car parts. The boy’s wage: less than $1 a day.

Lately, Khan said, the number of children working in the market has risen noticeably.

A short walk away in the city’s historic Khyber Bazaar, 13-year-old Junaid Khan stood on a sidewalk looking for customers. When schools closed, he’d asked to join his father as a street vendor, selling face masks.

Now Junaid sells about 50 blue surgical masks a day, pocketing roughly $2. He said he won’t go back to school, although he plans to attend Quran classes in the evenings.

His father Rahim Dad, who sells masks and natural toothbrushes made from tree bark, regretted that his eldest son had to work.

But with four daughters married off and two younger boys at home, Rahim Dad said, the family was just trying to survive.

“God willing,” he said, “I will do my best so that my other sons get an education.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7:33 p.m.: The Cuban government opened the island’s northern and southern cays to tourism Wednesday amid strong measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the country to shut down travel in late March.

Cuba, which according to official figures has had 2,348 cases of COVID-19 and has had 86 deaths, is seeking to attract international tourists to the island’s many cays.

Tourists will undergo a rapid PCR test upon arrival to identify possible infections and will not be able to visit the big island itself. Cuban nationals are prohibited from having contact with foreigners and from staying in hotels equipped for international tourism, the official press reported.

Cuban-Americans will not be able to travel to visit their relatives until the island is fully open to tourism. The government has not announced dates for a full opening.

2:25 p.m.: Health officials in the Windsor-Essex region say they’ve ordered a work stoppage at a farm experiencing a large outbreak of COVID-19.

The local public health unit says 191 cases of the virus were recorded at the farm over the weekend.

Chief medical officer Dr. Wajid Ahmed issued a mandatory order for the farm to ensure employees are isolated and stop working as a result of the outbreak. Ahmed said targetted testing efforts are continuing at farms in the area.

The Windsor-Essex region also reported nine new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, with seven of them occurring in the agri-farm sector.

Ontario did not report provincewide COVID-19 numbers on Canada Day, but will resume its daily report on Thursday.

1 p.m.: For the first time since the early days of the pandemic, Ontario won’t be releasing a daily update of COVID-19 numbers Wednesday due to the Canada Day holiday. The daily summaries for Wednesday and Thursday will be available Thursday at 10:30 a.m. A weekly summary will be available Friday at 2 p.m.

1 p.m.: Fireworks companies say they’re experiencing a surge in consumer sales as people try to recreate Canada Day displays that were cancelled.

Gary Colquhoun, owner of Fireworks Atlantic in Yarmouth, N.S., said he’s received five months worth of orders in the past two weeks after a slow start to the year.

Colquhoun, who sells across the country, says he’s running three shifts a day to fill orders for stock that has since sold out.

Many official Canada Day celebrations, and the fireworks that go with them, have been cancelled as governments across the country limit gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Star’s Margaryta Ignatenko has details on what the rules are for Toronto.

12 p.m.: Nova Scotia’s public health agency says people may have been exposed to COVID-19 last week on a flight from Toronto to Halifax.

The agency says the potential exposure occurred June 26 on WestJet flight WS 248. The flight left Toronto at 10 a.m. and landed in Halifax at 1:04 p.m that day.

The health agency says anyone on the flight may have been exposed to COVID-19, but passengers in seats A to C in rows 16 through 21 are at greater risk of exposure.

Officials are asking those passengers to call 811 for advice and to self-monitor for potential COVID-19 symptoms.

Nova Scotia has reported 1,063 cases of COVID-19 to date, including a new case that was identified on June 30.

12 p.m.: Quebec is reporting 24 more deaths attributed to COVID-19, for a new toll of 5,527.

Health authorities said seven deaths occurred in the past 24 hours, while the rest occurred before June 23.

The province is also reporting 66 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases to 55,524, including 24,949 cases that are considered recovered.

Quebec says the number of patients in hospital and in intensive care dropped slightly. The government conducted 6,763 COVID-19 tests on June 29, the last day for which data is available.

Authorities have acknowledged they are conducting fewer daily tests than they would like, but maintain they have the capacity to immediately increase testing if an outbreak occurs.

11:55 a.m.: Saskatchewan’s top doctor says his advice on wearing masks to protect against COVID-19 could change in the coming months.

Wearing a mask in Saskatchewan isn’t mandatory now, but chief medical health officer Dr. Saqib Shahab says it may become a rule if there’s an uptick in transmission rates.

11:20 a.m.: According to an industry source, both Toronto and Edmonton have been all-but-approved as the two hub cities to host the teams for the NHL’s return.

“Nothing’s official yet,” the source said, on the condition of anonymity.

Both the league and its players’ union talked into the early hours of Canada Day to iron out return-to-play details, COVID-19 protocols and other issues that, if agreed upon, would result in an extension to the current collective bargaining agreement.

If Toronto indeed gets approval, the city would need to get ready for 12 teams — and upwards of 600 players and team staff — descending on Scotiabank Arena for games.

The Star’s Mark Zwolinski has more details.

10:18 a.m.: A different kind of Canada Day has dawned across the country, with large celebrations in many parts of the nation replaced with backyard barbecues and digital events due to COVID-19.

The pandemic has led to the cancellation of high-profile events like the annual pomp and pageantry on Parliament Hill in favour of online offerings to keep crowds from gathering.

Instead, the Ottawa shows will be streamed at midday and in the evening, followed by virtual fireworks as part of a buffet of digital activities Canadian Heritage has curated.

The 53 bells of the Peace Tower will still ring today, with two special recitals streamed live.

The Star’s Margaryta Ignatenko has a list of what Toronto residents can do, and what’s open and closed.

8:29 a.m.: If you look closely at this mosaic, you’ll see 3,025 photos selected from over 7,000 pictures filed by Toronto Star photographers since the newsroom was shut down by COVID-19 quarantine orders on March 17, 2020.

The Canada Day composite depicts Toronto teacher Meradith Black in a flag mask. These images were compiled by Visuals Editor Taras Slawnych, who assigned to photographers from his dining room table.

8 a.m.: Before all this, every Canadian had their own version of Canada Day. Maybe it was a barbecue, a fair, a parade. Maybe it was just a day off, finally. Maybe it was on Parliament Hill, or in your backyard, unless you didn’t have a backyard; then maybe you could join the crowd, all carrying little Canadian flags, to see the fireworks.

But this is the pandemic year, Star columnist Bruce Arthur writes, and our collective experiences have been atomized as we were kept apart, together. So now our most common Canada Day experience may be this: how much can you pretend that everything’s the same?

7:24 a.m.: India reported 18,653 new coronavirus cases and 507 deaths in the past 24 hours with June proving to be the worst month since the pandemic hit the country in late January.

India’s total cases reached 585,493 on Wednesday, more than 400,000 of them reported in June alone. India’s health ministry said 17,400 people have died.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed concern over negligence in maintaining social distance and wearing masks.

7:14 a.m.: South Korea is considering including religious facilities on the same list with nightclubs, hostess bars and karaoke rooms as “high risk” venues for the spread of COVID-19 following a slew of transmissions tied to church gatherings.

South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said during a virus meeting on Wednesday that more than 40 per cent of the country’s newly confirmed infections over the previous three days have been traced back to places of worship.

He pleaded people to refrain from religious gatherings and criticized churches and other facilities for failing to implement proper preventive measures, such as requiring followers to wear masks and sit apart during services.

7:10 a.m.: Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has extended the COVID-19 state of emergency for 60 days.

She said as of Tuesday there have been over 8,600 coronavirus cases in the state, with over a quarter of those cases identified in the past two weeks. The Oregon Health Authority said 207 people in Oregon have died from the disease.

The state of emergency declaration is the legal underpinning for the executive orders Brown has issued throughout the pandemic, including her orders on reopening Oregon, as well as orders related to child care, schools, and higher education operations.

Extending the state of emergency declaration allows those orders to stay in effect. She will review and re-evaluate each of her emergency orders every 60 days. Brown said this extension will last through Sept. 4.

7:05 a.m.: An Australian state leader has welcomed “some sense of stability” in numbers of new coronavirus cases detected daily in the nation’s second largest city as more than 300,000 residents prepare to be locked down for a month.

There were 73 confirmed cases in Melbourne in 24 hours Wednesday, up from 64 reported on Tuesday but less than 75 on Monday.

Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews says “it is pleasing that there is some sense of stability to these numbers. There is the beginning of some consistency here.”

He said a “significant concentration” of the new cases were in the 36 hot spot suburbs that will be locked down from Wednesday night until July 29 in a bid to halt the spread.

Thousands of officials conducted more than 20,000 tests in Melbourne since Tuesday, going door-to-door and through dozens of testing centres in the targeted suburbs.

7 a.m.: The number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus in Pakistan has surpassed 100,000, about 50 per cent of total infections.

The virus has spread in Pakistan at one of the fastest rates in the world since February, and the deaths have jumped since May, when Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown despite warnings from experts.

In Wednesday’s statement, the national command and control centre said 100,802 patients have recovered out of 213,469 confirmed cases. Pakistan recorded 41,33 more cases and 91 deaths in the last 24 hours.

6:50 a.m.: Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea reopened after being closed for four months due to the coronavirus pandemic, with hundreds of visitors applauding as they were let in Wednesday.

The two parks have new guidelines, including limiting the number of entrants in three shifts to maintain social distancing.

No handshakes, hugging or photos taken with Mickey Mouse and other characters are allowed.

Though characters greet guests from afar, their signature parades and shows have been suspended to avoid crowds.

6:47 a.m.: A protest against Africa’s first COVID-19 vaccine trial was underway Wednesday as experts note a worrying level of resistance and misinformation around testing on the continent.

Anti-vaccine sentiment in Africa is “the worst I’ve ever seen,” the CEO of the GAVI vaccine alliance, Seth Berkley, told an African Union vaccine conference last week.

“In general, people in Africa know the diseases and want to protect each other,” he said. “In this case, the rumour mill has been dramatic.”

The trial that began last week in Johannesburg is part of one already underway in Britain of the vaccine developed at the University of Oxford. Some 2,000 volunteers in South Africa are expected to take part.

It’s important that vaccines be tested in Africa to see how they perform in the local context, professor of vaccinology Shabir Madhi, leader of the new COVID-19 vaccine trial in South Africa, told reporters and others in a webinar Sunday.

But the small band of demonstrators who gathered Wednesday at the University of the Witwatersrand, where the trial is based, reflect long-running fears among some in Africa over testing drugs on people who don’t understand the risks.

“The people chosen as volunteers for the vaccination, they look as if they’re from poor backgrounds, not qualified enough to understand” protest organizer Phapano Phasha told The Associated Press ahead of the event. “We believe they are manipulating the vulnerable.”

4 a.m.: Nineteen people from 13 different countries will become new Canadian citizens today in a special Canada Day ceremony.

The virtual ceremony takes place this afternoon and will bring together people ranging in age from six to 66 to swear the oath and hear from the prime minister and other dignitaries.

Canada Day citizenship ceremonies are a hallmark of the holiday, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced them online — since April 1, there have been over 1,000 virtual events.

Today’s event is also expected to highlight something many Canadians have learned during the pandemic: the crucial role immigrants play in staffing Canada’s health-care system.

Tuesday 9 p.m..: As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,111 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,720 deaths, up a total of 148 new cases since Monday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

In just a month, the rate of daily infections has fallen by nearly half in Ontario. On June 1, the province was seeing an average of about 365 new cases per day; as of Tuesday, the daily average was down to 186.

Most of that decrease has come in Toronto, which has seen its daily average fall even more sharply than in the rest of the province, from 161 cases per day to 52.

Meanwhile, the health units reported four more fatal cases Tuesday, well below the recent trend. The death rate has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Tuesday, the province reported that 213 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 42 in intensive care, of whom 34 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data since early April. At their highest levels, more than 1,000 patients were hospitalized with the disease in Ontario, with as many as 217 ventilated.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,672 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"OTTAWA—When Sweeny Karande was in her nursing program in India, her teacher presented her with an award as the best outgoing student.

“This is just the beginning,” her teacher said. “You can’t stop here.”

Karande took those words to heart.

The next nine years were full of new beginnings as she journeyed from India to Ontario to Nova Scotia and then the Northwest Territories, where she now works full time as a registered nurse.

There will be another new beginning this Canada Day: Karande is set to join 18 others in swearing the oath to become a Canadian citizen.

Canada Day citizenship ceremonies are a holiday tradition, but this year, the COVID-19 pandemic means the celebrations are going digital.

Karande’s ceremony won’t be the first held online. Since April 1, over 1,000 virtual oath ceremonies have taken place, mostly quiet affairs.

The marquee Canada Day group event will be streamed on YouTube, and is expected to feature remarks from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former governor general Adrienne Clarkson.

People ranging in age from six to 66 will take the oath, representing 13 different countries, the Immigration Department said.

While they’re all united in their new citizenship, some have another bond: they work in health care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role new Canadians play in the health-care system.

According to data from the 2016 census, more than a third of the 245,000 people working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates are immigrants.

Karande, now 29, grew up in a large village in the southwestern Indian state of Goa, where she’d always wanted to become a nurse.

Her family couldn’t afford university tuition, so she enrolled in an auxiliary nursing and midwifery program.

When a recruiter for Canadian personal support worker programs came calling in 2010, her siblings pooled their money together so she could enrol.

She arrived in Cornwall, Ont. the next year, where she lived in a two-bedroom apartment with three other Indian students, often relying on the food bank to get by.

She did a placement at St. Joseph’s Continuing Care Centre, and one night her colleagues knocked on her door. On the street was a whole SUV filled with food for her and her roommates.

She would find equally welcoming communities, she said, when she arrived in Halifax for nursing school, and again when she moved up to Hay River, N.W.T., to take a full-time nursing job.

“This was my end goal, and finally I am a nurse and I’m getting my citizenship — this is really awesome,” she said.

“I love every bit of it.”

Omair Imtiaz is also becoming a citizen on Canada Day, a feat he also attributes in part to the kindness and guidance of many near strangers along the way.

He was sent to Canada by his father in 2007 to join his older brother, already in Moncton, N.B.

From there, he moved to P.E.I, and found himself struggling to balance the demands of his undergraduate degree, part-time jobs and the freedom of student life in Canada.

He ended up suspended from university, and was on the cusp of losing his student visa and being forced to leave.

A classmate sat him down at a party and said she’d help him get through it.

The day before his visa expired, they went to reenrol in school. He had intended to study to be a pharmacy technician, but he changed his mind after speaking with the enrolment officer and he signed up for a residential care worker program instead.

The woman from the party? She became his wife. And the program led to the job he’s now held for eight years at the John Gillis Memorial Lodge in Belfast, P.E.I.

“I can never count my blessings enough for what Canada and its people have given me,” he said.

“So this is my way of giving back to the community, giving to the most vulnerable.”

Imtiaz, 32, said when he walked through the doors of the care home, many residents had never seen a brown person before.

He was met with hostility, but within days familiarity bred comfort and then genuine friendship, he said.

“Education and that personal contact can go a long way,” he said.

Karande said she’s fielded her own experiences with racism. But it was finding out about Canada’s own record on that score that has stuck with her more.

While in nursing school, she learned about Indigenous history and the impact the residential school system was having on the current health and well-being of Indigenous communities.

India had its own experiences with British colonialism that linger to this day, she said, but to be confronted with the harmful effects on Indigenous Peoples in Canada shocked her.

She decided to turn the anger to action.

“I felt like I was obligated to do so,” she said.

“I was just doing my part.”

She began to search for nursing jobs in Indigenous centres, finally landing in Hay River, a town of nearly 4,000 people where just under half identify as Indigenous.

She’s been there now for almost a year, working at the Hay River Health and Social Services Authority. She described the move up North as scary, given what she’d heard about the cold, but has now embraced the outdoor lifestyle.

She is also committed to reconciliation.

With her citizenship comes the right to vote — a right that she intends to take seriously.

“It is a privilege to have the opportunity make change,” she said.

“I believe there is a lot of change that needs to be implemented in terms of Indigenous people, in terms of different races and how they are being treated in Canada. I’m very excited that I’m finally a citizen.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"OTTAWA—Large celebrations were replaced in many parts of the nation with backyard gatherings and digital events as Canadians marked a Canada Day unlike any other in the country’s 153-year history.

It has been almost four months since governments ordered businesses closed and urged Canadians to stay home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus with restrictions only recently being eased.

Heading into Canada Day, the country had 104,204 reported cases of COVID-19, including 8,591 deaths and 67,954 recoveries, based on figures updated late Tuesday by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

Millions have lost their jobs, government spending has skyrocketed to provide emergency relief — planned federal spending alone now tops $174 billion. Demand has also jumped for social services such as food banks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spent part of his morning with his family harvesting broccoli at the farm operated by the Ottawa Food Bank.

The organization says demand has levelled out since an initial serge in need during the pandemic, but it now expects another large spike in demand once recipients max out payments through the $80-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Speaking afterward, Trudeau noted the tough circumstances many people in the country found themselves in this year, such as families separated from loved ones, including front-line health workers.

He said this year was not the first time the nation’s birth was celebrated in tough times, pointing to celebrations one year into the Second World War, when there was a message of opportunity amidst a crisis.

“That was the reality our parents and grandparents were called to face. That was the challenge to which they rose and this is the country they built,” Trudeau said, standing alongside his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.

“On this Canada Day, it is our turn. We must now restart and rebuild a Canada for the 21st century. My friends, I know that together we are ready.”

In her Canada Day message, Gov. Gen. Julie Payette noted April’s mass shooting in Nova Scotia, reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples and the need to denounce hatred.

“I am confident that we have and that we will not remain indifferent,” she said. “That will build on our ability to act collectively, to act as one for the good of all.”

The pandemic forced the cancellation of high-profile events like the annual pomp and pageantry on Parliament Hill in favour of online offerings to keep crowds from gathering.

Instead, the Ottawa show was streamed live, to be followed by virtual fireworks as part of a buffet of digital activities Canadian Heritage curated. The 53 bells of the Peace Tower still rang, with two special recitals streamed live.

Federal officials had already begun reshaping the annual celebration months ago, knowing that construction on the iconic Centre Block would force a change from the schedule in recent years where artists performed on a large stage set up on Parliament Hill.

As some of that work was underway, COVID-19 forced what Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said was a radical rethink of how to host the musical shows and making decisions well in advance without knowing what condition the country would be in come July 1.

“We’re happy that we were able to come up with this formula and we’re hoping Canadians will enjoy it a lot because they’ve made a lot of sacrifices in the last few months,” Guilbeault said in a morning interview.

Canada Day, he said, was “a day to celebrate those sacrifices and the fact that collectively we’ve pulled through this. It’s not over yet, but things are looking brighter.”

Some of the elements provided online could stay in place for future Canada Day festivities, particularly to help connect people who far apart, he said.

In other parts of the country, crowds were allowed to gather, including for actual fireworks displays.

On Tuesday, Alberta’s chief medical officer, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, said that up to 200 people could gather for audience-type outdoor community events such as fireworks and festivals.

“Celebrate Canada Day safely,” she tweeted. “Wear a mask, wash your hands and stay (two metres) apart.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jennifer Pagliarocity Hall Bureau', 'City Hall Bureau', 'Jennifer Pagliaro Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering City Hall', 'Municipal Politics For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-30,"Landlords will be required to meet a minimum of health and safety standards during the COVID-19 pandemic after council voted Tuesday to temporarily amend a by-law applying to multi-residential apartment buildings.

Tenants in populated high-rises and advocates were concerned enough wasn’t being done to keep their homes safe. That led Coun. Josh Matlow to move a motion at council on Tuesday asking for the by-law changes that include requiring landlords to provide hand sanitizer or hand-washing stations at building entrances and other common spaces.

Though Toronto Public Health released health and safety guidelines for landlords during the pandemic, the Federation of Metro Toronto Tenants’ Associations — which represents over 3,000 members — recorded in a recent survey of 577 tenants that 50 per cent of landlords had not adopted any new cleaning practices during the pandemic.

“It has become clear that landlords are not voluntarily complying with the guidelines established by the City to protect tenants,” Matlow’s motion said. “This is particularly concerning in light of recent data released by Toronto Public Health showing that the majority of new ‘sporadic’ or community cases are occurring in low-income neighbourhoods with a significant percentage of racialized people that must work outside of the home in congregate settings.”

City staff suggested Tuesday it may be difficult to enforce the new rules across the city.

But Coun. Joe Cressy, who chairs the city’s board of health, said he hopes the move to enshrine those public health guidelines in the by-law will help encourage compliance from landlords without need for city-wide enforcement.

In Thorncliffe Park, where Toronto Public Health documented 644 positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, tenant Aashir Vahidy said while his and other buildings in the area initially had hand sanitizer available at entrances it has since run out and not been refilled.

“It looks very good but other than that, no more soap,” he said.

He said making sure he washes his hands and socially distances in his building in line with public health advice is up to him, but shared spaces should also be better managed by landlords.

“It is my responsibility as well but when we are entering into the building there is a lot of people that have touched the doors,” said Vahidy, who lives in a smaller building but has visited nearby high-rises where he said he has rarely found the city-recommended measures in place. “Property management should be taking care of that.”

Matlow also successfully moved a motion asking the provincial government to provide rent supports for tenants as they continue to face financial hardship and to better protect them against future evictions as the province moves to speed up that process through new legislation.

And like many observers, the most recent iteration threw the Vancouver Canucks defenceman for a loop.

A mystery club — a placeholder referred to as Team E — beat the odds in Friday’s draw with a 2.5 per cent chance to secure the top pick and the right to select star winger Alexis Lafrenière at the pandemic-delayed 2020 draft.

That means eight franchises, potentially some with Stanley Cup aspirations, will take part in a subsequent lottery following this summer’s qualifying round, should the NHL be able to conclude its season under a 24-team format after it was shuttered by COVID-19 in mid-March.

So if things don’t go well for Sidney Crosby’s Pittsburgh Penguins, Connor McDavid’s Edmonton Oilers, the offensively stacked Toronto Maple Leafs or even Hughes and the Canucks, each will have a 12.5 per cent chance of landing a pretty nice consolation prize for missing the playoffs.

“Some of these teams that are in the (qualifying) round, they’re pretty much all high-end teams,” Hughes said on a video conference call Tuesday. “And they’re going to get the best player in the draft.

“So it’s a little crazy.”

The 20-year-old Hughes watched last spring’s lottery with keen interest, knowing that how the balls fell would determine his younger brother’s landing spot.

The New Jersey Devils, with the third-best odds, moved up to No. 1 and proceeded to take Jack Hughes with the top pick two and a half months later at the draft in Vancouver.

Quinn Hughes, who’s one of the favourites to win the Calder Trophy as NHL rookie of the year after a standout season, no doubt also kept an eye on the 2018 lottery, when the Canucks wound up with the seventh selection, which they eventually used to snag the smooth-skating blueliner.

Friday’s lottery saw the Los Angeles Kings grab the second pick, the Ottawa Senators secure the third and fifth slots and the last-place Detroit Red Wings drop from No. 1 to No. 4.

Things at the very top, however, remain unsettled.

“We had a lot of fun watching,” said Hughes, who’s taking part in two weeks of cohort quarantine in Vancouver after arriving from the United States.

“It’s definitely very exciting. I remember Jack being in that situation last year and watching that and being real nervous for him. We all wanted to see where maybe Lafrenière would end up.

Read', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-06-30,"VICTORIA—Four months after COVID-19 surfaced in British Columbia’s long-term-care homes, residents are finally allowed to see a loved one, health authorities announced Tuesday.

Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s advocate for seniors, said people were in tears after hearing government health restrictions will be eased to permit one designated person to see a long-term-care resident after being limited to virtual meetings or phone calls since March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We’ve all sacrificed, but the sacrifices by seniors in long-term care and their loved ones for four months has been one of the more onerous burdens to bear,” she said. “It’s a first step, and I think and hope in the next month, the number of visits will be expanded beyond just one person.”

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the one-person designation could be expanded for more visitors in the future, but she wanted to start slowly.

“We will be monitoring this on an ongoing basis to ensure that we can expand access as soon as is safe to do so,” Henry said at a news conference. “Like many businesses that have reopened, those facilities will need to have plans and precautions in place.”

Provincial long-term-care homes were restricted to essential visitors only since March in an effort to protect residents and prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

Henry said the facilities now must have written safety plans before allowing visitors.

It could take up to 10 days for a facility to be ready to accept people, but Henry said care homes have already been planning for visitors.

Designated visitors must bring their own masks to wear and will be screened for signs of illness before entering the facility, she said. Visitors must book in advance and facilities where there are active COVID-19 outbreaks will remain closed, she said.

Henry said she is immensely aware of the impacts the restrictions have had on residents and family members, but those days are coming to an end now that the COVID-19 risk has been lowered in B.C.

“We had to move quickly and decisively to protect our most vulnerable citizens,” she said. “Every day, this weighs heavily on us. There have been many dark and anxious days, but today is a brighter day for us all.”

Henry paid tribute to the resilience and courage shown by residents and their families over the past months, saying “this has been a difficult time for you to be separated from the ones you love.”

Health Ministry data show of the 174 COVID-19 deaths in B.C., 122 were seniors in long-term care, assisted-living facilities or hospitals.

The province reported 12 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, increasing the provincial total to 2,916. There were no reported deaths. The government said 2,590 people have recovered from the virus.

Mackenzie, who had been calling for earlier visitor access at long-term-care facilities, said four months without seeing husbands, wives, grandmothers and grandfathers was too long and many people were suffering from loneliness and their health was in danger of deteriorating.

“It’s not a risk-free decision,” Mackenzie said, acknowledging that once COVID-19 appears in a care facility the results could be “devastating.”

“There was a lot of balancing and that took time for people to work through,” she said. “At some point, the risk of no visits started to outweigh the risk from COVID-19.”

A COVID-19 outbreak at North Vancouver’s Lynn Valley Care Centre resulted in the deaths of 20 residents.

Part of the early spread of COVID-19 in B.C.’s care homes was linked to employees working in multiple facilities and the provincial government has since enacted a single-site policy ensuring workers stay at one facility.

Reach Him Via Email', 'Ekeenan Thestar.Ca']",2020-06-30,"WASHINGTON—In Albert Camus’ The Plague, the narrator explains why officials and townsfolk are so reluctant to respond in time to a deadly epidemic. “Stupidity had a knack of getting its way,” he says.

His townspeople kept “doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views,” because “they fancied themselves free, and no one will ever be free as long as there are pestilences.”

The words seem especially apt today in the U.S., where after business and social reopenings in May and June cheered by President Donald Trump, the country now faces a coronavirus crisis arguably as severe as it has ever been.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helps lead the U.S. coronavirus task force, warned senators on Tuesday that the current record-high 40,000 cases being detected per day could increase dramatically. “I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around,” he told them.

And yet like Camus’ characters the warnings were resisted. “We shouldn’t presume that a group of experts somehow knows what’s best for everyone,” Republican Sen. Rand Paul said in response to Fauci.

Even as other countries celebrate COVID-19 success, the sobering truth is sinking in that in much of the U.S., the virus is surging and threatens to overwhelm hospitals. Some states are re-closing businesses in response. The European Union is barring U.S. travellers. Vice-President Mike Pence has shifted his tone to encourage mask use and slower-paced reopenings.

“This is really the beginning,” Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told the Journal of the American Medical Association Monday. “I think there was a lot of wishful thinking around the country that, hey it’s summer. Everything’s going to be fine,” she said. “We are not even beginning to be over this.”

A symbol of the Trump administration’s optimism crashing into reality came from Jacksonville, Florida. On June 11, Trump announced he was moving the August Republican presidential convention there from Charlotte, North Carolina because he wanted a site where officials wouldn’t insist on masks and social distancing. On Monday, the mayor of Jacksonville implemented a mandatory mask order as Florida cases have surged fivefold in two weeks.

Still, some people persist in resisting warnings: Sen. Rand Paul said to Fauci Tuesday, “We shouldn’t presume that a group of experts somehow knows what’s best for everyone.”

Whether Paul has a point about experts always knowing what’s best or not, many of them predicted a situation like the one occurring now. Some I spoke to in May, as Georgia and Texas allowed businesses to reopen even as virus transmission remained high, said a disease resurgence was likely.

Jon Zelner, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, says you could psychoanalyze the behaviour leading to the resurgence as a culture war over freedom and individuality, but that he thinks it comes down to the difficulty of seeing cause and effect when cases and hospitalizations lag behind behaviour.

“If you’re motivated to think that your activity is harmless, it’s easy to find evidence for that by not seeing new cases cropping up all around you in the days or even one to two weeks after you really let your foot off the brake,” he says. He also says age, race, and wealth can drive a “sense of invulnerability” in some places.

The surge is likely not just frustrating to those who predicted it, but to the leaders who ignored the predictions, as the major aims of the aggressive push to reopen may soon prove to have been self-defeating. One aim, repeated often by Trump and supporters, was to bring the economy back.

But boutique owner Alex Belt in Houston told the New York Times this weekend her situation since reopening was “business as usual without the business.” An initial surge of customers has since disappeared as the virus has surged, she said. “People are just scared.”

Analysts at the Bank of America, Moody’s Analytics, and the Federal Reserve of Boston have warned in recent days that the resurgence of the virus threatens any economic recovery.

Trump has been promising the “Great American Comeback” on the campaign trail. Which suggests the second presumed aim of the aggressive reopening strategy. The president’s reelection hopes are thought to depend on an economic bounceback. If the economy lags, the strategy could backfire.

More so if people see a rise in illness and death in states Trump needs to win. That the virus resurgence is most pronounced in states that followed Trump’s lead most closely — places he won easily in 2016 — could hurt his political prospects even more. Polls in Texas and Georgia this week showed Democratic candidate Joe Biden competitive with Trump — any election in which those states are close is not one Trump is likely to win.

Which is aside from the human cost of a protracted epidemic in suffering, lost lives, fear and isolation. As in the case of Camus’ townsfolk, it appears leaders fancied themselves free to make decisions despite the virus, but are finding those decisions cannot work as long as the virus runs rampant, at great cost.

Zelner, of the University of Michigan, says it’s an “open question” whether authorities are learning their lesson.

“I think state and local health departments have been almost uniformly great across the board from the beginning, but elected officials and the public have not always been motivated to listen,” he says. “I worry in some places — and at the executive level — the strategy may just devolve into letting this thing ‘burn itself out.’”

Perceptions of danger, economics, and politics will likely continue to propel a see-saw of reopenings and closings, but Zelner thinks the status quo of regional surges in cases will probably prevail until either a vaccine or herd immunity slow the virus’ spread. “I think this noisy, spatially heterogeneous ‘thing’ we’re in right now is probably going to be what it looks like for awhile, until we get our act together or the biology takes care of it for us,” he says. “I hope it’s the former rather than the latter, but I’m not optimistic at a national level.”

Several southern and western states are seeing surging new case numbers, prompting some to put reopening plans on hold.

“The numbers speak for themselves. I’m very concerned. I’m not satisfied with what’s going on because we’re going in the wrong direction,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “Clearly we are not in total control right now.”

Fauci said he wouldn’t be surprised to see new cases rise by 100,000 a day if recent surges don’t turn around, up from the current level of about 40,000 a day. As for the number of deaths, “it is going to be very disturbing, I guarantee you that,” he said.

Fauci and other witnesses cited indoor gatherings as a major cause of recent spikes, singling out bars in particular. On Monday, Arizona paused operations at bars, gyms and movie theatres. Florida and Texas took steps to rein in bars on Friday, with Florida banning consumption of alcohol in bars and Texas closing them altogether. New York New Jersey and Connecticut, former hot spots earlier in the pandemic, added 16 states to their self-quarantine orders for visitors.

Rising hospitalizations

Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that in addition to the rise in new cases, hospitalizations are up in 12 states. The U.S. has recorded more than 2.6 million COVID-19 cases in total, with more than 126,000 deaths from the virus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Redfield and Fauci appeared before the Senate health committee for a hearing on reopening U.S. businesses and returning students to school. Fauci said schools may need to consider online classes or staggered schedules to safely bring students back. The CDC will issue guidance for schools on Tuesday.

Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with comments on wearing masks, saying the issue shouldn’t be as politicized as it’s become and that he’s asked President Donald Trump to wear a mask to set an example. Vice President Mike Pence appeared in Texas over the weekend in a mask and spoke about the value of covering your face in protecting against the virus.

Fauci told the panel, “I think we need to emphasize the responsibility we have as individuals and as part of a societal effort to end the epidemic and we all have to play a part in that.”

Vaccine guidelines

Several drugmakers are racing to complete clinical trials of vaccine candidates, with some expecting to wrap up in months studies that under previous circumstances have tended to take years. The Food and Drug Administration laid out standards for approving an inoculation, saying any candidate would have to be at least 50 per cent more effective than a placebo.

Fauci said that he’s “aspirationally hopeful” that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be ready in early 2021, though he cautioned that there’s no guarantee that a safe vaccine will be developed.

Some health experts have expressed worry that FDA will rush to approve a vaccine before enough is known about safety or efficacy but the agency sought to allay those fears with the guidance.

As for airlines, while the CDC hasn’t focused on their plans, American Airlines Group Inc.’s announcement on Friday that it would resume selling flights to capacity on July 1 rather than capping passengers to keep them socially distanced caused “substantial disappointment” among public health officials, Redfield said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus is currently carried by pigs, but in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers argued that it has “all the hallmarks” of being able to adapt and infect humans. Scientists recommend that measures should be taken to control the virus in its current form, and that anyone who works with pigs should be closely monitored for the disease.

The fact that humans would have little or no immunity to this new virus means that it could mutate into a major threat.

The virus may not be an immediate problem, but it does come as a reminder that, even with coronavirus still wreaking havoc around the globe, there are always new pathogens that can emerge.

“Right now we are distracted with coronavirus and rightly so. But we must not lose sight of potentially dangerous new viruses,” Prof Kin-Chow Chang of Nottingham University told the BBC.

“We should not ignore it.”

Their schedules are dictated by doctors’ appointments, physical therapy sessions and bouts of exhaustion. After weeks on ventilators, two siblings remain too weak to work even as their medical bills mount.

But at a table filled with several members of a tight-knit New Jersey family, the Fuscos, who lost five relatives to the coronavirus, the conversation repeatedly veers away from the chaos and pain of the past three months.

They do not avoid talk of their family’s devastating collective loss. But they also speak of a new focus: finding a remedy for the disease that killed their mother, three siblings and an aunt.

At least 19 other family members contracted the virus, and those who survived COVID-19 did not emerge unscathed.

Joe Fusco, 49, lost 55 pounds and spent 30 days on a ventilator. His sister, Maria Reid, 44, cannot shake the memory of the disjointed hallucinations that dogged her during the 19 or 20 days she was unconscious, or the terror of waking up convinced that her 10-year-old daughter was dead.

“This ain’t over,” Joe Fusco said of the pandemic on a recent afternoon in the backyard of his home in Freehold. “This ain’t over in the least bit.”

“I want to help somebody,” he added. “I don’t want anyone else to have to lose five family members.”

The Fuscos were unwilling pioneers charting an early course through all that was unknown about a virus that has killed more than 126,000 people in the United States.

They are now trailblazers of another kind, subjects of at least three scientific studies.

Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is conducting research that involves evaluating the DNA of the surviving and deceased members of the large Italian-American family for genetic clues. DNA from those who died will be retrieved from hairbrushes, a toothbrush, a blood sample and tissue from an unrelated gallbladder surgery.

Each Thursday, Elizabeth Fusco, the youngest of the 11 children, donates antibody-rich blood plasma that is used to treat patients with the virus to determine if it can help boost their immune response.

“We know another wave is going to come,” Elizabeth Fusco said. “It’s inevitable. Whatever will help this world is all I care about.”

Their help may prove useful well before the predicted second wave hits as states like Florida and Texas confront an alarming surge in new cases.

The Fusco family’s trauma began just before the state’s lockdown, as a slow cascade of closures marked the start of a new normal.

On March 13, Rita Fusco Jackson, 56, became the second person to die of COVID-19 in New Jersey, which has since recorded 14,992 deaths, making it No. 2 in the nation behind New York for virus-related fatalities.

Within a week, her mother, Grace Fusco, 73, and two brothers, Carmine, 55, and Vincent, 53, had also died. Grace Fusco’s sister on Staten Island died weeks later.

Their story became an urgent, cautionary tale about the potency of the disease and the importance of staying apart at a time when social distancing was still a novel concept.

During the first week of March, Carmine Fusco, the eldest son who was visiting from Pennsylvania, had described feeling chilled during a routine Tuesday dinner in Freehold that drew about 25 family members, his siblings said.

The precise source of the extended family’s infection is unclear, said Joe Fusco, a horse owner like his father and brothers who had spent time in the weeks beforehand with both brothers who died. He recalls waking up feeling “beat up” the morning after the dinner, which was held at the house where his mother lived with three of his siblings and their families.

He was admitted to the hospital days later, beginning a medical odyssey that would last 44 days. Much of the treatment was experimental, he said, and involved trial and error.

“When I was leaving the hospital, the doctor said, ‘You don’t realize the debt of gratitude the world owes your family,’” said Joe Fusco, the father of three children ages 10 to 18.

As news accounts of their story swept the globe, the family was cited by state health officials as a prime reason for staying apart.

Still, even as they were being held up as the family no one wanted to become, Elizabeth Fusco was stepping into the role of the little sister everyone might hope to have.

Elizabeth Fusco, 42, and her daughter were among those who contracted the virus; like many other family members, they never showed symptoms.

With four people already dead, two on ventilators and a sister hospitalized and receiving oxygen, Elizabeth Fusco emerged as a ferocious advocate, even as she feared for her own daughter, Alexandra, who is 12 and was born with a serious health condition, congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

“They would tell me to calm down,” she said. “No. I’m not going to calm down. Tell someone who didn’t lose a mom, a sister and two brothers in a matter of less than seven days to calm down.

“Tell me how you’re going to save my brother and sister.”

The family held a four-person funeral April 1. They remain anguished that the two siblings who were on ventilators at the time were not there and are planning a memorial celebration and burial after a full Mass in early August.

Elizabeth Fusco said she temporarily shoved mourning aside. “I consumed my time with — I’m not going to lose another one,” she said.

Desperate, she and other relatives pushed doctors to try a variety of treatments: remdesivir, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine.

“I don’t care if you were giving them rat poison — if you told me that that was going to fix them,” she said, her voice trailing off.

She called the governor on his cellphone. She and her mother’s cousin, Roseann Paradiso Fodera, a family spokeswoman, were on a first-name basis with congressional aides. They lobbied anyone who would listen for access to experimental medicines, and, later, for autopsies that never happened.

In that mad flurry, they were buoyed by neighbours, acquaintances half a world away and lifelong friends.

“You’d open your door,” said Dana Fusco, Joe’s wife. “You’d have groceries at your door. You’d have meals. The community was truly amazing.”

The nurses and the medical staff at CentraState Medical Center, the hospital in Freehold where Grace Fusco and five of her children were treated, served as the family’s eyes, ears and loving hands at a time when visitors were not allowed inside.

“For 44 days, every three to four hours, I was on the phone with them,” Dana Fusco said. The hospital declined to comment, citing privacy concerns.

When her husband awoke Easter Sunday, she asked that he not be immediately told of the deaths. Once he was stronger, she was allowed a visit to tell him in person.

To the Fuscos, the virus’s path showed little logic. An infected relative who is a heavy smoker showed no symptoms, and two older uncles with myriad underlying health problems rebounded in about a week. Several of the sickest family members had no serious underlying health problems, Joe Fusco said.

More than three months later, a numb calm has set in.

“Like it didn’t happen,” Reid said. “It’s just they’re not here.”

Dwelling on the past, she said, is a luxury she does not have. “I’ve got to move on,” said Reid, who, along with her husband and daughter, shares a house with Joe’s family. “I’ve got a young daughter.”

Joe Fusco said he remained frustrated by the lackadaisical attitudes of people shown crowding together near beaches or outside bars without masks.

“These idiots are out there and not taking precautions,” he said. “Not wearing a mask. And not doing what they’re supposed to do. They’re out of their minds.”

Doctors say patients who recover from COVID-19 frequently need to rebuild muscle strength, and some may struggle with a range of respiratory, cardiac and kidney problems or be at increased risk of blood clots and stroke. Some patients who experienced delirium while on ventilators may be at greater risk of depression.

And those placed in induced comas also may lose muscle tone in their hands, causing fingers to clamp shut.

Much about the recovery from COVID-19 is unknown, said Dr. Laurie G. Jacobs, chairwoman of the Department of Medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center, which is setting up a clinic for patients recovering from COVID-19 to better understand, track and treat their varied needs.

“There’s a desperation for answers,” Jacobs said.

Joe Fusco said he found the seeming absence of uniform guidance for doctors treating patients recovering from COVID-19 frustrating. His doctor has ordered a battery of tests, he said, but his sister’s has not.

“You’d think there would be some sort of protocol to follow, but there’s not,” he said.

When Grace Fusco got sick enough to need a ventilator, she asked for a pillow that had belonged to her husband, who died in 2017, her rosary beads and a scapular, a small cloth pendant worn during prayer. She reminded her daughter to bring a tray of chicken the next night to the program for homeless people that she cooked for each week.

“She said, ‘Don’t worry. I’m going to be OK,’ ” Elizabeth Fusco recalled. “Tell everyone I love them.”

She never awoke, and never knew that any of her children had died.

“It would have killed her,” Joe Fusco said. “She was always — and I’m the same way — there’s a sequence to life, and burying your kids is not part of it.

“It’s not the way it’s supposed to go.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Giuseppe Valiantethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-30,"MONTREAL—Quebec is making masks mandatory for all public transit users, but Premier François Legault says police will not enforce the new rule and those who refuse to wear them won’t be fined.

Instead, Legault told reporters Tuesday in Montreal, employees of the various public transit agencies across the province will be responsible for enforcing the directive.

He also suggested a mixture of public shaming and the honour system will be enough to ensure transit riders are covering their face to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault says masks will be mandatory for everyone 12 and older as of July 13. Legault says there won't be any fines, but those not wearing one won't be permitted to board. Legault says masks are not a sign of fear, but rather a sign of respect for fellow citizens.

The new rule comes into effect July 13. Following a two-week grace period ending July 27, anyone without a mask will not be permitted onto a public transit system anywhere in the province.

“There are no fines,” Legault said. “The only negative consequence will be that you won’t have access. We expect the various transit agencies to apply the rules.”

Legault said he was also counting on Quebecers to be responsible and respectful of others.

“Just saying it’s mandatory sends a message,” he said, adding that transit riders can also police themselves. “A citizen can tell another citizen it’s mandatory to wear a mask.”

The union representing roughly 4,700 of Montreal’s bus and subway employees — which had been calling for months to make masks mandatory for transit users — indicated it wasn’t fully on board with the government’s plan.

Interim president Daniel Leroux declined an interview request but said in an emailed statement his union welcomes Legault’s announcement.

“However, our members won’t be playing mask police,” Leroux said. “It’s not up to our members to manage who has a mask and who doesn’t, nor to limit access to public transit.”

Legault said bus drivers, for instance, don’t let people on board without paying a fare, and the same principle should apply for masks.

Health Canada says COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets from infected people when they cough, sneeze, speak or laugh — including by those who may be asymptomatic. Wearing a mask, authorities say, can help block infected droplets from coming into contact with non-infected people.

Health officials in Quebec have strongly promoted wearing a mask in situations where physical distancing isn’t possible, but had resisted making them mandatory for a number of reasons, including availability of masks.

But Legault said the province is in a different phase now.

The province has largely reopened, Legault said, adding there are more people taking public transit. Legault also pointed to U.S. states such as Florida and Texas, which have witnessed a sudden increase in COVID-19 cases as they reopened bars and restaurants.

“Wearing a mask is not about fear — it’s about respect,” the premier said. “Wearing a mask protects other people in case we’re infected.”

Any transit user over the age of 12 will be required to wear a mask, while it is “strongly recommended” that children between the ages of two and 12 wear one, he said.

Children younger than two years old, however, should not wear a mask on public transit because it could be dangerous for their health, said Legault.

Both Legault and Dr. Horacio Arruda, director of public health, said they have not ruled out making masks mandatory in other public areas, including stores.

Arruda said the government wanted to proceed “gradually,” and any new rules will be imposed as a function of the rate of COVID-19 infection in the province.

Quebec reported 68 new cases of COVID-19 Tuesday along with 18 more deaths — seven of which occurred in the previous 24 hours. The province now has reported 55,458 infections, including 24,798 cases considered recovered, as well as a total of 5,503 deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus.

Read', 'Carlotta Gallthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Carlotta Gallthe New York Timestue.']",2020-06-30,"ISTANBUL—An American NASA scientist returned with his family to the United States early Tuesday morning after nearly four years of imprisonment and house arrest in Turkey, and more than seven months after President Donald Trump said he had secured an agreement for his release.

The scientist, Serkan Golge, arrived in Washington on a commercial flight shortly after midnight, ending a tortuous journey for him and his family, who had become caught up in increasingly fraught Turkish-American relations.

Trump’s public dealings with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey have run a roller coaster from warm expressions of friendship to explosive threats on Twitter to ruin the Turkish economy.

At a White House briefing in November with Erdogan, Trump announced that Golge would be heading home and personally thanked his Turkish counterpart for releasing Golge from detention, though he remained under judicial control for several more months.

“That was a very nice tribute,” Trump said in November. “He’ll be coming back at some point in the not too distant future. That’s very good news for the United States and also very good news for Turkey.”

Erdogan did not mention Golge in his comments at that news briefing.

Golge’s case, along with those of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was held for two years, and three Turkish employees of U.S. consulates, one of whom was sentenced to more than eight years in prison this month, have been seen by U.S. and European officials as a form of hostage-taking for leverage.

Erdogan’s government has wanted several court cases in the United States against Turkish officials, potentially implicating Erdogan and his family, to be dropped. One such case, involving a state-owned bank accused of helping Iran evade sanctions, is still pending.

Ties between the United States and Turkey, ostensibly NATO allies, have been badly frayed since an attempted coup against Erdogan in July 2016. Among those involved in the coup were followers of a U.S.-based Muslim preacher, Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government describes as the main instigator, and it has demanded his extradition, so far to no avail.

Turkey then went ahead last year with the purchase of a Russian anti-aircraft missile system, despite NATO warnings that operating such a system was incompatible with membership in the alliance. Trump responded by cancelling the sale of advanced F-35 jets to Turkey.

The relationship reached a new low in October, with Erdogan’s invasion of northeastern Syria, an offensive against U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces that risked direct conflict with U.S. troops and threatened to undermine the fight against the Islamic State.

None of those issues were resolved in the talks in November, leaving the release of Golge as the only concrete achievement of the meeting.

Golge was one of up to 20 U.S. citizens who have been imprisoned or prevented from leaving the country in a crackdown by the Turkish government after the failed coup. More than 100,000 people in total were detained, some for direct involvement in the coup but many more on the flimsiest evidence, accused of involvement with Gulen’s movement.

Golge, 40, a naturalized U.S. citizen, holds a Ph.D. in physics from Old Dominion University. He lived near Houston and had worked on preparations for NASA’s Mars mission.

He was detained in July 2016 while visiting his parents in southern Turkey and was accused of being a member of the Gulen movement — he insists he is not — which the government calls a terrorist organization.

The only evidence of that association that was produced at his trial was that he had held an account at Bank Asya, which was linked to the movement, and that a $1 bill was found in his parents’ house, supposedly a secret sign of membership.

Golge’s wife, Kubra, and his two children, all U.S. citizens, were also barred from leaving Turkey.

Trump had been pushing Erdogan for Golge’s release for more than a year. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for terrorism charges, but was released from prison in May 2019. Trump announced then that Golge was being moved from prison to home custody and would be allowed back to the United States “pretty soon.”

But Turkish officials reacted to that statement by increasing judicial controls concerning his house arrest, according to Golge. Police officers in a parked car were posted outside his home around the clock for two weeks and followed him whenever he stepped out.

He was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements and had to sign in at the local police station four times a week, a regimen that was later reduced to twice and then once a week. Golge’s case is still pending a final appeal at Turkey’s Supreme Court.

Turkish law enforcement officials removed his ankle bracelet hours before the news briefing with Trump and Erdogan at the White House in November, but gave no indication why, Golge said.

“I was surprised,” Golge said on hearing Trump’s announcement. But his ordeal was not over.

The last judicial controls were only finally lifted in April, and international flights, grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic since March, only resumed this month.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'David Catanesemcclatchy Washington Bureau', 'Mcclatchy Washington Bureau', 'David Catanesemcclatchy Washington Bureautue.']",2020-06-30,"WASHINGTON—Long lines. Electronic tablets failing. Last-minute legal haggling. Delayed results because of a surge in absentee balloting. And a president casting doubt over the whole “rigged” process.

As Joe Biden expands his national and state polling lead over Donald Trump, Democrats can’t shake this nightmare November scenario: That even a Biden advantage heading into Election Day could be nullified by chaos at the polls, layered by added confusion around the fast-changing voting laws that officials are adjusting for an ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

“The thing that I am probably most concerned about,” Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon acknowledged to former Barack Obama campaign manager David Plouffe on his podcast recently, “is voting in this country.” It’s risen to such a priority that she indicated the campaign is debating running ads explicitly on voter education.

Even before voter accessibility was seen as arguably the most significant potential hurdle to a successful election year for Democrats, party officials had been taking steps to avoid — or at least reduce — chances for such an abominable ordeal, with early staffing and new technology to pinpoint and remedy problems.

Incidents that materialized during this spring’s messy primaries in states like Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania heightened the unease, but also served as valuable training ground for what’s to come this fall.

“What I worry about is going into an election three-four-five points up ... that could be impacted in close swing states if people don’t have the ability to cast votes,” said Dan Kanninen, a strategist who has worked for Mike Bloomberg and Obama.

A fleet of Democratic-aligned and non-partisan groups are raising awareness, lobbying state and county policy-makers and instigating lawsuits to enhance voting access. The Democratic National Committee demonstrated its commitment to the issue earlier than ever before by beginning staffing its voter protection team back in April of 2019.

Whereas the party traditionally ramps up these efforts in the fall before the election, this cycle the DNC has been preparing for challenges at the ballot box for more than a year, dedicating voter protection directors to states like Virginia and Pennsylvania last year. At present, they have them in 19 states.

The coronavirus has ensured this election will look different regardless. But new pressure on financially strapped states to safely administer elections as older, veteran polling workers opt to stay home to protect their health is causing fresh problems.

“I think the thought was, maybe, well, we’re going to mail ballots, so more people will vote by mail and we don’t need as many in-person voting locations. I think what you’ve seen in Georgia and Nevada specifically is that that’s not true,” said Reyna Walters-Morgan, the DNC’s director of voter protection. “You can’t replace in person voting locations. You have to have enough in-person voting options available because even if you do mail those ballots, people are still going to show up.”

With two U.S. Senate races and a razor-thin presidential contest, Georgia is an emerging battleground that is providing Democrats with both optimism and anxiety. Its June primary was hampered by lines that extended past midnight, last-minute polling place changes and allegations of disenfranchisement of Black voters.

“Georgia is the poster child for this dysfunction,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, during a recent U.S. House committee hearing.

The state’s July 21 runoff elections will be a key test to see if the problems are reduced.

But Republican lawmakers there are now pushing legislation that would halt the mailing of absentee ballot request forms to voters, placing the responsibility on voters to initiate the process to vote by mail. Studies show that white, older Republican voters are the most likely to request absentee ballots.

Rep. Dwight Evans, who represents a majority African American district in Philadelphia, said many of his constituents don’t trust a vote-by-mail process at a time when the president is threatening resources for the U.S. Postal Service.

“It gives a sense of uncertainty. That’s why they go to the polls and vote. Because they feel as if — and I can’t argue — it looks like it’s a strategy to prevent them from having full access to the polls,” Evans said. “In their heads, the only way they feel that they are going to actually ensure that their vote will count is they go to the polling place.”

Evans is sounding the alarm for Pennsylvania to add more staffers and secure voter drop boxes to minimize waits at polling places after it took his state more than a week to tally its June primary results. Biden recently said on “The Daily Show” it could take until December for a winner to be declared in the state where he was born.

“This to me should be the No. 1 issue ... no matter who you’re for, Biden or Trump,” Evans said. “You can’t take this for granted. This system doesn’t have the capacity for the election in 2020.”

Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore called her state’s primary “catastrophic” after voters waited in excruciatingly long lines and thousands never received absentee ballots they requested. But with the GOP-controlled state legislature opposed to conducting their election entirely by mail, Democrats said a robust education program will be necessary so voters understand deadlines for absentee ballot requests and returns.

“We are going to have smart codes on the ballots so people can track their ballots like you would a package,” said Wisconsin Lt.-Gov. Mandela Barnes.

While DNC officials won’t say how much they are dedicating to voter protection, the Trump campaign is boasting of a $20 million (U.S.) legal fund that the president himself has cited as integral to his chances at a second term. Just last week, the campaign’s legal team moved to intervene in a Democratic lawsuit in Arizona over signature requirements on ballots. A myriad of such legal wrangling is expected through the fall and even afterward.

Still, it’s not all doom and gloom for Democrats. Even with the presidential primary resolved and the threat of coronavirus, voter turnout in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania only saw minor decreases from 2016, while participation in Georgia soared.

“We’re watching the resiliency of the American voters,” said Andrea Hailey, the CEO of Vote.org. “People in Georgia were still standing in line at 12:30 at night to cast their ballot.”

Council will delay deciding whether to hold a byelection or appointment someone to represent Scarborough-Agincourt until its regularly scheduled meeting on Sept. 30.

The decision was made on the advice of the city clerk, who noted the timeline to fill the seat in 60 days would see council have to hold a byelection or a meeting to appointment someone no later than Aug. 28 — which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Deferring this decision will enable council to make a decision on whether to appoint or pass a bylaw requiring a byelection to its meeting on September 30, 2020 when staff should be able to report with more certainty about the options available,” the report to council said.

Karygiannis was automatically removed from office in November 2019 after filing paperwork showing he overspent a strict campaign limit by nearly $26,000.

Though he successfully had the Superior Court reinstate him to office, an appeal earlier this month by Toronto resident Adam Chaleff, a fair elections advocate, saw that decision overturned.

Karygiannis plans to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada to have that decision overruled and his ouster put on hold. It will be up to that court, which hears cases of national importance, to decide whether or not to hear the case.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-30,"Toronto city council voted to make masks mandatory in enclosed, public places following recommendations from the medical officer of health.

The new temporary bylaw was approved at a meeting Tuesday and will come into force next week.

It will require “the person or organization who owns or is responsible for the operation of a facility or business to have a policy to ensure masks or face coverings be worn by the public in the enclosed public spaces under their control,” subject to some exemptions.

Toronto’s bylaw is meant to make masks mandatory in businesses like grocery stores and will not apply to children under two or people who can’t wear masks for medical reasons.

“This proposed measure makes sense from a health perspective and it makes sense from a business perspective,” Mayor John Tory said at a morning news conference at city hall.

He said while he understands the requirement of a mask may be a “hassle” for some, he believes most Torontonians will comply.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city’s medical officer of health, said they’ve seen that making masks mandatory improves compliance, and that though there is greater risk of COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, wearing masks helps to prevent virus spread.

“I wear my cloth mask to protect you and you wear one to protect me,” she said at Tuesday’s press conference.

Though officials had hoped mandatory mask rules would be implemented by the province, GTHA mayors met Monday to discuss a regional response. On Tuesday, mayors from across the region started making their own announcements.

“In the city of Toronto we will not delay,” board of health chair Coun. Joe Cressy said Tuesday morning.

The city solicitor said in a report to council Tuesday that the province “would be in the best position to mandate the wearing of non-medical masks by the general public under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act,” but that the city had the legal authority to make requirements for health and safety if recommended by Toronto Public Health.

The solicitor, Wendy Walberg, told council that there is some question about the medical officer of health’s authority to order something that applies to all residents and looks like legislation. She said in absence of the province stepping in, she recommended council approve a bylaw.

A similar bylaw was expected to be passed in Peel Region later this week, officials announced Tuesday.

At Queen’s Park, Premier Doug Ford praised Toronto and Peel Region for their moves.

“If you’re in large groups, wear a mask, wear a face covering of some sort and practise social distancing. So that’s the golden rule,” said Ford.

“But each region has the authority to make their own rules. And a province this size, I encourage it and I encourage and compliment the regions that are doing it, be it Toronto and Peel, but Toronto (and) Peel (are) different than Kenora-Rainy River,” he said.

“It’s apples and oranges, so each public health area will have the authority to put in either two ways. Either they do it through Section 22 of the Health Act, or they do it through the bylaw and go to council, which Toronto has done.”

Masks have already been made mandatory on the TTC starting July 2. The use of masks on the TTC will not be enforced, officials have said.

As for penalties, Tory said he didn’t think there would be enforcement blitzes, and staff noted Tuesday it would be a difficult law to enforce across the city. Potential fines have not yet been set.

Just last week, both Tory and de Villa questioned whether Toronto had the legal ability to mandate mask use as Guelph did.

9:00 p.m.: As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, Ontario’s regional health units are reporting a total of 37,111 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,720 deaths, up a total of 148 new cases since Monday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

In just a month, the rate of daily infections has fallen by nearly half in Ontario. On June 1, the province was seeing an average of about 365 new cases per day; as of Tuesday, the daily average was down to 186.

Most of that decrease has come in Toronto, which has seen its daily average fall even more sharply than in the rest of the province, from 161 cases per day to 52.

Meanwhile, the health units reported four more fatal cases Tuesday, well below the recent trend. The death rate has also fallen sharply since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Tuesday, the province reported that 213 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 42 in intensive care, of whom 34 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data since early April. At their highest levels, more than 1,000 patients were hospitalized with the disease in Ontario, with as many as 217 ventilated.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,672 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

2:25 p.m.: Dr. Anthony Fauci said coronavirus cases could grow to 100,000 a day in the U.S. if Americans don’t start following public health recommendations.

The nation’s leading infectious disease expert made the remark at a Senate hearing on reopening schools and workplaces.

Asked to forecast the outcome of recent surges in some states, Fauci said he can’t make an accurate prediction but believes it will be “very disturbing.”

“We are now having 40-plus-thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned,” said Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health.

Fauci said areas seeing recent outbreaks are putting the entire nation at risk, including areas that have made progress in reducing COVID-19 cases. He cited recent video footage of people socializing in crowds, often without masks, and otherwise ignoring safety guidelines.

1:55 p.m.: The B.C. Fruit Growers Association says the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its industry has been devastating.

The association says a survey of its members shows more than 67 per cent of farmers have reduced fruit production because of uncertainties linked to the pandemic.

A statement from the association says there is a “real threat” to food security as producers cut crops to survive.

The survey shows 81 per cent of farmers are concerned about paying additional costs linked to public health guidelines in response to the pandemic.

It also finds 87 per cent of farmers worry they won’t have enough hired labour to bring in their crops.

1:30 p.m.: Crown attorneys in Ontario want to delay returning to courthouses next week over fears related to COVID-19, the lawyers’ union said in court documents.

The Ontario Crown Attorneys Association is seeking an injunction to delay the province’s plans to reopen 44 courthouses starting next week.

The association alleges the province’s attorney general, and the management board of cabinet that represents Crowns in labour relations, have not taken every precaution to protect workers in courthouses during the pandemic.

“These precautions include the mandatory wearing of masks and other administrative measures to protect the employees and other persons against contracting the virus,” said a notice of application filed in the Superior Court of Justice on Friday.

1:15 p.m.: Ontario Culture and Sport Minister Lisa MacLeod says she is in talks with the pro sports leagues about Toronto being a host for games.

“These conversations are ongoing, but we will not put the health and safety of Ontarians at risk,” MacLeod said.

11:40 a.m.: The COVID-19 pandemic kept the office of Ontario Ombudsman Paul Dube busy with complaints about people unable to reach government offices, unhappy with home schooling and unable to claim lottery prizes.

Dube launched an investigation June 1 into the provincial government’s oversight of nursing homes, where more than 1,809 residents have died from the highly contagious virus. He released his annual report on Tuesday.

“If there is one lesson we can draw from this pandemic, it is how much citizens rely on their public services,” he said, citing more than 800 complaints related to COVID-19.

“Given the scale of this pandemic and the speed with which it spread, there were bound to be gaps.”

11:15 a.m.: The 2020 CP Women’s Open has been cancelled.

The Canadian women’s professional golf championship was scheduled for the first week of September at Vancouver’s Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club.

Organizers had hoped that the tournament would be able to go ahead as planned, but travel and border restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible.

Shaughnessy and the city of Vancouver will instead host the event in 2021.

Golf Canada had already cancelled all of its national championships.

The RBC Canadian Open, Canada’s men’s professional championship, was cancelled in mid-April.

11:10 a.m.: The number of people in Ontario hospitals with COVID-19 dropped to 213 on Tuesday from 232 the day before, the province reports.

The numbers of people in intensive care and using ventilators also dropped.

Ontario’s health minister Christine Elliott says the province completed more than 23,700 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.

Elliott says 27 of Ontario’s 34 public health units are reporting five or fewer new cases.

11 a.m.: Toronto police will return to regular enforcement of on-street parking regulations Thursday, after rules were relaxed during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Regular enforcement will be phased-in over upcoming weeks, police said in a news release Tuesday.

9:05 a.m. (updated): Mayor John Tory says he’ll support a motion that will be voted at city council later today to make face coverings mandatory in all Toronto public indoor spaces starting July 7.

Council will be voting on a bylaw that requires mask wearing or face covering in enclosed public spaces, like when you go to pick up a coffee or at the grocery store.

Peel Region plans to make the same move.

“This proposed measure makes sense from a health perspective and it makes sense from a business perspective,” Tory said.

Tory clarified later that the policy is not meant to apply to a social gathering. It’s meant to apply to public spaces and businesses

Tory said he know it’s a “hassle” but believes Torontonians will understand and comply to keep everyone safe when distancing isn’t possible.

Toronto medical officer of health Dr. Eileen De Villa said they’ve seen evidence that places that require use of a face mask or covering have seen higher compliance and that’s why she’s recommending citywide, bylaw today. Won’t apply to children under two years old or those who can’t wear mask for medical reasons.

“I wear my cloth mask to protect you and you wear one to protect me,” de Villa said.

In order to be most effective, city needs as many people as possible to follow these rules, she said. Risk of virus spread is higher indoors.

Businesses will have the right to refuse service to those people who don’t wear a mask.

8:45 a.m.: Statistics Canada says the economy saw its largest monthly drop on record in April as it came to a near standstill due to the pandemic, but early indications point to a rebound in May as businesses began to reopen.

The agency says gross domestic product fell 11.6 per cent in April with non-essential businesses shut for the full month following a 7.5 per cent decline in March.

However, Statistics Canada says its initial flash estimate for May points to growth of 3.0 per cent.

Economists on average expect a drop of 13 per cent for April, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

8:30 a.m.: Mayor John Tory is expected to make an announcement regarding the use of face masks/coverings in Toronto at 9 a.m.

Mayors from across the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area have been urging Premier Doug Ford and provincial health officials to make wearing masks mandatory to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

“The mayors and chairs unanimously agree to request to the government of Ontario to implement a mandatory face covering measure for large municipalities,” said a statement Monday on their behalf from Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti.

“Every person wearing a face covering properly is protecting those around them from the risk of virus spread,” said the mayors’ statement, which was shared on Twitter by Toronto Mayor John Tory.

“We are at a critical time in the fight against COVID-19. We may do everything we can to avoid flare-ups of the virus in our communities.”

Ford, who recommends wearing a mask indoors in a public space or outside when a safe physical distancing of two metres apart cannot be maintained, said municipalities already have the power to mandate face coverings. Enforcement is also up to civic governments.

But the premier said it would be difficult to force all Ontarians to wear masks.

6:01 a.m.: Donors from around 60 countries and international agencies are meeting Tuesday to drum up financial aid for Syria as the coronavirus and economic chaos wreak even more havoc in a country shattered by a conflict now in its 10th year.

The war has killed more than 400,000 people and sparked a refugee exodus that has destabilized Syria’s neighbours and impacted Europe. Around 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and some 9 million don’t have enough to eat. More than half of the population have no jobs.

The coronavirus has sparked “a multitude of new and complex challenges including the restriction of movement and goods, the delay of certain field activities, the closure of borders and a critical insufficiency of protective equipment for staff and volunteers,” International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies President Francesco Rocca said Tuesday.

5:21 a.m.: China confirmed 19 new cases as those infected in the capital Beijing’s June outbreak started being released from hospital. Of the new cases, seven were reported in Beijing and one in the eastern financial centre of Shanghai, while 11 others were brought by Chinese travellers from outside the country, according to the National Health Commission.

5:15 a.m.: India on Tuesday reported more than 18,000 new virus cases and 400 deaths after an Indian company said it would start clinical trials of a potential vaccine.

Bharat Biotech said it had received government permission to go ahead with the first two phases of clinical trials after initial studies demonstrated safety. Multiple vaccine trials are in a preclinical stage in India, and several other candidates are being tested around the world.

The new infections confirmed in the past 24 hours raised India’s cases to 566,840, the fourth-highest in the world. The addition of 418 deaths raised its fatalities to more 16,000, according to India’s health ministry. Experts say the true toll of the disease around the world is much higher.

5:05 a.m.: South Korea’s professional baseball league says it will require fans to wear masks and to sit at least a seat apart as it prepares to bring back spectators in the coming weeks amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The Korea Baseball Organization on Tuesday said fans will also not be allowed to eat food in the stands. Teams will be initially allowed to sell only 30 per cent of the seats for each game, a figure that could be expanded to as much as 50 per cent depending on the progress in the country’s anti-virus efforts, according to the league’s plans.

Fans will also be screened for fevers and discouraged from excessive shouting, singing and cheering during the game to prevent contact or dispersion of droplets, the KBO said. And perhaps as a means of discouraging any boisterous behaviour, beer will also be banned and fans will only be allowed to drink water or non-alcoholic beverages.

4:32 a.m.: Scandinavian Airlines said Tuesday it is getting an aid package worth 14.25 billion kronor ($1.5 billion) after an agreement with its main shareholders, securing the carrier’s survival amid the COVID-19 crisis.

The governments of Sweden and Denmark, which own shares in the airline, were partly financing the recapitalization plan, SAS said in a statement.

The aid package was also financially supported by its third main owner, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, a Swedish public and private foundation.

4:15 a.m.: COVID-19 means the true north is not entirely free this Canada Day, but a new survey suggests that’s not going to change how many people mark the holiday.

Leger Marketing and Association for Canadian Studies surveyed Canadians asking whether, given all that’s gone on in the last three months with the COVID-19 pandemic, they’ll be more or less likely to find a way to celebrate this year.

For 42 per cent of those polled, this Canada Day will be no different than any other.

Sixteen per cent overall of those surveyed are feeling that true patriot love — they say they’re more likely this year to find a way to celebrate, even if it’s just a small gathering.

The feeling is strongest in B.C., the province widely seen as weathering the COVID-19 storm better than others. There, 22 per cent say they’re more likely to party.

Monday 5:52 p.m.: Ontario’s public health units reported the most new COVID-19 infections in more than three weeks Monday, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 5 p.m. Monday, the health units were reporting a total of 36,963 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,716 deaths, up a total of 232 new cases since Sunday evening.

However, that tally also included an administrative drop after Toronto Public Health removed several duplicate cases from its records. The health unit said the city saw another 62 new infections Monday, but after adjusting for the duplicates the city’s running total fell by 10.

Accounting for these cases, the province saw a total of 304 COVID-19 cases reported since the same time Sunday, the most since June 8.

That high one-day count included another 88 new cases in the Windsor-Essex health unit, which again reported dozens of infections among migrant farm workers.

Meanwhile, 10 more fatal cases were reported Monday. The daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply in the province since peaking in early May, when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier, the province reported that 232 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 46 in intensive care, of whom 35 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,665 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

The arrangement may serve as a template for distribution of new treatments and vaccines as the pandemic swells, said Ernst Berndt, a retired health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.

Remdesivir will be sold for $520 (U.S.) per vial, or $3,120 per treatment course, to hospitals for treatment of patients with private insurance, according to the Department of Health and Human Services and Gilead Sciences, the drug’s manufacturer.

The price will be set at $390 per vial, or $2,340 per treatment course, for patients on government-sponsored insurance and for those in other countries with national health care systems.

The drug will be sold only in the United States through September, meaning U.S. patients will receive almost the entirety of Gilead’s output, more than 500,000 treatment courses.

HHS and state health departments have been allocating the drug to hospitals nationwide based on need. After September, they will no longer have a role in determining where the drug is sent.

“This is a U.S.-first policy,” said Rena Conti, a health care economist at Boston University. “Access is guaranteed to the U.S., but worldwide demand could potentially outstrip supplies.”

“I am unaware of any other policy except perhaps in bioterrorism drugs where there might be country-specific supplies,” she added.

Remdesivir is so far the only treatment shown to speed recovery time in severely ill coronavirus patients. A large clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, found that the drug modestly shortened recovery time by four days, on average, but did not reduce fatalities.

The drug’s eventual cost has always been uncertain. “There is no playbook for how to price a new medicine in a pandemic,” Daniel O’Day, chief executive of Gilead, said in a statement.

The new pricing is not exorbitant, many experts said. Other promising drugs now in late-stage testing are already on the market for other purposes, Conti noted, and cost several times more than remdesivir.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-29,"VICTORIA—British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix says he wants to see the evidence that it’s safe for the country’s two largest airlines to drop their in-flight distancing policies during the pandemic.

“What I’d like to hear from Transport Canada, from Health Canada is do they agree with this,” Dix told a news conference on Monday. “The safety of passengers and the safety of all people in B.C., of Canada, in particular for us in B.C. is very important.”

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said spacing policies on airplanes are not within her jurisdiction, but she assumed there was evidence to support the move.

“We are concerned,” Henry said. “It’s an environment that we know people spend a lot of time in close contact with each other.”

She said it is important that people wear masks during flights and continue to practise physical distancing. People should not be travelling if they are ill, Henry said, adding that she would like to see passenger screening for signs of sickness before flights.

Air Canada and WestJet announced they are ending their on-board seat distancing policies starting Wednesday.

The carriers said Friday they will follow health recommendations from the United Nation’s aviation agency and the International Air Transport Association trade group.

Transport Canada said in a statement it issued guidance to the aviation industry, including recommendations for passenger spacing, but it is not mandatory.

“As physical distancing may not always be possible, all travellers, except those under the age of two years, and certain individuals with medical conditions, are required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering when travelling by air,” said the statement.

“Transport Canada will also now require temperature screenings for passengers at select airports.”

Air Canada could not be immediately reached for comment Monday, but it has said it is offering flexible rebooking options to customers on flights that are close to capacity. It is also introducing additional touchless processes at airports.

WestJet also could not be reached for comment, but it has said its cabin crew can assist customers if there is space to accommodate them.

Dix said he would like to hear from the federal agencies to allay fears or explain why they’ve allowed Air Canada and WestJet to end the seat-distancing policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The minister said he will discuss the policy change with his provincial counterparts, adding he’s looking for more than just a business case from the airlines.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-29,"VICTORIA—The British Columbia government has launched a program aimed at creating work for 15-to-29-year-old youth in community service while their job prospects are dramatically affected by COVID-19.

Advanced Education Minister Melanie Mark said Monday that almost 25 per cent of youth are unemployed in B.C. and the program would give them an opportunity to work outdoors on initiatives such as building trails or cleaning beaches.

The $5-million program would provide up to $10,000 in grants for community projects lasting up to 16 weeks, Mark said.

The money is part of a labour market development agreement with the federal government, which provided provinces and territories with funding in 2018.

British Columbia received $685 million over six years, the Advanced Education Ministry said.

The Youth Community Partnership Program introduced Monday would give youth a training stipend of up to $2,000 per four-week period to a maximum of $8,000 for work until the end of October.

“There’s been a lot of uncertainty out there,” Mark said, adding physical distancing requirements mean a limit of 10 youth will be part of each project.

Participants could also receive supports such as bus passes, child care, work boots and personal protective equipment.

Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction Shane Simpson said the program would provide young people with responsibility and work experience as B.C. begins to recover from the pandemic.

“We know the challenge of jobs is very real and we know that youth employment and youth unemployment is very much a challenge moving forward,” Simpson said as he urged community groups to get their applications in quickly to benefit youth who could work during the summer.

Chief Counsellor Robert J. Dennis Sr. of the Huu-ay-aht First Nations said students face an uncertain future and participating in the program would give them skills they could take into their career.

Dennis said his community in Port Alberni could benefit from projects related to the environment in the area that currently has a fishery renewal initiative underway.

“This would certainly be a good time to introduce the youth to why fishery renewal is really important to the nation. Forestry renewal is another thing,” he said.

On Monday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry reported that there have been 26 new COVID-19 cases in British Columbia since Friday. She said there were no deaths over the past three days.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"In-person trials are set to resume at 44 Ontario courthouses next week, even as unions representing Crown attorneys say the safety measures are inadequate and the start date should be delayed.

A Ministry of the Attorney General guidebook says Plexiglas barriers have been installed around lawyer desks, the witness stand and the judge’s dais. The number of people who can go into a courtroom will be limited. There will be frequent cleaning, no cafeterias and plentiful hand sanitizer. And anyone who isn’t courthouse staff or a judge will have to wear a mask, except while testifying.

“As we are opening up we’ve already put the pieces together to open safely and we’ve done that in concert with our justice sector partners across the system,” said Attorney General Doug Downey in an interview Monday, acknowledging the “significant challenge” posed by the need to reschedule thousands of cases postponed over the past three months.

“We have the best advice available, we are taking all precautions, we’re moving cautiously and slowly, we’re making sure that, as they return, that they will be safe for in person proceedings,” he said.

But in a letter to the ministry on Monday, the union representing senior Crown attorneys said not enough is being done and that with only a week left to go they are still lacking critical information about how the measures will work and how they will be enforced.

“You have given us no training on why some risks are acceptable and others are not,” the letter states, seeking delay of the July 6 date. “We are concerned for our own health and the health of our staff. You are asking us to make ill-informed decisions, in an area where we have no expertise, with the lives of our staff hanging in the balance. We do not feel we can properly implement any ‘good faith’ or ‘due diligence’ level of safety assessment in the very short time frame we are left with.”

The concerns in the letter echo those raised last week by unions representing Crown attorneys and court staff with the ministry. The Ontario Crown Attorneys’ Association (OCCA) filed a notice of application with the court on Friday for an injunction to delay resuming in-person trials, and a grievance with the ministry over the OCCA not being involved in the committees in charge of courthouse safety. The injunction application has been paused pending a meeting with the deputy attorney general this week, according to the Friday letter from the OCCA.

The concerns include: some risk assessments of courthouses have been conducted by people without experience of how courthouses work; no requirement for masking for staff where physical distancing is not possible; no way to enforce physical distancing or mandatory use of hand sanitizer; lack of clarity about who would clean spaces between witnesses; not enough Plexiglas barriers; and inadequate risk assessments of the ventilation systems.

“I urge you to step forward and slow down the process of reopening so that we can all be comfortable that we are all working in a safe place and not risking our lives to do our job,” said the letter to the deputy attorney general from Robert Parsons, president of the union representing senior Crown attorneys. Parsons declined to comment Monday.

Meanwhile, on Monday morning judges began confirming trial dates for next week in special COVID-19 trial readiness courts. At least one case was left in limbo as the Crown said more time was needed to know if the health and safety issues would be resolved.

A preliminary hearing was adjourned altogether because the defence lawyers involved are in high-risk groups for COVID-19 and felt the risk of returning to court is too high. In some hearings where both the Crown and defence agreed to proceed, accommodations were made to allow some participants — in one case the accused and in one case the judge — to appear remotely.

“We want to return to the courts but of course we want the courts to be as safe as possible,” said Daniel Brown, vice-president of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association. He said there need to be clear procedures in place so that accused people or witnesses do not have to attend court if they have symptoms. “We are encouraging ongoing dialogue ... to ensure that the courts can open safely for everyone to participate in them.”

He added that virtual alternatives are crucial for lawyers who are at high-risk or who have family members who are at high-risk.

Downey said the gradual reopening of in-person hearings will not stop the investment in virtual courts through the use of video-conferencing and other forms of technology.

“It’s going to potentially allow us to do trials that are a mix ... partly virtual and partly in person. The judges will have to work out what they are comfortable with ... but it opens up so many possibilities to move things along faster, more efficiently, cheaper,” he said.

Criminal defence lawyer Daniel Lerner had a trial set to begin next week at the 1000 Finch courthouse, scheduled before the pandemic. On Monday morning he agreed to go ahead with it, but said not enough information has been provided about what exactly is being done to ensure courthouses and courtrooms are safe, leaving lawyers, accused, witnesses and victims unable make informed decisions.

“I have a client who is not sure if it’s safe or not safe,” he said. “We’re really in the dark.”

Meanwhile, it’s unclear when a next trial could be set if the current trial dates are abandoned given the enormous backlog of cases.

Lerner worked as a duty counsel during the early days of the pandemic when bail hearings were not yet operating remotely and courts were still grappling with putting appropriate safety measures in place. He ended up having to self-isolate after a person at the courthouse tested positive for COVID-19.

“I’m not a medical expert. I have to rely on the right people making the right decisions and right recommendations,” he said. “It’s very difficult to make decisions with the lack of information.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Windsor-Essex reported 98 new cases on Sunday and 88 on Monday, most of them from a single farm.

Staff from the nearby Middlesex-London public health unit have joined Windsor-Essex’s team to manage the crisis, sending in nurse practitioners to farms to manage confirmed cases and contact tracing.

Premier Doug Ford said Monday that federal employees were inspecting the bunkhouses of the temporary foreign workers and that the federal government was picking up the tab for the hotels and motels where workers are isolating.

The province has also ramped up testing.

“We’re going to make sure we’re doing everything in our power to resolve these cases as quickly as possible,” said Ford.

Nearly 40 per cent of workers at Windsor-Essex farm test positive

Mass testing at a Windsor-Essex farm over the weekend resulted in the area’s highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.

About 175 cases were found in two days. The farm has about 450 workers.

The Windsor-Essex area is home to upward of 10,000 temporary farm workers. Some live in bunkhouses on farms, but others live in the community and workers can move from farm to farm.

Asked Monday whether it was becoming a public health crisis, Dr. Wajid Ahmed, associate medical officer of health for Windsor-Essex, said that it was too early to tell.

Although the virus was sweeping through one farm, workers on others had tested negative and on some farms, there were a limited numbers of positive cases, he said.

“As of now, what we are dealing with is unprecedented and nobody was expecting this high number,” said Ahmed. “I think as we continue to work with all these cases and contacts we will have a better understanding of what the ongoing risk to this population is.”

Ahmed declined to identify the farm.

The majority of workers who tested positive didn’t report having symptoms, but Ahmed said it would take interviews by nurse practitioners during case management to determine if that is truly the case.

The province recently eased the rules surrounding migrant workers who test positive, allowing them to continue working if they are asymptomatic so that farms don’t fear losing large numbers of employees to isolation.

However Ahmed said the latest workers to test positive were in isolation.

Susan Bondy, an epidemiologist with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said that ideally, people should come forward to be tested on their own.

However, community supports are necessary when it comes to a workforce that is particularly vulnerable.

Contact tracers should “detect, test, isolate and support,” she said, noting migrant workers particularly “need reassurance that they can remain with an income, remain with food and adequate housing.”

That is a challenge, “because in many cases accommodations, really good access to primary care (and) access to social services is certainly lower in the agricultural workforce than other workforces.”

Toronto and Peel drive up Ontario numbers

Collectively, the number of new cases coming out of the GTA is still the largest in the province. The GTA reported 85 new cases Monday, while Toronto Public Health reported 62 new cases — though after removing 60 duplicate cases from their tally, the city’s number actually fell by 10.

The rest of Ontario reported 147 cases Monday.

According to Peel Public Health, of the 280 cases reported between June 19 and 25, 80 per cent were related to an outbreak or close contact with a confirmed case. Only one per cent are linked to travel outside of Ontario.

“I’m disappointed that it’s not lower,” said Bondy. “For those health units … I would like to see it come right down and experience a period of thinking we can actually eliminate it from the communities.”

Some regions are still catching up on testing, she said. “You have people who are asymptomatic and you have people who haven’t yet been tested who probably are connected to an outbreak. So we’re still doing catch up on local areas that have just undetected virus in the community.”

Bondy said different trends will be driving daily case totals. “What accounts for 50 (cases) one week is a different phenomenon from what accounts for the 50 the next week,” she said.

Anna Banerji, an infectious disease specialist with the University of Toronto, told the Star it’s “reassuring” that case totals haven’t yet skyrocketed with the reopening of shopping malls and salons. “We’ll see what happens in the next few weeks, (but) we haven’t seen a trend going up — at least in the GTA. I’m reassured by this.”

That said, Banerji cautioned against reading too deeply into daily totals. “I think that all of our numbers and the emphasis on the numbers are completely inaccurate,” she explained, noting that tests could produce false negatives which skew the numbers.

Additionally, the possibility of asymptomatic people going undetected means the true number is much higher. “The number of people who have had COVID … I would estimate is at least five to 10 times higher” than what we know of, Banerji said.

Ontario’s struggles while the Atlantic Provinces bubble

Ontario was the only province to report more than 200 cases on Monday.

Quebec, with a total of more than 55,000 cases, the most of any province, reported 72 new cases of the virus on Monday, down from 77 the day before.

Cases there have declined steadily since the second week of May, mostly due to decreases in Greater Montreal, which is where the majority of cases have been located.

British Columbia gave its first update in three days on Monday, reporting 26 new cases as of Friday and bringing their total to 2,904. Alberta reported 39 cases on Sunday.

Saskatchewan and Manitoba have both reported daily cases in the single digits recently.

Meanwhile, residents of Canada’s eastern provinces will be able to travel freely as of July 3 between New Brunswick, PEI, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador thanks to an agreement by their premiers that eliminates a requirement to self-isolate for 14 days.

New Brunswick’s borders are still closed to the rest of the country unless you’re travelling to the province because of work, health care, you own property or you’re visiting family, in which case the isolation requirement is still in place.

PEI and Newfoundland also remain closed to non-essential travellers.

Nova Scotia never closed it’s borders, but visitors to the province from outside the Atlantic Provinces are still required to self-isolate.

What is going on in the U.S.?

South of the border, cases of COVID-19 continue to rise.

Despite a brief downturn in the country’s daily totals, case positivity is again peaking. On Sunday, the country saw nearly 40,000 cases in one day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

“The United States is having a terrible escalation” of the rate of positive infections, said Banerji, pointing to Florida and California as states that are continuing to break daily records. “I don’t think we can let our guard down with this virus.”

As of Sunday, the U.S. has seen five consecutive days of single-day records and comprises almost 25 per cent of the global total of cases.

Only two states — Connecticut and Rhode Island — are reporting a decline in daily case numbers. In Minnesota, for example, people in their 20s have become the largest group of confirmed cases of the virus — a spike that appears to be tied to reopened bars and public spaces.

Meanwhile, the state of Florida is seeing a staggering rise in positive results, reporting 43,964 new cases the week of June 21 to 28. This represents over 31 per cent of the state’s total case numbers. While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has chalked this rise up to increased testing, U.S. epidemiologists say the increases are real and the result of continued spread.

In response to continued case growth that appears to follow eased lockdown restrictions in late May, many states are pausing or restricting reopening plans. Miami-Dade County has announced it is closing its beaches and banning gatherings over 50 people.

Experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimate more than 20 million U.S. citizens have been infected with COVID-19 — far beyond the official figure of 2.5 million total cases.

Correction — June 29, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version to update the graphic showing the number of new cases per day related to COVID-19 in the Windsor-Essex health unit. The previous graphic mistakenly showed cumulative cases, not the number of new cases.

Her Reporting Is Funded The Canadian Government Through Its Local Journalism Initiative. Reach Her Via Email', 'Victoriagibson Thestar.Ca']",2020-06-29,"In a small apartment in Toronto’s east end, 77-year-old Janet McLeod is waiting on edge.

McLeod — who was born in the city, and has lived in her subsidized seniors housing unit at Greenwood Towers for seven years — is one of millions of Canadians receiving the federal government’s emergency benefits. But instead of providing a lifeline during COVID-19, McLeod fears the payout may leave her in an even shakier financial position.

“It’s not doing one bit of good,” McLeod said. Toronto Community Housing has warned that her rent may now rise, as Ontario is considering payments under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit as income.

She’s been warned of clawbacks from the federal level too, since she also receives the Guaranteed Income Supplement as a low-income Canadian senior. But she doesn’t know yet how much money she may lose in total.

And she’s not alone. Toronto’s shelter, housing and support department says that, while most re-calculations of rent-geared-to-income have led to monthly payments being lowered, they’re also aware of “some cases” where households are facing increased rent because of the pandemic payouts.

As for the GIS, the federal government says a “preliminary estimate” compiled before the CERB extension found that approximately seven per cent of GIS recipients would be eligible for pandemic pay — and that 0.4 per cent were thought to have income levels with CERB that would exceed eligibility limits for the income supplement.

The unsteady ground has left McLeod pinching dollars. Before the pandemic, she offered her experience as a retired guidance counsellor to students eyeing post-secondary slots, for a fee.

She’s tried to pivot to providing services online from home. But without clarity on rent increases and future clawbacks, she hasn’t been able to bring herself to replace her computer — an “old gal” that she says shuts off, sporadically, once a day.

“I’m scared to spend it,” she said, referring to CERB. “Because what if you claw it back? I’ll be in debt, and then I can’t pay my rent. None of us knows what’s going to happen. Am I scared? Hell, yes.”

Community housing staff seemed to be doing their best to get her answers, McLeod said. Toronto Community Housing told the Star about 15 per cent of tenant calls to their client centre in the last two months about rent deferral have mentioned CERB, mostly inquiring whether it counted as income.

But the situation has caused McLeod to consider whether she can afford to live in the city any more. “That (subsidy) makes it possible for me to live in Toronto,” she said. “The city I was born in, and can no longer afford.” She considered whether somewhere like Montreal would be cheaper, but, at her age, she worries about the harsh winters.

The issue has attracted the attention of retired Ontario social services bureaucrat John Stapleton, who argues that raising rent and clawing back benefits from CERB recipients defeat the payment’s purpose.

“It’s income that’s trying to get people to stay indoors,” Stapleton said, noting that seniors housing residents were at particular risk of COVID-19, and that things like delivery services came with extra costs.

“Here’s this extra money, this $2,000 a month that’s here to help you do that,” he said, “and yet, we’re going to charge you rent on it.”

The situation McLeod is facing is caused, in part, by the fact that Ontario is considering CERB as earned income — a designation that attracted attention earlier in the pandemic, when questions arose about how much Ontarians in social assistance programs like Ontario Works would be allowed to keep.

Treating CERB as earned income allowed those receiving social assistance to keep a portion of the emergency pandemic pay.

Since CERB is considered income in Ontario, Toronto community housing includes it when calculating rent-geared-to-income — though both the city and the province say they’ve urged social housing providers to be “flexible” during the pandemic.

Including CERB in subsidized rent calculations is consistent with a directive from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the feds say. But the decision whether to adhere to that instruction is ultimately up to the provinces and territories. (Prince Edward Island’s government told the Star it wouldn’t raise rent in subsidized housing, even if CERB recipients were making more than usual.)

Federal officials also consider CERB as income for the purposes of the GIS, Stapleton said, meaning that McLeod and others could wind up seeing clawbacks.

Federal seniors minister Deb Schulte’s office, in an email to the Star, confirmed that CERB payments would affect GIS entitlements, but said the maximum payment from the emergency program — $12,000 over 24 weeks — would not exceed annual exemption limits on its own. Currently, GIS recipients can earn up to $5,000 per year without reducing their benefits, and the next $10,000 of earnings would be partially exempt, Schulte’s office said.

McLeod, for now, is stuck in limbo. She says the amount she takes home from CERB is comparable to the amount she brought in last year from helping students with their postsecondary applications — but when she’s able to work, she can factor in business expenses.

Now on CERB, with her work stunted, she anticipates less from her usual supports as she tries to retool to work from home.

“Those of us who are being honest, and trying to be upfront, are saying ‘Wait, don’t change the rules on me,’” McLeod said. “It’s going to destroy my little business — just because I’m being honest.”

Read', 'Kieran Leavittedmonton Bureau', 'Edmonton Bureau', 'Kieran Leavitt Is An Edmonton-Based Reporter Covering Provincial Affairs For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"EDMONTON—Step 1 in Jason Kenney’s plan to save Alberta from the economic straits imposed by a pandemic and a global oil price war will be to cut the corporate tax rate.

During a news conference Monday, Alberta’s premier said the corporate tax will be dropped from 10 per cent to eight per cent by the beginning of July, making Alberta the least taxed province in Canada.

“We really do mean business,” Kenney said.

The cut was part of a range of investment initiatives laid out by Kenney, including an additional $2 billion in spending targeted at infrastructure projects. The province now has $10 billion in total set aside for construction projects such as schools, roads, overpasses, waterways, long-term-care homes, hospitals and bridges.

The pot of money is expected to create 50,000 jobs this year, said Kenney. Due to the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia running parallel to the pandemic, Alberta currently counts 330,000 unemployed.

The corporate tax cut was originally planned to take place over several years — going from 12 per cent in 2019 to eight per cent in 2022 — but that has now been sped up. The government has previously predicted the cut would create 55,000 jobs.

“Our commitment to have the lowest taxes for job creators isn’t just some aspirational, out-there-in-the-future, BS target — it’s real and it’s right now,” Kenney said.

There’s also a cultural events program that the province will use to boost music, performing arts and other events that have been affected by the pandemic.

Kenney also said there would be new money in grants and venture capital for the technology sector and start-up companies. More details on these initiatives will come later, he said.

The province is creating “Invest Alberta,” a corporation that will travel the world trying to attract investment in the province.

“They’re going to go out there and make sure that companies know that I think they’re being irresponsible if they don’t consider moving operations to Alberta,” Kenney said.

The plan was put together with input from the 12-member economic recovery council created by Kenney in March. The council includes former primer minister Stephen Harper and economist Jack Mintz.

Alberta’s official unemployment rate is pegged at 15.5 per cent, but factoring in the amount of people who have left the workforce over the past several months, the real number is likely closer to 20 per cent, said Finance Minister Travis Toews. Kenney added that, in the future, the unemployment rate could climb as high as 25 per cent.

The Alberta government is facing a reckoning after rolling out its 2020 budget plan based on projections of $58 as the price of a barrel of oil. That budget had a plan to balance the books by 2023. The price of oil now hovers around $35 per barrel and even dipped into a negative value in April.

Toews said the province will have a fully mapped fiscal update soon. He called the COVID-19 pandemic “much more than just a speed bump along the road” and said investment by the province would be needed.

“There’s good debt and bad debt,” he said. “As we borrow to deliver government programs, that’s like racking up debt on a credit card, whereas our investments are key investments in solid, defensible infrastructure projects.”

Moshe Lander, an economist at Concordia University in Montreal, described the infrastructure investment plan as one with “a complete lack of vision.”

“It's just going to end up requiring payback at some point in the form of higher taxes or lower government spending,” he said.

If the infrastructure spending results in 50,000 jobs, those will likely only be temporary, Lander said.

“I guess temporary jobs aren’t a bad thing,” he added. “But that's not the bold vision that he presented this to be. This is a stopgap to just keep the economy from flatlining.”

The corporate tax cut isn’t going to move the needle toward more investment, either, he added.

Companies aren’t looking to make big investment decisions, he said, because the world is waiting for a second wave of the coronavirus to hit. Many of them are also losing money, said Lander.

“It's a dogmatic policy that he insists on implementing come what may,” he said. “I think he's using this as a cover to just speed up what he wanted to do anyway.”

Dr. Kieran Moore, the region’s medical officer of health, says that most of the cases related to the outbreak are showing minimal symptoms and no one has been hospitalized.

He also reports that all of the people who have tested positive are self-isolating at home.

Moore also says that nearly 3,000 people have been tested in the area in the past week.

On Friday, the City of Kingston made wearing a face mask mandatory in all indoor public places following the outbreak at the nail salon.

Mayor Bryan Paterson said that means people will have to wear a mask to enter places including grocery stores, retail stores, restaurants and hair and nail salons.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-29,"OTTAWA—New federal models show continued progress in suppressing the spread of COVID-19, but with significant hotspots.

The figures released by the Public Health Agency of Canada Monday show that some areas have been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others, specifically Quebec and Ontario.

The hotspots in the past few days include parts of Saskatchewan, Toronto, Montreal and around the border town of Windsor, Ont.

At this point, transmission of the novel coronavirus appears under control nationally with any fluctuations due to localized outbreaks, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Monday.

She said that as restrictions ease, it will be even more important for Canadians to maintain physical distancing and good handwashing practices to keep case counts down to help with contact tracing and to not overburden the health-care system.

She said people under the age of 40 account for a greater proportion of cases after that has been steep declines in case numbers for people over 80 years old in recent weeks.

The federal public health agency now estimates there will be between 104,000 and 108,000 cases countrywide by July 12, and between 8,545 and 8,865 deaths by the same date.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday the restrictions Canadians have lived with through the spring have worked to get COVID-19 under control.

A new explosion in cases could mean a return to tight restrictions, he warned.

He said rising COVID-19 numbers in the United States demonstrate the need for continued vigilance north of the border, including keeping physical distance from each other wherever possible.

Trudeau also said federal officials will reduce the number of news conferences over the summer, but might hold unscheduled updates if there is information to share.

Read', 'Sheri Finkthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Sheri Finkthe New York Timesmon.']",2020-06-29,"HOUSTON—Melissa Estrada had tried to be so careful about the coronavirus. For months she kept her three children at home, and she always wore a mask at the grocery store. She and her daughter even stitched face coverings for relatives and friends.

But over the weekend Estrada, 37, was fighting the virus at Houston Methodist Hospital after a week of treatments that included an experimental drug, steroids, intensive care and high doses of oxygen. She probably contracted the virus while attending a dinner with relatives who had also been cautious, she said. Within days, all four adults and several children who had been at the gathering tested positive for the coronavirus.

“It was really, really scary,” Estrada said of her illness. She worried constantly about leaving her children motherless. “You hear about it and you think it’s the older people or the people with underlying issues,” she said. “And I’m healthy. I don’t understand how I got this bad.”

Coronavirus cases are rising quickly in Houston, as they are in other hot spots across the South and the West. Harris County, which includes most of Houston and is one of the largest counties in the nation, has been averaging more than 1,100 new cases each day, among the most of any U.S. county. Just two weeks ago, Harris County was averaging about 313 new cases daily.

Measures to cope with the surge and to plan for its peak were evident over the weekend at Methodist, which called nurses to work extra shifts, brought new laboratory instruments on line to test thousands more samples a day and placed extra hospital beds in an empty unit about to be reopened as patients filled new coronavirus wards.

Gov. Greg Abbott, speaking in Dallas on Sunday, said the virus had taken a “very swift and a very dangerous turn” in Texas and the increase in the rate of positive coronavirus tests, to over 13 per cent in the past month from less than four per cent, was an “alarm bell.” He made the grim assessment after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the co-ordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force, who joined the governor in urging all Texans to wear masks and avoid close contact in crowds.

Pence, appearing at a Dallas rally celebrating religious freedoms, threw his support behind Abbott and his efforts to reopen the state’s economy — even as the governor made an about-face on Friday in his phased plan by ordering bars closed and capacity at restaurants cut. Many young people had socialized in them, standing close together, not wearing masks, some expressing skepticism that they could become infected.

During the virus’ first peak in April, the majority of patients testing positive in the Methodist hospital system were older than 50. Now the majority are, like Estrada, relatively young. Nearly one-third of intensive care patients are now under 50, much higher than in the initial coronavirus surge.

The stress on medical institutions burst into public view last week, when Texas Medical Center — a downtown cluster of Houston’s major public and private hospitals, including Methodist — announced that the baseline intensive care unit capacity across its hospitals was full, with 28 per cent of beds occupied by virus patients. That was nearly twice a threshold established by the state, which called for ICUs to have a maximum 15 per cent of virus patients for hospitals to resume elective services.

The hospitals typically operate with nearly full ICUs, and had planned to increase the number of critically ill patients they could treat. But the next morning, the governor issued an executive order that again restricted elective surgeries in Harris County. The order, however, allows hospitals to continue performing surgeries and procedures that will not deplete their capacity to care for coronavirus patients; some hospital executives and doctors, including ones at Methodist, said they were able to continue providing those services, which they viewed as particularly needed after being halted during the initial shutdown. The Texas Medical Center hospitals are collectively treating about 1,500 coronavirus patients, according to figures released Saturday.

During the previous surge in mid-April, Methodist’s system had at most just over 200 coronavirus patients. On Sunday, it had nearly 400 in-patients with the virus, and about 150 more were being tested for it. Some models predict a peak in two to three weeks.

Roberta L. Schwartz, an executive vice president and chief innovation officer at Methodist, who is serving as the coronavirus incident commander, walked from unit to unit on Saturday “trolling for beds,” as she described it. She spoke with nurses and doctors, troubleshooting to solve problems that could delay sending patients home or transferring them to lower levels of care when they were ready. She informed nurses in an intermediate care unit that it would soon transition into an ICU for coronavirus patients.

She visited a huge laboratory with more than $3 million (U.S.) of new instrumentation that she referred to as the “Taj Mahal,” a former academic lab that was repurposed to process virus tests, and took her first look at two recently purchased new machines that can run 1,000 tests a day. In some parts of the country, laboratories, including Methodist’s, have experienced recent testing backlogs as demand and new cases increased.

The hospital is hiring travelling nurses to bolster its staff and offering bonuses as incentives to some employees to take extra shifts. In recent days, hospital beds and mobile computers were rolled into an empty, 34-bed unit that had been shuttered and will now be used for coronavirus patients. “This is why I don’t have to put trailers out front and mobile hospitals out front,” Schwartz said. The changes were also part of the hospital’s efforts to maintain capacity to safely treat its many nonvirus patients.

The Methodist hospital system, with nearly 2,400 beds in service, includes six community hospitals across greater Houston and the flagship academic medical centre downtown.

It sits near other renowned medical institutions including Baylor College of Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center and Texas Children’s Hospital, which is opening a unit to treat adult coronavirus patients. Methodist and several other private hospitals have also agreed to accept virus patients from Harris County’s inundated public hospitals, part of the Harris Health System.

Tritico Saranathan, a charge nurse on one of Methodist’s virus wards, said she had noticed that patients were younger than those first hit by the coronavirus several months ago. “We’re seeing a lot of people in their 30s — they’re out there partying and not wearing their masks,” she said. “As soon as the city opened up, they were very eager to go to the bars, to the clubs, to the restaurants, just to hang out in groups. And no one was social distancing or wearing a mask.”

“What I’m seeing is that they’re pretty sick — the younger ones are pretty sick,” she said. “They’re struggling a lot with respiratory issues. They’re having a hard time breathing,” she added, “just feeling like death.”

One of the newest coronavirus patients, Jessica Rios, 36, a mother of four with pneumonia, was transferred to Houston Methodist by ambulance from an urgent care centre on Saturday. She said her husband was being treated in the hospital, too. She worried about her children and was frequently using FaceTime to call them. Her 18-year-old was looking after her 12-year-old, who has severe asthma and has also tested positive for the virus, and five-year-old twins, one of whom has cerebral palsy and has tested positive, too. “It’s kind of hard to be here when I have them at home struggling,” she said.

Rios had not been out partying. She said she thought she had contracted the coronavirus while working as a clerk in a dialysis unit for children. She said that she has allergies that make it difficult to wear a mask, and that she would sometimes take her mask off at the unit, where one child later tested positive for the virus. “I couldn’t tell you if every time I talked to her I had a mask on,” she said.

In another room nearby was Curtis Ezell, 37. He had come to the hospital to be treated for heart failure, but tested positive for the virus when he had a routine test upon admission. He sometimes does deliveries for DoorDash, a food delivery service, and recently moved to Houston, staying at hotels.

He said that he had no idea how he had contracted the virus, and that he was not experiencing common symptoms of the infection. “If you know someone with COVID, everyone should get tested,” he said.

An even younger pneumonia patient, Alexander Nelson-Fryar, 25, was in a new ward for 15 coronavirus patients that just opened last week. He said that he worked training employees at a medical clinic nearby that sometimes saw virus patients. Nelson-Fryar said that he had worn the same mask at work every day, which he would keep in his car, and that he did not know how he had become infected. “I go there and I go home,” he said. “I think I got a little unlucky.”

He said he feared that people his age were not taking the illness seriously enough, as he himself had not. “I thought younger folks are not going to get symptoms; if I do get it, it’s not going to be a big deal,” he said.

That was not true in his case. “It hit me like a truck,” he said. “Even if you are young and not at risk, it’s pretty scary.”

At Methodist, the majority of the coronavirus patients are in designated medical wards, not in the ICUs.

That might be because of the increasing proportion of younger, healthier patients. Hospital leaders say they are also getting better at treating patients, avoiding the need to transfer them to ICUs. The length of hospital stays for virus patients at Methodist is about a day and a half shorter this month than it was in April and May.

It remains possible that the proportion of patients in the ICUs could rise, because of the time lag between when a patient first gets sick and develops critical illness.

On Saturday evening, after making rounds, Dr. Faisal Masud, the medical director for critical care across all of Houston Methodist’s hospitals, described the younger virus patients in the ICUs. “Typically there are definitely 30-year-olds, 35-year-olds,” he said, adding that the most severely ill young people often are obese or have medical problems such as diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure. One young patient was on an external heart-lung machine known as ECMO.

During the first surge, Masud said, some young virus patients came to the hospital extremely sick and died soon after they arrived. Now, he said, they are coming earlier, but more often.

“I think that there was a sense of being invincible or this is not their problem, even if they caught it, no big deal,” he said. That attitude has changed in the past few days, he said, including among his own three daughters, who are all in their 20s. “They’re now paying attention,” he said.

Estrada, the mother of three who was being treated for the coronavirus, said she worried that there would be more patients like her.

“They opened up our city way too quick — our governor didn’t want to let the bars be closed and the restaurants and functions, and they just wanted us to get back to normal,” she said, adding, “I knew it was a bad idea.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Premier Stephen McNeil warned Friday that with limits being raised on how many people can gather at bars, restaurants and organized events, the risk of a resurgence in infections was also increasing.

As a result, the province has issued an emphatic recommendation for residents to wear non-medical masks when physical distancing among strangers becomes difficult.

McNeil said Nova Scotians must get in the habit of wearing a mask, noting that he has had to change his own habits.

“Even when I saw others wearing them, I didn’t always wear one myself,” he told a virtual news conference.

“I’ve had to rethink this and do a bit of soul-searching. After all, when someone is wearing a mask, they are protecting me and others. So I need to do the same for them.”

The premier then offered a slogan of sorts to promote the use of masks.

“Don’t think of it as a task. When in doubt, wear a mask.”

The province’s previous advice was to ask residents to “consider” wearing a mask when physical distancing couldn’t be maintained.

But the province’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Robert Strang, said he wants to “normalize” the wearing of masks to reduce the inherent risks that come with allowing larger gatherings.

As examples, Strang said masks should be worn when entering grocery stores or malls, using public transit or at public gatherings with limited space.

“Wearing a mask is a way of showing that we care about other people,” he said.

Meanwhile, the province announced Friday that all bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate at full capacity and continue serving until midnight, effective immediately.

However, that change assumes establishments will continue to adhere to physical-distancing rules, which has required bars and restaurants to create more space for patrons by moving chairs and tables farther apart.

The province is also allowing private campgrounds to operate at 100 per cent capacity, and all public pools can reopen with physical distancing for lane swimming and aquafit classes.

As of next Friday, Nova Scotia will increase the limits on gatherings organized by recognized business or community organizations.

That includes weddings, funerals, cultural events, concerts, festivals, dance recitals and faith-based gatherings, which will increase to 250 people if they are outdoors and 200 — with maximum 50 per cent capacity — if they are indoors. In either case, physical distancing is still required.

These events do not include family gatherings, which remain limited to a 50-person maximum with physical distancing.

Last week, the province announced that Nova Scotians could start gathering in close social groups of up to 10 without physical distancing.

Though the province announced these groups did not have to be exclusive, Strang said Friday there seemed to be confusion over what that actually meant.

“We’re telling people that you can chose who is in your group of 10, but this is limited,” he said, adding that it was wrong to think any random gathering of 10 people was acceptable. “Ideally, people would have a single, closed social group.”

A total of 1,061 people in Nova Scotia have tested positive for the virus — and 63 of those people have died, most of them in a long-term care facility in Halifax. Two people remain in hospital, though their cases are considered among the 998 officially resolved cases.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-29,"VANCOUVER—A 17-year-old British Columbia student has been documenting the personal experiences of strangers around the world during this pandemic one photograph at a time.

Asalah Youssef of Langley Fine Arts School said the Screenshots of Home project came about from a yearning to create and connect with people who are united in isolation.

“I mean, the whole world was told to stay at home,” she said.

Youssef said she was seeing people connect virtually, which got her thinking about photography in a different way.

“I put down my regular camera, pushed my Canon camera to the side and picked up my phone to start photographing people virtually.”

Since April, she has photographed 45 people from different parts of the world including Lebanon, the United States, London, Costa Rica, Tanzania, Ecuador, France, Mexico and Israel.

The teen reaches out to people through Instagram, tells them about her project and asks if they want to participate, she said, adding that she met some people through friends.

“The beginning is just us having a conversation because, as you can imagine, I’m asking something quite personal of them — to have a FaceTime call and to document them and photograph them.”

She eventually leads them through lighting, posing, and where to position their phone, then takes a screen shot, Youssef explained.

“It’s a beautiful collaboration between me and someone who, most of the time, I have never met before.”

The clarity of the photos surprised her, she said with a laugh.

“Sometimes you can see the glitchiness of the photograph and, you know what, I kind of embrace that because I think ... it’s telling of the way it was taken,” she said.

“But sometimes you can’t even tell it’s on FaceTime, which is also quite beautiful.”

These photographs, Youssef said, are helping her stay in the present, embrace and work with the situation, and look for joy and beauty in the every day.

“It is highlighting the more personal part of this pandemic and the experience of quarantining at home. A hundred years from now, people are going to look at these photographs and see all different experiences and get a really personal look into this pandemic.”

Youssef noted that one of the most memorable shoots was a woman in the state of New Jersey who is a fashion designer and has been getting through the pandemic and lockdown by creating pieces of clothing and masks.

“She said to me during the shoot ‘creativity cannot be quarantined.’ She was such a bright and colourful person and it was really lovely leaving the conversation just feeling so filled, like my cup was full having this conversation with a fellow artist I had never met before who I connected with during this time.”

Another conversation Youssef said touched her was with a woman in France who lost her father during quarantine.

“She couldn’t hold his hand and she was saying how absolutely devastating that was and how much emotion that brought up for her. Her photo is her leaning up against a wall and you can feel that emotion through it.”

Youssef said her mother and she were recently having a conversation about “how cool it would be” to do a second instalment of Screenshots of Home, where she visits the same people in person once everyone gets through it.

“That would be quite special. You never know.”

A daughter staying home part time in order to take care of her mother who has Alzheimer’s.

A farmer-turned oil worker digging into retirement savings due to industry changes.

There are more than a hundred testimonies like these contained in a report released Monday by the non-profit Basic Income Canada Network.

The report features 141 anonymized stories collected from people across Canada in April and highlights the myriad of different situations where a basic income would allow someone to get a job, retain their dignity, or in some cases, save their life.

And right now, while Canada ponders a recovery from COVID-19, is the best time to implement a basic-income program, said Sheila Regehr, founding member and chairperson of Basic Income Canada Network.

“COVID hasn’t created anything new. It has put a spotlight on all of the weaknesses in our system,” said Regehr.

“All of those inequalities that have been growing over the years and have been causing all kinds of problems for a certain group of people. Now, COVID shows that so many other people are also vulnerable.”

For decades, economists have floated the idea of basic income, a policy centred on the premise that everyone deserves to have their basic needs met regardless of their income.

In 2017, Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal Ontario government launched a $150 million basic-inome experiment in three cities. The Ford government cancelled it in July 2018 but multiple studies afterwards found the pilot project had positive benefits for participants. One study by McMaster University found three-quarters of people who were already employed kept working even after receiving monthly basic income, dispelling concerns that basic income discourages people from working.

And recently, in the United States, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang championed something called universal basic income — where everyone would receive a cheque for the same amount in their pocket regardless of how rich or poor they are.

Support for basic income is growing, said Regehr.

Regehr believes Canada should adapt a progressive version of basic income, similar to how the country’s Old Age Security and child benefit programs are calculated. Essentially, your basic income cheque increases and decreases depending on how much other income you make.

In the Basic Income Network Canada’s model, those who make over $55,000 (or more than $77,782 as a couple) will not receive basic income aid. On the other end of the spectrum, those who make very little income would receive as much as $1,833 per month per person or $2,593 for couples.

Regehr said her organization has submitted policy briefs detailing exactly how the country can pay for basic income — either through existing tax programs, or with a new wealth tax, or by increasing sales tax slightly — to both the House of Commons and the Senate.

The federal government has given $2,000 per month to people who lost their jobs due to COVID-19, through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, also known as CERB. Regehr and others have applauded the government for acting quickly during the crisis.

“All of those people who were managing or were one or two paycheques away from disaster, getting that CERB benefit was huge for them,” she said.

In particular, the cash in people’s pockets — with no strings attached — meant they could use the money in whatever way made sense for them.

“It gives people both the security and the flexibility to manoeuvre through transitions,” said Regehr.

According to the stories Basic Income Canada Network collected, people used the money for everything from child care to groceries to rent. Many feared what would happen to them after the government halts CERB as some businesses, schools, and families gradually recover from the pandemic.

One respondent wrote:

“We all know about the people ‘in the middle,’ the ones who are struggling to keep up, but aren’t actually falling behind, who aren’t in danger of dying, but will never know what it is to truly thrive; the ones who just keep ‘falling through the cracks.’ This is me.”

Others lamented about how those living on disability cheques are forced to live on about half the amount of what CERB doles out.

Basic income would help those in all of these situations, said Regehr.

Many who wrote in were living on the precipice of poverty before COVID-19 hit, said Regehr. That’s why Canada should not settle for going back to the “old normal,” either, she said.

“Normal was people starving on social assistance, using emergency rooms for health care because they can’t eat properly, it’s police activity in disadvantaged neighbourhoods to quell the gun violence because people don’t have enough to get by through legal means.”

Through the stories collected by Basic Income Canada Network, Canadians living in precarious situations do a better job showing why basic income makes sense — better than any policy adviser could, said Regehr.

Some are even a little bit optimistic.

One youth who in recent years lived in shelters, under a bridge, and now in a garage, summed up the situation like this:

“I truly believe that the world has enough money and resources to go around; they just need to be distributed to those in need because without the working class, everything shuts down.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Monday. This file is no longer updating. Click here to read the latest coverage. Web links to longer stories if available.

5:52 p.m.: Ontario’s public health units reported the most new COVID-19 infections in more than three weeks Monday, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 5 p.m. Monday, the health units were reporting a total of 36,963 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,716 deaths, up a total of 232 new cases since Sunday evening.

However, that tally also included an administrative drop after Toronto Public Health removed several duplicate cases from its records. The health unit said the city saw another 62 new infections Monday, but after adjusting for the duplicates the city’s running total fell by 10.

Accounting for these cases, the province saw a total of 304 COVID-19 cases reported since the same time Sunday, the most since June 8.

That high one-day count included another 88 new cases in the Windsor-Essex health unit, which again reported dozens of infections among migrant farm workers.

Meanwhile, 10 more fatal cases were reported Monday. The daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply in the province since peaking in early May, when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier, the province reported that 232 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 46 in intensive care, of whom 35 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,665 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:55 p.m.: Nunavut lifted more COVID-19 restrictions Monday, announcing immediate family members can visit elders in its long-term-care facilities.

As well, residents are now able to gather in groups of up to 50 people while outside, and households are able to gather with groups of up to 10 additional people in private dwellings.

“We need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practise distancing and good hand hygiene,” said Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s chief public health officer.

Starting Monday, day camps and youth centres are allowed to resume operations, and the limit for some official indoor gatherings is now 50 people, or half of the capacity of the building, whichever is less.

This includes places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, the Government of Nunavut, municipal corporations or regional Inuit organizations.

“If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community and your territory safe,” Patterson said.

There are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut.

2:45 p.m.: The British Columbia government has introduced a program aimed at creating work for 15-to-29-year-old youth in community service while their job prospects are dramatically affected by COVID-19.

Advanced Education Minister Melanie Mark says almost 25 per cent of youth are unemployed in B.C. and the program would give them an opportunity to work outdoors on initiatives such as building trails or cleaning beaches.

She says the $5-million program would provide up to $10,000 in grants for community projects lasting up to 16 weeks.

Youth would receive a training stipend of up to $2,000 per four-week period to a maximum of $8,000 for work until the end of October.

2:30 p.m.: A report released Monday by the non-profit Basic Income Canada Network features 141 anonymized stories collected from people across Canada in April and highlights the myriad of different situations where a basic income would allow someone to get a job, retain their dignity, or in some cases, save their life.

1:28 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says an ongoing review of the federal response to COVID-19 will feed into plans for responding to a potential second wave of the novel coronavirus.

Trudeau says there are plenty of things that in hindsight the government might have done differently or sooner, but he didn’t go into details.

He says the federal government will be able to respond with sufficient fiscal room if economic lockdowns are required to combat a second wave of COVID-19.

He says the government is planning for a worst-case scenario and hoping for the best.

The latest federal figures show direct spending at just over $174 billion, including another increase to the budget for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit that is now expected to cost $80 billion.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau is scheduled to provide an updated snapshot of federal finances next week.

1 p.m. (updated): The latest COVID-19 projections based on possible scenarios were released Monday by Canada’s top public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam.

Cumulative COVID-19 cases by July 12 could range from 103,940 to 108,130 — Canada is already at 103,250.

Cumulative deaths by July 12 could range from 8,545 to 8,865 — Canada is already at 8,522.

New federal models show continued progress in suppressing the spread of COVID-19, but with significant hotspots.

The figures released by the Public Health Agency of Canada show that some areas have been more heavily impacted by COVID-19 than others, specifically Quebec and Ontario.

The hotspots in the past few days include parts of Saskatchewan, Toronto, Montreal and around the border town of Windsor, Ont.

At this point, transmission of the novel coronavirus appears under control nationally with any fluctuations due to localized outbreaks, Tam said.

She said people under the age of 40 account for a greater proportion of cases after that has been steep declines in case numbers for people over 80 years old in recent weeks.

12:30 p.m.: COVID-19 has exploded among agri-farm workers outside Windsor with almost 200 new cases on the weekend and public health units from London and elsewhere sending staff to help control the outbreaks.

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit reported 87 more cases in farm workers Monday on top of 96 the previous day — both highs for the region and all at the same operation officials would not identify.

“It’s unprecedented. Nobody was expecting this high number,” medical officer of health Dr. Wajid Ahmed told a news conference Monday in Windsor.

Read the full story from the Star’s Rob Ferguson.

Over the weekend, the Star’s work and wealth reporter Sara Mojtehedzadeh looked at the living and working conditions of the migrant workers.

11:53 a.m.: Quebec has resumed releasing daily COVID-19 data following a widely criticized three-day interruption.

The province is reporting 72 new cases of the novel coronavirus compared with the prior day, for a total of 55,390.

Authorities also report five additional deaths from COVID-19 within the past 24 hours, and two deaths that occurred before June 21, for a total of 5,485.

Last week, public health authorities said they would end daily COVID-19 updates in favour of a weekly summary, but reversed that decision after public outcry.

During the three days for which there was no daily update — Friday through Sunday — the province reported 30 deaths attributed to COVID-19, an average of 10 per day.

The province also reported 239 new cases of the virus during the same three-day period, for an average of nearly 80 cases per day.

11:45 p.m. (updated): Five more people have tested positive for COVID-19 in an outbreak related to a nail salon in Kingston, Ont., including an employee at another salon.

The Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health unit says a total of 27 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are linked to Binh’s Nail and Spa.

Dr. Kieran Moore, the region’s medical officer of health, says a worker at Kingdom Nails & Spa was in close contact with a staff member at Binh’s, and they have also tested positive for COVID-19.

Moore recommends that anyone who attended Kingdom on June 17 or between June 21 and June 25 get tested.

He says the growth rate of the outbreak depends on what steps people in the Kingston area take in the next two weeks to protect themselves and others.

On Friday the City of Kingston made it mandatory to wear a face mask in all indoor public places.

11:28 a.m. (updated): Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says new federal models show continued progress in suppressing COVID-19, but with significant hotspots.

He says the restrictions Canadians have lived with through the spring have worked to get the novel coronavirus under control. But if we let up, Trudeau says the country could still be at risk.

A new explosion in cases could mean a return to tight restrictions, he warns.

He says rising COVID-19 numbers in the United States demonstrate the need for continued vigilance north of the border, including keeping physical distances from each other wherever possible.

More details on the federal government’s outlook are to come at mid-day Eastern time, in a news conference with Canada’s top public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam.

10:10 a.m.: The Canadian Emergency Response Benefit which pays $2,000 per month, is being extended from 16 weeks to 24. However, eventually coverage will run out, as it will for those who qualified for employment insurance during the pandemic, too.

It’s not too soon to strategize about what’s next for work and your finances. Here’s a road map to help you through the transition.

9:30 a.m.: Local artist The Weeknd has donated $500,000 to the Scarborough Health Network “in support of COVID-19 relief efforts,” said a press release Monday morning.

“I was raised in Scarborough and felt it was important to give back to the community that raised me during the hard times of this pandemic,” The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, said in the release.

The donation from the Grammy-winning singer, songwriter and record producer came through sales of The Weeknd’s signature ‘XO’ face masks. XO is his record label.

“The donation is a leading gift to the health network’s COVID-19 Emergency Fund, which now totals more than $2.7 million,” reads the release from Scarborough Health Network.

More than 3,500 donors have contributed to the fund to date, according to Scarborough Health Network.

Dr. Elaine Yeung, corporate chief and medical director of medicine at Scarborough Health Network said the donation represents “Scarborough’s incredible spirit and collective passion for shaping a brighter, healthier future.

“Like The Weeknd, many of my fellow frontline workers either come from Scarborough or call this community home,” Yeung said in the news release. “It is amazing to see one of our own on the world stage, giving back during our community’s time of need; generous support like this inspires us to keep going.”

8:50 a.m.: Some of the Blue Jays’ top prospects are among a group of 58 players invited to a second training camp that looks more and more like it will land in Toronto this week.

Team president Mark Shapiro has yet to receive government approval for the Jays to host the camp. Shapiro said Friday he has been speaking to “all three levels of government.”

But two sources said Sunday evening that players were told last week to expect Toronto to be home to both the camp and regular-season games. Major-league camps can open as early as Wednesday, with the 60-game season starting July 23 or 24.

The Star’s Mark Zwolinski has the story.

8:20 a.m.: Data from Sheridan Villa shows seniors isolated by COVID-19 are increasingly depressed and suffering from falls, unexpected weight loss and pressure ulcers. The Star’s Moira Welsh has the stories behind the data and the lasting impact it may have.

6:13 a.m.: The three levels of government must “flip the switch” and quickly create new housing for homeless people in Toronto ahead of an anticipated second wave of COVID-19, says the executive director of a community health centre in the city.

Angela Robertson, executive director of Parkdale Queen West community health centre and a co-lead on the Toronto region COVID-19 homelessness/shelter working group, says the governments must quickly transition to a short-term strategy for housing the homeless. That strategy should include reinvesting in new affordable housing construction, turning existing vacant buildings into affordable units and putting money into creating new rooming houses and supportive units.

“We have seen what political will and commitment can do in the immediate short term to respond to the challenges that COVID brought to our communities, to the economy,” Robertson says, referring, for example, to the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides temporary income to those who lost work during the pandemic.

6 a.m.: Canadian Blood Services is gearing up to start testing for COVID-19 antibodies in the next few weeks, contributing to a massive cross-country study to determine just how many people have been infected with the disease.

Chantale Pambrun, director of Canadian Blood Services’ Centre for Innovation, said the organization partnered with the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force in the spring. The task force was set up by the federal government to co-ordinate efforts around understanding immunity, and includes researchers from across the country.

The blood banks have been saving samples from people who donated in the past few months, which they can rapidly test to inform the task force, writes the Star’s May Warren.

5:15 a.m.: Fans of South Korea’s pro sports may be required to wear masks and discouraged from shouting or eating food when they possibly return to the stands in coming weeks.

Jung Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said such measures were being discussed as health authorities and the sports ministry map out plans for spectators to return to sports. The plans could be announced as early as this week.

Jeong said it will be crucial for the leagues to enforce distance between the fans. Limits on attendance could be eased as the country’s anti-virus efforts progress. South Korea’s professional baseball and soccer leagues returned to action in May without spectators.

The discussions on fans’ return come despite a resurgence of the virus in the Seoul area. South Korea on Monday reported 42 new infections, and authorities are considering stronger social restrictions if the epidemic continues to grow.

5:05 a.m.: The European Union is preparing a list of 15 countries whose nationals will be allowed to visit the bloc beginning Wednesday, Spain’s foreign minister, Aranch Gonzalez Laya, told the Cadena SER radio network.

The resurgence of cases in the U.S. means Americans may not be on that list. Gonzalez Laya said countries will be chosen according to their coronavirus status and the reliability of their data, she said.

“This is not an exercise to be nice or unfriendly to other countries, this is an exercise of self-responsibility,” she said. She confirmed that Spain will reopen its borders with Portugal despite rising infections there.

4:58 a.m.: India has reported a new daily record of nearly 20,000 new infections as several Indian states reimpose partial or full lockdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

India’s health ministry has recorded 548,318 COVID-19 total cases as of Monday, a jump of nearly 100,000 cases in a week in the world’s fourth-worst affected country after the United States, Brazil and Russia. India’s death toll has reached 16,475, while 321,723 patients have recovered from the disease.

The capital district of the northeastern state of Assam on the Bangladesh border has reimposed a full lockdown until July 12 following a spike in cases. Another border state, West Bengal, has extended its lockdown until July 31.

4 a.m.: Health authorities are using a saliva test while working against a coronavirus outbreak in Australia’s second-largest city. The test appears to be less accurate than the nasal swab but is a more comfortable option.

Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the situation in Melbourne was “a genuine challenge now,” in part because the better situation elsewhere in Australia made it harder to tell people to stay vigilant.

Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said on Monday that 75 people had tested positive in the state in the latest 24 hours. She said the saliva test was first used in a Melbourne suburban hot spot on Sunday. The saliva tests in research were only 87 per cent as accurate as the nasal swab because saliva contained less virus than the throat, said Sharon Lewin, director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, which developed the saliva test being used.

Sunday 10:30 p.m. The number of active COVID-19 cases in a Calgary highrise condo building has prompted provincial officials to change the area’s regional classification on the weekend from “open” to “watch.”

According to Alberta Health, more than 60,000 people live in Calgary Centre and there are 34 active cases there — all of which spokeswoman Karin Campbell says are associated with Verve Condominiums. According to Alberta Health’s website, a watch is issued when there are at least 10 active cases in a region and there are more than 50 active cases per 100,000 people, and it says Calgary Centre is just over that at 51.4 cases.

It says that during a watch, the province is “monitoring the risk and discussing with local governments and other community leaders the possible need for additional health measures.” The next level up is enhanced, where “risk levels require enhanced public health measures to control the spread.”

Campbell says there have been 45 cases associated with the condo building and that 11 of them have recovered.

Alberta reported 39 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday but no new deaths. There are 216 active cases in the Calgary zone.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"The three levels of government must “flip the switch” and quickly create new housing for homeless people in Toronto ahead of an anticipated second wave of COVID-19, says the executive director of a community health centre in the city.

Angela Robertson, executive director of Parkdale Queen West community health centre and a co-lead on the Toronto region COVID-19 homelessness/shelter working group, says the governments must quickly transition to a short-term strategy for housing the homeless. That strategy should include reinvesting in new affordable housing construction, turning existing vacant buildings into affordable units and putting money into creating new rooming houses and supportive units.

“We have seen what political will and commitment can do in the immediate short term to respond to the challenges that COVID brought to our communities, to the economy,” Robertson says, referring, for example, to the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which provides temporary income to those who lost work during the pandemic.

“I may be in opposition to others who are still thinking of housing as a long-term strategy, but the pandemic has identified that housing is the most responsive remedy — a medicine for homeless, unsheltered folks who are affected by COVID-19,” Robertson says.

As co-lead of the COVID-19 homelessness working group Robertson is working with fellow co-leads Dr. Andrew Boozary, the University Health Network’s executive director of health and social policy, and Dr. Andrew Bond, medical director of Inner City Health Associates.

Among a host of initiatives, the working group — which includes physicians and nurses, from the health-care sector, along with managers and staff from dozens of community-based groups in Toronto — was formed in the spring to reimagine the support services and systems that are needed to assist homeless and unsheltered people, both during and after COVID.

The working group, funded through Ontario’s Ministry of Health, is also implementing a health and harm reduction strategy aimed at bringing a range of supports, including mobile coronavirus testing, to the homeless wherever they’re located — in the new hotel space created by the city to ensure physical distancing, traditional shelters, drop-in centres or encampments homeless people have set up under bridges, parks or beside roadways in the city.

Two new COVID-19 recovery sites in Toronto were recently set up in hotels as places where homeless people with COVID-19 can be treated and recover, and staffed with support from the working group. For instance, Robertson’s community health centre is involved in co-ordinating the provision of staff from a host of Toronto agencies who offer client support and harm reduction workers in the recovery sites.

The City of Toronto’s Shelter Support and Housing Administration is also involved with the sites where about 900 people have been cared for, says Boozary from UHN.

Boozary says the second wave of the coronavirus, predicted to begin sometime this fall, is a “statistical certainty,” according to epidemiologists, and with that comes “certain risks for further waves of homelessness on the horizon” in Toronto.

“Housing has to be a priority when we’re dealing with this virus,” he says.

“The rate of homelessness before COVID-19 was unacceptable. We were wilfully blind, and we can’t afford to go back to that,” Boozary adds.

Based on the city’s 2018 Street Needs Assessment, a “census” of the city’s homeless population, it’s estimated there were 8,715 people experiencing homelessness on the day the assessment was conducted, April 26, 2018.

The estimate included homeless individuals outdoors, in city-run shelters and 24-hour respite sites (including 24-hour women’s drop-in centres and the overnight Out of the Cold program), in shelters for women fleeing violence, health and treatment centres and correctional facilities.

“As we brace for a second wave of the virus, we need lasting housing solutions,” Boozary adds.

Robertson says it’s time to “flip the switch” in terms of the provision of housing resources that have been promised by the federal government and province, resources that will help reduce homelessness.

“I think what it means in tangible terms, lest we forget, in the late 1990s and early 2000, in this province, the then-Conservative government downloaded social housing to the city, without the appropriate funding to maintain or replenish and increase housing stock.

“They thought the private sector would step in and develop housing that would then make affordable housing miraculously appear. But what we have seen instead is an affordable housing crisis,” Robertson says.

In the near term, Robertson’s housing strategy envisions varied approaches.

Ontario had a strong co-op housing sector that was a model for bringing affordable housing to working people. This approach should be revisited, she says.

Additional supportive housing units need to be established for people with substance abuse and mental-health challenges, she adds.

New rent subsidies should also be brought forward to support people when affordable units are brought on-stream, Robertson suggests.

“And we still need to look at investments in mixed housing like rooming houses, where we know that has been a viable option for many who have transitioned out of street homelessness. That is a model that I think can and should still have support extended to it,” Robertson says, adding there are existing structures in Toronto that can be converted into this type of housing.

Given the anticipated second COVID wave in the fall, Robertson believes all levels of government need to move on a housing plan in the next six to 12 months.

“We have gotten stuck in being told there is no money. And those of us who administer ... we get stuck there and begin to believe that. We have seen that homelessness is not an inevitable condition we need to live with just because we keep being told there is no money,” Robertson adds.

Among several announcements, the City of Toronto had previously stated it plans to increase investments by $3 billion, mostly to support the creation of 20,000 new affordable rental and supportive housing units.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'May Warrenstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'May Warren Is A Toronto-Based Breaking News Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"Canadian Blood Services is gearing up to start testing for COVID-19 antibodies in the next few weeks, contributing to a massive cross-country study to determine just how many people have been infected with the disease.

Chantale Pambrun, director of Canadian Blood Services’ Centre for Innovation, said the organization partnered with the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force in the spring. The task force was set up by the federal government to co-ordinate efforts around understanding immunity, and includes researchers from across the country.

The blood banks have been saving samples from people who donated in the past few months, which they can rapidly test to inform the task force.

“It’s a really great opportunity for blood donors today who have come through the doors in the last few months to contribute to this data,” she said, “to understand, what has COVID done to Canadians.”

The antibody tests don’t show whether someone has COVID-19, like the nasal swab tests. They instead show whether someone has had it in the past and recovered.

Canadian Blood Services will also test donors going forward, to help the task force get to the goal of at least 1 million samples. Héma-Québec, the non-profit that supplies blood in Quebec, will also support the project, a spokesperson confirmed.

A similar study in the United States that looked at samples from blood banks and collected in labs for other tests found the number of Americans infected with the coronavirus is 10 times higher than thought, about 23 million people. That’s about 5-to-8 per cent of the population, but still means over 90 per cent is still susceptible, the head of the CDC announced Thursday.

The antibody tests find people who didn’t have symptoms or only had mild ones and weren’t counted in official testing totals because they never got the nasal swab test.

Taking the blood samples won’t involve having to stick an extra needle in a person’s arm, but are done “in the background,” Pambrun said, with samples they normally hold for testing of blood-borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, to provide the task force with “an aggregated view of the results for them to then plug those results into a bigger data set.”

For about 80 per cent of donors, there’s enough blood left over after safety testing to test for the antibodies, she said.

They don’t test for active COVID-19 because it’s not spread through blood, Pambrun added.

The federal government has already ordered 140,000 antibody tests from Abbott Laboratories for the study, Federal Procurement Minister Anita Anand told reporters on a recent press call.

“These kits will play an important role in tracking how widely the virus has spread,” she said.

“Information made available through these kits could also prove valuable in the estimation of potential immunity and vulnerabilities in our population.”

There’s been some controversy with accuracy of antibody tests in the U.S. but the Abbott test is one of a handful approved by Health Canada.

The task force will roll out several studies over the next two years, said Dr. Tim Evans, director of the School of Population and Global Health at McGill University, who’s leading its secretariat.

They will also look at trends in specific populations such as seniors and pregnant women, and occupational groups like long-term-care home workers and employees at meat packing plants.

The goal is to get “an understanding of the level of infection across the country,” he said, and eventually “understand also through the antibody test what the levels of immunity are, and what their duration will be and what level of protection they provide with respect to risk of further infection.”

The approved tests have “very low false-positive rates,” he said.

Pambrun said they will not be informing donors if they have the antibodies, as the science on immunity is still developing, through studies like those being undertaken by the task force.

“The balance that we have is we don’t want to give people false assurance that you won’t get COVID-19 again because we don’t know that,” she said.

“But we are keeping on top of what the evidence shows and how informative this could be to donors.”

Ministry of Health spokesperson Hayley Chazan told the Star earlier this month that a framework for incorporating these serology tests into the province’s wider testing strategy is expected to be released shortly.

In the meantime, the Health Canada-approved antibody tests are currently licensed only for research, and individuals can’t go out and get them if they want to know if they’ve been infected.

Canadian Blood Services is also still looking for convalescent plasma donors for another clinical trial they’re part of, giving plasma from people who’ve recovered from the coronavirus to current patients.

For now, they’re only taking male donors as female plasma is more complicated, Pambrun said, because of possible past pregnancies.

Men who’ve had sex with men in the last three months are also barred from donating blood products.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-28,"CALGARY—The number of active COVID-19 cases in a Calgary highrise condo building has prompted provincial officials to change the area’s regional classification on the weekend from “open” to “watch.”

According to Alberta Health, more than 60,000 people live in Calgary Centre and there are 34 active cases there — all of which spokeswoman Karin Campbell says are associated with Verve Condominiums.

According to Alberta Health’s website, a watch is issued when there are at least 10 active cases in a region and there are more than 50 active cases per 100,000 people, and it says Calgary Centre is just over that at 51.4 cases.

It says that during a watch, the province is “monitoring the risk and discussing with local governments and other community leaders the possible need for additional health measures.”

The next level up is enhanced, where “risk levels require enhanced public health measures to control the spread.”

Campbell says there have been 45 cases associated with the condo building and that 11 of them have recovered.

Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health, said last week that the situation is an example of how easily the illness can spread from one person to many if given the opportunity.

Alberta reported 39 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday but no new deaths. There are 216 active cases in the Calgary zone.

Read', 'Daniel Politithe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Daniel Politithe New York Timessun.']",2020-06-28,"BUENOS AIRES—Days after Argentina cancelled all international passenger flights to shield the country from the new coronavirus, Juan Manuel Ballestero began his journey home the only way possible: he stepped aboard his small sailboat for what turned out to be an 85-day odyssey across the Atlantic.

The 47-year-old sailor could have stayed put on the tiny Portuguese island of Porto Santo, to ride out the era of lockdowns and social distancing in a scenic place largely spared by the virus. But the idea of spending what he thought could be “the end of the world” away from his family, especially his father who was soon to turn 90, was unbearable.

So he said he loaded his 29-foot sailboat with canned tuna, fruit and rice and set sail in mid-March.

“I didn’t want to stay like a coward on an island where there were no cases,” Ballestero said. “I wanted to do everything possible to return home. The most important thing for me was to be with my family.”

The coronavirus pandemic has upended life in virtually every country, gutting the global economy, exacerbating geopolitical tension and halting most international travel. A particularly painful aspect of this awful era has been the inability of an untold number of people to rush home to help ailing loved ones and attend funerals.

Friends tried to dissuade Ballestero from embarking on the perilous journey, and authorities in Portugal warned him he might not be allowed to re-enter if he ran into trouble and had to turn back. But he was resolute.

“I bought myself a one-way ticket, and there was no going back,” he said.

His relatives, used to Ballestero’s itinerant lifestyle, knew better than to try to talk him out of it.

“The uncertainty of not knowing where he was for 50-some days was very rough,” said his father, Carlos Alberto Ballestero. “But we had no doubt this was going to turn out well.”

Sailing across the Atlantic in a small boat is challenging in the best of circumstances. The added difficulties of doing it during a pandemic became clear three weeks into the trip.

On April 12, authorities in Cape Verde refused to allow him to dock at the island nation to restock his supply of food and fuel, Ballestero said.

Hoping he had enough food to carry him through, he turned his boat west. With less fuel than he hoped for, he would be more at the mercy of the winds.

He was no stranger to spending long stretches of time at sea, but being alone on the open ocean is daunting to even the most experienced sailor.

Days into the journey, he became panicked by the light of a ship that he thought was trailing him and seemed to be approaching closer and closer.

“I started going as fast as possible,” Ballestero said. “I thought, ‘If it gets very close, I’ll shoot.’”

Seafaring is a Ballestero family tradition.

From the time he was three, his father took him aboard the fishing vessels he captained.

When he turned 18, he took a job on a fishing boat in southern Argentina. Off the coast of Patagonia, one of the most experienced fishermen aboard gave him a piece of advice that would become a way of life.

“Go see the world,” the fisherman said.

And so he did.

Ballestero has spent much of his life sailing, with stops in Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Bali, Hawaii, Costa Rica, Brazil, Alaska and Spain.

He has tagged sea turtles and whales for conservation organizations and spent summers working as a skipper aboard boats owned by wealthy Europeans.

He bought his sailboat, an Ohlson 29 named the Skua, in 2017, hoping to take it on a loop around the world. It proved up to the task of traversing an ocean on a planet plunged into crisis mode.

“I wasn’t afraid, but I did have a lot of uncertainty,” he said. “It was very strange to sail in the middle of a pandemic with humanity teetering around me.”

Sailing can be a lonely passion, and it was particularly so on this voyage for Ballestero, who each night tuned into the news on a radio for 30 minutes to take stock of how the virus was rippling across the globe.

“I kept thinking about whether this would be my last trip,” he said.

The expansiveness of the ocean notwithstanding, Ballestero felt he was in a quarantine of sorts, imprisoned by an unrelenting stream of foreboding thoughts about what the future held.

“I was locked up in my own freedom,” he recalled.

On a particularly trying day, he turned to a bottle of whiskey for solace. But drinking only increased his anxiety. With his nerves frayed, Ballestero said he found himself praying and resetting his relationship with God.

“Faith keeps you standing in these situations,” he said. “I learned about myself; this voyage gave me lots of humility.”

Several weeks into the trip, when his spirits were low, Ballestero said he was buoyed by wildlife sightings that felt like omens.

He found solace in a pod of dolphins that swam alongside his boat, on and off, for some 2,000 miles.

“They would go and come back,” he said. “And one day, they seemed to say goodbye.”

During a day when he had drunk heavily, he spotted a large bird cruising nearby. It turned out to be a skua, the bird his boat is named after.

“It was as if the bird was telling me not to give up, to keep going,” he said.

One day, when he tired of canned food, Ballestero got a fishing rod and scanned a school of mahi-mahi. But he had a sudden reluctance to cast out a line.

“I didn’t want to kill one. It felt like killing a person,” he said. “I used to be a fisherman, but after that experience it’s hard for me to kill now.”

He went back to eating canned tuna.

When he was approaching the Americas, a brutal wave rattled the boat some 150 miles from Vitória, Brazil, he said. That episode forced him to make an unplanned pit stop in Vitória, adding about 10 days to a trip he had expected to take 75 days.

During that stop, Ballestero learned that his brother had told reporters in Argentina about the voyage, which enthralled people who were bored and cooped up at home. At the urging of friends, he created an Instagram account to document the final leg of the trip.

When he made it to his native Mar del Plata, on June 17, he was startled by the hero’s welcome he received.

“Entering my port where my father had his sailboat, where he taught me so many things and where I learned how to sail and where all this originated, gave me the taste of a mission accomplished,” he said.

A medical professional administered a test for COVID-19 on the dock. Within 72 hours, after the test came back negative, he was allowed to set foot on Argentine soil.

While he did not get to celebrate his father’s 90th birthday in May, he did make it home in time for Father’s Day.

“What I lived is a dream,” Ballestero said. “But I have a strong desire to keep on sailing.”

Read', 'Peter Edwardsstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'With Files The Star S Wire Services']",2020-06-28,"There’s a nasty phrase burning through the Internet from Canada’s smallest province right now — “plate shaming.”

Prince Edward Island hasn’t reported any COVID-19 deaths and Islanders plan to keep it that way, even if that means being uncharacteristically frosty to visitors.

That explains an ad posted Saturday on Kijiji, which promises to help outsiders hide their place of origin by purchasing or renting out a P.E.I. licence plate.

The ad reads: “P.E.I. License (sic) Plate/ $50.00” and goes on to explain: “All you Mainlanders coming to PEI sick of being harassed by dummies about your New Brunswick license plate? Well don’t worry I’ve got just the fix. Slap this baby on your car and tell folks you’re from Summerside, and you’re all set! Rental for $50 a month or buy it for $150 flat!”

When asked by the Star, the ad’s poster wouldn’t comment Sunday on whether he’d had any bites, despite the ad receiving 122 views since it was posted Saturday.

The ad comes as the tiny province braces for an influx of cottage owners, many of whom have out-of-province license plates.

It also comes as P.E.I. prepares to join with Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador to create an “Atlantic bubble” on July 3, which will allow residents of the region to travel within the four provinces without having to self-isolate for 14 days.

Meanwhile, there have been reports of cars being vandalized and one of a nasty note being left on the windshield of a rented car with Nova Scotia plates driven by a local Salvation Army pastor. The local pastor’s note read, “go the (expletive) back to the mainland” and was signed, “all of P.E.I.”

In response to such reports of “plate shaming,” Island resident Paddy Wadden has posted on Twitter: “Love PEI & Islanders we live in #PEI, pay taxes here, and were here months or years before COVID. Please don’t key our cars or shame us just because of our license plates are from out of the province.”

This debate has even spilled into the provincial legislature, with the Opposition and Green party leader Peter Bevan-Baker blaming Islanders’ uncharacteristic hostility toward outsiders on the Premier Dennis King’s government for what he believes has been inconsistent messaging.

King acknowledges the province’s initial four-phase plan to gradually lift restrictions has been more accelerated, but he maintains all decisions to ease restrictions have been made in consultation with the province’s chief public health office.

“From the beginning of this, we realized that we had to evolve and adapt every day on a lot of the decisions that we’ve been making,” he said in an interview Saturday.

“I certainly feel confident in the process that we put together from the position that everything has been based on the best data and science and the best public health information.”

He characterized the anti-outsider sentiment as “isolated incidents” and believes they were sparked by fear of the unknown triggered by a concerning resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some American states.

“My own belief is that many people in our province and beyond have been watching events as they transpire around the world and maybe transporting that back here,” he said.

“For example if you see what’s taking place in Florida, it’s vastly different than what takes place here, so I think that’s a big part of it.”

There have been heightened tensions about tourists from Quebec, which has been hard-hit by the pandemic.

Quebecers wanting to go to Cap-aux-Meules on the Îles-de-la-Madeleine were only allowed to pass through P.E.I. to reach the ferry in Souris starting June 26.

While they’re finally allowed into the province, they aren’t allowed to stop for anything other than fuel or washroom breaks and must go straight to the ferry terminal in Souris.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-28,"OTTAWA—The federal Conservatives are calling for an investigation into the Liberal government’s decision to have an international charity administer a $900-million program designed to help students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The request is contained in a letter sent to Auditor General Karen Hogan on Sunday in which the Tories argue that “outsourcing” the Canada Student Service Grant to WE Charity undermines Parliament’s ability to monitor the aid program.

The Conservatives also noted the “well documented” connections between WE and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as they underscored the importance of transparency, accountability and value for money in Ottawa’s COVID-19 spending.

“By outsourcing this program to a third party, the proper channels for Opposition scrutiny, the very bedrock of our parliamentary democracy, have been circumvented,” reads the letter signed by Conservative MPs Pierre Poilievre, Dan Albas and Raquel Dancho.

“Indeed, it is your office that will provide the most legitimate and transparent examination of this program.”

The auditor general’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

The Liberal government announced the Canada Student Service Grant last week as part of a broader suite of support for students and young people struggling to find internships, job placements and other work-related experience during COVID-19.

Eligible students can earn up to $5,000 for volunteer work with non-profit organizations that are helping to cushion the impact of the pandemic. The program is supposed to place up to 20,000 students in volunteer positions between now and October.

Trudeau defended employing WE to administer the program after conflict-of-interest concerns were raised last week. The prime minister attended several WE events in the past and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, hosts one of its podcasts.

The prime minister said the decision to use WE was made by the non-partisan public service, not by him. Delivery of the grant program demanded an organization able to reach the tens of thousands of students, he said.

WE directed questions Friday to the government.

The Conservatives want Hogan to incorporate her study of WE and the student aid program into her larger review of the government’s pandemic-related spending, which is expected to be tabled in Parliament later this year.

Direct federal spending on emergency aid measures now stands at $174 billion, the government announced Friday, driven by a jump in the estimated cost of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to $80 billion.

That is up from the previously revised $60 billion and more than double the original $35-billion estimate, as demand rises and recipients get ready to receive eight extra weeks of payments.

Statistics Canada’s latest jobs report showed that returning post-secondary students, aged 20 to 24, had a record-high unemployment rate in May of 42.1 per cent, and about one-third had seen summer placements disappear because of COVID-19.

Data released Friday by the agency also found that youths in the so-called internet generation were the most likely to formally volunteer. They contributed on average 82 unpaid hours to charities in 2018 and had a volunteer rate of 52 per cent.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some expats who spoke with The Canadian Press from the hardest-hit areas said they were surprised by the speed at which their respective states reopened, while others said the situation was overblown.

All are trying to maintain physical distancing and wear masks when they do go out.

“All we can do is the best we can to stay as safe as possible, but it’s definitely nerve-racking,” said Houston resident and Toronto native Grace Gonzalez.

Texas surpassed 5,000 hospitalizations last week as the second-biggest state scaled back its aggressive opening strategy, ordering bars closed indefinitely and restaurants to reduce capacity.

In Houston, where Gonzalez has lived for eight years, the public threat level was raised to its highest level on Friday.

“I was in shock when they decided to open up Texas, I felt it was way too early,” Gonzalez said. “We never saw a dip at all ... there wasn’t any of that flattening of the curve before they decided to reopen.”

Gonzalez said masks weren’t prevalent in recent weeks and many went about their lives as if everything was back to normal. But she stayed at home most of the time, while making limited trips to stores.

“I feel like a lot of mentality (here) is if you feel sick or if you’re in one of those groups that are immunocompromised, you should stay home, but if I’m healthy, why should I have to stay home?” Gonzalez said.

That question of individual-versus-collective good is something Ontario-born Cheryl Applebaum noted in Florida, where more and more younger people have been infected. The state set a record Saturday with more than 9,500 cases.

Officials moved to shutter beaches and discouraged bar gatherings in a state that has more than 3,300 registered COVID-19 deaths.

“It really just increased our anxiety level,” said Applebaum, who lives in the Tampa area.

Applebaum was born in Windsor, raised in Toronto and has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years with her Canadian husband.

“Both my husband and myself are in the more vulnerable age group, we’re both seniors and we have been very conscientious about social distancing, wearing face coverings, proper hygiene when we go out and come in,” said Applebaum. “And to see some of the people in the grocery stores relax those things has been very disconcerting.”

Applebaum acknowledges the situation has her thinking about Canada a lot these days.

“To be honest, this (COVID-19) in conjunction with the political climate down here has made us seriously think about moving back,” Applebaum said.

However, not all Canadians living in the U.S. are overly worried.

Ken Moon, who lives in a town just north of Dallas, feels the situation is overblown on both sides of the border.

“Others may chose to say you must hide away forever and never do anything again, but that’s not how we live our lives,” said Moon, a southeastern Ontario native who found out through serological testing that he’d had COVID-19 in February, with milder symptoms, despite having other health issues.

Moon said he believes the bigger numbers in recent days are more a result of increased testing. He says the only real change in his day-to-day life is wearing a mask.

“It is what it is, the biggest thing is keeping those that are infected away from the seniors’ care facilities,” Moon said.

Moon said he wasn’t opposed to the Texas reopening plan, noting some acquaintances in Canada haven’t left home in months.

“I have no idea where this idea of complete quarantine came from but that’s what they’re doing, and it’s kind of like ‘Why are you doing that?’” Moon said.

Like in Canada, the COVID-19 circumstances vary across the country.

The situation in Florida was worrisome enough for Ontario-born Laurie Turley-Michel that she headed back to her summer residence in Ohio early, with the impression that people in the Sunshine State were in denial about COVID-19.

“I was personally afraid to go out at all,” said Turley-Michel, who has been in the U.S. for 15 years. “It wasn’t until right before we decided to come back to Ohio that they implemented a stay-at-home order, but it didn’t last long. Florida was one of the first to start reopening.”

She works at a law firm where employees are mostly working remotely and clients are obliged to wear a mask for meetings. Turley-Michel has largely stayed home, other than going for groceries or essential purchases. She always wears a mask in public.

“We haven’t had family over here, we live in a rural area so it’s easier to stay social distanced,” Turley-Michel said.

Amy Williams, who lives in a small town near the Arizona-Mexico border where cases have been low, said she was optimistic when the lockdowns in March in her home state and her home province of Ontario happened almost in lockstep.

“Ontario and Arizona issued lockdown orders within two or three days of each other and then I felt in terms of cases, we were on the same trajectory as Ontario and then our governor decided to open things up,” said Williams, a native of Mississauga who will have to put off an annual summer trip home due to obligatory quarantine measures.

On Sunday, Arziona had 3,858 new cases of COVID-19. Ontario, with almost double the population, had 178.

Williams, a mother of two who works as a psychologist in the local school system, said her primary concern is how schools will reopen during the earlier August return in that state amid the spike.

“I just don’t see how we’re going to be able to not only physically prepare for the reopening, but mentally,” Williams said.

“I don’t know what that’s going to look like.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Shawn Donnanbloomberg News', 'Bloomberg News', 'Shawn Donnanbloomberg Newssun.']",2020-06-28,"A surge in the coronavirus that has seen record numbers of new U.S. cases in recent days is likely to continue for weeks after states moved too soon to reopen their economies, two of the country’s leading public health experts said Sunday.

The warnings by Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, and Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, came as a new poll showed confidence in how the U.S. is dealing with COVID-19 has fallen.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Frieden said the virus continued to have the “upper hand,” even as he acknowledged Americans had become tired of the restrictions needed to contain it.

“We’re all sick and tired of staying home. But you know what? The virus is not tired of making us sick,” he said.

“We are moving too fast,” Frieden said of states that remained eager to continue phased reopenings as cases continue to rise. “It’s like leaning into a left hook. You are going to get hit hard. And that’s what is happening.”

U.S. coronavirus cases now exceed 2.5 million, with more than 125,000 reported fatalities — in both cases the world’s highest. The country’s inability to control the spread of the virus seems likely to result in U.S. citizens being banned from travelling to Europe, for example, as air travel slowly resumes worldwide.

A move by the EU to restrict travel from the U.S. was the inevitable result of the continuing spread in America, Gottlieb said. Growing restrictions on travel within the U.S. could come next, he said.

A CBS poll released on Sunday showed 62 per cent of those surveyed said U.S. efforts to deal with the virus are “going badly,” up from 57 per cent in early June. The percentage who said President Donald Trump was doing a “good job” on the virus was 41 per cent, the lowest of five polls taken since late March.

The survey of 2,009 U.S. adults was taken June 23-26. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.

In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation on Sunday,” Gottlieb said that in the absence of requirements for the “universal masking” of people in affected states the spread of the virus was likely to continue growing.

Requiring people to wear masks is “the simplest intervention that we could take” to stop the spread of the virus, Gottlieb said. Polls, including the CBS survey, show the issue of wearing masks has become highly politicized in the U.S.

While the virus has ebbed in the Northeast, states like Florida, Texas and Arizona have seen virus cases spike in recent days. Other measures, including hospitalizations and deaths, haven’t risen as much.

On Sunday, Florida officials said the state’s coronavirus cases rose 6.4 per cent from a day earlier. Cumulative hospitalizations of Florida residents rose 0.8 per cent.

The current record rates of newly reported cases at 40,000 or more in recent days likely reflected a far bigger outbreak, Gottlieb said.

By the CDC’s own reckoning, the real number of infections was five to 10 times that being reported, Gottlieb said, and that meant the real rate of new infections was likely to be a “quarter-million” each day.

Frieden said that while there were potentially encouraging signs in the growing share of younger people — who are less likely to suffer severe complications — among new reported cases, that shouldn’t be a reason to grow complacent.

“What starts in the young doesn’t stay in the young,” he said, as younger people, often asymptomatic, can spread the coronavirus to more-vulnerable individuals including family members and co-workers.

It was false to dismiss the recent surge in daily cases as a function of a ramping-up in testing, Frieden said. A lower death rate was also potentially misleading, he said, with reported deaths likely to lag a surge in cases by about a month.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-28,"For the first time in its decades-long history, Toronto’s Pride parade was held online.

Despite some occasional technical glitches — lagging audio and spotty video for some viewers — the online “parade” on Sunday afternoon was a joyful substitute for the real thing, bringing together a mix of dancing, live performances, and montages.

A few minutes into the presentation, Pride Toronto said, jokingly, on Instagram that there was “too much pride!

“Our website traffic is over the rainbow and causing technical difficulties with our server,” reads the post. The livestream steamed ahead, ironing out an audio issue along the way.

City councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam gave a welcome speech, saying that, “when this pandemic is behind us, we will come together once again to fill the streets: the restaurants, the bars, the dance floors, the civic squares — and when we do, it will be the loudest, most colourful, most fabulous pride celebration this city has ever seen.”

“I look forward to that day with you,” Wong-Tam said.

Toronto comedian Brandon Ash-Mohammed hosted the 90-minute-long event, which featured cameos from Halsey and Alanis Morissette, Cozmic Cat, a Toronto-based DJ, Jully Black, and more.

The parade’s start time was moved so it wouldn’t overlap with a “teach-in” taking place Sunday at Nathan Phillips Square beginning at 2 p.m., organized by the No Pride in Policing Coalition, a group of “queer and trans people (supporting) all the demands that Black Lives Matter Toronto raised at the 2016 Pride Toronto parade,” according to the event’s Facebook description.

Pride Toronto said on its event page that the rally at Nathan Phillips Square was “a teachable moment for all of us, and the beginning of a larger global change to support the Black and BIPOC communities.”

New York’s famous Pride parade was also cancelled, with virtual performances and some smaller protests filling the breach. This year’s celebration marks the 50th anniversary of the first Pride march — which itself was a marker of the Stonewall uprisings in the city’s West Village the year before — and was set to be a huge commemoration until COVID-19 hit.

According to Pride Toronto’s annual report, around 150,000 people marched in the parade last year, which made it the biggest on record.

Virtual attendance this year was much smaller: the Facebook stream of the event peaked at around 500 people, while the livestream, on twitch.tv, had around 1,400 viewers.

Read', 'The Associated Press']",2020-06-28,"TAIPEI, TAIWAN—The Taiwanese capital held its annual LGBTQ pride parade on Sunday, making it one of the few places in the world to proceed with such an event in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

The parade in Taipei has drawn tens of thousands of people in the past, but participant numbers Sunday were reduced by both virus concerns and heavy rain.

Still, those who did take part said it was a testament both to Taiwan’s ability to contain the pandemic and its commitment to rights for people of all sexual orientations.

Taiwan is the only place in Asia where same-sex marriage is legal, and its liberal political system has long promoted human rights, free speech and freedom of assembly.

American student Loren Couse, 28, said Taipei’s ability to hold the parade was “really impressive.”

“I think Taiwan has done a really good job so far, and I am really proud of living here, not only because it’s so open to people like myself, the gay community, but also because I think it’s such an example for the world and how to handle the pandemic so far,” Couse said.

New York was among the cities compelled to cancel its gay pride parade this year to comply with social distancing measures. Taiwan has largely dropped such restrictions after quarantines and case tracing helped bring the coronavirus infection rate down radically. In all, the island of 23.7 million people has confirmed 447 cases, including seven deaths.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jillian Kestler-D Amoursstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter']",2020-06-28,"MONTREAL—Bruno Guilbault says he can’t remember seeing anything like it.

The mayor of Rawdon, Que., about 60 kilometres north of Montreal, said municipal parks on the Ouareau River were “overflowing” with out-of-towners last weekend, as the temperature hit 34 C.

The crowd was twice its usual size, Guilbault said, and even though Rawdon put signs up saying the parks were at capacity, people kept coming.

Many parked their cars haphazardly on residents’ lawns or near riverbanks, while large groups crowded together at various points on the water, said Guilbault.

“I’m 60 years old. I’m originally from Rawdon. I’ve rarely — rarely — seen something similar,” he said.

The busy weekend pushed the town to close the Dorwin Falls and Cascades parks and a municipal beach to non-residents until June 30 to give it time to put a better system in place and ensure people can maintain physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“I think the decision was easy enough to make. We didn’t have a choice,” Guilbault said.

Most businesses have been allowed to gradually reopen across Quebec this month, as the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths has decreased.

But the reopening has been met with some trepidation, especially in smaller towns outside Montreal, which was the epicentre of the province’s outbreak.

While many of those towns are welcoming the economic boost summer visitors bring, some residents fear an influx of tourists may put them at risk.

A petition launched on June 21 calls on the authorities in the Matawinie region of the Lanaudiere, of which Rawdon is a part, to prioritize the needs of local residents over tourists this summer.

With over 8,000 signatures so far, the petition decries “the outsiders who have taken our beautiful region hostage.”

On Thursday, Quebec’s public health director Horacio Arruda said the decrease in COVID-19 cases and deaths was good news for the province.

However he said people need to continue respecting physical distancing measures to avoid a potential second wave of the pandemic. “There is still a big need to be careful,” Arruda told reporters.

But with most Quebecers unable to travel outside of the province due to the pandemic, local tourist attractions may be busier than usual.

Simon Boivin, a spokesman for Quebec’s provincial parks network, known as SEPAQ, said many people have expressed a “keen interest” in visiting this year.

About 140,000 annual passes to SEPAQ’s 24 outdoor parks were sold in three days this week, Boivin said.

The passes were on sale for just over $40 – half the regular price – thanks to a $5-million investment from Quebec’s Tourism Department.

While the number of SEPAQ visitors is only released at the end of the season, Boivin said camping reservations between the end of June to the end of October are already up 11 per cent compared to last year.

“Summer is always a busy period for the SEPAQ network, but we effectively feel that it is more popular this year,” he said.

The parks have released an online checklist of health and safety precautions that people can take to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Information centres and other common areas inside the parks have physical distancing markers in place, and some trails have also been outfitted with signs letting hikers know if the paths are one-way or two-way.

Quebec’s Tourism Department said it is up to police to make sure rules around public safety and COVID-19 are respected, and that municipalities can also take steps to manage an influx of tourists.

“We’re confident that visitors will act in a way to ensure their safety and that of the places they will spend their vacations,” department spokeswoman Virginie Rompre said in an email.

Back in Rawdon, Guilbault said the town’s parks and beach will reopen to non-residents at 10 a.m. on June 30.

Additional security guards will be in place and the town has put up no-parking signs to direct visitors.

Guilbault said he is confident things will run more smoothly now, and fears of the region being taken hostage will not materialize. “We don’t want any more overflows,” he said.

Read', 'Hina Alamthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Hina Alamthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-28,"A significant drop in sea traffic brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has created what scientists call a rare opportunity to study how quieter waters affect southern resident killer whales off the British Columbia coast.

Ocean Networks Canada, which has been monitoring noise from ships and sounds made by marine mammals such as orcas, said it believes the change will be a boon for the animals.

“The anticipation is that the quieter environment will help the killer whales in communicating, in socializing, in navigating and, most importantly, in finding food,” said Richard Dewey, the organization’s associate director of science.

A paper published last month in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America said there has been about a 30 per cent decrease in commercial shipping traffic into the Port of Vancouver from China due to COVID-19 in just the first four months of the year.

Dewey said it’s not just commercial traffic that’s gone down — there’s also been a pause in whale watching boats, cruise ships, recreational vessels and tankers. That’s led to a noise reduction of about 75 per cent, he said.

“What we are seeing in the Salish Sea is levels of shipping noise that haven’t been present for three or four decades,” he said. “So we would have to go back to the 1980s before we would have heard such a quiet environment.”

One of the major concerns for the endangered southern resident killer whales is that shipping noises have been increasing and almost doubling every decade, he said.

These mammals have a hearing that is similar to that of humans, and they communicate in a frequency band similar to ours, Dewey said.

They use vocalizations to communicate within the pod, to navigate and most importantly to find their prey, he said.

“They echo-locate to find their salmon. It’s a very sophisticated sort of acoustic capability and the quieter the environment, they would have more success in finding prey.”

In the ocean, Dewey said whales use sound “continuously and all the time.”

Their eyesight helps them see up to a distance of about five to 10 metres while using sounds helps them scope out kilometres, he said, adding that the Salish Sea is a “very murky environment.”

Scientists believe the loud noises caused by humans increase stress hormones in orcas because they have to shout and cannot communicate over large distances, Dewey said.

He compared it to someone going into a loud club and having to pause until noise passes, to speak more loudly or give up. He noted that unlike people in a club, orcas can’t just leave for a quieter space.

Scientists will be using 30 hydrophones to record sounds made by the killer whales when they come into the Salish Sea, which should be any time now, Dewey said. Hydrophones are underwater recording devices that record how loudly the whales talk when it’s noisy or if they just give up.

The team is hoping this study will yield much-needed data to make policy and regulation changes to help the animals survive, he said.

“If we see them returning and staying in their critical habitat for longer periods ... if we have evidence of successful feeding on the salmon, then those are all good signs and in some sense the quieter environments can only have helped their survival,” he said.

The director of the University of British Columbia’s marine mammal research unit said that in the past, killer whales would be seen in the Salish Sea in May and June, but for the past four years they have been coming in much later, sometimes as late as September.

Andrew Trites said one of the reasons could be that there is not enough salmon, although mathematically there is enough fish for the 72 remaining southern resident killer whales.

This has left scientists wondering whether the trouble is that the whales cannot hunt because of disruption from vessels, he said.

“And there is an opportunity to see whether or not the behaviour of whales is different with fewer boats on the water and less noise.”

10:30 p.m. The number of active COVID-19 cases in a Calgary highrise condo building has prompted provincial officials to change the area’s regional classification on the weekend from “open” to “watch.”

According to Alberta Health, more than 60,000 people live in Calgary Centre and there are 34 active cases there — all of which spokeswoman Karin Campbell says are associated with Verve Condominiums. According to Alberta Health’s website, a watch is issued when there are at least 10 active cases in a region and there are more than 50 active cases per 100,000 people, and it says Calgary Centre is just over that at 51.4 cases.

It says that during a watch, the province is “monitoring the risk and discussing with local governments and other community leaders the possible need for additional health measures.” The next level up is enhanced, where “risk levels require enhanced public health measures to control the spread.”

Campbell says there have been 45 cases associated with the condo building and that 11 of them have recovered.

Alberta reported 39 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday but no new deaths. There are 216 active cases in the Calgary zone.

6:15 p.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 6:13 p.m. on June 28, 2020:

There are 105,327 confirmed cases in Canada.

Quebec: 55,079 confirmed (including 5,448 deaths, 23,786 resolved)

Ontario: 36,731 confirmed (including 2,706 deaths, 30,107 resolved)

Alberta: 7,996 confirmed (including 154 deaths, 7,322 resolved)

6:00 p.m.: Nearly 100 new COVID-19 infections related to the agricultural work in southwestern Ontario have pushed the province’s daily case total back above 250 for the first time in almost three weeks, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 6 p.m. Sunday, Ontario’s regional public health units are reporting a total of 36,731 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,706 deaths, up a total of 263 new cases since Saturday evening.

That high one-day total — up 100 from the Saturday — included a record 98 new cases in the Windsor-Essex health unit. On Sunday, the unit explained that all but two of those infections came in the region’s agricultural sector.

Elsewhere, the new cases were once again concentrated in a handful of health units; besides Windsor, just Toronto (84 cases) and Peel Region (54 cases) reported new infections in the double digits.

Because several health units have stopped issuing daily reports on the weekend, Sunday has typically seen lower case total relative to other days. Mondays, meanwhile, tend to see higher reports as the units catch up.

Meanwhile, just five more fatal cases were reported Sunday. The daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply in the province since peaking in early May when the health units reported as many as 94 deaths in a single day.

Earlier, the province reported that 214 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 51 in intensive care, of whom 36 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,658 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4:45 p.m.: The World Health Organization has announced another daily record in the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases across the world — topping over 189,000 in a single 24-hour period.

The tally Sunday from the U.N. health agency eclipses the previous record a week earlier at over 183,000 cases, showing case counts continue to progress worldwide.

Brazil recorded the most new cases over the one-day span at more than 46,800, followed by the U.S. at over 44,400. India had nearly 20,000.

Overall the U.S. still has far and away the most total cases, at more than 2,450,000 — roughly twice that of Brazil.

4:40 p.m.: The prime minister of Kosovo is warning that officials may have to reinstate lockdown measures if things don’t improve after a recent surge in reported coronavirus cases.

Avdullah Hoti said Sunday that he’s worried the hospital system will be overwhelmed.

Kosovo has seen a steep daily increase of the virus cases following containment measures from March to May. This past week, there were 517 new confirmed cases and 12 deaths.

Hoti urged residents to wear masks, follow social distancing protocols and wash their hands. He says those are simple measures “to protect ourselves, our children, parents and co-workers or co-travellers in the bus or taxi, or the next person at the restaurant.”

Kosovo has eased all restrictions except for those on mass gatherings, or fans at sport or cultural events.

As of Sunday, Kosovo has reported at least 2,590 confirmed cases and 48 deaths.

3:50 p.m.: The latest numbers from New York show five people died Saturday from the coronavirus in the state, the lowest daily death toll the state has reported since March 15.

Saturday’s total compared to 13 fatalities the day before as the number of fatalities caused by the virus continues to plummet in the state. During the peak of the pandemic in April, nearly 800 people were dying a day from coronavirus.

“We are on the exact opposite end,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

New York still leads the nation in COVID-19 deaths with nearly 25,000, according to the state’s official tally, which doesn’t include people who likely died of the disease.

Meanwhile, fewer than 900 patients were hospitalized Saturday for COVID-19, down from a peak of over 18,000 in April.

The governor cautioned that the numbers could spike again if New Yorkers let down their guard down and fail to follow social distancing and mask-wearing requirements.

“I’m now afraid of the spread coming from other states because we are one country and people travel,” Cuomo said. “I’m afraid the infection rate in the other states will come back to New York and raise that rate again.”

Confirmed daily infections in the U.S. hit an all-time high of 40,000 on Friday, prompting officials in Texas and Florida to reverse course and close down bars in their states again.

1:40 p.m.: A surge in coronavirus that has seen record numbers of new U.S. cases in recent days is likely to continue for weeks after states moved too soon to reopen their economies, two of the country’s leading public health experts said Sunday.

The warnings by Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control from 2009 to 2017, and Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, came as a new poll showed confidence in how the U.S. is dealing with COVID-19 has fallen.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Frieden said the virus continued to have the “upper hand,” even as he acknowledged Americans had become tired of the restrictions needed to contain it.

“We’re all sick and tired of staying home. But you know what? The virus is not tired of making us sick,” he said.

“We are moving too fast,” Frieden said of states that remained eager to continue phased reopenings as cases continue to rise. “It’s like leaning into a left hook. You are going to get hit hard. And that’s what is happening.”

11:36 a.m.: Ontario reported 178 new cases of COVID-19 and six new deaths related to the virus on Sunday.

The total number of cases now stands at 34,654, which includes 30,107 cases marked as resolved and 2,658 deaths.

New cases of the virus outpaced the number of resolved cases for the first time in recent days.

The number of people in hospital for the virus dropped significantly.

The number of people in intensive care also continued to drop, although there was a slight increase in the number of people using a ventilator.

The Ministry of Health says it was able to complete more than 28,000 tests for the novel coronavirus yesterday.

10:35 a.m.: As the Windsor-Essex region partially entered Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan this week, political leaders, health officials and farmers in the area expressed anxiety about efforts to contain COVID-19 outbreaks in the region’s sprawling greenhouses ahead of a possible second wave of the virus this fall.

The southwestern Ontario region became a hot spot for the virus this month, as a spike in cases among migrant workers led to hundreds of positive cases and two deaths.

The outbreaks also prompted the province to reopen only part of the region this week, leaving the towns of Leamington and Kingsville, Ont., behind as Windsor and other communities reopened further.

10:30 a.m.: For the first time in its decades-long history, Toronto’s Pride parade will be held online.

At noon Sunday, Pride Toronto will kick off its “virtual parade,” with the livestreamed festivities scheduled to last an hour and a half.

The parade’s start time was moved so that it wouldn’t overlap with a “teach-in” taking place Sunday at Nathan Phillips Square beginning at 2 p.m., organized by the No Pride in Policing Coalition, a group of “queer and trans people (supporting) all the demands that Black Lives Matter Toronto raised at the 2016 Pride Toronto parade,” according to the event’s Facebook description.

9:50 a.m.: Russia has recorded 6,791 new cases in the past day.

The national coronavirus task force said Sunday that the total number of cases rose to 634,437.

It said 104 people died of the virus over the past day, bringing the total dead to 9.073.

Russia has the third-highest coronavirus infection case count in the world. But it has reported far fewer deaths than many countries with smaller infection case counts, leading to speculation that figures are manipulated which Russian officials vehemently deny.

8:53 a.m.: The Taiwanese capital held its annual LGBT pride parade on Sunday, making it one of the few places in the world to proceed with such an event in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.

The parade in Taipei has drawn tens of thousands of people in the past, but participant numbers Sunday were reduced by both virus concerns and heavy rain.

Still, those who did take part said it was a testament both to Taiwan’s ability to contain the pandemic and its commitment to rights for people of all sexual orientations.

Taiwan is the only place in Asia where same-sex marriage is legal, and its liberal political system has long promoted human rights, free speech and freedom of assembly.

7:32 a.m.: When Toronto Public Health released its map of neighbourhoods hardest hit by COVID-19, for people in the city’s northwest it felt like déjà vu.

It looked strikingly similar to the map showing where chronic diseases like diabetes are highest. It mirrored a 2014 report highlighting Toronto neighbourhoods facing the biggest social and economic disadvantages. It might as well have been any number of maps showing some of the city’s highest concentrations of poverty in highrises or lowest post-secondary education.

7:30 a.m.: Confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed the 10-million mark worldwide.

A tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University registered the grim milestone Sunday, after India and Russia added thousands of new cases. The United States has confirmed more than 2.5 million infections, the most in the world.

Globally, the Hopkins tally has reported nearly 500,000 deaths.

While Hopkins reports only confirmed coronavirus cases, experts believe the true number of people who have been infected could be as much as 10 times that figure, given that so many people can’t get tested or may have the virus without showing any symptoms.

4 a.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 4 a.m. on June 28, 2020:

There are 103,032 confirmed cases in Canada.

-Quebec: 55,079 confirmed (including 5,448 deaths, 23,786 resolved)

Saturday 5 p.m.: Ontario’s regional public health units are reporting a total of 36,468 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 as of 5 p.m. Saturday, including 2,701 deaths, up by a total of 163 new cases since Friday evening.

As has been the case in recent days, the growth was concentrated in a handful of health units; only Toronto (62 cases), Peel Region (59) and Windsor-Essex (20) reported new infections in the double digits.

Meanwhile, Toronto was responsible for all nine fatal cases reported Saturday. The daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply in the province since peaking in early May, when the health units reported as many as 94 in a single day.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported that 252 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 54 in intensive care of whom 35 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,652 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Graphics Nathan Pilla', 'Andres Plana', 'Cameron Tulk']",2020-06-28,"When Toronto Public Health released its map of neighbourhoods hardest hit by COVID-19, for people in the city’s northwest it felt like déjà vu.

It looked strikingly similar to the map showing where chronic diseases like diabetes are highest. It mirrored a 2014 report highlighting Toronto neighbourhoods facing the biggest social and economic disadvantages. It might as well have been any number of maps showing some of the city’s highest concentrations of poverty in highrises or lowest post-secondary education.

Every time, the same northwest neighbourhoods pop out — a cluster of communities spanning a large swath of Toronto, wedged between Dufferin St. and Highway 427 to the west, running south from Steeles Ave. to Eglinton Ave.

So when the COVID-19 neighbourhood map came out, “I was definitely not surprised,” said Tesfai Mengesha, head of Success Beyond Limits, a community group in the Jane-Finch area. “Yet again, our system has failed people from our community.”

“COVID-19 is just another thing, another issue, that highlights the challenge that our communities face,” said Floydeen Charles-Fridal, executive director of Caribbean African Canadian Social Services, a not-for-profit in the neighbourhood.

“It’s just a really heartbreaking truth,” said Leticia Deawuo, the executive director of Black Creek Community Farm.

The COVID-19 rates are more than 10 times higher in some of these neighbourhoods than in the least-affected areas, which are wealthier and more central. The neighbourhood with the most cases, Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown, has nearly 400 cases, while the Beaches has just 11. (The Star’s analysis looked at sporadic cases, which do not include institutional outbreaks and better reflects patterns within the community at large.)

Researchers and public health officials are still collecting and analyzing data to better understand who is being most affected by the pandemic and why — and why the northwest corner is so vastly overburdened by COVID, even compared to other areas of the city with similar socioeconomic profiles.

Testing rates may be playing a role. The northwest corner has had some of the highest testing per capita in the city, though much of that volume could be tied to two massive outbreaks at long-term-care facilities where the military was called in.

Parts of Scarborough with similar demographic profiles have some of the lowest testing rates in Toronto, and could prove to be hot spots as access to testing improves.

“The fascinating thing about COVID-19 is that it has actually really laid bare where the health inequities are in the city, in a way that frankly all the reports that we have done over the years just haven’t done as effectively,” said Toronto’s medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, in an interview.

On Wednesday, Toronto Public Health announced a proposal to provide alternative accommodations for residents struggling to self-isolate in cramped, unsuitable housing, which de Villa and Councillor Joe Cressy said would help gird vulnerable communities against the pandemic.

Community advocates say officials should have acted faster on the mountain of evidence already available that suggested neighbourhoods like these would be the most vulnerable to COVID, as they had been to many other health risks. They fear the pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on the Black community and is yet another spotlight on the pernicious effects of systemic racism: the city’s northwest neighbourhoods also have the city’s largest proportion of Black residents.

De Villa suggested that many of the approaches to address the deep roots of these systemic inequities were beyond the control of her department. Cressy, who is chair of the Toronto board of health, acknowledged that the city, the province and Ottawa all bear some blame.

“All levels of government have a responsibility for the continued health inequities that have long plagued certain neighbourhoods,” he said, “and all levels of government have failed to do enough. And COVID has made that painfully visible for everyone to see.”

Toronto Public Health says it is investigating why neighbourhoods in the northwest have been disproportionately burdened by COVID.

The Star examined datasets and research and interviewed more than 40 residents, advocates, health workers, experts and officials to try to understand more. As some warn of a second wave, our findings offer clues about how the virus infiltrated the city’s hardest-hit corner, and how to protect at-risk neighbourhoods in the weeks and months ahead.

THE WORKPLACE

For months, the mantra from public health authorities has been: “stay home.” But which communities have had the luxury of heeding this advice, wonders Deawuo from Black Creek Community Farm — and which ones haven’t?

“Working from home is for who?” she asks. “Who gets the opportunity to do that work from home, or even who has the capacity?”

In the city’s northwest, the answer has been “not many,” according to census data and community advocates. At Delta Family Resource Centre, which has three locations in northwest neighbourhoods, many clients are new immigrants, refugees or those without legal status — people who might “live on the edge at the best of times,” said executive director Kemi Jacobs.

“The people we serve; if they have a job, they don’t have the luxury of not going out. They’re the personal support workers, they’re the people working in grocery stores as cashiers,” she said. “They’re the most poorly fed and the most vulnerable.”

To better understand employment risk in these communities, the Star analyzed custom workplace data provided by Statistics Canada for the 16 neighbourhoods with the highest COVID rates in Toronto — all of which are clustered in the city’s northwest corner.

In each of these 16 neighbourhoods, 26 to 32 per cent of residents work in “sales and services,” especially in a subcategory that includes cashiers and shelf stockers. Out of the city’s 140 neighbourhoods, the five with the largest proportion of cashiers are all in the northwest corner — and all are in the top 10 neighbourhoods with the highest rates of COVID.

When looking at industry data, the manufacturing sector is also a standout; many of the neighbourhoods with the highest COVID rates also have the biggest proportions of residents working in this sector.

In the 16 neighbourhoods hardest hit by COVID, between 11 and 25 per cent of residents work in manufacturing; by comparison, the city average is 8 per cent.

The manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on lower-income workers and temp agency workers, many of whom live in the city’s northwest. And during the pandemic, while the rest of the city has locked down, factories, like food processing plants, have revved up.

At one north Etobicoke plant in the food services industry, there have been at least a dozen workers infected by COVID, according to documents obtained by the Star and a production line worker, who asked not to be named because of concerns over his job.

According to the worker, the plant has been operating at a frenetic pace since the pandemic began; half of the workers on his shifts are new faces that have been recently brought in. But despite the growing number of worker infections, he said his plant has yet to cancel any shifts, shutting down only a couple of times for two or three hours so the premises could be cleaned.

“People were crying in the break room,” the worker said. The virus “went pretty quick through the plant.”

At Rexdale Community Health Centre, nurse practitioner Almut Brenne-Davies has also heard alarming stories. She recalled one woman she saw who worked in a factory and was unexpectedly told by her bosses to go on break along with half of her co-workers, because inspectors were about to come in.

This was “so that they got the impression they were social distancing,” Brenne-Davies said. “And then they had an outbreak.”

While they are not captured in Statistics Canada data, vulnerable temp agency workers are common in the city’s northwest, according to to Farid Partovi, a community development worker with the Jane/Finch Community and Family Centre. A report released last year by Jane Finch Action Against Poverty noted there are as many as 100 temp agencies in the area.

While TTC ridership has plummeted during the pandemic, some of the city’s most crowded bus lines have been in the city’s northwest. Many workers commute to industrial jobs in the 905 region, Partovi said. According to Statistics Canada data, the neighbourhoods with the city’s highest COVID rates all have either Vaughan or Mississauga as one of their top three work locations.

The public health units in York and Peel both started identifying a rise in workplace outbreaks in their regions early on. York has reported 475 workplace clusters, Peel has investigated 17. In both health regions, a significant proportion of those outbreaks have occurred in manufacturing and food processing plants.

Toronto Public Health did not release numbers on workplace outbreaks, stating it is still “developing a process for posting COVID-19 workplace clusters on our website.”

HOUSING

When Deawuo, who lives at Jane and Sheppard, discovered that her neighbourhood is among those hardest hit by COVID-19, she thought about a distressing chain of events that she imagined playing out all around her — front-line workers becoming infected and “going back home into their communities, and taking the virus with them.”

“It’s a bit scary to think about, and trying to just figure out how we can keep each other safe and make it through this pandemic,” said Deawuo, a single mom to two children, 17 and 8.

Residents, community advocates and experts say that the overcrowding and poor housing conditions that have long plagued these neighbourhoods could be playing a role in virus transmission.

De Villa told the Star that “close contact within the household is a major risk factor,” and that public health officials are investigating cases to find out more about how this is playing into transmission in parts of the city hard-hit by COVID-19. Toronto Public Health has also started collecting individual-level data on household size to better understand this phenomenon.

Space is key to stopping the spread of COVID-19. Public health officials urge people on the street and in the grocery store to stay at least two metres apart. At home, those infected with COVID-19 are told to self-isolate, away from family, in a separate room, and to use a separate bathroom.

Quarantine is a “luxury good,” say experts like Jim Dunn, chair of the department of health, aging and society at McMaster University.

“You just have to go up to Jane and Finch, and Jane and Sheppard, and see the buildings, see the housing units that make it impossible virtually for people to practise physical distancing,” said Charles-Fridal.

Cramped living has long been endemic in the aging towers in the city’s low-income neighbourhoods, including the northwest corner.

In Toronto, roughly 12 per cent of homes don’t have enough bedrooms to accommodate the size and makeup of the households living there, according to 2016 census data. This metric is dubbed “housing suitability.” It’s a good way to measure crowding — and quantify risk during the pandemic.

In Mount Olive, which has been hardest hit by the virus, 30 per cent of homes are classified as unsuitable. Other neighbourhoods in the northwest corner with a disproportionate COVID-19 burden also fare poorly on this measure, including Black Creek (26 per cent), Glenfield-Jane Heights (23 per cent) and Kingsview Village-The Westway (20 per cent).

While the need to set up COVID recovery centres for individuals experiencing homelessness is “blatantly obvious,” this is also a concern for those who are living in crowded conditions, or in multi-generational households, and can’t self-isolate safely, said Dr. Stephen Hwang, director of the MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions at St. Michael’s Hospital.

Councillor Cressy said work has been underway for roughly six weeks on a plan to offer free hotel rooms to people without enough space to self-isolate at home — a first in Canada, he said.

“This work is all urgent,” he said. “And being the first country to implement such a program doesn’t mean you get a pat on the back. It means it’s a good thing, now do more,” he said.

Toronto Public Health said it has not declared an outbreak in any apartment building setting. But COVID-19 has heightened the anxiety of some residents, who fear unmet maintenance concerns and cleanliness issues could put them at risk.

Angie Toussaint, 65, who lives on the 23rd floor of a highrise near Jane and Finch, said she is “trying to stay safe.” But her building has not provided hand sanitizer in common areas, she said, despite guidelines issued by the city. Those guidelines also urged landlords to regularly clean common areas and shared surfaces.

Toussaint, who is co-chair of the York West chapter of ACORN Canada, which advocates for low- and moderate-income families, also complained that broken elevators in the building were causing overcrowding — “a pile of people downstairs in the lobby.”

At the urging of ACORN and the Federation of Metro Tenants’ Associations, whose members have reported that more than half of landlords are not following the guidelines, Councillor Josh Matlow will bring forward a motion on June 29 to make these rules mandatory.

“While we’re in the midst of a public health emergency, why on earth, even out of an abundance of caution, would we not tell landlords that we expect some basics?” Matlow said.

HEALTH CARE

Even before the pandemic hit, the corrosive effects of poverty and other systemic ills had already degraded the health of these communities. The maps of many chronic conditions in Toronto — hospitalizations from cardiovascular disease, diabetes rates — look like a doughnut, with a healthy, wealthy core and a ring of sicker communities surrounding it.

“We can’t talk about COVID until we talk about what historically we’ve been seeing in this community with regards to access to health care,” said Michelle Westin, senior analyst for planning, quality and risk at Black Creek Community Health Centre.

Food insecurity, lack of affordable and safe housing, high rates of unemployment — these already had “a huge impact” on the overall health of the community, she said.

And when people in the northwest corner of Toronto do get sick, they are less likely to have a family doctor to turn to. This corner of the city has historically been a “primary care desert,” experts say.

When Ontario researchers examined the geography of primary care gaps in the province, they found that areas of the province with the highest needs were getting the lowest levels of care. In Toronto, those areas clustered in the city’s northwest corner and in south Scarborough.

“You’ve got a lot of poverty of opportunities and of services, and some of (that) is lack of health care,” said Dr. Rick Glazier, a senior scientist at ICES and the lead author of the 2018 report.

Access to a family physician has been vital in the pandemic, Glazier noted — especially in the early months when it was difficult to get tested. Primary care doctors and nurses were crucial in providing advice on how to get tested, how to self-isolate, or when go to the emergency department.

The northwest has strong Community Health Centres, which offer a unique model of care and have deep roots in these neighbourhoods. CHCs like Rexdale and Black Creek are mandated to address the health of the community and the social determinants of health, and serve anyone who needs care, even if they are uninsured.

“I can’t say enough wonderful things about them,” said Glazier, a family doctor himself. But he added that they cover a small proportion of the population, and underserviced areas need more.

At the Rexdale Community Health Centre earlier this month, staff noted there were just a few CHCs covering a huge geographic area.

“What are the resources? Look at it — let’s break it down and see where all the resources are,” said Linda Akuamoah-Boateng, a diabetes educator.

“Even north and south Etobicoke — it’s like moving from one world to another.”

In Rexdale, the health centre’s pandemic-related concerns expand far beyond the virus. Their list of food-insecure clients grew from about 50 in late March to over 900 in early June, and was still rising. Mental health impacts have become a grave concern.

But their virus-related issues are also unique compared to wealthier, better-resourced areas. Though this region of the city has high testing rates overall, staff suggested their clients had trouble accessing assessment centres: not everybody drives or owns a car, and travelling by TTC while symptomatic is strongly discouraged.

In Thorncliffe Park, a neighbourhood on the other side of the city with similarly high rates of newcomers, low-income residents, and unsuitable housing, a partnership between health-care providers is breaking down similar barriers to testing.

At Michael Garron Hospital, which operates the closest assessment centre, doctors noticed high test-positivity rates from certain areas in the community. Infectious disease doctor Jeff Powis said the hospital’s close relationship with other, community-driven health partners was key to establishing a response.

“I was able to lean on my colleagues who are already integrated in the community, and already know the subtleties of the connections in the community … luckily, I was able to work with them and hand that piece over.”

Those partners — Health Access Thorncliffe Park and the East Toronto Family Practice Network — worked with the hospital to set up a low-barrier pop-up testing site in a currently vacant community centre, near some of the residential areas with the highest test-positive rates.

Two “community ambassadors” are always present, helping to take information and guide patients. Information handouts are available in multiple languages. Community workers spread the word of the site’s opening through WhatsApp, and when they didn’t see the diversity at the test site they knew to expect, redoubled their efforts. Masks, hand-sewn by volunteers, are piled in boxes and available for giveaway.

In the northwest, no mobile testing that is available to the community has materialized, even though they are the hardest hit by COVID-19.

The Star asked the nearest hospitals operating assessment centres about mobile testing in these communities; they redirected inquiries to public health. City officials suggested that planning for mobile testing, however, was the responsibility of the province’s Local Health Integration Networks, who either didn’t respond or directed the Star back to public health.

De Villa said mobile testing in these neighbourhoods has been “the subject certainly of conversation and soon to be action, I would like to think.” But she reiterated that while Toronto Public Health is a partner in testing efforts, “we are not the testers,” and added that mass testing in harder-hit communities may stigmatize them.

But several community agencies and health centres said they wanted mobile testing in the area.

“We know people face barriers getting to testing sites,” said Cheryl Prescod, executive director of the Black Creek Community Health Centre. “Mobile testing in our community would be incredibly beneficial — going out to community spaces, apartment buildings, places of worship — will help us reach the people we know need testing the most.”

While the various levels of government sort out a response, local organizations continue to work furiously to protect their communities, as they have since the beginning of the pandemic.

“Residents and agencies are really mobilizing,” said Ruth Crammond of United Way Greater Toronto, which has been working with a cluster of community organizations in the northwest corner that have been responding to the pandemic. “It’s not that people are just sitting back and waiting for someone to save them.”

But the northwest neighbourhoods also need what more privileged Toronto communities already have.

“We do need resources to make these changes happen,” said Butterfly Sabrina GoPaul, a community health worker who lives at Jane and Finch. “But the systemic reality is so deep that it’s not going to happen with, you know, pixie dust and curry powder.

“We need to really break down what’s been broken and stop trying to repair and create Band-Aid solutions. Because it’s not working for communities like ours.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Isabella Grullón Pazthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-06-27,"Transgender women of colour led the uprising at New York City’s Stonewall Inn 51 years ago Sunday, but they were never put at the centre of the movement they helped start: one whose very shorthand, “the gay rights movement,” erases them.

Although active in the Black Lives Matter movement from the beginning, they have not been prioritized there, either. At no point have Black trans people shared fully in the gains of racial justice or LGBTQ+ activism, despite suffering disproportionately from the racism, homophobia and transphobia these movements exist to combat.

But now, as the two movements are pulled together by extraordinary circumstances — the protests sparked by the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery; the killings of two Black trans women, Dominique Fells and Riah Milton, shortly after a Black trans man, Tony McDade, was killed by police; a pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of colour; an economic crisis that has disproportionately affected trans people; and a Supreme Court decision protecting gay and trans people from employment discrimination, all coming to a head during Pride month — Black trans people are mobilizing more visibly than ever before.

This moment, advocates say, is long overdue, and they are determined not to let it slip away.

For decades, the idea that “we were all minorities was enough for people to just say, ‘OK, that’s what we have in common, so if I win, that means you automatically are winning, too,’” said Peppermint, a Black trans activist who co-hosted the Black Queer Town Hall, a three-night series of virtual performances and discussions, this month. “I think that the notion of intersectionality is becoming more readily available for people to understand that a win for one group or one identity doesn’t necessarily equal an automatic win for the other.”

While LGBTQ+ people have secured many legal rights and protections, Black transgender women are still killed so often that the American Medical Association has declared it an epidemic. Last year, 91 per cent of the transgender or gender-non-conforming people who were fatally shot were Black women, according to the Human Rights Campaign. This year, at least 16 trans people have been killed — almost certainly an underestimate because many cases go unreported and many victims are misgendered.

“So much money and resources and energy has been put into legislative fights or judicial fights, which is important — those wins are important,” activist Raquel Willis said. “But as a Black trans woman, I often have to grapple with the question of, what do any of these protections mean if I am dead, if I am still at risk of literally being killed?”

Violence against transgender people increased after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated, advocacy groups found in 2017, and Trump has singled out trans people in his policies since the beginning of his presidency.

His administration reversed Barack Obama-era protections for transgender students, reimposed a ban on trans people serving in the military and, just this month, erased rules protecting them from discrimination in health care. It also sought to define gender as an immutable trait assigned at birth — an effort that would, essentially, define trans people out of legal existence.

“The attacks on the trans community are at every level, and it’s coming from the highest office in this country, and it has from Day 1,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD. “I think that Black trans people and trans people of colour are mobilizing and using this platform and this moment because you can’t have Black lives matter without having Black trans lives matter.”

Nala Toussaint, founder of Reuniting of African Descendants, a grassroots healing initiative for LGBTQ+ people of African descent, said the trans community had always taken care of its own by “making sure that we have food in our stomachs, making sure that our folks have housing, making sure that there’s lights and building utilities running.”

What is new is the national visibility of Black trans people as movement leaders and the prominence of their structural demands.

Calls to redistribute police funding to education and public housing could benefit Black transgender people, who, because of widespread transphobia, have some of the highest rates of homelessness and unemployment in the country. More than one in four transgender people have lost a job because of bias, and more than three-fourths have experienced workplace discrimination, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).

The idea of defunding the police is also tied to efforts to change the criminal justice system more broadly: Peppermint noted, for instance, that decriminalizing sex work could reduce interactions between officers and trans people, especially Black trans women, which can be traumatic or even deadly.

A report from the NCTE found that 22 per cent of transgender people who interacted with police reported harassment. For Black trans people, and especially sex workers, the number was higher.

Black trans activists are also calling for the redistribution of resources within mainstream LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations that have usually been led by white, cisgender people.

National non-profits with strong funding “need to get serious about reallocating resources to Black- and Brown-led grassroots initiatives,” Willis said, “and they need to really reorient themselves around who they consider to be a leader.”

Historically, mainstream LGBTQ+ rights groups have focused more on white gay people and lesbians than on trans people or people of colour. While that has begun to change, there remains a well of mistrust and a conviction that effective advocacy will need to be led by Black trans people.

“They don’t know the first thing about what it is to live a life like we have, and they have no comprehension as to what it is we suffer and go through,” said Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, one of the last surviving leaders of the Stonewall uprising. “So I myself do not participate in groups that are led by white people, because they just don’t understand.”

That lack of understanding is part of what advocates are trying to address.

Beresford, 23, grew up in a conservative Michigan town and described a slow process of coming to understand that he was bisexual, to acknowledge that within himself, and finally to take pride in it.

“For me, it has been scary to accept myself,” he said. “I thought this year could be the year that I go and show myself, and everyone else, who I am. But, just like countless other things, that will have to wait.”

Pride marches and events have been cancelled or postponed throughout the country this year because of the coronavirus, and many people like Beresford in the LGBTQ community are missing out on an important moment of visibility and acceptance: their first Pride.

The Pride celebrations are not alone in being called off, but few other events are as much about being seen — by everyone.

“It’s something that’s so central to our identities as LGBTQ folks,” said Fred Lopez, executive director of San Francisco Pride. “To remember that time when we were able to walk hand in hand with a boyfriend or a crush, even amongst hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, is really inspiring.”

In place of the marches, parades and parties that have defined Pride in the United States, there will be small gatherings as cities begin to reopen, along with virtual celebrations. World leaders, human rights activists, musicians and drag queens participated in a 24-hour celebration streamed on YouTube and the Global Pride website that started Saturday.

But the importance of Pride as a public event that transforms city streets was underscored by readers who responded to the New York Times when asked what the loss of the large gatherings meant to them.

Susanna Yudkin said she had been to Pride marches in the past as an “ally” but last year went for the first time as an openly queer woman.

“Attending Denver Pride with my pride of fellow queer lionesses was nothing short of exhilarating,” she said, describing a new-found sense of belonging, as well as deep gratitude to those who came before her to make moments of open celebration possible.

Gregory Antollino said he still remembered what his first Pride, at the age of 23 in 1988, meant to him. He had just moved to New York City, had not yet connected with the gay community and unknowingly stumbled into a Pride parade.

“I made it a holiday,” he said. “Pride was joyous.”

He has since attended Pride in London, Lisbon and Amsterdam, and he said each experience was as “magical as those in my first years in New York.”

Neil Wu-Gibbs said his first Pride in 2013, when he marched with the Gay Asian & Pacific Islander Men of New York, gave him “a sense of belonging” that helped him decide to move back from Britain to New York City.

“It was like a homecoming,” he said.

Although most Pride events were cancelled in the spring over fears of large crowds spreading the coronavirus, mass gatherings have returned since Memorial Day in the form of protests in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, Layleen Polanco and many others.

At many of the demonstrations, people have waved the rainbow LGBTQ flag to honour Pride month, a reminder that the first Pride march 50 years ago was itself rooted in protest and followed the uprising against police brutality at the Stonewall Inn a year before.

And this month in Brooklyn, N.Y., more than 15,000 people — wearing all white — rallied for a Black Trans Lives Matter demonstration, bringing attention to disproportionately high rates at which Black trans people are killed and incarcerated, and highlighting the point that they do not always feel fully included in the Black Lives Matter movement.

For many in the LGBTQ community, proclaiming their identities is not an easy undertaking. Many choose to come out in a public way, others share who they are only with close family members and friends, and some never openly identify themselves as gay.

By her own account, it has taken Jennifer Depew, 23, a long time to accept herself as bisexual. She came out this month, she said, first to a friend and then to her family.

“I was looking forward to being able to celebrate Pride this year as someone fully comfortable with my identity, fully a member of the community,” Depew said. “To lose out on that opportunity this year is a true disappointment, another melancholic note of 2020.”

In countries where same-sex relationships are criminalized or homophobia is endorsed by the state, coming out publicly or celebrating Pride can come with grave risks.

Poet and essayist Chibuihe Obi Achimba, 27, grew up in a small village in southeastern Nigeria and for a long time struggled with being open about his sexuality.

In 2017, he wrote an essay titled “We’re Here, We’re Queer,” in which he detailed his experience with homophobia, spoke out against Nigeria’s laws that criminalize same-sex relationships, and described his longing to find positive LGBTQ presentation in Nigerian literature.

After the essay was published, Achimba said, he became the target of abuse and physical violence. He left Nigeria and came to the United States in 2019 as a fellow in the Harvard University Scholars at Risk program.

So 2020 looked like the year he had been waiting for all his adult life, and he was eager to join Pride, calling it “this global celebration of resistance, love, freedom, happiness and hope.”

“I planned to enact my own deliverance from the chokehold of my country’s state-sanctioned oppression and the sharp cudgels of my countrymen’s homophobia at this year’s Pride,” he said. “But now, we need to wade through the murky waters the coronavirus has stirred up.”

“It feels like a personal loss,” he added.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Note To Readers', 'This Is A Corrected Story. A Previous Version Mistakenly Said Seasonal Residents Were Allowed To Arrive Starting June', 'Teresa Wrightthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-06-27,"CHARLOTTETOWN—Canada’s smallest province, which once branded itself the “gentle island,” is seeing some not-so-gentle attitudes emerging toward people perceived to be from other provinces — a phenomenon Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King says is likely driven by COVID-19 fears.

The province has been closed to all non-essential travellers since April 17 and only began allowing seasonal residents from within Canada to submit applications to travel there on June 1.

These travel restrictions have been lauded as being key to keeping the virus contained to only 27 cases in total since the pandemic began — now all recovered — with no hospitalizations, no deaths and no community spread of the disease.

But with cottage owners now arriving on the Island, several people with out-of-province licence plates have had their cars vandalized, have been confronted or have had nasty notes left for them in incidents known locally as “plate shaming.”

Miriam Leslie, a local pastor, is leasing a car with Nova Scotia licence plates and discovered a note left on her windshield earlier this month that said, “Go the (expletive) back to the mainland.”

In place of a signature, the author signed it from “all of P.E.I.”

“When we found the note after a visit to a beautiful park, it definitely was disappointing,” Leslie said Saturday.

Leslie has now placed a sign in her front and back windows indicating she is an Island resident, which she believes has helped avoid further conflicts.

Other similar incidents have been reported on social media in recent weeks. Jordan Bujold, a student at the Atlantic Veterinary College in Charlottetown, published a photo of her car on Facebook last week showing a large note in the window saying, “AVC student. Been here since January. Please don’t damage my car again!”

In an accompanying note, she says her car with New Brunswick licence plates had been keyed and that the same thing had happened to a woman she’d been speaking with who has Ontario plates.

Others with out-of-town licence plates have reported being challenged in parking lots of grocery and retail stores by residents who quiz them on their travel history.

These incidents come on the heels of weeks of heated debate among locals about the province’s decision to allow seasonal residents to come to their cottages from provinces with active cases of the novel coronavirus.

This debate has even spilled into the provincial legislature, with the Opposition and Green party leader Peter Bevan-Baker blaming Islanders’ uncharacteristic hostility toward outsiders on the King government for what he believes has been inconsistent messaging.

King acknowledges the province’s initial four-phase plan to gradually lift restrictions has been more accelerated, but he maintains all decisions to ease restrictions have been made in consultation with the province’s chief public health office.

“From the beginning of this, we realized that we had to evolve and adapt every day on a lot of the decisions that we’ve been making,” he said in an interview Saturday.

“I certainly feel confident in the process that we put together from the position that everything has been based on the best data and science and the best public health information.”

He characterized the anti-outsider sentiment as “isolated incidents” and believes they were sparked by fear of the unknown triggered by a concerning resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some American states.

“My own belief is that many people in our province and beyond have been watching events as they transpire around the world and maybe transporting that back here,” he said.

“For example if you see what’s taking place in Florida, it’s vastly different than what takes place here, so I think that’s a big part of it.”

Next week, starting July 3, travel and self-isolation restrictions for people within the four Atlantic Provinces will be lifted, thanks to an “Atlantic bubble” announced by the four Atlantic premiers this week.

King says he hopes Atlantic tourists will remember how hospitable P.E.I. has always been in the past and not see these recent negative incidents as a disincentive to come to the Island.

“Certainly it is my great hope that we will roll out the welcome mat for those who are visiting P.E.I.,” King said.

“The experience, if it is a little bit different because of COVID, I certainly hope it won’t be any different from a hospitality situation.”

Leslie echoed this, noting that P.E.I.’s economy relies heavily on the tourism industry, which has been devastated by the pandemic’s travel restrictions to date.

“These are anxious times for everyone. My hope is people will feel welcomed as visitors from off- Island,” she said.

“If only we had not become afraid of each other during these months, perhaps people could feel more at ease.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kelly Geraldine Malonethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Kelly Geraldine Malonethe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-06-27,"WINNIPEG—The Manitoba Métis Federation’s president says the province has left vulnerable foster children out of pandemic response plans.

“When this pandemic came into play the province did not give us one penny more, knowing full well the complications we are going to face as an agency,” David Chartrand said.

“Not one ... penny was issued to us to help us during this time of COVID.”

Chartrand said Métis Child and Family Services is facing multiple hurdles caused by the pandemic to ensure safety of more than 1,200 children. But the province’s block funding model will inevitably force agencies to cut programs or fall into a deficit, he said.

The province changed to “single envelope” funding, also known as block funding, last year. Manitoba provides finances up front to child-welfare authorities based on a three-year agreement. The previous system based funding on the number of children in care and the number of days they were in care.

Many agencies voiced their concerns about the switch saying the funding levels were based on a year when there were less children in care and the new model would not cover current needs, let alone fund preventive services.

There was no increase in funding for child and family services authorities in the Manitoba’s 2020 budget released in March. There are about 10,000 children in care in Manitoba. About 90 per cent are Indigenous.

When asked about additional funding, Families Minister Heather Stefanson said the government is working with agencies.

“We are assessing what some of the challenges are with respect to COVID and will continue to do that throughout,” she said, adding personal protective equipment was provided.

The Families department said in an email that the move to single envelope funding means that authorities and agencies are responsible for managing and overseeing expenditures based on the needs of the families they serve. However, the department recognizes that the pandemic is creating new challenges, and is monitoring for financial implications.

Chartrand said the bills are adding up and falling to agencies that are already financially strapped. He said the Métis federation itself gave $400,000 to its agency to help cover costs during the pandemic.

Chartrand said the agency needed to get kids tablets so they could do school work. It needed to find ways to have employees work from home and come up with creative ways to keep children in contact with family. When schools and camps were closed that put even more pressure on agencies and their staff.

A letter sent to foster families from Southeast Child and Family Services last month provided to The Canadian Press by the Manitoba NDP said the agency was being forced to reduce its respite pay. Respite pay gives caregivers a short-term break from the unique demands of caring for a child with disabilities.

The letter said the agency was “forced to make changes” due to provincial funding cuts and the deficit incurred as a result.

A pandemic is “perhaps the worst time to freeze funding for children, especially those in the CFS system,” said Amanda Lathlin, the NDP critic for child and family services.

“Agencies need the provincial government to lift funding freezes, stop cuts to supports and actually increase funding so that kids in care are safe and have the supports they need to be successful.”

Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth Daphne Penrose said her office has received concerns about block funding both before and during the pandemic. Penrose said young people are also struggling to access mental health and addictions services.

“With the provincial government moving so quickly on pressing issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, I hope implementing child-centred services is at the top of their agenda.”

Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-27,"While parades and parties have become the fixtures of Pride, this year the LGBTQ2+ communities devised their own plans to stay connected. From throwing a mini prom to writing a star-studded “Queerantine” talk show, here’s what some of them did to celebrate and create change from home during June’s Pride Month.

Shawnee is a Mohawk, two-spirit singer and songwriter originally from Welland, who moved to Toronto to pursue her music career before arriving in Edmonton late last year. She is this year’s winner of Searchlight, CBC’s annual competition on the country’s best emerging musical acts. Her new song, “Don’t Go,” was released earlier this month.

“Everything was turned upside down when COVID-19 first started and I was well into booking a tour. There was also the Searchlight win, so there was excitement for seven days until I got an email that the CBC Music Festival would be cancelled in Toronto. I travel a lot during Pride and it’s my busiest time. I was in New York for world pride then Ottawa for Canada Day last year. But to be honest, I’ve been busy celebrating Pride and Indigenous month, celebrating my people, and connecting and empowering with two-spirited youth who need to know they’re important and loved. I also got engaged two-and-a-half months ago (to retired Canadian rugby Olympian Jen Kish). We were just sitting around and spending so much time together and finding such a deeper love and connection, she just surprised me with the question.

I’ve been taking part in live streams, performing online and using the opportunity to talk about who I am and how far I’ve come. I did a performance for Saskatoon Pride and Two Spirit Pride. There’s also the ‘We’re Funny That Way’ virtual Pride special on CBC Gem. It is more difficult performing with technology sitting in front of you and you’re in front of a little tiny camera, but I keep focus and remind myself there are people who need music on the other end of that. I feel like Pride month is going to extend past June, as it should.

My new song is different from anything I’ve released, but it’s something you can just bop your head to when you’re driving with the windows down. There’s so much change happening, and you also have to feel the joy to have that balance to keep you on your journey. I just thought it was a really good time, and it’s about me speaking to another woman, which I’ve never done in my songs, and to release it during Indigenous and Pride months, it’s a good time to just enjoy it.”

Polly Perry is the founder of Polly Perry Events, an event planning company specializing in creating safe spaces for the LGBTQ2+ POC community for more than 20 years.

“As someone who creates social spaces for a community that can feel generally isolated at times, the current pandemic and cancellation of public gatherings has definitely offered an extra layer for 2020. It’s been very challenging for the people who look forward to these events on a yearly basis. For me, I had four or five events that I have had to cancel. I chose not to pivot to online because the bulk of my demographic is 35 to 45 (years old), and they tend to like the physicality of things. They prepare months in advance and like to dress up and they won’t do all that to come online.

The current civil rights movement is well overdue and exciting. I see where I can use my skills and my business to foster change and growth opportunities for the Black community by creating networking events and workshops around topics like starting small businesses, real estate, career development, investing and creating generational wealth. I get questions from young people about the above subjects all the time. These events I can present online.

I also want to connect people, especially in the Black queer community, with like-minded people who have excelled in these areas and can serve as mentors and support systems. These are some of the areas that we need in order to prepare the next generation, build and strengthen our community.

As for me, I have been watching a lot of what’s going on and it’s great that Pride is having all this online programming. There are usually so many events on different days and now I have the opportunity to go to all of them or go back and rewatch the ones I’ve missed. As an event producer, it definitely allows me to stay in the loop and watch that new DJ or artist, for example.”

This week, writer and producer Neila Karassik released the final episode of #HumpdayWithHampshire, a quarantine-themed online talk show hosted by her writing partner, Emily Hampshire (Stevie Budd on Schitt’s Creek).

“I came out as trans two years ago but I’ve always been apprehensive about the corporatization of Pride, and I find that at actual Pride, I almost feel like a minority, as my straight friends would talk about getting dressed up. It just seems like Disneyland. But I do like going to the Trans March, which still has the grassroots of Pride being a protest. I always liked the tone of it. But this year, everything went virtual and I got to work on a show with my writing partner Emily, and it raised money for the Actors Fund, which goes to those working in the entertainment industry and not just actors.

In mid-June we did a Pride episode to shine a light on intersectionality and evolving language with Laverne Cox, as well as raise money for the Black Lives Matter and Black Trans Lives Matter organizations.

We kind of threw this virtual party. We also had Margaret Cho; ‘Canada’s Drag Race’ judge Brooke Lynn Hytes; GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis; and Miles McKenna, a big trans YouTuber. We had this fun game of telling your coming-out story in 30 seconds. Coming out for me took 35 years, so it’s cathartic to be able to do it in 30 seconds now. We also did ‘Queerantine’ nicknames, just having fun with it. We got to celebrate Pride with all these crazy famous people.”

French immersion teacher Steve Massa started a YouTube channel three months ago called Monsieur Steve, which has dozens of videos covering subjects such as math, art and story time in French and English.

“There was a documentary short that CBC put out called ‘Take Me To Prom’ that asked queer people about their prom experiences. It was something I always thought about. My high school, like many others, wasn’t the most welcoming to the LGBTQ2+ community. I was out to my friends, but not completely free to be who I was. I went to prom with a girl and the whole time it was a letdown because I didn’t feel connected or a part of anything.

At home I had set up Pride decorations for my YouTube channel, so we did our own mock prom and just had some fun! We lit sparklers, pretended to put on corsages and now I can say I went to prom with my husband, Justin, and our cat, Puppy. For Pride, I lived for the Green Space Parties, especially Starry Night, and I loved seeing people that you only see in queer venues and positive spaces, so it’s hard not being able to see those faces this year. But Pride shouldn’t stop because we can’t have a party in the streets. Pride means being able to be who I am and wear that label proudly. I can do that speaking to my students, being at home, or taking prom photos with my husband. It doesn’t have to be a big commercial event; we made it a creative one.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Mike Blanchfieldthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Mike Blanchfieldthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-06-27,"OTTAWA—Canada contributed $300 million on Saturday towards the international fight against COVID-19, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined fellow leaders, activists and philanthropists in calling for a vaccine to be distributed to the world’s neediest people.

Trudeau announced the new funds in another virtual international fundraiser — this one sponsored by an organization, Global Citizen, that raised almost $9.5 billion in pledges.

“COVID-19 has changed the lives of people everywhere, and it has highlighted inequalities around the world,” Trudeau said. “None of us have been spared from the effects of COVID-19 and none of us can beat it alone.”

Canada’s contribution includes $180 million to address the immediate humanitarian and development impacts of the pandemic and $120 million toward a new initiative called the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.

The ACT Accelerator was created in April by the World Health Organization, the French government, the European Commission and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to ensure equitable access to medical treatments. It supports organizations, health professionals and businesses in their efforts to develop a vaccine, as well as drug therapies and diagnostic tools to battle the pandemic.

Trudeau said the pandemic has hit vulnerable populations especially hard and the ACT Accelerator will ensure that when a vaccine is found, it will be able to reach all the people who need it.

“We’re also committed to working with countries around the world on how we can pool procurement efforts to make sure all countries have access to the vaccine,” said Trudeau.

Sir Andrew Witty, the former chief executive of the British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, said a vaccine would normally take 10 to 15 years to develop, but the COVID-19 outbreak is forcing companies and universities to find one or more viable vaccines in one-tenth that time, or quicker.

Witty said the pandemic has forced unprecedented co-operation between “industrial partners, biotech companies, government, universities” to swiftly find new treatments as well as a vaccine.

“This is a really, really difficult thing to try and achieve. We’re all giving it our absolute best shot, but there are no guarantees,” Witty told the conference.

“No country can be an island in this situation. It’s not great to be the one country who’s safe if all of the people you trade with are still struggling because the trade is not going to be there.”

There has been widespread concern that American President Donald Trump might adopt a go-it-alone approach if a vaccine were discovered in the United States first.

However, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, offered an olive branch to the conference when she announced Washington’s new pledge of almost $750 million.

“Together we must work in an open, transparent and supportive manner to build a safer, more resilient world,” said Craft, who previously served as Trump’s envoy to Canada.

“We must be the true multilateralist in the best in sense of the word, working toward the common good.”

Julia Anderson, the chief operating officer of the Canadian Partnership for Women and Children’s Health, said the ACT Accelerator is the “robust mechanism” the world needs to co-ordinate the fight against the pandemic while supporting the existing health systems of vulnerable countries.

“It’s shaping up to be hopefully the one-stop shop,” Anderson said, adding that the ACT is very much a work in progress. “The plane is being built as it is being flown.”

Her group and two anti-poverty organizations — Results Canada and the One Campaign — say Canada should be devoting one per cent of its overall COVID-19 spending programs to international assistance.

They say that would require a boost of at least $1.5 billion to Canada’s foreign-aid budget, which stands at about $5 billion.

“Today’s pledge was significant but we’re still far from hitting that mark. But this is a marathon not a sprint, so we trust there’s more to come and (we) will keep pushing for Canadian leadership,” said Chris Dendys, the executive director of Results Canada.

The aid agencies and anti-poverty groups are crediting International Development Minister Karina Gould for being one of the strongest advocates they have seen for their sector around the federal cabinet table.

“We are happy to see Minister Gould pushing for more investment because more is desperately needed,” said Stuart Hickox, the Canadian director of the One Campaign.

Gould has repeatedly stressed that Canadians’ safety is linked to the success of stamping out COVID-19 abroad, and that there can be no rolling back of existing spending, or else there could be new flare-ups of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis, polio and malaria.

“What keeps me up at night is not just the immediate needs of the pandemic, but the collateral damage if we turn our attention away from our core activities,” Gould told The Canadian Press on Friday.

Global Citizen bills itself as the world’s largest anti-poverty advocacy group, and it organized Saturday’s pledging conference as well as a star-studded evening concert that is to be livestreamed across the world.

The total number of cases now stands at 34,476, which includes 2,652 deaths and 29,932 cases marked as resolved.

The number of people in intensive care and on a ventilator in hospital continued to drop, reaching its lowest level since the province started reporting the figure in April.

The Ministry of Health says it was able to complete more than 33,000 tests for the novel coronavirus the previous day.

The new cases come as the Ontario government extended its emergency orders for the COVID-19 pandemic until July 10.

Premier Doug Ford said the province has made good progress in reducing the spread of COVID-19, but Ontarians need to remain vigilant.

The province also said it will loosen some restrictions around indoor sports and fitness to enable amateur and professional athletes to train.

The announcement comes days after the government extended its state of emergency until July 15.

Ford has said he hopes this will be the last time Ontario has to extend its state of emergency.

The province will no longer be able to issue new emergency orders after a state of emergency ends, but it will be able to extend existing orders.

7:20 p.m.: The coronavirus is showing signs of spiking in Pennsylvania’s Lancaster County, known for its large Amish population. Positive tests increased by about 135 per cent from June 19 to June 25, compared to just 18 per cent statewide.

The extent of the spread among the 39,000 local Amish residents, however, is unclear. Amish families typically avoid using technology due to their faith, and have differing philosophies about modern medical care. Anecdotal evidence, though, indicates many Amish and Old Order Mennonites are not seeking testing for the coronavirus, said Edwin Hurston, the county’s COVID-19 public health emergency adviser.

The population could be at particular risk through church gatherings and because many households include older relatives.

6:15 p.m.: U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence called off campaign events in Florida and Arizona for this coming week as the states experience a surge in coronavirus cases. Pence still plans to travel to Texas, another state with a rising rate of infection, for a church-run Celebrate Freedom Rally in Dallas on Sunday before meeting with Gov. Greg Abbott.

5 p.m.: Ontario’s regional public health units are reporting a total of 36,468 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 as of 5 p.m. Saturday, including 2,701 deaths, up by a total of 163 new cases since Friday evening.

As has been the case in recent days, the growth was concentrated in a handful of health units; only Toronto (62 cases), Peel Region (59) and Windsor-Essex (20) reported new infections in the double digits.

Meanwhile, Toronto was responsible for all nine fatal cases reported Saturday. The daily rate of deaths has fallen sharply in the province since peaking in early May, when the health units reported as many as 94 in a single day.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported that 252 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 54 in intensive care of whom 35 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,652 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4:30 p.m.: Vancouver Coastal Health says anyone who visited Brandi’s Exotic Show Lounge from June 21 to 24 may have been exposed to the coronavirus. Health officials say a number of people who tested positive attended the strip club between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. on those dates.

4:01 p.m.: Canada contributed $300 million on Saturday towards the international fight against COVID-19, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined fellow leaders, activists and philanthropists in calling for a vaccine to be distributed to the world’s neediest people.

3:03 p.m.: Some Arizona hospitals have begun activating surge plans to increase their capacity to treat coronavirus patients as confirmed cases rise and more people seek treatment.

The Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday reported 3,591 additional confirmed cases, increasing the state’s total to 70,051. There have been 1,579 known deaths, including 44 reported Saturday.

Saturday’s increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases tied a record set Tuesday and was the sixth day over nine days in which the reported increase topped 3,000.

2:42 p.m.: The Brazilian government announced an agreement with Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to produce a promising coronavirus vaccine that is undergoing tests.

Brazilian Health Ministry authorities said in a press conference that the country will pay $127 million and receive material to produce 30.4 million doses in two batches in December and January, which would allow it to quickly start inoculation efforts if the vaccine is certified to be safe and effective.

1:30 p.m.: Canada’s smallest province, which once branded itself the “gentle island,” is seeing some not-so-gentle attitudes emerging toward people perceived to be from other provinces — a phenomenon Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King says is likely driven by COVID-19 fears.

The province has been closed to all non-essential travellers since April 17 and only began allowing seasonal residents to come from within Canada on June 1.

These travel restrictions have been lauded as being key to keeping the virus contained to only 27 cases in total since the pandemic began — now all recovered — with no hospitalizations, no deaths and no community spread of the disease.

But with cottage owners now arriving on the Island, several people with out-of-province license plates have had their cars vandalized or have had nasty notes left for them in incidents known locally as “plate shaming.”

1:03 p.m.: An Ethiopian Orthodox monk whose family says he is 114 years old has survived the coronavirus.

Tilahun Woldemichael was discharged from a hospital on Thursday after almost three weeks. He received oxygen and dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid that researchers in England have said reduced deaths by up to one third in severely ill hospitalized patients.

Ethiopia’s health minister has said the ministry recommends the emergency use of the drug for COVID-19 patients who require ventilation or oxygen.

12:50 p.m.: Florida has marked another one-day record in new COVID-19 cases Saturday as the state looks to curb the spread of the virus. The Florida Department of Health reported a total of 132,545 cases of the novel coronavirus, marking a jump of 9,585 in new infections.

In response, the state has suspended alcohol consumption at bars, and Miami-Dade announced that beaches would be closed and most parades and parties cancelled on the fourth of July. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, however, has refused to make masks mandatory statewide.

The number of people in intensive care and on a ventilator in hospital continued to drop, reaching its lowest level since the province started reporting the figure in April.

The Ministry of Health says it was able to complete more than 33,000 tests for the novel coronavirus the previous day.

The new cases come as the Ontario government extended its emergency orders for the COVID-19 pandemic until July 10.

Premier Doug Ford said the province has made good progress in reducing the spread of COVID-19, but Ontarians need to remain vigilant.

The province also said it will loosen some restrictions around indoor sports and fitness to enable amateur and professional athletes to train.

The announcement comes days after the government extended its state of emergency until July 15.

Ford has said he hopes this will be the last time Ontario has to extend its state of emergency.

The province will no longer be able to issue new emergency orders after a state of emergency ends, but it will be able to extend existing orders.

7:47 a.m.: India’s confirmed coronavirus cases crossed half a million on Saturday with another record 24-hour jump of 18,552 infections.

The Health Ministry also reported 384 new deaths, raising the total to 15,685.

The surge prompted authorities in the northeastern state of Assam to impose a two-week lockdown in the state capital of Gauhati. About 700 new cases were reported there in just four days.

Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the rest of Assam will be placed under a night curfew and weekend lockdowns.

He urged people to store essential goods and signalled a tighter lockdown where even grocery stores would be closed.

7:46 a.m.: Police in the English city of Liverpool have been given more powers to break up crowds after celebrations to mark Liverpool Football Club’s first league title in 30 years led to disorder.

The local move to stop gatherings of more than two people came after the sheer joy of victory, together with warm weather, prompted people to cast off worries about the COVID-19 pandemic and to gather in huge crowds.

Amid the wild celebrations, part of the Liver Building — a local landmark — caught fire. Images circulating on social media appear to show a firework sailing from the crowd and striking the building’s balcony before exploding. Four fire engines were dispatched and the blaze was put out, but the extent of the damage is unclear.

7:46 a.m.: European Union envoys are close to finalizing a list of countries whose citizens will be allowed to enter Europe again, possibly from late next week, EU diplomats confirmed Saturday. Americans are almost certain to be excluded in the short term due to the number of U.S. coronavirus cases.

The envoys were expected to have narrowed down later Saturday the exact criteria for countries to make the list, which include the way the spread of the virus is being managed. Another key condition is whether the country has a ban on citizens from European nations.

The number of cases in the United States has surged over the past week, with an all-time high of 45,300 confirmed new daily infections just reached. President Donald Trump also suspended the entry of all people from Europe’s ID check-free travel zone in a decree in March.

The EU diplomats confirmed that an official agreement on the criteria — likely to include a limit on the infection rate per 100,000 citizens — is expected late on Monday or early Tuesday. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the procedure is ongoing and politically very sensitive.

Friday 6 p.m. Ontario’s public health units reported their fewest new COVID-19 infections in more than three months as the rate of new cases fell sharply Friday, according to the Star’s latest count.

The health units have reported a total of 36,305 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,692 deaths, up a total of just 114 new cases since Thursday evening, down 64 from the day before.

The case totals reported Friday were low across the province: just 40 new cases in Toronto, another 40 in the rest of the GTA, and just 34 in Ontario outside the GTA, all among the lowest totals in months.

The last time the health units reported fewer than 120 cases in a day was March 23, well before the worst of the province’s epidemic at a time when just six people had died.

The three fatal cases reported Friday are below recent trends and well down for the province’s peak in early May, when the health units reported as many as 90 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported that 256 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 61 in intensive care, of whom 41 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,644, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Gilbert Ngabostaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Gilbert Ngabo Is A Star Breaking News Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-27,"Editor’s note: Some have termed COVID-19 “the great equalizer” because it can indiscriminately infect anyone. But the impact it has on people and families is far from equal. The Star’s Viral Inequality series looks at how people from various walks of life have seen their lives change, and, in some cases, how they’ve slipped through the safety net of government support.

The right to ride in the front seat. It’s the kind of battle Julia Williams never imagined she would wage in the middle of a global health pandemic.

Williams, 61, and a long-time resident of Innisfil, a town near Barrie, says her life under lockdown due to COVID-19 has been overcomplicated by what she calls “unfair treatment” when trying to ride in taxis. She lives with multiple disabilities and health conditions which require her to use a walker, and says she has been late or even missed important medical appointments due to taxi drivers refusing to let her ride in the front passenger seat.

“It’s very frustrating and I’m stressed out,” Williams said. The situation has led her to get into verbal disputes with both taxi drivers and dispatchers over the past three months since lockdown began.

“I really think it is my right as a human being and a person with disabilities to be accommodated.”

Some have termed the coronavirus “the great equalizer” as it can indiscriminately infect anyone, but the impact it inflicts on people is far from equal. Just as families’ makeup and socio-economic statuses are different, the stakes can be much different when it comes to living in the era of COVID-19.

Due to her physical disabilities, Williams didn’t go out much even before the pandemic forced people to limit outings to only what is essential. She has arthritis in both her knees, and bone spurs have developed in one of them. She’s been contemplating knee replacement. Walking is “unbelievably painful,” and she’s been using a walker for the past 20 years.

She was also born with congenital fibrosis syndrome, a condition that affects her sight and has made her partially blind. She relies on the generosity of her neighbours for grocery shopping and other needs during the lockdown, and only leaves home when going for medical treatments.

Living in a town that has no public transit system leaves her with almost no other option than relying on taxi for transport. She described herself as a “van only” customer.

Williams said she had always used the front passenger seat before, as her physical conditions wouldn’t permit her to get into the back seat of a van. But with physical distancing measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19, taxi drivers in the Barrie region have been refusing to let her sit up front, citing guidelines from health-care officials.

“I have been missing my medical appointments because of this,” she said, adding she usually has about two appointments every week for blood work and getting her hearing aids serviced among other health-care needs.

“One time I was so late the doctor got angry and told me he could refuse to treat me or charge me $150 in fines. It’s just scary and unfair to be in this situation.”

She recounts an incident a few weeks ago when a driver from Deluxe Taxi company wouldn’t let her use the front seat, offering instead to lift her up and get her in the back of the van. She refused as she has PTSD and doesn’t want people touching her.

“With COVID-19 they don’t want you touching anybody, and I’m thinking to myself ‘well, if you’re going to touch me to help me get in the back seat, why can’t I sit in the front seat then?’” she said.

Williams said she has repeatedly argued with dispatchers that the back-seat use is just a guideline from health officials and not a mandatory rule, especially when someone has a legitimate reason to want to sit in the front of the car.

Deluxe Taxi did not respond to the Star’s request for comment. The company has put up signs in its cabs that direct all passengers to sit in the back seat of the vehicles for their safety and that of the drivers during COVID-19.

The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit wouldn’t say if Williams has a legitimate case to make, only saying it has put out a guidance document on preventive practices for taxi drivers during this pandemic. The guidelines are meant to help limit exposure to other people when possible, and recommend wearing face coverings when physical distancing is not possible.

“Operators of taxi-driving agencies should consider appropriate barriers, procedures, and personal protective equipment for drivers based on provincial guidance, in order to accommodate riders with disabilities,” said Dr. Lisa Simon, Associate Medical Officer of Health, in a statement.

Williams, who purchased a face-shield earlier in the pandemic and wears a mask every time she goes out, said it’s “ridiculous” to use the taxi driver’s safety as an excuse to refuse her service for needing to sit in the front seat.

“I am always protected. I carry hand sanitizer with me always. I am more at risk than any of these drivers,” she said, adding she knows many other people with disabilities also face similar challenges.

All she wants is for the dispatchers to write down that she’s a special needs client and requires a driver who will let her use the front seat.

“I don’t really think it’s too much to ask.”

“As someone who shoots a lot of queer events, I say nine out of 10 (times) I can give you a list of the nights where you can find people like you,” says Raphael, who was also formerly the editor in chief of Fab Magazine.

Club 120 (formerly Goodhandy’s), a live performance venue praised for welcoming people of all communities, announced its closure last month. Fly 2.0 closed last year after a 20-year run, to make way for a condo. Glad Day Bookshop posted on social media that while Toronto patios can reopen, the shop no longer has a back patio because it had to make way for a condo laneway.

In March, Crews and Tangos worked out a deal with an incoming condo developer whereby the bar and drag venue will continue to exist.

Also in focus within the photo series are the people Raphael says have been vital in shaping the city’s queer community. There’s DJ Blackcat, a longtime fixture in the local ballroom scene, in front of the now-closed Club 120. There is also activist, singer, comic and club owner Mandy Goodhandy of Club 120 and 120 Diner. (“The number of clubs she was involved in and helped create —I think most gay men in the city have gotten laid from all the different things she has done,” says Raphael with a laugh.)

There’s also longtime Buddies in Bad Times Theatre bartender and musician Patricia Wilson, author and artist Rolyn Chambers, Toronto-St. Paul’s New Democrat MPP Jill Andrew, the first Black and queer person to be elected to the Ontario legislature, and her partner Aisha Fairclough. The two are behind Body Confidence Canada, which fights body discrimination.

Raphael also photographed a health-care worker who is now helping with COVID-19, as well as another who works in long-term care.

“Putting this all together as a series is a mix of feelings,” he says. “You’re scared, angry, the pandemic is showing all the cracks in the system, not just race but also how we treat our elder population,” he says.

In the end, Raphael hopes the photographs will amplify the need to preserve and create spaces for LGBTQ+ and racialized folks, as well as the people who have been fighting for their communities to be heard for decades.

Read', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-06-26,"VICTORIA—First Nations in British Columbia have been largely successful in keeping COVID-19 out of their communities by strictly following health guidelines and relying on the advice of elders about smallpox and tuberculosis that decimated Indigenous populations, say health officials.

Since Jan. 1, there have been 87 cases of COVID-19 among Indigenous people in B.C. and four deaths, a rate below the provincial average, Dr. Shannon McDonald of the First Nations Health Authority, said Friday.

She said there are currently three active cases among Indigenous Peoples in B.C.

The province reported 10 new COVID-19 cases Friday, bringing the provincial total to 2,878. There have been 174 deaths.

“I’m also pleased to tell you that thanks to an extraordinary response from our First Nations communities, the people the First Nations Health Authority serves have fared even better than the rest of the population in the face of this unprecedented challenge,” McDonald said at a news conference on Friday.

She said the results are from data based on COVID-19 testing of more than 5,500 Indigenous people through a program unique in Canada that allows the sharing of federal and provincial data with the health authority.

McDonald credited the success to the many sacrifices made by First Nations communities to follow health restrictions, restrict travel and the willingness to cancel cultural and family gatherings that are integral to Indigenous culture.

“The sacrifices made, some of them very difficult and painful, have paid off,” she said. “The worst, which many anticipated and feared, did not happen. Transmission of the virus within and between our communities was kept to a very small number.”

McDonald said those communities must continue efforts to prevent the spread of the virus, especially since the B.C. government decided this week to ease more health restrictions, including allowing travel in the province.

“This is no time to lower our guard,” she said. “The curve has flattened but not flat lined.”

Judith Sayers, president of the 14 Nation Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, said Friday Indigenous communities are concerned that increased travel could mean the arrival of the virus in their territories.

There are more than 10,000 Nuu-chah-nulth members in 14 communities on the west coast of Vancouver Island, including Port Alberni, Bamfield and Tofino.

Sayers said the Nuu-chah-nulth were not properly consulted by the provincial government prior to the announcement that health restrictions would be eased.

The Nuu-chah-nulth and other Indigenous groups on B.C.’s central coast and the Interior said the failure to consult about the reopening puts Indigenous lives at risk.

Sayers said there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in her communities.

“People tried very hard to follow the guidelines.”

She said not allowing large funerals “really hurt.”

But the memories of smallpox, which almost wiped out Nuu-chah-nulth communities, were invoked as strong forces to keep the virus away, she said.

“There was a certain effort that that would never happen this time,” said Sayers.

McDonald agreed, saying the advice of elders remembering how previous diseases like tuberculosis spread uncontrolled through Indigenous communities convinced residents to follow health guidelines.

“History is an ugly thing for many First Nations communities,” she said. “We have people alive and well who tell the stories of previous pandemics.”

McDonald said the appearance of COVID-19 in April in the remote village of Alert Bay, located on Cormorant Island off northern Vancouver Island, also served as a wake-up call for people about the ability of the illness to show up anywhere.

Premier John Horgan urged travellers earlier this week to be aware that some communities are not prepared to welcome tourists or may not want them there because of the COVID-19 risk.

Sayers said talks are ongoing between Indigenous leaders, health and government officials about the potential impacts of the reopening on Indigenous communities.

The tribal council had said that it was prepared to restrict access to their territories, but Sayers did not say when or if that would occur.

Some are skeptical,"['Carl Zimmer', 'Raphael Minder', 'Carl Zimmerthe New York Timesraphael Minderfri.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Carl Zimmerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-06-26,"In a study not yet published in a journal, scientists have reported that the new coronavirus was present in wastewater in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2019, a finding that, if confirmed, would show that the pathogen had emerged much earlier than previously thought.

But independent experts who reviewed the findings said they doubted the claim. The study was flawed, they said, and other lines of evidence strongly suggest the virus emerged in China late last year.

Up until now, the earliest evidence of the virus anywhere in the world has been from December 2019 in China — and it was only known to have hit mainland Spain in February 2020.

“Barcelona is a city that is frequented by Chinese people, in tourism and business, so probably this happened also elsewhere and probably at the same time,” said the lead author, Albert Bosch, a professor in the department of microbiology at the University of Barcelona who has been studying viruses in wastewater for more than 40 years.

Several experts not involved in the research pointed out problems with the new study, which has not yet been subjected to the critical review by outside experts that occurs before publication in a scientific journal. They suggested that the tests might very well have produced false positives because of contamination or improper storage of the samples.

“I don’t trust the results,” said Irene Xagoraraki, an environmental engineer at Michigan State University.

Researchers at the University of Barcelona posted their findings online June 13. Most of their report described research on wastewater treatments from early 2020. The surprising finding about March 2019 was only mentioned briefly at the end of the report.

The research gained more attention when the university issued a news release Friday.

For months, scientists have been struggling to assemble clues about the origin of the new coronavirus. The earliest official reports came from the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019.

Researchers have studied the mutations that have arisen in coronavirus samples collected from across the world since then and have estimated on the basis of their findings that the samples shared a common ancestor that dated to late 2019.

More evidence for the origin of the novel coronavirus has come from other viruses that scientists have found in animals. The closest relatives to the coronavirus infect bats in China.

Because the virus can be shed in feces, researchers have begun examining wastewater to detect the pathogen’s genes.

In Europe, Australia and the United States, researchers discovered rising levels of the virus’s genes in wastewater days before confirmed cases began to arise. These discoveries have led a number of researchers to examine frozen wastewater samples from earlier periods, seeking evidence of the virus’s presence before anyone knew to look for it.

Last week, Italian researchers reported finding the virus in Milan and Turin on Dec. 18, two months before northern Italy was besieged by COVID-19 cases.

Separately, in Spain, Bosch and his colleagues began taking weekly samples of wastewater from two of Barcelona’s treatment plants in April. They found the virus in these samples, prompting them to look back at earlier samples.

The researchers found the virus in a number of samples from early 2020, in the months before the pandemic struck Spain.

Bosch and his colleagues then went back even further, examining nine samples taken every few weeks or months between January 2018 and December 2019. In a single sample, taken March 12, 2019, they got a positive result from their tests for the virus.

Bosch found it plausible that the virus could appear in March but not show up in more recent samples.

“Respiratory viruses usually have peaks around this time of the year,” Bosch said. “Probably the virus then disappeared.”

But Xagoraraki noted that the researchers used tests that search for bits of three different genes. The only tests that came back positive were for a gene called RdRp. One of the other tests, for a gene called N, is known to be more sensitive. “It should have shown a signal as well,” Xagoraraki said.

It was possible that the positive results were the result of contamination from other samples that did have the virus, Xagoraraki said. She also doubted whether the delicate coronavirus could have survived for more than a year without the sample having been put in a deep freeze. “If the samples were not stored in -80 degrees, you can’t trust the results,” she said.

Gertjan Medema of the KWR Water Research Institute in the Netherlands said that the study came from a “knowledgeable research team” and so should be taken seriously. But, he added, “they need to confirm this finding in multiple ways.”

Bosch said that his team would not be able to repeat the experiments in the positive sample from March 2019 because it was depleted during the first test. “We proved it from this sample, but we cannot repeat it,” he said. But contamination was unlikely, he said. “The way we work, when there is contamination, we notice it.”

Another way to confirm the finding would be to search through stored samples of blood from patients in Barcelona hospitals in March 2019. If the virus were circulating, even briefly, in Spain, some people would most likely have been hospitalized complaining of flu-like symptoms.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-26,"Mayor John Tory now says he’s open to considering an order forcing Torontonians to wear non-medical masks or face coverings in stores and other indoor public spaces.

His change of tone comes amid new advice from the city solicitor on whether Toronto has legal authority for such an order, and a growing number of municipalities considering telling stores to compel masks for staff and customers.

“I think it’s going to move in that direction,” the mayor said Friday when asked if he could support a mask order when council next week debates the city solicitor’s report and other issues facing Toronto in Stage 2 reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown.

Tory said he has been consulting Dr. Eileen de Villa — the public health chief who so far has only “strongly recommended” cloth mask use when people can’t physically distance — on infection control measures including a mask order.

De Villa has noted research citing infection risk during sustained indoor contact.

More covered faces could reduce new cases of the virus spread primarily through water droplets from people’s mouths and noses, and get Toronto quicker to a wider reopening that includes restaurants with some indoor dining, Tory said.

“I’m not indisposed to that,” he said of an order broadening the list of places with mandatory mask use beyond TTC vehicles and stations, and city ferries to the Toronto Islands.

But Tory said he’ll follow de Villa’s advice as to whether an order for non-city sites would be an effective way to reduce COVID-19 spread and “allow us to get back to a more normal functioning of our economy.”

De Villa would not say Friday what advice she’ll give to council

Wendy Walberg, Toronto’s chief lawyer, said in a new report to council that the Ontario government is best positioned to issue a mask order under its Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

City council could, however, issue an order under its general authority to legislate health, safety and well-being of Torontonians based on “clear recommendations of public health authorities and operational requirements,” she wrote.

Both Tory and de Villa recently questioned Toronto’s legal ability to follow the lead of Guelph where, since June 12, commercial establishments are ordered, under Ontario’s Health Protection and Promotion Act, to require mask use.

Provincial health authorities this week assured Toronto it has that power.

At Queen’s Park Friday, Premier Doug Ford said he’s not against mask wearing but won’t order it across the province because it’s difficult to enforce, particular in many regions of Ontario where there have been no new cases for weeks.

“It’s up to the local chief medical officer if they want to do it,” he told reporters.

York Region is considering an order at the urging of Markham Mayor Frank Scarpitti, who told reporters Thursday: “The pandemic is not over and the threat of a second wave is a real possibility.”

Kingston said it’s considering an order after an outbreak at a nail salon.

Toronto councillors appear to be split on the merits of a mask order.

Cynthia Lai is a strong supporter. “I think we need to be proactive for the second wave,” of the virus expected in fall, said the Ward 22 Scarborough North councillor. “There are store owners who would really like the city to take the lead with a mandatory order.”

Stephen Holyday (Ward 2 Etobicoke Centre) said retailers are best suited to decide what people must wear in their shops.

“We are already familiar with seeing signs like ‘No shirt, no shoes – no service,’” he said, “and store personnel have experience in keeping order in their spaces.”

Read', 'Joanna Chiuvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'With Files The Canadian Press', 'Joanna Chiu Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Both Canada-China Relations', 'Current Affairs On The West Coast For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-26,"SUMMERLAND, B.C.—Rural communities in British Columbia are racing to establish temporary camp sites with washrooms and enough space for physical distancing for domestic farm workers from elsewhere in Canada.

Some workers have already arrived to pick early-season fruit, and hundreds more are expected to arrive in coming weeks, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.

The working conditions faced by migrant workers from other countries such as Mexico have been under the spotlight of late amid concerns over COVID-19 outbreaks and several deaths due to the virus. Meanwhile, for thousands of Canadian youth, picking fruit in the summer and autumn while camping in orchards rent-free is a long-standing way to save up money for school or other expenses.

But in the time of coronavirus, as evidenced by the migrant worker situation, some existing farm sites don’t meet government health and safety standards.

In a statement this week, B.C.’s Ministry of Agriculture said it is providing funds to local governments to create campsite accommodations.

The sites would meet health and safety requirements set by the provincial health officer to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Campsites are planned for the Oliver area in the southern Okanagan and two more are slated for Creston in southeastern B.C., with the province providing about $60,000 for each site. Campsite accommodations are also currently being explored in Summerland, Osoyoos, Naramata and the Similkameen.

Each year, between 1,500 and 2,000 domestic seasonal workers arrive in B.C., with the majority from Quebec. This season, approximately 1,000 workers are expected, an agriculture ministry spokesperson told the Star in an email.

Quebec leads Canada in the number of COVID-19 cases, with a total of 54,397 cases as of June 24, while B.C. has been able to “flatten the curve” with a total of only 2,849 cases provincewide so far.

In picturesque Summerland, on the west side of Okanagan Lake, where there are nearly 3,000 hectares of farmland, some residents have been anxiously waiting for weeks for details about planned campsites.

They are concerned that without proper protocols in place in time for arrivals, incoming workers from Quebec and Ontario could spread COVID-19 in the community.

“It’s super scary because domestic farm workers don’t have to self-isolate like migrant workers, where farmers have to meet strict protocols for migrant housing,” says Janine Sentes.

“I don’t want to say Canadians will be dishonest about whether they are feeling well or not, but … we’d support mandatory self-isolation for domestic workers, too,” she said.

Sentes was speaking to the Star at the Summerland Rodeo Grounds, which has been tabled by municipal council as a potential campsite for workers.

She has been vocal as part of the Summerland Rodeo Grounds Equine Development Committee, which says it appreciates the important role domestic farm workers play in the economy but wants the province to hold farmers responsible for meeting COVID-19 protocols so public spaces aren’t affected.

B.C. provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry issued a 10-page public health order on April 23 for employers and workers in the agriculture, aquaculture, forestry and resource sectors.

It is not mandatory for seasonal workers in these industries to self-isolate for 14 days when coming to B.C. from other parts of the country.

However, the order says employers must develop COVID-19 infection prevention and control protocols and maintain high levels of hygiene.

The problem is that regulations for domestic worker campsites have been minimal in the past and some farmers don’t have the resources to make substantial upgrades, says Anthony Haddad, chief administrative officer with the District of Summerland.

“Workers have had a variety of accommodations over years, some obviously better than others, which put pressure on public recreational washroom facilities in the past,” Haddad said in a phone interview.

“We’re here to support our agriculture industry as well, which is a key economic driver in the south Okanagan,” he added.

With fewer domestic workers coming to B.C. as well as fewer foreign workers coming from other countries, growers say they will likely lose crops because of the labour shortage.

Jonathan Boerboom, 32, whose family has owned the Mountain View nursery in Summerland since the 1960s, said his business doesn’t normally employ Canadian workers from out of province, but would need to compete with other farmers to hire them this year.

The process of packaging and transferring the nursery’s 21 million seedlings for storage is labour intensive, and the 20-hectare nursery usually employs a hundred people at peak season, including a mix of locals and workers from Mexico.

“It’s such a dense agricultural area so there is a lot of competition for labour and not enough local residents to work for the farms here,” Boerboom said while giving a tour of the nursery, which supplies 12.3 million seedlings to the B.C. government to replenish forests destroyed in wildfires.

“My concern is that after we have invested in our facilities (for foreign workers) using the current COVID-19 health and safety standards that the government has laid out, what will happen now? How can we keep our employees safe and fully utilize our facilities?”

Boerboom said he’s seen that provincial officials in Quebec are considering subsidies to encourage local workers to take on seasonal farm work, and he says it would be beneficial for governments across Canada to introduce subsidies to allow growers to offer more competitive salaries and better-quality lodgings.

“It’s a tough time for everyone in many industries,” he said.

Toni Boot, mayor of the town of Summerland, says the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted that the living conditions of many farm workers require significant improvement, both those from overseas and other provinces.

“It’s unfortunate that we’re in crisis mode at this point, but the work we’re getting done now (to upgrade living facilities) will move us forward in the future, I think,” Boot said.

“It’s something that should’ve been addressed years ago and now we have no choice. Let’s make the most of it.”

Read', 'Michael Tuttonthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Michael Tuttonthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-06-26,"HALIFAX—The Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union says pandemic infections and deaths in the province’s nursing homes have been a “tragic reminder” of the province’s failure to bring in higher staffing levels it recommended four years ago.

The preface to a study paper released today argues the lack of nurses to assess residents and monitor those with severe dementia is “highly relevant” to the control of infectious disease.

The union hired Charlene Harrington, an expert on long-term care staffing who served on the U.S. Institute of Medicine Committee on Nursing Home Regulation, to prepare the 27-page paper last year.

She repeats recommendations from the union’s 2015-16 “Broken Homes” study, calling for an average of 4.1 hours of care per resident per day, including 1.3 hours of nursing care.

According to the union, that would mean about 20 per cent more staff, or 600 nurses and 1,400 continuing-care assistants.

Harrington’s work was completed prior to the pandemic crisis, but a preface has been added to the report which says her findings are given added urgency by the COVID-19 deaths and infections of the past three months.

Union president Janet Hazelton said during a news conference the consultant’s conclusions have highlighted the need for the province to act immediately.

“The COVID-19 tragedy in our long-term care facilities has brought to light how imperative it is to address staffing shortages in our long-term care sooner rather than later,” Hazelton said during a news conference.

“I implore government to take action so we do not fail these citizens.”

The report’s preface notes the tragedy at the Northwood care homes in Halifax, where 246 people were infected and 53 people died during the last three months.

It says the province needs an independent review to determine the factors that led to the outbreak and to recommend solutions.

However, the union says improved staffing levels, along with measures such as more single rooms and greater access to infectious disease experts, are factors in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

The preface notes Northwood lacked staff after many care workers and nurses became ill in the pandemic, swiftly putting the home in a crisis situation that required it to call in nurses from local hospitals.

“If long-term care facilities in Nova Scotia had higher staffing levels, they would be better positioned to handle these crisis situations,” it says.

“More licensed staff means better, more regular assessments and earlier detection of problems.”

The report also reveals that inspection reports last year and so far this year show 16 facilities were cited for not meeting the requirement that a registered nurse be available for 24-hour coverage.

“Well-trained staff in sufficient numbers is an important bulwark against a threat like COVID-19,” says the report’s preface.

Harrington says in the report that it’s reasonable for her to recommend that Nova Scotia’s 7,000 long-term care residents benefit from staffing levels that meet minimum professional standards established in research literature.

She says existing studies suggest 1.3 hours per resident per day of nursing care and at least 2.8 hours per day of personal service worker care daily, for a total of 4.1 hours. The expert noted the figures should be higher for patients with more serious medical conditions.

Hazelton says the current level of care is an average of about 3.45 hours per day.

The nurses’ union president said there are many nursing graduates looking for work in the province, but the long-term care homes don’t have the budgets to hire them.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-26,"OTTAWA—The Canadian Red Cross will send 900 people to work in Quebec’s long-term care homes until September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.

The announcement came as the military prepares to pull out of the homes, despite repeated requests from Premier François Legault to keep at least 1,000 Forces members there until the fall.

Trudeau said 150 Red Cross personnel would arrive before July 6, with the balance arriving by July 29.

They will remain at the homes until September 15, by which time thousands of workers hired by the province are expected to be trained and ready to take over the jobs.

Trudeau said a small number of Canadian Armed Forces personnel will remain at four of the care homes until the COVID-19 situation is stable, while 10 teams of seven will be ready to deploy in the case of an emergency.

He praised the work of the soldiers, who were deployed to 47 Quebec care homes, known as CHSLDs, as well as to several homes in Ontario.

“Overall, the situation in the CHSLDs has greatly improved,” he said at a stop at an Ottawa craft brewery. “The needs are no longer the same as they were two months ago.”

More than 3,730 people have died of COVID-19 in Quebec’s care homes, which have long suffered from a lack of staff.

Trudeau said the replacement of Armed Forces personnel with civilians was part of a “transition plan” created in conjunction with the province that would allow the soldiers to return to their regular duties.

The workers will be paid from the $100 million in federal funding the government announced for the Red Cross in May to help it meet the demand created by COVID-19.

Public Safety Minister Bill Blair is expected to provide more details Friday afternoon.

Read', 'Kim Tong-Hyungthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Kim Tong-Hyungthe Associated Pressfri.']",2020-06-26,"SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF—While China moved closer to containing a fresh outbreak in Beijing, the coronavirus took a stronger hold elsewhere, including the United States, where surging infections across southern states have highlighted the risks of reopening economies without effective treatment or vaccines.

Another record daily increase in India on Friday pushed the country’s caseload toward half a million, and other countries with big populations like Indonesia, Pakistan and Mexico grappled with large caseloads and strained health-care systems.

South Africa, which accounts for about half of the infections on the African continent with 118,375, reported a record 6,579 new cases, as transmissions increase after it loosened what had been one of the world’s strictest lockdowns earlier this month.

Mexico reported some of its highest 24-hour counts so far with 6,104 new cases and 736 additional deaths, as its treasury secretary began isolating at home after a positive test.

In China, where the pandemic originated in December, authorities have mobilized resources for mass testing and locked down parts of Beijing this month due to an outbreak that has infected 260 people. The 11 new cases reported in the capital Friday continued a downward trend that suggests transmissions have been largely brought under control.

The United States, which counts the most infections in the world, is seeing daily jumps in COVID-19 cases nearing the peak reached in late April.

Arizona’s 3,056 additional infections reported Thursday was the fourth day in a week with an increase over 3,000. Transmissions have spiked following Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s decision to lift stay-home restrictions in May.

Twenty-three per cent of tests conducted in the state over the past seven days have been positive, nearly triple the national average, and a record 415 patients were on ventilators.

The numbers “continue to go in the wrong direction,” said Ducey, who confirmed that the state has postponed further efforts to reopen.

He pushed back against reporters’ questions about his position on the use of masks and his attendance at U.S. President Donald Trump’s indoor campaign event this week at a Phoenix church. Many of the 3,000 people who attended did not wear face coverings.

Mississippi announced a record 1,092 new cases of coronavirus, the second time this week its daily count reached new highs.

After making one of the most aggressive pushes in the nation to reopen, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has put off lifting any more restrictions and reimposed a ban on elective surgeries in some places to preserve hospital space.

The United States reported 34,500 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, slightly fewer than the day before but still near the high of 36,400 reached April 24, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Deaths tolls have dropped even as the number of infections have increased, possibly reflecting better medical treatments and better efforts to prevent infections among the most vulnerable, like nursing home residents. A rising proportion of cases in the U.S. is among younger people, who are more likely than their elders to survive a bout with COVID-19.

“This is still serious,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but “we’re in a different situation today than we were in March or April.”

India, which has the world’s second-largest population, has seen regular record daily increases. The 24-hour spike of 17,296 new infections reported Friday raised the national caseload past 490,000, including 15,301 fatalities. Indian Railways delayed the resumption of regular train services by more than a month, until Aug. 12.

In India and in neighbouring Pakistan, government leaders have resisted new restrictions, citing economic concerns. The world’s fourth-most populous country, Indonesia, passed 50,000 confirmed cases on Thursday, with at least 2,620 deaths, the highest number of cases and fatalities in Southeast Asia. That’s up from just two positive cases in early March.

President Joko Widodo said his administration wants Indonesia’s economy back on track but safe from the virus, and started the country’s reopening earlier this month. The government says the pandemic is expected to raise the nation’s poverty rate to 10.2 per cent.

A comeback of the virus is also erasing hard-won gains in South Korea, which reported 39 newly-confirmed cases on Friday, mostly from the densely populated capital area that had escaped the worst of the country’s outbreak in February and March. There’s criticism that authorities, concerned about a fragile economy, were too quick to ease social-distancing guidelines and reopen schools starting in May.

Japan’s capital, Tokyo, confirmed 54 new cases, continuing a steady rise that’s raising concern about a need for stronger preventive measures. Gov. Yuriko Koike has downplayed fears about a major surge that would overwhelm the city’s hospitals.

Australia on Friday reported 37 new cases of the coronavirus, including 30 in Victoria state, where health authorities are scrambling to contain an outbreak. Authorities said they tested 20,000 people in Melbourne suburbs as they went door-to-door in their attempts to stamp out the virus.

In Europe, the official in charge of Spain’s response to COVID-19 says imported infections are a growing source of concern as the continent readies to welcome more visitors.

Epidemiologist Fernando Simón said Thursday that 54 people who had contracted the disease in the past week have been linked to recently arrived visitors in Spain. He suggested that controls should be strict and that regional and local governments should be ready to apply localized isolation to avoid spreading the disease.

In Britain, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the government has the power to close beaches and other public spaces amid growing concerns over the public’s adherence to social-distancing rules.

Huge crowds on English beaches Thursday prompted the concern. Trash bins overflowed, extra police were called and the rural roads gridlocked by beachgoers now have signs stating the area is full.

There were also concerns surrounding jubilant Liverpool fans gathering outside the soccer club’s stadium to celebrate the team’s first league title in 30 years.

In Germany, Westfleisch, one of the country’s biggest meat-processing companies, said Friday it plans to perform daily coronavirus tests on all 5,000 workers involved in the production process amid concerns about a series of outbreaks at slaughterhouses.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-26,"OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canadian companies are now producing so much personal protective equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19 that Canada is almost at the point of being self-sufficient.

He underscored that contention Friday with a visit to a Kanata, Ont., brewery that has retooled to make hand sanitizer during the pandemic.

The visit to Big Rig Brewery, which has used the federal wage subsidy to rehire workers, is also intended to emphasize Trudeau’s repeated plea to businesses to take advantage of the program to get back on their feet.

It’s his third visit in as many weeks to a company that’s used the subsidy to hire back laid-off employees.

“As we move into the summer, Canadians can keep counting on our support,” Trudeau said, standing before an array of kegs and cans.

Friday’s visit underlines comments Trudeau made during a pre-taped interview that aired Thursday evening at the online Collision tech conference.

He touted the various federal financial support programs aimed at helping businesses survive the pandemic-induced economic shutdown and to promote innovation to help fight the disease.

And he said many Canadian companies have taken advantage of those programs to retool and start producing masks, gowns, ventilators, sanitizer and other personal protective equipment.

Indeed, Trudeau said so many have stepped up that “even as, like every country, we’re having to import massive amounts of PPE because we didn’t have enough from the beginning, we’re now getting to a place where we’re close to self-sufficient on that and able to turn around and share with the world, particularly the developing world.”

Having a secure domestic supply will be particularly important if there is a second wave of the deadly virus that causes COVID-19 in the fall, triggering another wild, global scramble for PPE.

China is the dominant supplier of PPE. With the outbreak starting in that country, there was a severe shortage of equipment as the disease first started spreading around the world in March. Countries were outbidding one another for supplies that were often never delivered.

According to the Public Services and Procurement Canada website, Canada has vast amounts of protective equipment and supplies on order. Some of the contracts are for delivery much later.

As of June 16, 55.7 million face shields had been ordered but 17.6 million received; over one billion pairs of gloves ordered but 42.3 million received; 126.6 million gowns ordered but 4.6 million received; 20.4 million litres of hand sanitizer ordered but 7.1 million litres received.

As well, Canada had ordered 121.9 million of the coveted N95 respirators and 340.8 million surgical masks, though 12.9 million and 110.9 million respectively had been received. Of the 40,328 ventilators ordered, just 367 had been received.

The latest coronavirus news from Canada and around the world Friday. This file will be updated throughout the day. Web links to longer stories if available.

6 p.m. Ontario’s public health units reported their fewest new COVID-19 infections in more than three months as the rate of new cases fell sharply Friday, according to the Star’s latest count.

The health units have reported a total of 36,305 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,692 deaths, up a total of just 114 new cases since Thursday evening, down 64 from the day before.

The case totals reported Friday were low across the province: just 40 new cases in Toronto, another 40 in the rest of the GTA, and just 34 in Ontario outside the GTA, all among the lowest totals in months.

The last time the health units reported fewer than 120 cases in a day was March 23, well before the worst of the province’s epidemic at a time when just six people had died.

The three fatal cases reported Friday are below recent trends and well down for the province’s peak in early May, when the health units reported as many as 90 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Friday, the province reported that 256 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 61 in intensive care, of whom 41 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,644, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:15 p.m. There are 102,735 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 8,507 deaths, and 65,658 that have been resolved, according to The Canadian Press.

NOTE: Quebec no longer reports its case count on a daily basis. Instead, those numbers are reported weekly. The Star does its own count for Ontario; see this file.

Quebec: *As of June 25, 2020, 55,079 confirmed (including 5,448 deaths, 23,786 resolved)

2 p.m.: The Canadian Red Cross will send 900 people to work in Quebec’s long-term care homes until September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.

The announcement came as the military prepares to pull out of the homes, despite repeated requests from Premier Francois Legault to keep at least 1,000 Forces members there until the fall. Trudeau said 150 Red Cross personnel would arrive before July 6, with the balance arriving by July 29.

1:15 p.m.: Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil says the province is lifting additional restrictions after going more than two weeks without a new case of COVID-19.

The premier told a news conference today that effective July 3, limits on public gatherings will be increased, and effective immediately, bars and restaurants will be allowed to operate at full capacity.

Public pools are allowed to reopen, and private campgrounds can now operate at full capacity, as long as they follow sector guidelines. McNeil stressed the importance of physical distancing and hand hygiene, and provincial health officials are now recommending that non-medical masks be worn when distancing is not possible, such as in stores, on public transit or at gatherings.

1 p.m.: Ontario Premier Doug Ford will be joined by Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, to provide a COVID-19 update.

12:30 p.m.: Ontario labs processed 30,780 COVID-19 tests Thursday, a new high, with just 111 people testing positive, a recent low. Of the positives, 89 of the patients were aged 20 to 59.

The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 fell from 270 to 256.

The numbers of people in intensive care and on ventilators — 61 and 41, respectively — fell to their lowest levels since the province started publicly reporting those figures at the beginning of April.

11:19 a.m.: Florida banned alcohol consumption at its bars Friday after its daily confirmed coronavirus cases neared 9,000, a new record that is almost double the previous mark set just two days ago.

The Florida agency that governs bars announced the ban on Twitter just minutes after the Department of Health reported 8,942 new confirmed cases, topping the previous record of 5,500 set Wednesday.

State officials have attributed much of the new outbreak to young adults flocking to bars after they reopened in most of the state about a month ago, with many of them ignoring social distancing restrictions aimed at lowering the virus’s spread.

11 a.m.: An NBA press release says 16 of the 302 players tested in the league have come back with positive results for COVID-19.

“Any player who tested positive will remain in self-isolation until he satisfies public health protocols for discontinuing isolation and has been cleared by a physician,” the statement read.

The names of the specific players who came back with positive tests results were not included in the press release.

10:25 a.m.: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott shut down bars in Texas again on Friday and scaled back restaurant dining, the most dramatic reversals yet as confirmed coronavirus cases surge.

Abbott also said rafting and tubing outfitters on Texas’ popular rivers must close and that outdoor gatherings of 100 people or more must be approved by local governments.

“At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,” Abbott said. “The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and protect public health.”

Texas has reported more than 17,000 confirmed new cases in the last three days with a record high positive tests of 5,996 on Thursday. The day’s tally of 4,739 hospitalizations was also a record. The state’s rolling infection rate hit nearly 12%, a level not seen since the state was in a broad lockdown in mid-April.

The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the COVID-19 virus without feeling sick.

8:50 a.m.: As jurisdictions around the world lift restrictions, there is concern that COVID-19 will experience a resurgence. Already some countries such as Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia are experiencing second waves.

And there are fears that regions in South Korea, Germany and the U.K. are on the cusp of a second wave — or already in one.

This at a time when global cases of COVID-19 are rising exponentially, prompting Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, to warn earlier this week that while it took three months for the world to see the first one million infections, the last one million cases took just eight days to appear.

Experts in Canada warn that a second wave here is possible, indeed likely, but predicting exactly when and where is difficult.

8:25 a.m.: In any other year, the streets in the Church-Wellesley neighbourhood this weekend would be abuzz with annual Pride Toronto celebrations. Patios would be packed, music would be pouring out of storefronts, and crews would be erecting stages and cordoning off the gardens around The 519, ready for large crowds.

But 2020 has proven to be anything but a normal year. In lieu of the regular festivities, storefronts and bars remain boarded up, with many businesses operating at reduced capacity or offering improvised services due to measures in place to help curtail the spread of COVID-19.

And the streets, for the most part, are empty.

7:55 a.m.: A witness says three people were killed in a small town in Kenya’s Rift Valley during a confrontation between police and residents over the wearing of face masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Police confirmed the deaths but gave a different account.

Human rights activists for weeks have protested alleged killings by Kenyan police officers while enforcing virus-related restrictions. They also accuse officers of using the measures to extort bribes.

Kenneth Kaunda told The Associated Press that violent protests erupted in Lessos on Thursday after residents tried to prevent police officers from taking a motorcycle taxi rider to the station for not wearing a mask. Kenya has made it compulsory to wear face masks in public and failure to comply brings a $200 fine, a hefty fee for many.

7:22 a.m.: Millions of children could be pushed to the brink of starvation as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across war-torn Yemen amid a “huge” drop in humanitarian aid funding, the U.N. children’s agency warned Friday.

The stark prediction comes in a new UNICEF report, “Yemen five years on: Children, conflict and COVID-19.” It said the number of malnourished Yemeni children could reach 2.4 million by the end of the year, a 20 per cent increase in the current figure.

“As Yemen’s devastated health system and infrastructure struggle to cope with coronavirus, the already dire situation for children is likely to deteriorate considerably,” warned UNICEF.

Yemen’s poor health care infrastructure is unprepared to battle the coronavirus pandemic after five years of war between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The war, which has mostly stalemated, has also triggered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

7:13 a.m.: South Korea reported 39 new cases, mostly from the Seoul metropolitan area where officials have been struggling to stem transmissions.

South Korea was considered an anti-virus success story after containing an outbreak during February and March surrounding the southeastern city of Daegu. However, the country has been seeing an uptick in new infections since authorities moved to ease social distancing guidelines and reopen schools starting in May.

6:35 a.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canadian companies are now producing so much personal protective equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19 that Canada is almost at the point of being self-sufficient.

He’ll underscore that contention today with a visit to a Kanata, Ont., brewery that has retooled to make hand sanitizer during the pandemic.

The visit to Big Rig Brewery, which has used the federal wage subsidy to rehire workers, is also intended to emphasize Trudeau’s repeated plea to businesses to take advantage of the program to get back on their feet. It’s his third visit in as many weeks to a company that’s used the subsidy to hire back laid off employees.

Today’s visit underlines comments Trudeau made during a pre-taped interview that aired Thursday evening at the online Collision tech conference.

6:30 a.m.: The United States, which counts the most infections in the world, is seeing daily jumps in COVID-19 cases nearing the peak reached in late April.

Arizona’s 3,056 additional infections reported Thursday was the fourth day in a week with an increase over 3,000. Transmissions have spiked following Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s decision to lift stay-home restrictions in May.

Twenty-three per cent of tests conducted in the state over the past seven days have been positive, nearly triple the national average, and a record 415 patients were on ventilators.

Mississippi announced a record 1,092 new cases of coronavirus, the second time this week its daily count reached new highs.

After making one of the most aggressive pushes in the nation to reopen, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has put off lifting any more restrictions and reimposed a ban on elective surgeries in some places to preserve hospital space.

The United States reported 34,500 COVID-19 cases Wednesday, slightly fewer than the day before but still near the high of 36,400 reached April 24, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Deaths tolls have dropped even as the number of infections have increased, possibly reflecting better medical treatments and better efforts to prevent infections among the most vulnerable, like nursing home residents. A rising proportion of cases in the U.S. is among younger people, who are more likely than their elders to survive a bout with COVID-19.

“This is still serious,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but “we’re in a different situation today than we were in March or April.”

6:25 a.m.: Australia reported 37 new cases, including 30 in Victoria state, where health authorities are scrambling to contain an outbreak.

Authorities said they tested 20,000 people after going door-to-door in Melbourne suburbs Thursday in their attempts to stamp out the virus. In Sydney, a 12-year-old student tested positive, forcing the closure of his school for cleaning.

New Zealand, meanwhile, reported one new virus case from a returning traveller. New Zealand has 14 active cases, all of them returning travellers who remain quarantined.

6:20 a.m.: India neared half a million confirmed coronavirus cases Friday with its biggest 24-hour spike of 17,296 new infections, prompting a delay in resumption of regular train services of more than a month.

The new cases took India’s total to 490,401. The Health Ministry also reported 407 more deaths in the previous 24 hours, taking its total fatalities to 15,301.

The ministry said the recovery rate was continuing to improve at 57.43 per cent. Also, deaths per 100,000 stood at 1.86 against the world average of 6.24 per 100,000, it said.

The actual numbers of infections and deaths from COVID-19, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons including limited testing.

Indian Railways was due to resume regular train service on June 30 but said Thursday that it wouldn’t fully resume until Aug. 12. Trains were halted when the government declared a nationwide lockdown in late March. Special trains linking main cities have been running since mid-May as part of an easing of the lockdown.

6:17 a.m.: In many ways, it’s been a perfect storm for illegal gatherings in England as the hot weather, which is set to persist into Friday, and Liverpool Football Club’s first league title in 30 years prompted people to abandon their cooped-up coronavirus existence.

British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that the government has the power to close beaches and other public spaces in England amid growing concerns over the public’s adherence to social distancing rules.

Following widespread rule-breaking that has seen beaches crammed, illegal street parties in London that have turned violent and a mass celebration in Liverpool, concerns are mounting that people have ditched their risk-averse attitude as the government eases its lockdown restrictions.

With the hot weather set to continue Friday, there was clearly a potential for more mass gatherings, although early indications were that people had not converged on the beaches around the southern English coastal town of Bournemouth in anything like the numbers they had over the past couple of days.

6:15 a.m.: The latest numbers of confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases in Canada as of 6:15 a.m. ET on June 26, 2020:

There are 102,622 confirmed and presumptive cases in Canada.

-Quebec: 55,079 confirmed (including 5,448 deaths, 23,786 resolved)

-Ontario: 34,205 confirmed (including 2,641 deaths, 29,528 resolved)

-Alberta: 7,851 confirmed (including 154 deaths, 7,191 resolved)

Total: 102,622 (11 presumptive, 102,611 confirmed including 8,504 deaths, 65,419 resolved)

Thursday 6 p.m. Ontario’s public health units are reporting a slight drop the daily tally of new COVID-19 infections, according to the Star’s latest count.

The health units have reported a total of 36,191 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,689 deaths, up a total of 178 new cases since Wednesday evening.

For the last two weeks, the province has seen a string of daily reports around the 200-mark as a steep decline in infections seen since early June appears to be slowing.

On Thursday, the province saw the case growth concentrated in a handful of cities; just Toronto (65 cases), Peel Region (53 cases) and Simcoe Muskoka (12 cases) reported new infections in the double digits.

The total of 12 fatal cases reported Thursday was up slightly from recent trends, but still well down for the province’s peak in early May, when the health units reported as many as 90 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Thursday, the province reported that 270 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 69 in intensive care, of whom 47 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,641, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that, in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

Read', 'Megan Ogilviehealth Reporter', 'Health Reporter', 'Megan Ogilvie Is A Toronto-Based Health Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-26,"In the final weeks of March, after the WHO declared a pandemic and as thousands of patients in New York City hospitals battled COVID-19, Dr. Tali Bogler saw panic in the faces of her pregnant patients.

Expectant parents, already nervous about having a baby, were scared — scared to get sick with the coronavirus, scared to go to hospital, scared about giving birth and parenting in a pandemic.

“You could see the worry, this genuine concern and palpable anxiety when it became apparent COVID-19 was going to be an issue in Toronto,” said Bogler, chair of family medicine obstetrics at St. Michael’s Hospital.

Almost immediately, she and her colleagues knew they had to find a way to ease their patients’ fears. The small team of physicians and medical students turned to social media and launched an Instagram account — Pandemic Pregnancy Guide — on April 4 to provide free, evidence-based health information to new and expectant parents.

Months later, the account has 9,000 followers and has grown in scope, adding heartwarming birth stories from its followers, tailoring content to reflect emerging COVID-19 knowledge and hosting live classes with a range of experts, from NICU doctors to lactation consultants, financial experts to yoga instructors.

Bogler said the account’s popularity is a sign pregnant patients and new parents crave easy access to trusted experts, especially during turbulent times.

“Right away, after our very first post where we introduced ourselves and said what our mission is, the account took off,” said Bogler, also a staff physician in the hospital’s department of family and community medicine.

“We measure our success, not just by our numbers, but what our patients are saying. We get direct messages all the time about how much it means to them, that PPG is their go-to guide during this time of uncertainty.”

Bogler believes Pandemic Pregnancy Guide is one of the first Instagram accounts to offer science-based pregnancy advice directly to patients during the pandemic, and said it could be a model for other patient groups, especially as the pandemic has curbed many in-patient appointments.

The small team of physicians, medical students and residents who run the account don’t receive hospital funding and have declined sponsorship offers. Experts volunteer their time and advice and PPG has so far not partnered with social media influencers, though the team has been approached.

That PPG is volunteer-driven means patients and parents can trust its content, Bogler said.

“As health-care providers, we were clear at the beginning that providing evidence-based information means it needs to be free of influence so it’s reliable,” she said. “We’re not trying to be like a Mommy Facebook Group (though those are important) … it’s really more about offering a multidisciplinary, evidence-based platform — and one run by physicians.”

Nakita Singh has followed PPG since its first post and has watched the account grow in tandem with her pregnancy.

Just days away from giving birth, the Toronto TV producer said PPG has helped her stay healthy, offering tips on everything from breastfeeding to what to pack for the hospital — all from Instagram, an app that she uses every day.

PPG has also helped Singh, a first-time mom and a patient of Bogler’s, feel connected during the months of self-isolation. As PPG gathered followers, more and more asked questions and shared their own experiences and perspectives with the group.

“It’s really helpful to be a part of a community and to know you’re not alone in what you are going through.”

Singh rarely misses any of PPG’s Instagram live classes with experts, especially those focusing on prenatal yoga and mindfulness techniques.

“They were really helpful at the beginning,” she said. “We were in the heat of lockdown, and it was such an anxious time, but so many people could go on that platform and pause for 30 minutes out of their day to focus on their baby and mental health. It was a blessing.”

Bogler, along with Dr. Eliane Shore and Dr. Sheila Wijayasinghe, are the physicians who lead PPG. As mothers, they know first hand the difficulties parents can face in the weeks and months before — and after — birth.

Bogler has twin girls, now two-and-a-half, who spent their first month in the NICU at St. Mike’s. She said that anxiety-ridden experience was tempered by the empathetic care her family received, especially from neonatologist Dr. Douglas Campbell, head of the hospital’s NICU.

“He instilled such calm in me; I wanted to offer that to other parents,” said Bogler, who invited Campbell to do several interview-style videos for the PPG community, including one that focused on whether people with COVID-19 can safely breastfeed. (Campbell told followers that — so far — evidence suggests you can and the known benefits of breastfeeding currently outweigh risks).

“Parents had so many questions about how the virus could impact their baby. I knew he could talk about the evidence and do it in a reassuring way that didn’t instill fear and anxiety.”

Cheyanne Reed, a third-year medical student at the University of Toronto, has been helping write, edit and monitor PPG content since April. She said the experience has complemented her clinical training, which was put on pause during the pandemic, and has taught her how to answer the kinds of questions facing new and expectant parents.

“It’s given me skills to help me communicate with patients,” said Reed, adding that she and the other medical students involved bring their social media and design skills to the project. “We’re tech-savvy; I’ve seen Instagram evolve and a lot of the information we get and digest is through social media.”

Recently, Bogler and her team surveyed PPG’s followers about how the account can best support them as their pregnancies and parenting lives progress along with the pandemic. Some 1,600 people responded, and the team will analyze the findings to guide their path forward.

“The pandemic isn’t ending anytime soon. We need to find out what else our patients need to know.”

Singh, who values the range of diverse voices and perspectives showcased by Pandemic Pregnancy Guide, hopes it will continue beyond the pandemic.

“It appeals to so many different people … It’s very reflective of what’s happening in the world, which is what I love about it,” Singh says.

“It has something there that every woman, every person, can relate to.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Nicholas Keungimmigration Reporter', 'Immigration Reporter', 'Nicholas Keung Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Immigration For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"An Ontario tribunal has struck down a health authority order that restricted bunkhouses to a maximum of three migrant workers during self-isolation, a measure that had been meant to control the spread of COVID-19.

In siding with the challenge by a farm owner, the Health Services Appeal and Review Board ruled the local health officials in Haldimand-Norfolk did not have “reasonable and probable” grounds to impose the measure introduced on March 24.

“The Board finds that the requirement of a maximum of three migrant farm workers per bunkhouse is arbitrary and does not take into account the specifics of each bunkhouse,” the three-member panel concluded in a judgment published Thursday.

“There was no convincing reason given as to why there is a limit of three to a bunkhouse,” the panel said in removing the requirement from the Haldimand-Norfolk Health and Social Services’ self-isolation plan checklist for migrant farm workers.

It also suggested that each bunkhouse would instead have to be evaluated individually to determine the appropriate number of workers able to self-isolate there.

The local health authorities have appealed the board’s decision. The restriction is still in effect until the Ontario Divisional Court hears the case.

“We are disappointed by the board’s decision. While the Health Unit has approved the vast majority of area farmers’ isolation plans, the above changes will mean that increased public health resources will be needed in order to avoid delays in future plan approvals,” the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit said in a statement.

“The Health Unit’s section 22 order is reasonable and effective at protecting farms from the disastrous effects of a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 during migrant workers’ initial self-isolation period.”

On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. A week later, the Ontario government declared a state of emergency. The federal government subsequently imposed border restrictions and a mandatory 14-day isolation on all individuals coming into Canada.

On March 24, Dr. Shanker Nesathurai, Haldimand-Norfolk’s medical officer, issued the local regulations and a checklist that local employers must abide before migrant farm workers are allowed entry to Canada.

Schuyler Farms Ltd. appealed the three-worker-per-bunkhouse rule to the tribunal.

The farm agreed to all other guidance to workers’ self-isolation, but said the bunkhouse capacity requirement was arbitrary and unreasonable.

It argued that farm bunkhouses vary in size and facilities, and questioned why more than three workers could not maintain social distancing in a bunkhouse that measures 5,000 square feet.

Witnesses for the county’s health unit, however, maintained that it was not possible or would be extremely difficult to maintain physical distancing at all times, even in a large bunkhouse, if there were more than three occupants.

The tribunal found “unreasonable” the argument that it’s impossible to self-isolate more than three people in a bunkhouse “regardless of design, size, layout and amenities.”

Brett Schuyler, owner of Schuyler Farms, said farm operators are doing their best to follow the rules and hope to work with local health authorities to resolve their differences, all being well before the appeal drags on in court.

“Our workers’ health, our community’s health and our food security are our pillars. The farm community is hoping to work with the health unit to stop the appeal,” Schuyler told the Star.

“By the time this is heard at the end of July, it’s everybody’s loss.”

Advocates called the tribunal decision a slap in the face of justice, especially during this pandemic, when thousands of migrant farm workers are risking exposure to coronavirus to secure Canada’s food supply.

Hundreds of farm workers in Ontario, many of them seasonal migrant workers, have tested positive for COVID-19, and there have been at least three deaths.

“How many more workers must die before we take steps to level the playing field so workers are accorded fairness and decency?” asked Chris Ramsaroop of Justicia for Migrant Workers.

“We will continue to fight this system of apartheid that treats Black and brown migrants differently because of race and immigration status.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Wanyee Livancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Wanyee Li Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"Melanie is a pink owl. Meeta is a sparkly unicorn.

Three-year-old Ava Carr has been missing her friends from daycare so much, she started naming her stuffies after them. She hasn’t seen the real Melanie and Meeta since their daycare closed in mid-March due to the pandemic.

Since March, Ava’s mother, Maeve Carr, has worked 12-hour days from home while taking care of her toddler. That often means working until 2 a.m. and then rising at 5:30 a.m. to start the day with Ava.

As Ontario begins to ease coronavirus-related restrictions in June, some daycares have been allowed to reopen. Ava’s daycare in Toronto, Deer Park Extended Primary Education Program, was set to reopen on June 22.

Suddenly, Carr could see a light at the end of the tunnel.

Then, at 8:42 p.m. on the Friday before the big day, Carr received an email from the daycare: “It looks like we will not be allowed to open the daycare on Monday,” it read.

The email thread revealed the school board had told the daycare four hours earlier that, in fact, no child-care centres in Toronto schools were allowed to open yet.

“Apologies for the delayed response,” a school board staff member wrote. “We are diligently working with a number of departments and stakeholders to support reopening, but we must ensure that we have processes in place that prioritize health and safety for all.”

Carr, a single parent, was devastated.

Being able to bring Ava back to daycare would have meant a return to some semblance of sanity, she said.

“I have no idea how to live my life right now. I can’t prepare. I can’t tell my boss when things are going to go back to normal,” said Carr, who works in global finance. “I’m the only one with a young child in my department.”

In a memo obtained by the Star, the Toronto District School Board informed child-care operators Wednesday that they could reopen as early as July 2.

But Carr questions why the school board waited until the last moment to tell the Deer Park daycare it could not open the following business day.

“I don’t blame the daycare at all,” said Carr. “I think she was blindsided too.”

The Toronto District School Board told the Star it has been working as quickly as possible to reopen daycares in schools.

“While some child cares may have been ready to reopen earlier, we had to take the necessary time to reopen as safely as possible, and we thank everyone for their patience,” the statement read.

The school board confirmed that daycares with provincial authorization would be able to reopen starting July 2.

But Carr said she has not received any communication from the daycare or the school board since last week.

“There’s been no followup from anybody. There’s no update at all.”

Meanwhile, child-care advocates have criticized the province for not providing enough support, financial and otherwise, to child-care operators struggling to reopen.

The Ontario government announced that daycares across the province would be allowed to reopen starting June 12, provided they follow public health protocols.

Those protocols include, among other things, drop-off and pickup procedures, frequent cleaning and a COVID-19 response plan if a staff member or child gets sick.

In emails sent to parents last week, Deer Park Extended Primary Education Program outlined the steps it had taken to follow these protocols and announced it would open its doors to a handful of families on June 22.

The daycare declined the Star’s interview request but said in a written statement, “The staff worked really hard to prepare for opening and were denied by (the Toronto District School Board).”

The approximately 320 child-care centres on Toronto District School Board property need the board’s permission to reopen.

The daycare’s statement went on to say, “Parents and child-care staff will need to continue to be patient and wait for an announcement for when we can reopen.”

For now, Carr has resigned herself to letting her daughter sit on her lap during her work Zoom meetings. It’s far from ideal, she said.

“Sometimes it’s just better to avoid the occurrence of a meltdown. And then you become the parent who can’t afford to have the noise and the crisis so you give them what they need,” she said. “You give them chocolate. It’s terrible.”

When Ava goes down for her midday nap, Carr will sometimes shut her eyes as well because she gets only a few hours of sleep a night.

Some days, Ava will take her mother on imaginary car rides where they “pick up” her imaginary friends, Virat — embodied by an Elmo stuffy — and Meeta, the unicorn, on the apartment balcony.

“We pretend we are all going to the zoo together,” said Carr. “She is so lonely.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They started out as 11 light blue eggs in a nest that educator Robert Gallo discovered in his Etobicoke backyard after seeing a female mallard duck fly out of a tree. That hatched an idea: Why not start a contest for students to name the duck family, providing teens a little fun while cooped up at home during the pandemic?

“I had 100 submissions within the first day,” said Gallo, who is a vice-principal and new to Toronto Catholic high school Dante Alighieri Academy.

Gallo said he’s a “big fan of play on words,” so in the end he chose the submissions from Grade 12 student Massimo Calabro.

The 18-year-old saw the contest on Instagram and “thought I might give it a shot.” He came up with his ideas “from watching movies, and I just remembered some names and went through actors’ names to see if I could make a duck name out of it,” he said.

“It was fun,” said Calabro, who was awarded a $50 Amazon gift card for his creative efforts. “It gave me a little laugh while I was doing it, too. It’s a little boring being at home all the time … it makes your day a little better.”

Gallo’s own two-year-old son, Nathan, was excited about all the activity in the backyard and even neighbours got involved: one family put out a kiddie pool so the ducks had access to water, and one young elementary student on the street wrote about them for a school project.

“It’s been fascinating to see, a beautiful experience,” Gallo said.

He took precautions for the duck family, putting on porch lights at night to deter possums.

“The wildlife these days is a bit more out there,” he said of his Renforth-Rathburn neighbourhood. “There were wild geese at Keele and Lawrence; it’s kind of like ‘Jumanji.’”

Before the school shutdown, Gallo and Toronto police constable Mike Skelhorne had planned to run a “Kids in the Coop” project for special needs students at Dante, hatching duck eggs. Skelhorne owns a farm and was able to advise Gallo during his backyard pandemic project on “the gestation period and what to do and what not to do. He’s been hatching eggs for quite some time.”

Once the ducklings hatched last weekend, Gallo and wife Angela — who is also a teacher — escorted the whole duck family two kilometres to a pond at Centennial Park, getting a lot of attention and even stopping traffic along the way. (And, as teachers, they kept counting heads during the entire walk.)

Neighbours Debbie and Roman Kolankowski said two adult ducks were frequent visitors to their property, starting in mid-March. The couple filled a garbage can lid with water “and the female would come and sit in that,” while the male “seemed to spend a lot of time in front of the mirror” in their yard.

“We’ve been here for over 20 years and we have always seen ducks. But this is the first time they were in our yard,” said Roman Kolankowski.

They put out the plastic kiddie pool they’d purchased for their two young grandchildren and, given its “Frozen” movie theme, they named their visitors Olaf and Elsa.

“The kids were all involved in it. The grandkids were here when the ducks hatched” last Sunday evening and little Nathan Gallo “thought it was a big thrill,” added Roman Kolankowski.

“It was a great nature experience in the city.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 56 full time DriveTest locations shut down on March 23. According to the Ministry of Transportation, between mid-March and mid-June, the facilities were forced to postpone about 500,000 tests, including 234,000 road tests and more than 260,000 written tests. About 150,000 licence applications were also delayed.

On Monday, all full-time DriveTest centres reopened, with services limited to G1 and M1 knowledge and vision tests, licence exchanges, and commercial licence applications and upgrades. As part of a phased approach, the province intends to offer road tests for G2 and all motorcycle licences starting Aug. 4, before fully reopening the centres by September 8.

In order to reduce crowding and allow for social distancing, this week DriveTest centres are only open to Ontarians born between January and June. Next week they will be accessible for people born in the second half of the year. Access will continue to alternate weekly until the centres fully reopen.

Brampton resident Nicole DeBellefeuille is among those struggling to navigate the booking system as DriveTest attempts to clear its testing backlog. The recent Queen’s law graduate had booked a road test in late March to get her G2, which was a requirement of the articling placement she’s scheduled to start next month.

When the test was cancelled, DeBellefeuille rebooked it online, but as the lockdown persisted her subsequent tests were also scrubbed. After the third time, she was shut out of DriveTest’ss online booking system. She said a note on the website said the three-cancellation limit was in place to prevent people from abusing the system, and couldn’t be overridden.

DeBellefeuille then had to try to book a new test by phone. After calling repeatedly and being placed on hold for an hour, she was told the earliest date she could get was Dec. 10 at a DriveTest in Chatham, nearly three hours from Brampton.

She’s upset that people who booked their tests for August appear to be unaffected by the DriveTest closure, while drivers like her who scheduled theirs months earlier are now facing a lengthy delay.

“Obviously everything is kind of up in the air because of the COVID pandemic, but I don’t think that they really planned this out,” she said.

“I think that they need to have some kind of prioritization in place, either for people who had already booked or people who needed (a licence) for a job.”

Her employer has agreed to let her work at her placement while she waits to get her licence, and she plans to keep calling DriveTest in the hopes an earlier spot opens up. But she’s found the experience “really overwhelming and very frustrating.”

Caledon resident Carolyn Torchia said her 16-year-old son Maverick had a G2 driving test scheduled for March 30. After it was cancelled, she rebooked it only to have it cancelled four more times, including a date scheduled for July. In the meantime Maverick has lost out on two summer jobs he had lined up at local farms because he needs a driver’s licence to be able to use farm vehicles, Torchia said.

After the latest cancellation, Torchia was told the soonest she could book was November in Mississauga, but she has since been able to rebook for early August at a location in Barrie, almost an hour away. She said she’s upset people who booked tests early in the pandemic lost their place and weren’t given an easier route to rebooking.

“They haven’t given any priority to cancelled tests it’s just a free for all,” Torchia said. “And there is no guarantee this won’t get cancelled again.”

In response to questions about how the province is handling the testing backlog, Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Lee Alderson issued a written statement that said the government is aware “there is currently significant demand for driver related products and services due the recent closure of DriveTest Centre locations,” but “protecting people’s health and well-being — especially our most vulnerable — remains our number one priority.”

She said the province has instituted a phased reopening based on medical advice, and the availability of tests “will increase as we progress from one phase to the next phase while considering the safety of both customers and employees.”

She noted that 14 DriveTest locations are offering extended hours and 13 are providing Saturday service in order to help with the backlog. The MTO has also extended the validity of driver’s licences during the pandemic so that none expire. “No one will lose their licence as a result of COVID-19,” Alderson said.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"More than 100,000 Scarborough residents could be without city council representation at Toronto city hall for months.

Jim Karygiannis was ejected from his seat in Ward 22 Scarborough-Agincourt by an appeal court on Wednesday over campaign spending issues from his successful 2018 re-election bid.

When a council seat suddenly becomes vacant due to resignation, death or ejection, the rest of council usually votes to either appoint a replacement or to hold a byelection in the ward so voters can choose a new representative.

Council has a meeting next week. City clerk Ulli Watkiss, in a report released Thursday, suggests Mayor John Tory and the remaining 24 councillors declare the Ward 22 seat vacant, but wait until the Sept. 30 meeting to decide how to fill it.

A requirement that council appoint a replacement or order a byelection within 60 days of the vacancy can be set aside due to provincial emergency orders to deal with the COVID-19 emergency, Watkiss wrote.

“The uncertainty as to how long the emergency will last, and the resulting limitations to the normal operation of the City and the daily life of its residents, are obstacles,” to holding a byelection otherwise meeting the 60-day target, she wrote.

Deferring the decision will allow council to decide when city staff can “report with more certainty about the options available,” Watkiss wrote, adding staff by then will have information about byelection costs, timeliness and pandemic considerations.

Postponing the decision puts it about halfway through the four year council term that ends in the fall of 2022.

It would also leave more than 105,000 residents of northeast Toronto without any political representation at the June and July scheduled council meetings and any emergency meetings called between now and an appointment or byelection.

Kargyiannis’s office staff, working with the city clerk’s office, will continue serving Ward 22 residents who need help with local issues.

Reached Thursday and asked about his ouster, Karygiannis offered only a hoarse “no comment.” When asked if he’ll inform the media about any attempt to challenge the court ruling, he replied, after a long pause: “I will.”

Karygiannis, a former Liberal MP first elected to council in 2014, was automatically removed from office last November after his campaign financial statement showed he had grossly overspent a strict limit in the 2018.

He was soon back in city hall after a Superiour Court judge ruled an error in his 2018 election paperwork was made “inadvertently” and an automatic removal provision created an “absurdity” in provincial law.

Karygiannis was removed again, this time by the appeal court panel that ruled the Superior Court judge did not have jurisdiction to override provincial law and void its penalty.

That penalty includes a provision that, along with being tossed from office, he is forbidden from being appointed back into the seat and also from running in the next general election.

He could ask the Supreme Court of Canada to let him try to overturn the appeal court ruling, and then ask it to suspend the appeal court ruling’s impact until he got an answer.

Instead, the Spanish Flu came in waves that began in July of 1918, cresting and falling three times until largely disappearing in mid-1919. But not before infecting an estimated 500 million people worldwide and killing between 20 million and 50 million.

SARS had a similar pattern in 2003.

Restrictions in Toronto were eased as the first wave of the respiratory syndrome was winding down. But then a single case, a person who remained infectious longer than was typical, sparked a prominent second wave.

Now, as jurisdictions around the world lift restrictions, there is concern that COVID-19 will experience a resurgence. Already some countries such as Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia are experiencing second waves.

And there are fears that regions in South Korea, Germany and the U.K. are on the cusp of a second wave — or already in one.

This at a time when global cases of COVID-19 are rising exponentially, prompting Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, to warn earlier this week that while it took three months for the world to see the first one million infections, the last one million cases took just eight days to appear.

Experts in Canada warn that a second wave here is possible, indeed likely, but predicting exactly when and where is difficult.

“The timing of a second wave will depend on how fast people fatigue and relax their social distancing,” said Chris Bauch, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of Waterloo. “It depends on how soon they drop their physical distancing. As soon as it drops, it comes back. It’s as simple as that.”

Bauch is one of several co-authors of new research (not yet peer-reviewed) that explores a model of interaction between human behaviour and infection dynamics. The researchers found that when fatigue sets in and people start relaxing physical distancing and workplace and school closures, there is a resurgence of infections, resulting in a second or even a third wave of the virus.

“Some populations will not have them but many will because of this so-called behavioural fatigue,” Bauch said, noting that the warmer summer months could also help tamp down transmission, resulting in less severe second waves, especially in Northern Hemisphere countries.

Waves are really just graphical representations of the number of new daily cases over time. Cases go up, crest and come down, creating the shape of a wave. If after cases have dropped, they rise again, that would be considered a second wave.

But Raywat Deonandan, associate professor and epidemiologist at the University of Ottawa, says that there is no scientific definition of a wave in the spread of disease.

He likens the infection waves of a virus to a predator-prey model.

“You’ve got a bunch of rabbits and a bunch of wolves in the same environment. The number of rabbits is high, and once you start introducing the wolves, the wolves eat the rabbits. Then the number of wolves go up because they’re reproducing more. Then as the rabbits disappear, the wolves start dying off.

“So with this disease, it’s a similar idea. The cases were increasing because there was a susceptible population that had never seen it before and suddenly this virus is amongst us — the wolf is amongst us — and as the wolf is increasing its prevalence in the community, the wave’s going up.”

Deonandan added that because of social distancing measures taken by Canadians, the first wave is mostly done here. But that also means that we still have a susceptible population.

“We think that this disease infected fewer than five per cent of the Canadian population, which means that at least 95 per cent are still susceptible,” he said. “And so it’s likely to keep on doing this up and down until herd immunity is achieved.”

It’s an evident pattern for new cases in Iran, which Bauch’s research notes is in the midst of a large second wave thanks to restrictions being lifted in April.

New case data published by Johns Hopkins University shows Iran reached the peak of its first wave on March 30 with 3,186 new cases, before dropping to 802 new cases on May 2. But then the country experienced a resurgence in new infections beginning in May after the government allowed mosques, museums, restaurants, cafés and historic sites to reopen, with a high of 3,574 new cases reported on June 4.

Similarly, Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a second wave that began June 1 after authorities began easing restrictions. The country has experienced record growth rates since then, peaking on June 17 at 4,919 new cases, the largest number of reported cases in a single day for the Persian Gulf nation.

This week, Israel ordered partial lockdowns in some areas as the nation continued to experience a growth in new coronavirus cases following a first wave that saw its seven-day rolling average bottom out at 13 on May 25. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post is reporting that a new projection by the country’s Coronavirus National Information and Knowledge Center is warning of a second wave that could kill hundreds of people this summer.

Closer to home, many U.S. states are seeing a resurgence of new cases, if not a second wave. Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and California, among others, have seen a spike in recent weeks as social distancing measures relaxed. Two weeks ago, the U.S. surpassed two million COVID-19 cases.

On Wednesday, Florida, where pictures of packed beaches have made headlines around the world, set a new single-day record for new COVID-19 cases with 5,511 reported, bringing the total number of reported cases in that state to date to 109,014. (For comparison purposes, Canada as a whole has just over 102,000 confirmed cases).

“Things are opening up and people aren’t wearing masks like they should be,” said Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, noting that even with social distancing, if there is not strong testing and contact tracing in place, the virus is going to spread.

New unpublished COVID-19 modelling by an international team of researchers, including Longini, found that if 50 per cent of symptomatic cases can be identified and 20 to 40 per cent of those can be contact-traced and quarantined, infections would be held to a level that wouldn’t overwhelm the health-care system.

The researchers used real, anonymized data from mobile devices in the Boston area, as well as census and demographic data, to build their model.

“The whole point was if you started opening up without effective testing and contact tracing, you would get an increasing epidemic,” said Longini, noting that the modelling could apply in general to other places.

Countries such as China and Japan haven’t had a second wave.

Bauch says they are managing the pandemic because of ongoing preventative measures, such as mask wearing, social distancing and rapid testing, which enables them to respond to new outbreaks.

“Those are the kinds of things you need to reopen with more confidence,” he said.

The jury is still out as to what a possible second wave in Canada and Ontario could look like, and when it could hit. Many experts suspect an increase in new cases with a return to school in the fall, but whether the numbers will be large enough to constitute a true second wave, no one knows.

“Going from no schools to some form of schools provides a whole new environment for COVID-19 to spread, even if it spreads more slowly among kids, which means that there will be an inevitable uptick in cases,” said Dionne Aleman, a University of Toronto professor and an expert in pandemic modelling.

“If a province is already in the middle of a second wave due to reopening prior to the start of school, extra cases from school-based transmission may or may not be obvious from the curves; it all depends on the magnitude of community-based spread versus school-based spread.”

Deonandan says he suspects a second wave, if there is one, will manifest not so much as a smooth increase and decrease but as a “bunch of small bumps.” He says the public health infrastructure that has been deployed — mask wearing, social distancing, working from home, contact tracing and testing — will allow for officials to descend on cases “and suppress them such that that little wave is bumped down again.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-25,"OTTAWA—A new research project shows women experiencing homelessness in Canada are largely invisible and falling through major gaps in support systems — and into dangerous situations.

The study, led by the Women’s National Housing and Homelessness Network, says the scope is dramatically underestimated because women are more likely to rely on precarious and sometimes dangerous support, such as by sleeping on couches or trading sex for housing.

Studies of homelessness also largely fail to count women fleeing gender-based violence and women trapped in situations of sex trafficking, according to the report.

This means the scale of homelessness among women, girls and gender-diverse people is larger than official estimates would suggest.

“The ways we measure homelessness in Canada often look really at just visible homelessness in the street, but women’s homelessness is really distinct,” said Kaitlin Schwan, senior researcher at the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness, which was involved in the report.

“The hidden nature of women’s homelessness can become invisible at the policy level and so we don’t get the kind of investments and funding that we really need to address the issue.”

Statistics Canada data from 2019 shows emergency shelters for those fleeing gender-based violence were already turning away nearly 1,000 women and children a day before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

The pandemic then caused a strain on existing homelessness resources, with some shelters having to reduce services or close due to public health and physical distancing rules.

Now, with women feeling a disproportionate economic impacts from COVID-19, particularly those who are from racialized communities or single parents, Schwan said she expects more women to be homeless as eviction moratoriums begin to lift, making things more critical.

“COVID is really is going to be disproportionately affecting women, because women are much more likely to live in poverty, much more likely to be working minimum-wage jobs without security, especially if they’re single parents,” she said.

“They are going to be facing a risk of eviction that maybe they hadn’t before, so we’re at risk of having this whole new wave of women across Canada who are becoming homeless for the first time in the context of a system that was already overburdened before COVID.”

The study is the first ever comprehensive national portrait of women’s homelessness, and involved a review of all available evidence on the situation in Canada.

The study also revealed homeless women and LGBTQ people are at much higher risk of violence.

Data shows more than 37 per cent of homeless young women have experienced a sexual assault in the last 12 months, compared to 8.2 per cent of homeless young men. Ninety-one per cent of women experiencing homelessness have experienced an assault in their lifetime.

Also over the last year, more than 35 per cent of LGBTQ youth have experienced a sexual assault, compared to 14.8 per cent of youth who do not identify as LGBTQ.

The report says women who do access emergency shelters are often further harmed by bureaucratic policies, including the prospect of losing custody of their children.

Indigenous women in particular are experiencing the most profound forms of housing need in all parts of the country, and disproportionate levels of violence, the research shows, but they also remain the most underserved when it comes to both those areas of support.

Data shows 70 per cent of northern reserves have no safe houses or emergency shelters for women escaping violence, and shelters in urban centres often do not offer welcoming or culturally appropriate programs or services for Indigenous women.

Schwan says the deeply embedded and systemic shortfalls in housing and social supports for Indigenous women show the issue needs to be tackled beyond expanding emergency homeless supports.

COVID-19 offers Canada an opportunity to reimagine its overall response to homelessness, especially as many public conversations are now focused on systemic barriers that cause disproportionately negative outcomes for some populations, she said.

“Certainly, more funds are needed with respect to addressing this emergency response piece to homelessness, but honestly, more important than that is really investing in increasing our availability of affordable housing,” Schwan said.

“The solution to homelessness to people of all genders is housing.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-25,"VICTORIA—The British Columbia government says it is moving to protect residents and seasonal workers from COVID-19 while ensuring the temporary labourers have a safe place to stay as they work in orchards and fields this summer.

A statement from the Ministry of Agriculture says it is providing funds to local governments to create designated campsite accommodations.

The sites would meet health and safety requirements set by the provincial health officer to slow the spread of COVID-19.

One campsite is planned for the Oliver area in the southern Okanagan and two more are slated for Creston in southeastern B.C., with the province providing about $60,000 for each site.

The ministry says seasonal workers must also complete a new online COVID-19 awareness course outlining the rights and responsibilities of employers and workers to meet B.C.’s pandemic-related rules.

Camping accommodations are also being explored in Summerland, Osoyoos, Naramata and the Similkameen.

Agriculture Minister Lana Popham says creation of the campsites is a step toward ensuring community safety as well as the safety of seasonal workers, who are a “crucial part” of B.C.’s food supply system.

“Our government is protecting these workers and local residents by making sure workers have a safe place to camp and are educated on the rules and guidelines Dr. Bonnie Henry has put in place here in British Columbia,” Popham says in the statement.

The COVID-19 awareness course for seasonal workers includes information on physical distancing, hygiene and cleaning, work pods, transportation, tools and equipment, as well as safeguarding and monitoring health, the ministry says.

The course must be completed by any seasonal worker planning to stay at the campsites.

Read', 'Steve Cornwellmississauga News', 'Mississauga News', 'Steve Cornwellmississauga Newsthu.']",2020-06-25,"Ahmed Ali’s long-standing plans for a March break trip to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, with his wife and two kids really went sideways.

The Mississauga resident booked flights in June 2019 to visit the holy city in March 2020 as part of a pilgrimage that millions of Muslims do each year. He landed in Pakistan first and was originally planning to travel with his family to Saudi Arabia, before returning home within a week on March 22.

COVID-19 and the subsequent cancellation of numerous flights led to Ali, who works as a contract teacher at the Peel District School Board, staying in Pakistan until May 3 and owing thousands to the federal government for emergency loans.

The loans, on which repayment is due in the fall, paid for flights that the Canadian government arranged with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and were much more expensive than pre-COVID-19 fares.

“It's not fair, to be very honest,” said Ali, who is hoping that he can work out a plan with the federal government if he can’t pay the more than $6,000 owed for his family’s airfare home.

“I'm thankful that the government of Canada helped me, but I have been listening to other people from the U.S.A., from England, and they didn't pay that much money to get back.”

In April, one-way flights for U.S. citizens travelling back from Karachi, where Ali and his family flew from, cost around $1,400. Tickets for flights from Islamabad to the United States cost around $2,042.

British repatriation flights that same month from Pakistan to the U.K. approximately cost between $866 and $908.

One-way fares for Ali and his wife Zahida Ahmed on their May 3 flight were around $2,286 each at the time of bookings. Flights back to Canada for Ali’s two children cost around $2,000 in total.

Mississauga Erin-Mills MP Iqra Khalid said she’s been advocating for lower prices, but that the airfares are set by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), not the government.

Khalid also said she doesn’t anticipate late penalties being tacked onto the loans and the government’s focus has been to repatriate first, and worry about the cost later.

“I'm hopeful that those who have had to pay significantly more in order to repatriate to Canada, that they will find equity in their situation,” she said.

There were still 7,258 Canadians in Pakistan as of June 19, according to numbers from the federal government’s voluntary traveller registry.

Global Affairs Canada spokesperson John Babcock said that because the registry is voluntary, it doesn’t provide a “complete picture” of the number Canadians currently in Pakistan.

""A lot of people (were) basically discouraged to take these special flights because of the cost,” said Salman Tariq, who came back to Mississauga with his wife, Kanwal Salman, and two children on an April 23 flight from Pakistan.

Tariq, who ran against Khalid in the 2019 federal election, took the emergency loan for the flight, which cost over $10,000 for the four one-way tickets.

He said wants to see the loans waived because many are already struggling with economic hardships due to COVID-19.

“In this pandemic environment people are already having financial troubles, so this is a big setback,” he said.

Of the more than 4,300 loans the federal government has approved through its COVID-19 emergency program for Canadians abroad, around 300 have been for travel from Pakistan, Babcock said.

Another Mississauga resident, Arslan Razi, said he didn’t get a loan from the Canadian government but borrowed money from family to get back from Pakistan, along with his wife and three children.

He said he has since sold his car to help pay for his tickets.

Ali, Tariq and Razi all said they have yet to be reimbursed for their original flights out of Pakistan that were cancelled.

For Ali, he estimates total costs of the trip to be about $20,000 including accommodations and cancelled flights.

“It's not easy but I wanted to come back because things were not getting better (with COVID-19) in Pakistan,” he said. “Now it's getting worse.”

To date, COVID-19 case numbers are much higher in Pakistan than they are in Canada, but not if adjusted for population.

COVID-19 cases in Pakistan have spiked recently, with more than 100,000 new infections reported in June alone, according to the Pakistan government.

Canada’s more than 8,400 COVID-19-related deaths are more than double those in Pakistan, which has reported more than 3,500 deaths in the country.

Read', 'Giuseppe Valiantethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Giuseppe Valiantethe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-06-25,"MONTREAL—Quebec’s public health director says the province has reached a turning point in its management of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore authorities will no longer be releasing daily data related to coronavirus infections.

“Over the course of the past few weeks, the different indicators ... that we’ve been following closely regarding the number of cases, number of hospitalizations and deaths, are all down,” Dr. Horacio Arruda told reporters Thursday. “We are really in a total decline all over Quebec, even in the greater Montreal area.”

Arruda’s explanation for the new policy on publishing data came as he announced that virtually all businesses, services and activities can reopen across the province, including bars, spas and casinos.

He said he made the decision to switch to weekly updates despite his worry that Quebecers are taking the virus less seriously.

“It’s not a question of transparency,” Arruda said in Montreal. He said the overall decline in cases means daily numbers don’t provide an accurate reflection of the situation in the province.

“Be assured that the moment when we think there is a change in the epidemiology, and people need to be informed, and it becomes pertinent — we will do it.”

The province reported Thursday 142 new cases of COVID-19 — almost triple the number from Wednesday — as well as seven additional deaths attributed to the virus. Arruda said Thursday’s jump is “relatively small” and he noted that hospitalizations continue to decline.

The decision to end the daily updates — announced quietly Wednesday on a provincial holiday — came after Premier François Legault named a new health minister, Christian Dubé, on Monday.

Dubé replaced Danielle McCann, who had led the department through the COVID-19 crisis. The disease has devastated the province’s long-term-care homes, where roughly 64 per cent of Quebec’s 5,448 deaths attributed to the virus occurred.

In Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and federal health authorities were cautious in their assessment of Quebec’s decision to end daily updates.

Trudeau told reporters “every province makes its own decisions about how transparent it needs to be,” but he noted that Quebec still has “a significant number of cases every day, significant number of deaths, unfortunately, every single day.”

He added: “I certainly hope that Premier Legault will continue to be transparent with Quebecers and indeed with all Canadians as he has been from the very beginning.”

Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, told reporters Thursday that provinces should be regularly warning people to continue to follow health directives, such as regular handwashing and physical distancing.

Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu echoed Njoo’s statement, adding that what’s most important is for provincial health authorities to rapidly share COVID-19 data with Ottawa.

“It’s important for Canadians not to think this is over in any sense of the word,” she said. “Although we are out of the surge that we saw in March, we are putting out localized fires ... We still have an important role to play, no matter where we live, to make sure those fires don’t reignite.”

Quebec now has a total of 55,079 cases, including 23,786 that are considered recovered.

Arruda said Quebec has fully controlled its COVID-19 outbreak, even within long-term-care homes. And he said his office is now taking a “different approach” in announcing what parts of the economy can reopen.

“Starting today, rather than saying what we are reopening, we are saying what is staying closed,” he said. With a few exceptions, every business, activity or service that had not reopened is now allowed to resume operations, Arruda said.

The only exceptions are festivals and large gatherings, sleepover summer camps and combat sports. Those are still too risky because they encourage close contact, he said.

Bars and clubs, he added, can reopen, but only for a seated clientele — and no dancing will be allowed.

And despite his good news for the many business owners who can now reopen, Arruda said he is still worried that Quebecers are dropping their guard and taking the virus less seriously.

People still need to keep a two-metre distance from one another, wash their hands frequently and wear a mask in public, Arruda said. If they don’t, he warned, “we’re going to pay dearly. Either in the fall or maybe even before.”

Read', 'Hyung-Jin Kimthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Associated Press Journalists Chang Yong Jun In Seoul', 'Mari Yamaguchi In Tokyo Contributed To This Report.', 'Hyung-Jin Kimthe Associated Pressthu.']",2020-06-25,"SEOUL, KOREA, REPUBLIC OF—North and South Korea on Thursday separately marked the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War with largely subdued commemorations amid the coronavirus pandemic, a day after the North abruptly halted a pressure campaign against the South.

South Korea issued a joint statement with the United States, which fought alongside it during the 1950-53 war triggered by a surprise North Korean invasion. The U.S. still stations about 28,500 soldiers in South Korea in what North Korea views as a military threat.

In the statement, South Korean Defence Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo and U.S. Defence Secretary Mark T. Esper said they “commit to strengthening and adapting the alliance to meet present and future challenges” and urged North Korea to implement past disarmament pledges.

Jeong and other South Korean military leaders later paid their respects at a national cemetery in Seoul, where about 130,000 war-related dead, mostly South Korean soldiers, are buried or honoured.

They were given special permission to enter Seoul National Cemetery, which has imposed entry restrictions amid a resurgence of the coronavirus in recent weeks. The cemetery received about 530,000 visitors in June last year but only about 61,000 this month, according to cemetery officials.

A war museum in Seoul, normally a popular place to visit on the war’s anniversary or on Memorial Day on June 6, remained shut Thursday.

In the evening, South Korea held a ceremony with 300 war veterans, bereaved relatives and government officials at a military airport near Seoul. It was far less than the 4,000 people who attended last year, according to Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs.

During the ceremony, President Moon Jae-in said he hopes North Korea will “boldly embark on an endeavour to end the most sorrowful war in world history.” He said the two Koreas must achieve peace first before being able to see the path to reunification.

North Korea marked the anniversary with visits to monuments to late soldiers and with anti-U.S. rhetoric and newspaper editorials praising its fighting in “the Fatherland Liberation War.”

An institute run by the North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that “we will continue to build up our strength to overwhelm the persistent nuclear threats that the U.S. has launched at us.”

The main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said in an editorial that, “The spirit of defending the country in the 1950s which brought about a victory after defeating the aggressors is valuable mental heritage to be glorified forever, generation after generation.”

Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which handles relations with North Korea, said there were no signs that North Korea had organized mass public events commemorating the anniversary.

North Korea considers July 27, the day when the war’s armistice was signed in 1953, a bigger anniversary because it views it as the day of its war victory. But the North held a mass public rally in Pyongyang, its capital, on the 65th anniversary of the war’s start in 2015, the Unification Ministry said.

Seventy years after the war’s beginning, the Korean Peninsula remains technically in a state of war because the armistice that ended the fighting has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty. Animosity has deepened recently as North Korea resumed aggressive rhetoric toward South Korea, blew up a Seoul-built liaison office on its territory and threatened to take steps to nullify 2018 tension-reduction deals.

“Seventy years have passed but nothing has changed ... and we’re tired of that,” Kim Young-man, the son of a South Korean soldier killed during the war, said at the Seoul cemetery.

Observers believe North Korea is trying to wrest concessions from Seoul and Washington amid stalled nuclear talks. Japanese Defence Minister Taro Kono told reporters Thursday that he believes North Korea might have attempted to divert public attention away from problems such as the coronavirus.

North Korea has steadfastly claimed it hasn’t recorded a single virus case, but foreign experts are highly skeptical. They believe the pandemic worsened economic troubles in North Korea because it has closed its border with China, its biggest trading partner and economic pipeline.

On Wednesday, North Korea said leader Kim Jong Un put off planned steps to end the 2018 deals after he and other senior ruling party officials in charge of military affairs “took stock of the prevailing situation.”

Experts say North Korea may be trying to leave room for South Korean concessions or may be worried about a stronger response from Seoul, whose help it may need again when it wants to reach out to the United States for future talks.

The Korean War left millions of people dead, injured or missing and destroyed much of the two Koreas. About 36,000 U.S. soldiers were also killed.

During the military airport event, Moon reviewed an honour guard ceremony for the arrival from the United States of the remains of 147 South Korean soldiers killed during the war. North Korea earlier sent the remains to the U.S., where forensic reviews found they were South Korean. Moon said the return of “these valiant warriors” makes “us feel sad but proud” and that “we will engrave their names in our history.”

Quarantine might be in the cards,"['Michael Hill', 'Mhmichael Hillthe Associated Pressthu.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Michael Hillthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Contributing To This Report Were Associated Press Writers Marina Villeneuve In Albany', 'N.Y.', 'Susan Haigh In Hartford', 'Connecticut']",2020-06-25,"New York, Connecticut and New Jersey asked Wednesday for travellers from states with high coronavirus infection rates to go into quarantine for 14 days in a bid to preserve hard-fought gains as caseloads rise elsewhere in the country.

“We now have to make sure the rates continue to drop,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday at a briefing in New York City, joined via video by Govs. Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Ned Lamont of Connecticut, both fellow Democrats. “We also have to make sure the virus doesn’t come on a plane again.”

What was presented as a “travel advisory” that starts Thursday affects three adjacent Northeastern states that managed to check the spread of the virus this spring as New York City became a hot spot for the pandemic.

Travellers from more than a half-dozen states, including Florida and Texas, are currently impacted. The quarantine will last two weeks from the time of last contact within the identified state.

The announcement comes as summer travel to the states’ beaches, parks and other attractions — not to mention New York City — would normally swing into high gear.

It also marks a flip-flop in the COVID-19 battle since March, when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, both Republicans, separately issued orders requiring people flying in from the New York tri-state area, where cases were surging, to quarantine for 14 days.

Now, Florida and Texas are among the struggling states being eyed warily by the three northern governors.

“As Gov. DeSantis said on Saturday, Governors have a prerogative to do what they need to do,” press secretary Cody McCloud said. “He just asks that Floridians not be quarantined in the nursing homes in New York.”

Murphy called a quarantine the smart thing.

“We have taken our people, the three of us, these three states, to hell and back,” Murphy said. “The last thing we need to do right now is subject our folks to another round.”

The states will relay the quarantine message on highways, at airports, and through websites and social media. Lamont signed an executive order on Wednesday evening requiring such messages be posted at all major points of entry into the state and at the state’s airports. He said the governors plan to also ask hotels and vacation rental companies to tell guests from affected states.

Lamont’s order also allows the state’s public health commissioner to make exceptions for essential workers and for “other extraordinary circumstances” when a quarantine is not possible.

Enforcement will vary by state. The Cuomo administration said violators in New York will be subject to mandatory quarantine and face fines from $2,000 (U.S.) to $10,000. Violators could be discovered at business meetings or during a traffic stop, he said.

It was not clear what, if any, penalties violators in New Jersey and Connecticut will face.

Lamont described the quarantine as “urgent guidance.” Murphy called it a “strong advisory ... to do the right thing.”

The quarantine applies to people coming from states with a positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents on a seven-day average, or with a 10 per cent or higher positivity rate over seven days.

As of Wednesday, states over the threshold were Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, Cuomo said.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said later Wednesday that his state was erroneously included on the list.

A spokeswoman for Cuomo, Caitlin Girouard, said there had been an initial discrepancy with Washington’s reporting, but “they have since corrected it and we have removed them from the list of states under travel advisory.”

The order appears to apply to President Donald Trump, who was in Arizona on Tuesday and is slated to go to Bedminster, New Jersey, this weekend.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email Wednesday that standard procedures were in place in Arizona to ensure the president did not come into contact with anyone who was symptomatic or had not been tested.

“It could come back and we can have a second wave arriving by jet airplane a second time,” Lamont said. “And right now, they wouldn’t necessarily be coming from China. They could be coming from one of six or seven or eight states that have a very high positivity rate.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"They never thought they’d miss school so much.

But after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and everyone went into lockdown, the class of 2020 says it was the routine things they longed for the most — hanging out in the hallways with friends, talking to teachers.

It was not an easy year — the shutdown came on the heels of educators’ one-day strikes and work-to-rule — but definitely memorable.

There was “tremendous difficulty and personal adversity” this year, Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Wednesday at Queen’s Park, during a virtual graduation address with Premier Doug Ford and Raptors superfan Nav Bhatia. “Yet the history books will reflect with pride on you. Because when faced with a real obstacle, you showed your family, your educators and your country that nothing can stop you.”

The Star spoke to 11 graduates from elementary and high schools, several of them honoured to be their class’s valedictorian, in Greater Toronto about life under lockdown and their hopes for what lies ahead.

Ivy Deng, Earl Haig Secondary, Toronto

Her final year of high school? “Like an amazing novel that ended in the middle.”

During the shutdown, she started baking bread and having daily family dinners in the backyard followed by evening bike trips — time she treasured before heading away this fall to the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of business.

When school was in, she remembers one beloved, long-time visual arts teacher walking across the icy parking lot on a cold day. The whole class pressed their faces against the window, worried about his safety. When he came into the room, “we all stood up and started clapping and chanting (his name) … people even randomly started crying.”

“This experience illustrated how closely my class had bonded over these four years,” she said. She wishes “we could’ve spent a bit more time together before our final goodbye.”

Zaiboon Azhar, Woburn Collegiate, Scarborough

She spent the lockdown doing homework — and home workouts — and helped her sister with her new baking business. And although she missed school, “this was down time that a lot of people needed,” said Azhar, who heads to the University of Toronto this fall to study international relations.

Zaiboon’s best time in Grade 12 was a school assembly before the winter break where she performed with the dance team. “It was a feeling of being so involved and so together with the graduating class,” she said. “That’s a good memory that I really hold close to my heart.”

Senior year, she added “is one of those years you look forward to every year — there’s this vision for senior year that it’s fun and exciting, and we were missing out on it all.”

Nelson Lee, Marc Garneau Collegiate, East York

After strikes and work-to-rule job action by staff and teachers, “COVID-19 really amplified” what was already a tough year, Nelson said.

He was proud to have held the first mental health awareness month at the school, and then spirit events online after schools were closed. He also started a YouTube channel highlighting high school life as well as tips on getting into university. Nelson got early acceptance into engineering at the University of Toronto.

“I missed my friends and the entire atmosphere — being in the TOPS (science) program I always felt a motivation from students to push myself to another level.

“With online classes, we don’t feel that same motivation that we have when we are beside friends.”

Hadassah Myers, White Haven PS, Scarborough

She started school busy with athletic council and flag football and was looking forward to the Grade 8 grad trip to Niagara Falls. But that didn’t happen.

“I never imagined I could miss school this much. I miss my friends the most and just not being inside” for such a prolonged period, Hadassah said.

“We need to stay positive,” she added. “I know a lot of the Grade 8s are sad because things were cancelled. But we need to focus on the bigger issues” and to “keep up with current events and encourage others do to the same — speak up, challenge things.”

She’s heading to Agincourt Collegiate in the fall, and hopes to become a lawyer.

Luca Caruso LeMay, White Haven PS, Scarborough

Luca plays percussion for the school’s concert band, which took only one trip. Other than that, he said there wasn’t a lot going on in Grade 8. After schools were closed, Luca’s music teacher gave kids fun assignments, such as bucket drumming.

“I stay at home and once in a while go to Costco — that’s the most eventful thing I will do,” he said.

“I think a lot of Grade 8s, like myself, are kind of disappointed. It’s not the best ending to elementary.”

But, he added, “we still have high school ... we have to keep optimistic, keep our hopes up for the future. The number of (COVID-19) cases is going down ... we are going to have a good time (at Agincourt Collegiate), and there are more memories to make.”

Julienne Espiritu, Francis Libermann Catholic Secondary, Scarborough

Julienne “cherishes” the carefree feeling she had before the pandemic, when students were looking forward to grad, prom and the senior prank.

“Even being in the hallways and those classrooms,” she said wistfully, “I never thought I would miss school so much. I definitely think that it was a very hard year to get through, but it made me appreciate those moments more.”

Her school has planned a “drive-thru” graduation. As valedictorian, she will “thank my fellow grads for staying strong. It’s not the senior year we wanted — it’s not the year we wanted at all, period ... (and) even though it’s been hard, I want them to keep the same fire and energy they had at the start of the year.”

She heads to Carleton University this fall for public affairs and policy management.

Charmi Sanghvi, Fletcher’s Meadow Secondary, Brampton

She’s sad about missing out on the tradition of “senior’s sunrise,” when graduating students meet at their school at about 4:30 a.m. for a breakfast picnic.

The valedictorian — who kept busy pre-pandemic with sports, student council and school fundraisers — said she’s going to tell her fellow graduates that while they might feel “down about everything, they put in so much hard work over the years” and they must not lose sight of that.

“I came to realize we missed our teachers, we missed the social (life), we missed sports and clubs and we missed the few months of our senior year when we had the chance to make life-changing memories.”

She’s heading to Queen’s University this fall to study commerce.

Mohamad-Hassan Bahsoun, Dunbarton HS, Pickering

Ramadan fell during quarantine and as one of the leaders of his school’s Muslim students association, Mohamad-Hassan arranged to have friends post online “what they were having for dinner — when the sun came down and they could eat” as a way to keep everyone connected.

The student activity council arranged daily games or yoga via livestream and have asked Grade 12s to share where they are going to university and post photos. Mohamad-Hassan is going to McMaster for engineering.

The valedictorian said his speech “might be a little sad because I might talk about corona and how we were all separated from each other. I will talk about the whole Black Lives Matter movement, and how when we work together, we can create positive change.”

Michelle Chou, Bayview Secondary, Richmond Hill

This valedictorian said she is going to focus her speech “reflecting on the year … (and) how our generation is rebuilding.”

Michelle said once schools closed “we got too much of what we wanted … too much of a break.

But she was able to take the time to starting painting, play frisbee and go on runs and walks. “I used to think walking by myself was boring,” she added. “But now, it’s really refreshing. I appreciate the small things in life.”

Michelle is heading to Queen’s this fall to study commerce.

Dorian Knight, Thomas A. Blakelock, Oakville

Before the shutdown, Dorian was busy with school, band and extracurriculars. But he and his friends joke that since COVID-19 hit, life actually got busier — from Zoom meetings to online hangouts.

He’s also spent the shutdown honing his valedictorian speech, talking about how helping others has “boundless impact.”

“From everything I’ve observed, all the marches, the protests, the town halls and the paradigm-shifting discussions, it is clear that our generation is the generation of impact. From a young age, we have been acutely aware of the types of strife and difficulties that exist in our society … we’d rather choose to rise up and make the changes we wish to see, the changes that the world needs.”

Dorian is heading to McMaster this fall for biomedical engineering/health sciences.

Sheanne Jesudhason, Holy Name of Mary Secondary, Brampton

This week would have been her graduation — and she would have been valedictorian. Instead, Sheanne and some friends are going to pick up their gowns from school and on Friday meet at someone’s house to take grad photos.

“That will be the first time all of us are meeting in person,” she said.

“I think for most people, for the first couple of weeks we thought it was relaxing … then when the extensions kept going … we took back everything we said” and wanted things to be back to normal.

“It feels like we have missed a major milestone,” she said.

She’s going to York University in the fall for a concurrent education and business and society program.

Read', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-06-25,"A new study finds the proportion of Canadian COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in long-term care facilities is about twice the average of rates from other developed nations.

The analysis released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information provides a damning snapshot of senior care as of May 25, when LTC residents made up 81 per cent of all reported COVID-19 deaths in the country compared to an average of 42 per cent among all countries studied.

The data compares Canada’s record to that of 16 other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The proportion of LTC deaths ranged from less than 10 per cent in Slovenia and Hungary to 31 per cent in the United States to 66 per cent in Spain.

At 5,324, the reported number of LTC deaths in Canada was near the average but data varied widely among countries: from 28 in Australia to 30,000 in the U.S., with more than 10,000 in France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.

Researchers point to limitations that prevent some comparisons — countries vary in COVID-19 testing and reporting practices, and in their definition of long-term care.

In addition, COVID-19 cases are often under-reported and in the case of Italy, data was available from only 52 per cent of the nursing homes operating in the country.

Nevertheless, Tracy Johnson, CIHI’s director of health systems analysis and emerging issues, says the data offers valuable insight into a tragedy many families, caregivers and residents have been trying to illustrate since the pandemic began.

Johnson notes countries that implemented additional LTC precautions at the same time as standard stay-at-home orders had fewer LTC infections and deaths.

That includes Australia, Austria and Slovenia, which ordered broad LTC testing and training, isolation wards to manage clusters, surge staffing, specialized teams and personal protective equipment.

Johnson says the findings suggest such measures could be key to mitigating the impact of a possible second wave.

But for now, she notes several of Canada’s hardest-hit facilities are still grappling with the devastating fallout of existing infections.

“Even if all of these (measures are instituted) there will be other folks who will die because some people are infected right now, still, and the outbreaks are still ongoing,” she says.

“Some of the control measures though will probably help to at least keep the rates the same as they are.”

The contrast in LTC deaths is even more stark between provinces and territories, says the report, which notes LTC deaths represented more than 70 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta and 97 per cent of all deaths in Nova Scotia.

There were none in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the territories at the time of the study. Two LTC residents have since died in New Brunswick.

Dr. Roger Wong, clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia, says the numbers are “very concerning” and point to long-standing systemic problems that include inadequate staffing and resources and inconsistent standards.

“There needs to be a fundamental reprioritization, focusing attention and resources, time and effort into the sector right away. Because I can tell you that what COVID-19 has shown us in terms of a major lesson is a fragmentation (of) seniors’ care,” Wong says from Vancouver.

“Which means it makes it more difficult for all of us to support our older Canadians with equal and consistent access to the services that are necessary, based on their care needs at their age.”

Wong is part of a federal task force working on national recommendations on how best to help LTC homes battle COVID-19.

He says he recently spoke to a Senate standing committee on the topic, drawing on data from June 1 when reports of LTC deaths totalled 6,007, or 82 per cent of deaths.

Wong encourages more specific training in geriatric and palliative care as well as psychiatry. And he suggests it’s time to put provincially driven long-term care mandates under the Canada Health Act.

“I see the federal government having its role in terms of setting the national standards and benchmarking so that expectations are set (and) no matter which province or territory our older Canadians are living in they can be protected in the same way under that framework,” says Wong.

“(For) individual provinces and territories, it is about implementation of those national, federally set benchmarks and standards.”

6 p.m. Ontario’s public health units are reporting a slight drop the daily tally of new COVID-19 infections, according to the Star’s latest count.

The health units have reported a total of 36,191 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,689 deaths, up a total of 178 new cases since Wednesday evening.

For the last two weeks, the province has seen a string of daily reports around the 200-mark as a steep decline in infections seen since early June appears to be slowing.

On Thursday, the province saw the case growth concentrated in a handful of cities; just Toronto (65 cases), Peel Region (53 cases) and Simcoe Muskoka (12 cases) reported new infections in the double digits.

The total of 12 fatal cases reported Thursday was up slightly from recent trends, but still well down for the province’s peak in early May, when the health units reported as many as 90 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Thursday, the province reported that 270 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 69 in intensive care, of whom 47 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,641, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that, in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases. This means they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4.33 p.m. There are 102,576 cases of COVID-19 in Canada, including 8,501 deaths, and 65,361 resolved, according to The Canadian Press.

This breaks down as follows (NOTE: The Star does its own count for Ontario; see this file):

Quebec: 55,079 confirmed (including 5,448 deaths, 23,786 resolved)

Ontario: 34,205 confirmed (including 2,641 deaths, 29,528 resolved)

Alberta: 7,825 confirmed (including 153 deaths, 7,134 resolved)

British Columbia: 2,849 confirmed (including 171 deaths, 2,516 resolved)

Nova Scotia: 1,061 confirmed (including 63 deaths, 998 resolved)

Saskatchewan: 759 confirmed (including 13 deaths, 648 resolved)

Manitoba: 305 confirmed (including seven deaths, 294 resolved), 11 presumptive

Newfoundland and Labrador: 261 confirmed (including three deaths, 258 resolved)

New Brunswick: 165 confirmed (including two deaths, 143 resolved)

Prince Edward Island: 27 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Repatriated Canadians account for 13 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Yukon: 11 confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Northwest Territories: five confirmed, all of which have been resolved

Nunavut reports no confirmed cases.

1:30 p.m.: Ontario’s nursing homes are making progress on ending outbreaks of COVID-19, with the number of homes dipping below 60 for the first time in weeks even as residents and staff continue to catch the virus.

There were 57 outbreaks at long-term-care facilities on Thursday, the Ministry of Health reported, down from 62 the previous day. The number had been stalled in the mid-60s for much of June.

But daily statistics show new cases continuing to develop, with 44 more nursing-home residents and 53 more staff members taking ill with the highly contagious novel coronavirus in the last two days.

1:20 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford is urging Ottawa to keep the border with the U.S. closed.

“I just don’t think we’re ready,” Ford says.

Unlike Quebec, Ontario will continue the daily release of COVID-19 data. Health Minister Christine Elliott says Ontarians have the right to know.

1:05 p.m.: Premier Doug Ford announces $13 million for community-driven and youth-led projects to improve well-being of families facing economic and social barriers.

11:55 a.m.: CEC Entertainment Inc., the parent of Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza, filed for bankruptcy protection after the coronavirus pandemic shuttered its locations and kept families at home.

The filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas makes CEC the latest in a string of companies upended by Covid-19. Lockdowns have drained revenue, keeping consumers at home and pushing corporations into bankruptcy.

CEC, acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc. in a 2014 leveraged buyout, has more than 600 Chuck E. Cheese outlets and over 120 Peter Piper Pizza venues.

As of June 24, 266 company-operated Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza restaurant and arcade venues have re-opened, CEC said in a statement. It expects to maintain operations in theses locations during the Chapter 11 process, and to open additional locations each week. CEC franchised locations operate under separate legal and financial structures and are not included in the Chapter 11 filings, the company said.

The company filed for bankruptcy protection without a deal in place. It said it will use the bankruptcy process to continue discussions with its stakeholders and landlords to achieve a balance sheet restructuring that “supports its re-opening and longer-term strategic plans.”

Both loan and bondholders to CEC were contemplating putting new money into the business to keep it afloat, Bloomberg reported last week. They brought in advisors to help them evaluate options, including fresh capital to help CEC ride out the pandemic.

11:50 p.m.: Quebec is reporting 142 new cases of COVID-19 on what health officials say will be the final day they release daily data on the pandemic.

The number is a jump from Wednesday, when the province reported 53 new cases, and it brings the provincial total to 55,079.

The decision announced Wednesday to end daily updates on the situation in the province comes after Premier Francois Legault named a new health minister, Christian Dube, on Monday.

Alexandre Lahaie, spokesman for Dube, said the decision came from the Health Department and not from the new minister.

A Health Department spokesperson said the province is switching to weekly updates, to be issued every Thursday, because the epidemiological situation is stabilizing.

Health authorities also today reported seven new deaths attributed to COVID-19 — six that occurred in the past 24 hours and one that occurred before June 17, for a total of 5,448.

10:38 a.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government will invest to create 10,000 new job placements for young people between the ages of 15 and 30 through the Canada Summer Jobs Program.

Another 20,000 job placements will be made available for post-secondary students through the Student Work Placement Program.

8:45 a.m.: The number of laid-off workers who applied for unemployment benefits in the U.S. declined slightly to 1.48 million last week, the 12th straight drop and a sign that layoffs are slowing but are still at a painfully high level.

The steady decline in claims suggests that the job market has begun to slowly heal from the pandemic, which shuttered businesses and sent the unemployment rate up to 14.7 per cent in April, its highest level since the Great Depression. The total number of people who are receiving jobless aid also fell last week, evidence that employers are rehiring some of the workers who had been laid off since mid-March.

8 a.m.: Export Development Canada says trade confidence among Canadian exporters hit all-time low in its latest survey due to the economic shock as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The export credit agency says its trade confidence index fell to 56.0 compared with 69.3 per cent at the end of 2019.

The economy plunged into recession earlier this year after public health restrictions forced the closure of non-essential businesses in a bid to slow the spread of the pandemic.

7:03 a.m. A surge of coronavirus cases in India’s capital and largest city is overwhelming its health-care system, as the world’s second-most-populous country becomes a major focus in the global pandemic.

New Delhi, a sprawling metropolis of some 30 million people, has rocketed to the top of the country’s regional coronavirus sick list as cases have rapidly multiplied in recent weeks.

The central government took control of the local health-care response earlier this month — with the country’s powerful home minister overseeing it personally — in the midst of government warnings that some 80,000 hospital beds will be needed by the end of next month. That vastly exceeds the nearly 13,200 beds available across state-run and private hospitals in the city. Almost half of those are currently occupied, according to a government mobile app tracker.

The capital expects coronavirus infections to soar to 550,000 by the end of July, up from the 70,390 cases reported through June 24. Well over 3,000 new cases have appeared every day so far this week, vaulting Delhi past India’s second-largest metropolis and other major hot spot, Mumbai, where a population of some 25 million has recorded 68,481 cases as of June 24. So far, 2,365 people have died of the disease in Delhi.

6:23 a.m.: Demand in U.S. hospitals for a cheap, commonly used steroid has surged more than six-fold since U.K. research showed it reduced the mortality of patients who are severely ill with Covid-19.

Vizient Inc., a drug-purchasing group that works with more than half of the U.S. hospitals and health systems, said in a report Thursday that in six days orders for dexamethasone increased 610 per cent. Meanwhile, the so-called fill rate of dexamethasone fell from 97 per cent to 54 per cent, suggesting that as demand increased, hospitals have been able to buy little more than half of the amount they ordered.

Researchers and drug companies are trying to identify or develop vaccines and treatments that work to minimize hospitalizations and deaths caused by the novel coronavirus. Dexamethasone, introduced in the 1960s, is a generic drug that is used to treat inflammatory disorders and some cancers. Clinicians are using it to treat the most severe patients who require oxygen or a ventilator for assistance breathing.

Steven Lucio, vice president of pharmacy solutions at Vizient, said that even with a decrease in fill rates, the drug is still reaching hospitals around the U.S. Vizient categorizes dexamethasone as a “high impact” drug on its essential medicines list.

“If you don’t have these medicines, you shouldn’t have the doors of your hospital open,” said Lucio.

6:05 a.m.: In China, where the virus first appeared late last year, an outbreak in Beijing appeared to have been brought under control. China reporting 19 newly confirmed cases nationwide amid mass testing in the capital. Case numbers both nationally and in Beijing were up by only single digits from Wednesday.

South Korea was still struggling to quell an outbreak there, reporting 28 new cases on Thursday, mostly associated with nightlife, churches, a huge e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sales. But the numbers have not reached the hundreds of new cases every day in late February and early March.

6 a.m.: In Amsterdam, it appeared weeks before the first case was confirmed.

In the northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin, it was already there in wastewater in December, well before patients started showing up sick in hospitals.

And now in Toronto, researchers at Ryerson University are looking to sewage to track remnants of the virus that causes COVID-19, hoping that what we flush down the toilet can help provide an early warning system for a dreaded second wave of the disease. It could even identify spikes in hot spots around the city, they say, and no one can opt out.

6 a.m.: India says it will carry out a massive survey for the coronavirus targeting the entire population in New Delhi of 29 million.

Officials will go each household to record each resident’s health details, and administer a test for the virus to those who show or report symptoms.

The exercise will be completed by July 6, according to a plan issued by the government of New Delhi, the worst-hit city in the country with 70,390 confirmed cases.

Police will be deployed to enforce physical distancing and prevent the mixing of the population inside more than 200 containment zones in the capital, where large clusters of cases have been confirmed. CCTV or drone monitoring will also be used.

6 a.m.: The number of coronavirus infections in Indonesia surpassed 50,000 Thursday, an increase that is worrying experts at a time when the government is allowing businesses to resume operations amid increasing economic pressure.

The spiking case numbers in the world’s fourth-most populous country align with the country’s increasing testing capacity, which have averaged close to the government’s daily target of 20,000 over the past week, said Achmad Yurianto, the spokesman for the National COVID-19 Task Force.

But skepticism remains over the ability of the government to conduct enough tests to determine the true spread of the virus in the Southeast Asian nation, which is home to more than 270 million people living on thousands of islands.

The task force said Thursday afternoon the coronavirus has infected 50,187 people and killed at least 2,620 in Indonesia, the highest number of cases and fatalities in Southeast Asia. That’s up from just two positive cases in early March.

There are 20,449 patients who have recovered from the illness nationwide.

5:55 a.m.: The federal government is to launch a program today aimed at encouraging students to volunteer in the fight against COVID-19 — more than two months after first announcing it and just in time for those who haven’t been able to find a summer job.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also expected to announce a substantial increase in funding for a host of other existing programs, like Canada Summer Jobs, aimed at creating thousands of new opportunities for youth.

Back in April, Trudeau announced creation of the Canada Student Service Grant, a way of giving students who can’t find a summer job a chance to earn some money while volunteering in “national service” activities related to fighting the pandemic.

Eligible students are to receive grants of $1,000 to $5,000 to support the costs of post-secondary education in the fall.

3:13 a.m. Governments and businesses are ramping up precautions as coronavirus case numbers rise to dire new levels in parts of the U.S. and around the world, potentially wiping out two months of progress.

Indonesia was expected to pass the 50,000 mark for confirmed infections on Thursday. In Melbourne, health workers planned to go door-to-door to test more than 100,000 residents in a coronavirus hot spot that threatens to undo the nation’s success in battling the virus.

In the Indian capital of New Delhi, which has reported more than 70,000 cases, authorities said they would conduct house-to-house screening over the coming two weeks. With the city’s hospitals overwhelmed, military personnel were providing care at makeshift medical wards fashioned from railroad coaches.

India reported a record high 16,922 cases on Thursday, taking the national total to 473,105, with nearly 15,000 deaths.

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the continent’s cases have surged to more than 336,000, up by 10,000 from a day earlier. The Africa CDC chief said the pandemic on the 54-nation continent “is picking up speed very quickly” while shortages of testing materials and medical equipment remain severe in many countries.

The actual numbers of cases everywhere, are thought to be far higher due to a number of reasons including limited testing.

World financial markets were rattled by the setbacks in fighting the pandemic, which cloud prospects for recoveries of economies mired in their worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Wednesday 10:26 p.m. Mongolia’s ruling party retained a supermajority after parliamentary elections, as the government’s relative success against the coronavirus outbreak offset concerns about corruption and the erosion of democratic institutions.

The Mongolian People’s Party appeared poised to secure at least 62 of the 76 seats in the Great State Khural, according to preliminary results released Thursday by the General Election Commission in Ulaanbaatar. The result reaffirms Prime Minster Khurelsukh Ukhnaa’s grip on power, representing a loss of only one seat in parliament.

The main opposition Democratic Party —led by former Prime Minister Amarjargal Rinchinnyam —won 11 seats, while independents and coalition groups secured three others. More than 600 candidates competed in the election Wednesday, the country’s first since the MPP’s landslide win four years ago.

Since taking the premier’s post in 2017, Khurelsukh has strengthened his political position through unlikely cooperation with President Battulga Khaltmaa, 57, of the rival DP. They pushed through a series of legislative changes last year including the removal of measures intended to protect the independence of the courts and anti-corruption investigators. Khurelsukh also secured new powers to select Cabinet members and extended the length of the president’s term.

Mongolia has managed to keep its coronavirus cases low by closing its border, banning public gatherings and establishing curfews on restaurants and pubs, giving Khurelsukh a boost. The country has confirmed 215 cases and no deaths.

9 p.m. Mexico confirmed 947 more COVID-19 deaths Wednesday, the country’s second-highest daily toll since the coronavirus pandemic began. The highest daily toll came June 3 with 1,092 deaths.

The Health Department said the country has seen a total of 24,324 deaths so far.

The number of confirmed cases rose by 5,437. The case load has increased by about 5,000 each day in the last two weeks, and the total now stands at 186,847.

The numbers are clearly an undercount, given Mexico’s very low rate of testing.

Mexican officials have repeatedly predicted the peak of the pandemic had been reached, or would do so soon, only to be proved wrong.

The Health Department’s epidemiology director, José Luis Alomía, used almost comically couched language Wednesday, saying the country is on “a slight tendency that may insinuate a descent” in infections.

Because the case load continues so high, authorities have had to delay planned re-openings of theatres and concert halls.

One of Mexico City’s biggest venues, the Arena Mexico, announced Wednesday that it will start drive-in movie screenings starting July 4.

Mexico City once had drive-ins, but most closed years ago. One company resumed outdoor screenings in 2011.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"In Amsterdam, it appeared weeks before the first case was confirmed.

In the northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin, it was already there in wastewater in December, well before patients started showing up sick in hospitals.

And now in Toronto, researchers at Ryerson University are looking to sewage to track remnants of the virus that causes COVID-19, hoping that what we flush down the toilet can help provide an early warning system for a dreaded second wave of the disease. It could even identify spikes in hot spots around the city, they say, and no one can opt out.

“Everybody contributes to my research every single day,” Kimberley Gilbride, a professor of chemistry and biology, said with a laugh.

“Everything your body doesn’t want ends up in your poop.”

She and Claire J. Oswald, an associate professor in the department of geography and environmental studies, were already part of Ryerson Urban Water, a collective of researchers from different disciplines focused on urban water issues, pre-pandemic. When the university put out a call for rapid response research on the novel coronavirus this spring, they quickly put together a proposal and were just awarded $100,000 last week.

The pair and their teams are among several groups in communities across the country, and the world, looking at tracking COVID levels in sewage.

They’ll bring untreated wastewater treatment plant samples back to the lab at Ryerson where they’re looking, not for the live virus, but its ribonucleic acid or “RNA signature,” fragments of genetic material that are broken down in fecal matter, Gilbride said.

Because the virus has a long incubation period of up to two weeks, people might not show symptoms for a while, or ever, and might not get tested. But from the beginning they’re shedding the virus in feces.

SARS-CoV-2 is known as an “envelope virus” because it has a layer of fat around it. That doesn’t make it to sewage, so it’s not infectious. But the RNA fragments, like a fingerprint, can tell scientists that the virus was there and help them find trends.

Sewage epidemiology can’t replace classic outbreak tools of testing, contact tracing and isolation. But the Ryerson researchers are working with Toronto Public Health, Toronto Water and Public Health Ontario and hope it can complement these other measures. Toronto Water will co-ordinate the samples to support the research, a spokesperson said in an email.

Public Health Ontario will provide scientific advice on the potential of the study and its findings “to inform public health surveillance and action,” a spokesperson confirmed by email.

Toronto Public Health spokesperson Dr. Howard Shapiro, Associate Medical Officer of Health and Director, Healthy Environments, said information collected from analysis of wastewater samples would be used as an “additional tool” to monitor COVID-19 in the city.

“By looking at the level of COVID-19 activity using this method, we would better be able to determine if COVID-19 infections are increasing, decreasing or stabilizing across the city,” he said in an email.

“The collection of this information could also help us to detect changes in rates of COVID-19 infection among the population more quickly in addition to the information that is collected through the direct testing of individuals.”

Infections are now slowing as regions across the province, including Toronto and Peel, start to reopen. But with the virus still around, it’s more important than ever to be vigilant.

“At some point if we see the detection going up again we know, oh, there’s going to be some more infectious people in the community in the near future, so we’re warning you guys,” said Gilbride. This could help public health officials know when and where to introduce more strict restrictions, or ramp up testing in a certain area “so we don’t have another huge spike in cases.”

If all goes well, they hope to start looking beyond the treatment plant to monitor hot spots and look for trends in specific geographic areas, like hospitals, long-term-care homes, even at airports.

“It’s not like we would be sampling individual houses or anything like that, there’s major privacy issues, more at a neighbourhood scale,” said Oswald. There’s “potential for monitoring certain locations where you might expect a new outbreak to happen.”

Gilbride and Oswald are part of a national COVID-19 Wastewater Coalition through the non-profit Canadian Water Network. Across the province and country, researchers are already providing samples to municipalities on similar projects. The organization is rolling out a pilot, hoping to co-ordinate the efforts in a way that can be “both rapid and rigorous” and can help determine if the approach could work as a national early response system, said CEO Bernadette Conant.

Sewage testing has been done to monitor drug use in Canadian communities and has also been used by the World Health Organization to look for early signs of polio outbreaks, she said.

The science on COVID-19 in sewage is still new, but several recent studies out of Europe — including in Amsterdam, Turin and Milan, for example — have shown that the virus’ RNA shows up in wastewater.

Conant likens sewage monitoring to something that can help public health officials fighting the COVID fire as they shift from the immediate blaze in front of them to looking for “the unseen pile of embers that might burst into flames.”

She’s hoping for funding for the network to scale it up, as pandemic lockdowns are relaxed and governments try to figure out the right balance for living with the virus.

“As hard as shutting everything down was, opening up is much harder,” she said, and the threat of a second wave is still looming. “Winter is coming.”

Elsewhere, researchers Rob Delatolla and Dr. Alex MacKenzie are sampling twice a week at plants in Ottawa and Gatineau, looking for RNA fragments as well as proteins in sewage.

They’re already providing the analysis to Ottawa Public Health.

“It’s still in beta testing,” said Delatolla, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Ottawa. But so far the data is consistent with testing numbers showing cases going down in the region.

The approach has “tremendous appeal” as places start to open up, fast, added MacKenzie, a principal investigator at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute.

“A real time metric to show things are slipping away here and we need to get back on track.”

Their team has aspirations to look at more targeted geographic areas, examine sewage for antibodies to study community immunity and even conduct “a CSI audit” on past samples, like what’s been done in some places in Europe to see when the virus showed up.

There are some disadvantages to sewage sampling. Wastewater is complex with all the chemicals and products that go down the drain, and trying to find fragments of the virus can be difficult, said Delatolla.

In Toronto, as in many cities, there are parts of the sewer system where storm water mixes in, which can dilute samples. But Gilbride and Oswald plan to be strategic about when they sample to overcome this.

Region of Peel Public Works staff have sent samples to researcher Mark Servos, a biology professor at the University of Waterloo and the Canada Research Chair in Water Quality Protection, who believes the technique could be scaled up with the help of private labs, validated methods and protocols.

“It could be a powerful tool to support our interpretation of what’s going on,” he said.

“And we save some lives.”

Phil Dennis, principal scientist for Guelph-based private lab SiREM, said its sister office in Knoxville, Tenn., is already working on tracking sewage for cities in the United States, as well as several college campuses, some of which are interested in looking at it down to the “dormitory level.”

It could be used to target samples at the pipe for places like nursing homes, even casinos or large apartment complexes, he said.

A number of municipalities in Canada have expressed interest “so I think there’s demand out there.”

“Their first reaction is like ‘ick, sewage’” he said.

“But then when you look at the benefits, you could be monitoring many thousands of people with a couple of tests.”

An early alert sewage monitoring system could have universal use, when COVID-19 is hopefully no longer the kind of threat it is now “to sample for any pathogen that comes into the city,” added Ryerson’s Gilbride.

“Which would leave us in better shape at the end of this for anything coming in the future.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Laurie Monsebraatensocial Justice Reporter', 'Social Justice Reporter', 'Laurie Monsebraaten Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Social Justice For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"Toronto should declare child care essential for economic recovery from COVID-19 and urge Queen’s Park and Ottawa to start building a long-awaited national system that is accessible and affordable to all families that need it, say city councillors Joe Cressy and Mike Layton.

“There is a moment in history right now where we can finally replace a flawed, largely parent-funded model, with a publicly funded and accessible one, said Cressy, who represents Ward 10, Spadina-Fort York.

“The question is, do we seize this moment as a country and as a province?” he asked in an interview. “We believe the City of Toronto should take a stand and help make that a reality.”

In their motion to city council’s June 29 to 30 meeting, Cressy and Layton also call on the province to develop “a comprehensive plan” to ensure every child who was enrolled in licensed child care before the pandemic, has access to a spot as centres reopen this summer.

To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, provincial safety measures for daycare reopening limit group sizes to just 10 children and staff. But this will force centres to operate at only 30 to 40 per cent capacity, the councillors note in their motion to be released Thursday.

“This means that there will be 60 per cent to 70 per cent (fewer) spaces than before the pandemic — when access to child care in Toronto was already nearing crisis levels,” they add.

The city’s child-care capacity can’t return to pre-COVID levels until the province provides a plan to find — and fund — those extra spaces, they say.

Without a plan, at least 56,000 Toronto children may not be able to return to their daycares, Cressy said earlier this month, quoting city estimates.

Advocates have said work should begin now to identify unused public and private space that could be retrofitted for child care.

But even a return to the status quo will continue to exclude many Toronto families who have “long struggled with accessing affordable child care” and are facing multi-year wait lists and other barriers, the councillors say. Toronto has the highest child-care fees in the country, with the cost of infant care topping $21,000 a year.

Both Cressy and Layton have young children and say they have heard from many stressed-out parents in their wards who can’t return to work without child care.

Cressy’s son Jude was born in November, and Layton has two daughters, Phoebe, four, and Chloe, two.

“I know my two-year-old won’t be going to child care any time soon because a lot of spaces will be lost,” said Layton who represents Ward 11, University-Rosedale.

As a result, Layton’s spouse has agreed to step back from her career for the summer to free up a spot for a family “that needs it more than ours” and doesn’t have grandparents to help, he said.

“Our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on access to affordable child care,” the councillors say in their motion.

“Parents can only return to their jobs if they are able to find a child-care spot for their children. This is especially true for women, who are more likely to be excluded from the workforce if they cannot access child care,” they add.

The councillors’ motion argues that child care is a sound investment. In Quebec, where families pay less than $20 a day, child care produces $5 in economic stimulus for every $1 in provincial government spending. It is also essential for addressing gender inequity and tackling the pay gap “which in Canada means that today women still earn 87 cents for each dollar earned by a man,” they add.

“Providing affordable child care creates jobs, reduces inequality and ensures that working parents are empowered to make decisions about what’s best for their family,” the motion says.

“That’s why all levels of government must work together to create a national framework for child care that is truly affordable and accessible to all,” the councillors say. “We cannot move forward into full recovery without a national child care strategy.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-24,"OTTAWA—New restrictions on visas for workers entering the United States don’t apply to Canadians who don’t plan on living south of the border permanently, the American Immigration Lawyers Association says.

A “practice alert” for the group’s 15,000 members, issued late Wednesday, says a liaison committee it has with U.S. Customs and Border Protection has confirmed that exemption.

President Donald Trump this week ordered a suspension on issuing several types of visas allowing foreign citizens to work in the United States, on the grounds that his country’s pandemic-rattled economy doesn’t have enough jobs for Americans as it is.

The proclamation lasts until the end of the year. It particularly covers workers seeking H-1B visas, which U.S. employers use to temporarily employ specialists in fields such as high-tech.

The ban also includes H-2B visas for seasonal non-agricultural workers, L visas for managers and executives in multinational companies and J visas for students and workers in exchange programs.

But Canadians who want to work in the U.S. without immigrating permanently don’t necessarily need those work visas.

The language of the proclamation seemed plain enough, immigration lawyer Henry Chang said by email.

“We therefore believed that the presidential proclamation did not apply to (Canadians). Unfortunately, in the absence of clear guidance on this issue, the position taken by United States Customs and Border Protection varied from port to port,” said Chang, a partner at Dentons in Toronto who specializes in Canadian and U.S. business immigration.

He said it’s now clear that so-called visa-exempt Canadians aren’t lumped in with others who won’t be eligible to work in the United States.

A request for comment sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection after regular business hours wasn’t immediately answered.

Trump’s proclamation explicitly forbids only the issuing of new visas. People who already hold them can continue to use them.

Though Canadians don’t necessarily need visas to work in the U.S., having one does come with protections and advantages. Someone with an H-1B visa can seek permanent residency and start on a path to U.S. citizenship, for instance.

The Department of Homeland Security says about 4,600 Canadians received H-1B visas last year.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-24,"Toronto officials want to be able to offer free hotel rooms to people contagious with COVID-19 but unable to isolate in their own crowded homes.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city’s public health chief, made the recommendation in a report released Thursday. She wants the city to ask provincial and federal officials to help fund a lodging program similar to that of Chicago and New York City.

Newly infected Chicagoans in danger of infecting household members can spend their infection period in a dedicated isolation facility in a hotel, with private single rooms, bath and food. New Yorkers can also isolate in provided hotel rooms.

Toronto virus hotspots include low-income areas where many people live in crowded circumstances and don’t have room at home to self-isolate.

De Villa told reporters she hasn’t got a cost estimate but, given the risks and costs of ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, “my sense is it would be worth the investment.”

Mayor John Tory said Ottawa has signalled interest in helping with such a program. He doubted the program would be very costly.

Toronto already has arrangements with hotels to book rooms at favourable rates, because it has done so to help relieve crowding in homeless shelters. Also, the number of infected Torontonians is dropping and people are considered contagious for a finite period, around 14 days.

“It doesn’t have to be incredibly expensive relative to having these people healthy and stopping the spread of the virus to their own family members,” Tory said.

Toronto’s public health board will debate the issue on July 2.

On the first day of Stage 2 reopening for Toronto, de Villa said she continues to be encouraged by COVID-19 indicators for the city. The daily increase in newly recovered patients continues to handily outpace increased infections.

But as Torontonians start to venture back to restaurant patios and hair salons, there was an indication that people remain anxious about the possibility of infections.

The first day of registrations for CampTO, the city’s scaled-down summer camp program for kids aged 6 to 12, with physical distancing and other virus-control measures, saw parents book less than half the available spots.

Registrations on Wednesday for the Scarborough and Etobicoke/York districts saw, by 4 p.m., less than 6,000 of 13,722 spaces reserved.

Registration for the Toronto/East York, West Toronto/York and North York districts starts Thursday at 7 a.m.

Tory said if attendance remains low, the eight-week camps, including dance, drama, music, arts and crafts and active games, will proceed with any changes required.

“Probably some people … are holding back because they’re a little nervous about their kids going to school in the fall, or going to child care, or going to summer camps,” Tory said, “because we know so little about this virus and its behaviour.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The premier said Wednesday the gradual move into B.C.’s third phase allows hotels, motels, spas, resorts, hostels, RV parks, provincial campgrounds and the film industry to resume operations after being shut down or restricted since March.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said recent modelling data show if B.C. residents keep their current level of contact with other people, then COVID-19 infection rates can be held in check.

Horgan said COVID-19 has not disappeared and he advised people to make plans before visiting other communities, which include safe physical distancing, frequent handwashing and staying home if sick. The restriction on prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people remains in place.

“I commend British Columbians because it’s their hard work that got us here based on the guidance that we’ve received from public health,” Horgan said at a news conference. “And the hard work of British Columbians, I think, deserves a bit of time at the lake or on the beach.”

But Horgan said summer holidays and travel will be different this year.

“As we carefully turn up the dial on our activity, we can now look to travel safely around the province. But as we hit the open roads this summer, we must remember we are not leaving COVID-19 behind, and we need to continue to do our part to bend the curve and protect the progress we’ve made,” he said.

Indigenous leaders from Vancouver Island, the Central Coast and the Interior said in a statement they were not consulted about the reopening and are concerned Indigenous lives could be at risk.

“We will do what we need to in order to protect our people, and if there is an impasse, we need to talk. For us, it is people before economics,” said Judith Sayers, president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council on Vancouver Island.

Horgan said Indigenous leaders were being consulted about their concerns.

“There are communities around B.C. that are still quite concerned about travellers coming to visit,” he said. “I think of the Haida on Haida Gwaii. I think of the Heiltsuk in Bella Bella and the Nuxalk in Bella Coola and here on Vancouver Island, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council who have asked government to give them more information about how we plan to proceed.”

Horgan’s announcement comes one day after Henry released modelling figures that said the province is maintaining a balance where contacts are increasing, but at a rate that is keeping COVID-19 infections from spiking.

Henry said contact rates are around 65 per cent of normal in B.C., up from 30 per cent, but it’s all the more important to continue limiting the number of people they connect with to allow for quick contact tracing if the illness spreads.

Up to 97 per cent of a person’s contacts have been found within a few days after a case is identified, she said. Going to an 80 per cent rate of normal contacts would result in a dramatic increase in cases before a vaccine is available, she said.

B.C. announced 14 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday, increasing the province’s total to 2,849 cases. There has been another COVID-19 death, bringing the total to 171 people. So far, 2,516 people have recovered from the virus.

The legislature resumed this week for a summer sitting, with Horgan’s New Democrat government facing criticism about delays in a long-awaited pandemic-recovery program.

Last week, Horgan announced several online participation platforms, including surveys and virtual town hall meetings, to encourage people to have their say on the province’s recovery plans.

Opposition Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said Wednesday people without jobs and businesses struggling to survive need immediate help, not surveys.

Wilkinson said the reopening announcement appeared to be more focused on Horgan’s vacation plans than the serious economic issues facing businesses and thousands of people.

“We’ve all got to be concerned when half a million people in this province don’t have a job compared to a year ago and tens of thousands of people are about to lose their jobs because of NDP policy, so it’s great to talk about going on holidays if you’ve got a job and if you’ve got enough money to take that holiday,” he said.

B.C. entered its initial restart phase last month by easing restrictions to allow the reopening of some businesses, including restaurants, hair salons, dentist offices and physiotherapy clinics. Schools reopened on reduced schedules for students on June 1.

Her Reporting Is Funded The Canadian Government Through Its Local Journalism Initiative. Reach Her Via Email', 'Victoriagibson Thestar.Ca']",2020-06-24,"Legislation proposed by the Ontario government could lead to a slew of evictions after the COVID-19 pandemic and disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, lawyers and tenant groups warned on Wednesday – during the first of three scheduled days of hearings on Bill 184.

Legal clinics, lawyers and tenant advocacy groups fear that a proposed change – allowing agreements like repayment schedules for missed rent during COVID-19 to be reached through alternate dispute resolution methods, then enforced without hearings at the province’s Landlord and Tenant Board – could lead to a wave of renters in Ontario being turfed, as the province continues to face economic difficulties.

“The most vulnerable people may not be able to avail themselves of reviews or appeals, and will find themselves out on the street,” lawyer Caryma Sa’d, who represents both landlords and tenants, told the standing committee on social policy.

She fears renters may agree to repayment plans without fully understanding their rights, and if tenants fell behind they wouldn’t have a chance to explain themselves before being evicted.

“This is contrary to public health at this juncture, but also not good in terms of society,” Sa’d said.

Dania Majid, a lawyer for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, pointed out that the bill was drafted before the pandemic, which she said has made renting more precarious for low-income tenants.

She commended the provincial government for halting residential evictions during the crisis, but argued that the dispute resolution contained in the proposed bill would “fast-track” evictions when those processes resumed.

“We need the eviction moratorium to continue,” Majid said, warning that the board couldn’t weather an “avalanche of evictions” once its work resumed. “No one should lose their home or be forced into an unaffordable repayment plan because of the economic lockdown.”

The government is presenting the legislation as a tenant protection bill, and a spokesperson for Housing Minister Steve Clark stressed that tenants could still choose to have a hearing at the Landlord and Tenant Board. When an alternate resolution is reached, though, “everyone must abide by the terms.”

Tenants could try to negotiate amendments to plans they’d agreed to, but if the landlord refused, they could seek an order to end tenancy without a hearing, the housing minister’s office said.

At that point, a tenant could file a motion to set the eviction order aside, Clark’s office said. That process was panned by lawyer Benjamin Ries in the hearings on Wednesday as “backwards.”

Tony Irwin, president of the Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario, told the Star he understood that the board would still have oversight of granting eviction orders if a tenant lapsed on a repayment plan, even if it didn’t need to hold a hearing first. He said the idea of allowing alternate dispute resolution channels seemed to be reasonable.

But as the hearings kicked off, a coalition of legal clinics and other groups released a joint letter. In it, they allege that the bill would lead to tenants being displaced, in part, due to the dispute resolution, which they argue could lead to tenants being “pressured to agree to terms they cannot meet.”

The letter asked the government to extend the eviction moratorium until the province’s economy and employment numbers recover.

It also asked the government to direct the board to make sure agreements were feasible, and “will not push tenants into homelessness or continued poverty.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-24,"VANCOUVER—A study by University of British Columbia researchers underscores the immediate, harmful health effects of wildfire smoke and says there are concerning implications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study, published in the online journal Environmental Health Perspectives, explores a link between high levels of fine particulates in wildfire smoke and increased ambulance dispatches.

The research shows a jump in ambulance dispatches related to respiratory or cardiovascular conditions occurs within one hour of exposure to smoke.

Among diabetics, the study says the odds of health complications increase within 48 hours of exposure to fine particulates.

The researchers say the smoke has the potential to make viral respiratory infections such as COVID-19 even more severe.

Lead author Jiayun Angela Yao says rapid public health action to limit smoke exposure is vital because the pandemic remains a serious threat as the wildfire season approaches.

“Anyone with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes is especially vulnerable and should consider purchasing air cleaners and ensuring that they have adequate supplies of medication at home,” Yao said in a release.

“It’s alarming to see just how quickly fine particulate matter seems to affect the respiratory and cardiovascular system. And the acute effects for people with diabetes is relatively new to us,” said Yao.

She conducted her research while completing a PhD at the UBC School of Population and Public Health.

Researchers used statistical modelling to examine ambulance dispatches, paramedic assessments and hospital admissions for respiratory, circulatory and diabetic conditions related to high levels of fine particulates during wildfire seasons in B.C. from 2010 to 2015.

The study was supported by the Australian Research Council Linkage Program and the British Columbia Lung Association.

Read', 'Steve Mckinleyhalifax Bureau', 'Halifax Bureau', 'With Files The Canadian Press.', 'Steve Mckinleyhalifax Bureauwed.']",2020-06-24,"HALIFAX — For the past 17 years, Anna-Marie Weir has guided visitors from around the world through the sights and attractions of New Brunswick, from high tide in the Bay of Fundy, to the province’s iconic covered bridges, to the lighthouses along its coast.

She knows her client base.

One-third of her business at Moncton-based Road to Sea Guided Tours comes from provinces outside of Atlantic Canada, another third from the United States, and a final third from the United Kingdom and overseas.

So news Wednesday that the four Atlantic provinces have banded together to form an “Atlantic travel bubble” — a move it’s hoped will boost the economy and help tourism operators in a region battered by COVID-19 travel bans — left her cool.

“Since 2003, I can count on one hand how many people from Atlantic Canada have taken my tour,” she said.

Buoyed by low COVID-19 case counts, the premiers have announced an agreement to form a travel bubble starting on July 3. Residents will be able to travel freely between Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island without the need to self-isolate on arrival.

Governments for all four provinces have been marketing “staycations” to prod Atlantic Canadians to spend their tourism dollars close to home.

With most of her public tours for Road to Sea cancelled this year, Weir has taken a job as a tourism relations and communications liaison with the Elsipogtog First Nation in New Brunswick to help build its tourism operation.

And, with many local tour operators suffering from the lack of business from away, she says she thinks this might be a great opportunity for Indigenous tourism to flourish.

“There’s certain product developments that are underfoot right now that could shine in this specific time, especially Indigenous tourism, because there’s a history,” she told the Star. “There’s a story that’s not been told yet that’s part of the real story that connects the past to the present here in Atlantic Canada.

She said although she believes that Atlantic Canadians are inclined to want to spend their tourism money close to home, they’re generally reluctant to take tours to attractions that they are familiar with.

Indigenous tourism, on the other hand, allows local tourists to learn about a history and culture that is much less familiar.

“There is a want and a need for Indigenous stories to be told, by and through Indigenous people, in their own words, in their own way.”

“I know as a tour operator that people are very interested when I talk about the history of this region. As soon as I start talking about the First Nation people who were here in Atlantic Canada, people want to delve into it further and they want more — they want to know where they can go and get more information,” she said.

As far as the Atlantic travel bubble is concerned, Canadians travelling to Atlantic Canada from other provinces will still have to adhere to the local entry requirements for the specific province they enter, although those visitors who complete 14 days of self-isolation would then be able to travel throughout the region.

Each of the provinces will use its own process for tracking and monitoring travellers.

“The decision to ease travel restrictions within Atlantic Canada was guided by all of the provincial chief medical officers of health,” said Newfoundland Premier Dwight Ball during a news conference Wednesday. Ball is also the chair of the Council of Atlantic Premiers.

“Decisions like this one are not taken lightly. As this Atlantic bubble opens, it will be closely monitored as we remain committed to working together to support economic and social recovery, while ensuring public health and safety measures.”

Ball also proffered July 17 as the earliest possible date to allow unrestricted travel from other Canadian provinces, contingent on coronavirus case numbers remaining low during the previous two weeks of the Atlantic bubble.

The specifics of that move will depend on the results of the first weeks of the Atlantic bubble.

“This can only be possible if we get favourable results in the days and weeks leading into July 17. So in order for this to work, we must have to maintain good public health measures,” said Ball.

“We will never hesitate to go back (to tightening restrictions) if we have to. Your actions today will determine our results of tomorrow.”

Nova Scotia — the most populous province in the region — announced Tuesday it had not recorded a new case of the viral infection in the past two weeks and had no active cases. The province had 1,061 total confirmed cases, including 63 deaths — 53 of them at a single long-term care facility in Halifax.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, where there were 261 confirmed cases and three deaths, the most recent case of COVID-19 was recorded on May 28. Like Nova Scotia, the province has no active cases.

New Brunswick reported one new case in the Moncton region Tuesday, but that person was in self-isolation before the diagnosis and has had no close contacts. The province has 20 active cases. Of the 165 people with confirmed infections, two have died and 143 have recovered.

Prince Edward Island had just 27 cases of COVID-19 and all have recovered. The island last reported a case on April 28.

Read', 'Keith Doucettethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Keith Doucettethe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-06-24,"HALIFAX—Nova Scotia’s Opposition Progressive Conservatives are calling for a timely release of a plan for the province’s public schools, saying parents and teachers require “peace of mind” ahead of September.

Tory Leader Tim Houston made the call at a news conference held outside the provincial legislature on Wednesday, pointing out that nine other provinces have already made their plans public.

Houston said his party has written to Premier Stephen McNeil asking for immediate action and also submitted its own plan with 30 recommendations for the government’s consideration.

“Once you have a plan, it takes time to execute on that plan,” Houston said. “It’s not fair to wait until August, or July even, to tell people what to expect or how to prepare. You have to let them know sooner.”

Houston said his party’s plan is based on consultations with the education sector and includes input from former teachers and principals, as well as party caucus members.

Among the Tories’ recommendations: a 15-child class-size cap for pre-primary through Grade 5; help for at-home learning that also takes into account capacity for a family’s access to the internet; having schools submit plans for cleaning protocols; and having school buses operate at half-capacity.

While younger children would return to school with reduced class sizes, the Tory plan would see students from grades 6 through 12 return under a blended program. It would see them in school two to three days a week with at-home learning during the other days.

The Tories say the health-risk level needs to be constantly assessed because of the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 into the fall and winter months.

The plan also calls for school operations to be decentralized to the local level, where teachers and administrators are in closer contact with students and the wider community.

“There’s a lot of planning to be done around human-resource requirements and that’s why this discussion can’t be put off any longer,” Houston said.

However, Education Minister Zach Churchill said the amount of work required to get a proper plan in place is the reason one likely won’t come out until midsummer.

Churchill said a working group is currently examining 22,000 survey responses from parents about their experiences over the past few months as students learned at home. Another student survey is due this Sunday, he said, as Education Department officials continue to seek feedback from teachers and administrators.

“We are going to take some time to really go through this and find the themes of concerns and challenges ... and apply that to next fall,” Churchill said.

The minister said his department is looking at some blended teaching options between in-home and in-school instruction, but is also wary of the potential for a second wave of the virus.

“We are going to be prepared for whatever the situation is come fall, and there will be communication with school communities throughout the summer,” he said.

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-06-24,"OTTAWA—New statistics show 21 people were apprehended by the RCMP crossing into Canada from the U.S. in May, despite the shutdown of the border.

That’s up from just six who were stopped in April, the first full month the border was closed to nearly everything but essential travel in a bid by the two countries to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The border deal gave Canada the right to turn people back to the U.S. if they sought to claim asylum here.

It was not immediately clear how many of those who arrived in May were returned to the U.S., or how many were allowed to file for asylum under existing rules around who can file a refugee claim in Canada.

Since 2017, nearly 57,000 people have crossed the border between Canada and the U.S. using unofficial entry points so they are able to file for asylum.

They do so because of the Safe Third Country Agreement, which governs asylum claims between Canada and the U.S., and forbids most people from lodging a claim when they arrive at a formal border point.

The agreement is based on the premise that both Canada and the United States are safe and a refugee claimant should seek asylum in whichever of the two he or she enters first. It does not forbid applications from people who are already on Canadian soil, however.

The vast majority of claimants leaving the United States arrived in Quebec, and as they’ve awaited decisions on their claims, many have found work in health care.

With those positions now essential to the fight against COVID-19, the federal and Quebec governments are considering a program that could see asylum-seekers granted permanent residency.

A new study released this week by Statistics Canada highlights the oversized role newcomers to Canada play in the health sector.

Using data from the 2016 census — which wouldn’t capture the arrival of thousands of asylum-seekers since then — the agency found that year, 245,000 people were employed as nurses’ aides, orderlies and patient service associates in Canada.

Of them, more than a third — 87,925 — were immigrants.

By comparison, the agency said, immigrants represented less than one in four people in all other occupations.

The percentage of immigrants working in health care in cities was even more pronounced.

In Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary, over 70 per cent of nurses’ aides, orderlies and patient-service workers were immigrants, and the majority of those were women.

Statistics Canada pulled together the data as part of its effort to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting different communities in different ways.

The intersection between immigrants and the health-care sector was important to examine, the agency said in the introduction to its research.

“One of the issues immigrants and visible minority groups have been facing since the start of the pandemic is that many of them are essential workers, which puts them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19,” the introduction said.

“In particular, nurse aides, orderlies and patient-service associates were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, especially those working in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario. A number of workers in these occupations contracted the virus, which was an additional risk factor for their families and communities.”

The research also showed that certain communities within the broader pool are potentially more at risk.

In 2016, 30 per cent of immigrants working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient-service associates were Black, and 30 per cent were Filipino.

The main places of birth for immigrant workers in those occupations were Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and Bermuda and sub-Saharan Africa.

Of the population from the Caribbean, about half were born in Haiti.

Of those who have crossed into Canada from the U.S. since 2017 and filed for asylum, just over 9,000 are from Haiti.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Colin Perkelthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Colin Perkelthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-06-24,"Authorities in some provinces ramped up often arbitrary law enforcement to help curtail the COVID-19 pandemic rather than rely on a purely public health approach, according to a report out Wednesday.

The main problem, the report finds, is that marginalized or other vulnerable groups tended to bear the brunt of police and bylaw action.

“This report proves that we’ve got an ugly ticketing pandemic, replete with COVID carding and racial profiling, in central and eastern Canada,” Michael Bryant, executive director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said in a statement. “Somehow a public health crisis has been twisted into a public order crisis.”

Provinces across the country issued emergency orders with hefty penalties for violations in March, including closures of public spaces and physical distancing measures. Ticketing soon followed.

In one example cited in the report, a man walking his dog in Ottawa was fined $880 for standing in the wrong place. A bylaw officer in the city also tackled a man walking through a park with his daughter. He ended up with a bruised lip and a fine of more than $2,000.

One woman with her baby in Aurora, Ont., stepped off a park path to let others pass and was ticketed $880, prompting Premier Doug Ford to say the officers “could have used a little bit different judgment.”

According to the study by the association and the Policing the Pandemic Mapping Project co-founded at the universities of Toronto and Ottawa, police and bylaw officers issued at least 10,000 tickets or charges related to the pandemic between April 1 and June 15. The value of the fines was more than $13 million.

Quebec accounted for 77 per cent of the reported fines, while Ontario saw 18 per cent and Nova Scotia three per cent.

The findings, based in part on publicly available information such as news and police reports, were supplemented by reports from more than 100 people who reported COVID-related stops, searches and charges through the association’s online tracker.

Some said there was no basis for their tickets. Others maintained any infraction was trifling.

“Many of the experiences Canadians shared demonstrate how over-zealous, technical enforcement of confusing, broad and vague laws frequently led to fines that were completely disconnected with the goal of protecting public health,” states the report called “Stay off the Grass: COVID-19 and Law Enforcement in Canada.”

While some provinces such as British Columbia successfully resorted to messaging and other public health strategies to encourage compliance with the various measures, others opted for punitive enforcement.

“Police will be handing out more fines and, I repeat, the fines can vary from $1,000 to $6,000 per person,” Quebec Premier François Legault said in April. “That’s what people who don’t respect the rules deserve.”

In an interview, report co-author Abby Deshman said large data gaps exist but it is clear discriminatory police action occurred in the context of COVID-19. Black and Indigenous people, the homeless and recent immigrants were among those targeted.

“When the primary response that these communities see is a law-enforcement response, they do not seek help for their health and the health of their communities,” Deshman said. “They hide.”

Officers also singled out people in same-sex relationships by questioning them about their relationship, while ignoring heterosexual couples, she said.

The hefty fines — often a month’s rent or grocery budget — also had a disproportionate impact on recipients such as students, seniors on fixed incomes, single parents or the unemployed.

The report warns against a return to law-enforcement stops, searches and charges should a second COVID wave prompt a reprise of the lockdown. Punitive measures, it says, are simply counterproductive.

“Government leaders must resist the temptation — and the calls from scared constituents — to back up every public health recommendation with the force of law and give a carte blanche to law enforcement,” the report states. “Trying to police our way out of this pandemic is unimaginative, sometimes unconstitutional and ineffective.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“We all know how eager people are to be able to get to the islands,” said Tory.

“These are a beloved part of our city that people like to enjoy, especially in the summer months and the ferry ride is very much a part of that — it’s a time-honoured tradition for Torontonians.”

Ferries will operate at 50 per cent capacity and passengers will be required to bring their own face masks and wear them on the boats, as they are expected to do on the TTC.

Visitors are being urged to buy ferry tickets online in advance, as only 5,000 a day will be sold in order to allow for proper physical distancing on the boats and to prevent crowding at the terminal.

Only one ferry has been operating during the COVID-19 lockdown, principally for the 700 residents of the islands.

While washrooms on the islands will be open, Centreville Amusement Park and play structures on the islands will remain closed.

The islands, part of an archipelago, typically get 1.4 million visitors a year. Widespread flooding forced the closure of the islands for weeks in 2017 and they were again flooded in 2019.

Water levels in Lake Ontario were high in January and February, suggesting more flooding was in the cards in 2020. To avoid that, water was drained from Lake Ontario at the Moses-Saunders Power Dam into the St. Lawrence River at record rates over the winter.

The levels are set by an international treaty between the U.S. and Canada and are monitored by the International Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Board.

Lake Ontario levels peaked early this year, at 75.40 metres, on May 5, 10 centimetres below the general flood stage and over half a metre lower than the peak in 2019, according to the board. Lake Ontario typically peaks in June.

Letting off more water, combined with drier spring conditions around Lake Ontario and in the Ottawa and lower St. Lawrence River basins, helped keep the lake below flood levels.

Visitors to the islands are also being asked to try to plan their visits at non-peak hours if possible — peak hours are 9:30 to lunch and 3:30-6:30.

The announcement was made on the first day of Toronto officially entering into Stage 2 of reopening, after being locked down since March to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Malls have reopened, along with hair salons and patios and splash pads.

Read', 'Julian Mckenziethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Julian Mckenziethe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-06-24,"MONTREAL—Despite being allowed to operate, some day camps in Quebec and Ontario are turning to the internet to keep children entertained this summer.

And while online day camps can help prevent kids from catching COVID-19 and assuage the concerns of skittish parents, they aren’t accessible to everyone.

Rock Camp Montreal, for instance, wasn’t able to get access to some of the venues it used in previous summers. Instead, the camp will open online-only this year with a different focus that it hopes will appeal to young people.

“We have had to basically completely change the model of camp to be more of a music production focus,” board member Skye Miechkota said.

The one-week camp runs music and anti-oppression workshops and is offered to girls and gender non-conforming youth. This year, instead of teaching campers in an electroacoustic studio at Concordia University, they will try to teach their campers through music production software.

But the camp cannot be as inclusive as it wants to be because of the digital divide.

“It’s definitely been very stressful,” Miechkota said. “We’re trying to work around people’s schedules, but ultimately if a camper doesn’t have access to the internet, unfortunately it’s beyond our means right now to provide that for a camper.”

The Ottawa Children’s Theatre previously used the Dominion-Chalmers United Church for its summer programs but is now holding sessions online, including one led by two former Ottawa residents who’ve since moved to New York City to work as actors and playwrights.

But the children’s theatre must also reduce access to its activities this year.

“Most of the camps, we’re dealing with six, eight or 10 kids,” said Amanda Lewis, founder of the Ottawa Children’s Theatre. “Keeping very small numbers so that we can stay closely connected to each and every child.”

Malik Shaheed is the director of operations for the Youth Stars Foundation, a non-profit organization that runs an annual summer day camp in Pierrefonds-Roxboro, a Montreal west-end borough.

Shaheed said the camp will offer free online workshops on coding, arts and crafts, and music starting June 29. He initially wanted to open the camp and welcome kids in-person, but relented when parents expressed concerns.

“Once the COVID really hit, registration completely stopped,” Shaheed said. “We had a couple of people inquiring, but not the magnitude it usually is.”

Day camps are permitted to open in Quebec and Ontario under certain public health guidelines designed to control the spread of COVID-19.

But some parents such as Tara Belle are getting ready for a summer multitasking work and parental duties.

“A lot of parents keep their kids all summer anyways,” Belle said in a interview. “It might be a hardship for us, relative to what we usually have. At the same time, it’ll allow us to spend more time with our kids than we really ever have before.”

The YMCA in Quebec was forced to close several of its day camps that don’t have dedicated outdoor space this summer because the government is requiring all activities take place outside.

Sean Day, YMCA regional director of camps, says that Quebec YMCAs are looking to provide ways for children to connect online with a camp counsellor.

Day said he feels strongly that children need something to look forward to this summer.

“You can imagine the complexities of creating these programs,” he said in an interview about the YMCA’s online summer services. “We’ve been working hard at it because we feel so strongly that there needs to be something for kids this summer.”

Read', 'With Files Miriam Lafontaine', 'Margaryta Ignatenko.']",2020-06-24,"Toronto is springing back to life — but slowly.

Throughout the city Wednesday morning, restaurants, nail salons and barbershops unlocked their doors to the public for the first time since Ontario shut down in mid-March.

It’s a milestone that’s invited a mix of anticipation and anxiety.

The city was quiet as the day started. By noon, streets and sidewalks had become patio spaces. Reopening protocols mean bars and restaurants can only operate at 50 per cent capacity for outdoor seating.

Experts cautioned Torontonians venturing out Wednesday to protect themselves.

“I’m not against opening, but I think there’s so much we could do to do it in a safe, sustainable way and if we don’t do it now we’re going to pay a heavy price later,” said infection control epidemiologist Colin Furness.

“We need to have people wearing masks in malls and stores, and we’re going to pay a horrendous price if we don’t.”

At Organic Nail Bar in the King West neighbourhood, customers were required to book an appointment for a manicure or pedicure; Plexiglas separated the nail technician and the customer. Owner Mike Duong said the salon was fully booked for the day.

Simi Kapur, co-owner of Futures Bistro at Bloor St. and Brunswick Ave., said a lot of work went into reopening on Wednesday, like figuring out how to maximize the space while being in compliance with Toronto Public Health guidelines. Kapur said she worked hard to ensure employees were on board and comfortable with new training and protocols, as well as to organize PPE, gloves and hand sanitizer.

“Very quickly we had to react to, ‘Can we even be open today or should we wait until Friday?’” she said.

A breezy, overcast day contributed to a relatively slow morning on the Futures patio, but faces — some familiar — eventually began to trickle in. Many tables were occupied by mid afternoon.

“People are coming out,” she said. “We’re seeing a lot of our regulars. Very supportive, thankful to come in and stop by for a pint. That really helps us in summer, to move our draft.”

Opening was a welcome relief after three months of anxiety and tension, but there were still lessons to be learned — like asking people for their contact tracing information upfront.

“It’s also education for the customer,” Kapur said. “We may know what the guidelines are, they don’t. I’ve had some customers question the civil liberties part of it ... We’re understanding that. Everything is with patience and an air of optimism and education.”

For the restaurants that aren’t yet open, Kapur recommends taking time to set up.

“It’s not going to always be perfect and you will continue to learn as you go, as you adjust,” she said. “It is a learning curve as you get customers in. Put a smile where you can. I know it’s not seen behind the mask, but be thankful that we’re out here, we have the opportunity. We do know a lot of restaurants do not have outdoor space.”

Toronto is one of the last cities to join to Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan, which started several weeks ago in some regions.

Some patrons were so excited at the prospect of venturing out that they lined up to gain entry at midnight. About 150 people had to be turned away from the patio at Marbl Restaurant on King Street West by Spadina Avenue.

Retail outlets had a slower start Wednesday.

At the Eaton Centre, Banana Republic, Nordstrom and Williams-Sonoma opened their doors, while other stores at the mall remained shuttered on the first day of Stage 2. Shops like Lululemon, Zara and Ted Baker put signs on their doors notifying customers that they intended to reopen late in the week.

Physician epidemiologist Dr. Nitin Mohan said masks were especially recommended for indoor spaces.

“In dense places like Toronto and Peel, I think if you are entering a closed space where you are not able to maintain physical distancing like a mall, I highly suggest wearing a mask, and for individual stores as well I suggest they provide masks for customers,” said Mohan, a partner at ETIO Public Health Consultants.

Masks are not mandatory in any of the major Toronto and Peel region malls — including Eaton Centre, Yorkdale, Dufferin Mall and Square One. All say they encourage shoppers to wear one inside the mall, adding that some retailers within the malls do require them.

In Scarborough, malls were quiet; Scarborough Town Centre, near Brimley Road and Hwy. 401, was near empty shortly after opening at 11 a.m.

Retailers such as Sephora were limiting the number of customers and employees who could be in the store at any one time to 34. A security guard said that mall washrooms could only be used by people wearing masks.

The Malvern Town Centre, near Nielson Road and Sheppard Avenue East, was also very quiet.

Dipak Sheth, owner of the mall’s Gateway Newstand store, said he was glad to reopen and doesn’t know how he survived the past three months. If the lockdown had continued, Sheth said he would have been forced to declare bankruptcy.

Business was also slow in the Agincourt Mall, where Ken Chiu has owned Multi, a luggage store, for 20 years.

Chiu said customers usually flowed through the Sheppard Avenue East mall from Walmart, which anchors the mall at one end. But access has been closed because of the pandemic.

At the other end of the mall customers were lined up, waiting to get hair cuts at KY Hair Salon, owned by Ken Ye for five years. Around the corner, the Shiny Salon and Spa was buzzing with customers getting hair cuts and manicures.

By the afternoon, the Parkway Mall at Ellesmere Road and Victoria Park Avenue was busy in comparison.

Julia Jiao, who opened her nail salon on Wednesday for the first time in three months, said that many of her customers had been so anxious to return to her salon that they started calling her every day, to ask when she would reopen, about a month into the pandemic.

But she said that the number of shoppers in the mall on Wednesday was still down from levels before the pandemic, even though many of the other businesses in the mall, including Canadian Tire and Dollarama, never closed.

Malls that have already been open for weeks in other parts of the province and country have found that there is pent-up demand from shoppers, said Karl Littler, senior vice-president of public affairs at the Retail Council of Canada.

“There’s an initial enthusiasm, and then we found it flattened out a bit thereafter and is not at levels that it was traditionally at, but certainly there’s a significant return of customers in albeit very different circumstances,” he said.

Some small businesses saw their patience in the reopening process rewarded Wednesday, as former clients flocked back to execute plans the pandemic put on hold.

At Puedmag Inkpire Tattoo Studio on Bloor Street, co-owner Tina Legris said the studio was balancing fitting in anyone who missed their bookings over the last three months with a calendar that is already full.

Legris said she was “just trying to take it one day at a time and make sure that we can co-ordinate and get the clients who had their appointments in first.”

“For us as a tattoo shop we’re already always used PPE so the only big changes for us were the mandatory masks, social distancing where possible and we are screening” she said.

A waiting area sat empty, as clients can no longer wait for their tattoos or piercings in the shop. It’s among a number of changes the studio has implemented, along with doing away with their 48-hour cancellation policy and having staff screen themselves before showing up for work.

The studio is open seven days a week and Legris is happy to be there as much as possible. She doesn’t know anyone who didn’t want to work over the past three months.

“Especially as artists, it’s a whole different world for us. Artists are mostly self-contracted so it’s not like we could just get employment insurance. (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) was a huge help for a lot of our artists,” she said.

“Thank god for that.”

Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-24,"With Toronto entering the second stage of reopening and more people enjoying the summer weather, I thought it would be the perfect time to remind ourselves of the various memes and internet obsessions we distracted ourselves with since March.

How many of us are still whisking Dalgona coffee or regrowing green onions? A look at our online faves in the last three months.

Toilet paper shortages (early March)

There were many things that were as valuable as gold during the pandemic: dried pasta, dried beans, meat, eggs, hand sanitizer, Lysol wipes, dumbbells, bikes, kiddie pools. But the thing that predated it all was toilet paper.

Murmurs of a global shortage started in Hong Kong in February over concerns that supply chains from China would be cut off. People in other countries started to stock up (including my parents), causing a chain reaction of others also buying TP. There is a reasonable explanation for the shortage, though, as self-isolating at home means we’re not going the washroom anywhere else.

Dalgona coffee (early March)

The three-ingredient, frothy dessert of boiling water, sugar and freeze-dried coffee became an easy quarantine project for those who had no interest in sourdough. (It’s basically a very bitter coffee mousse that you would never make again.)

Most credit the drink’s origins to South Korea, where it was featured on television back in January, inspiring self-isolating residents to make it themselves before it gained more popularity in North America in late February and March. But upon closer inspection, Dalgona coffee existed years beforehand under other names in countries such as China, Greece, Libya, Pakistan and India.

Sourdough (March 8)

Shoppers started to panic buy as North Americans became more aware of the virus that was already shutting down large parts of countries overseas. Pictures of empty grocery shelves proliferated on social media as stores and suppliers tried to keep up with the sudden spike in sales. Among the top items were flour and yeast, as first-time and professional bakers alike settled into the idea of staying at home for weeks and tried to be self-sufficient by baking their own bread.

According to Google, interest in sourdough peaked in April and searches have gone down since (a flattened curve, if you will). Other popular quarantine bakes included banana bread and focaccia dotted with intricate flowers made from herbs, but nothing quite matched the mass popularity of sourdough.

Italians singing from their balconies (March 14)

North Americans got a glimpse of life under quarantine as Italians were told to stay home weeks before we got the orders. In an act of solidarity, Italians began to sing and play instruments from their balconies. It was a heartwarming gesture, and the videos spread on Twitter. With the internet being what it is, users began to dub the videos with songs from the likes of Madonna, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.

A few celebrities fell for the gag, believing entire Italian towns know every word of their songs (bless).

We Are the Virus (mid-March)

Images of empty cityscapes and deserted tourist hot spots provided a slightly uneasy feeling, but overall sense of calm. We wondered if staying off the road and production plants being shut down meant that there would be less air pollution and polluted waterways. (Sort of, but it’s temporary and climate change is still real.)

Photos and videos of wild animals reclaiming the land went viral, from goats wandering in a Welsh town to a family of foxes in the Beach neighbourhood (naturally, humans ruined that short moment of joy). The tag line “We are the virus, nature is healing” emerged, providing some pretty funny Photoshop jobs (orcas frolicking in a toilet bowl, for example) and riffs (the 505 streetcar finally coming back on the streets).

Zoom meetings (mid-March)

Let’s be honest, who even heard of Zoom before all of this? In an attempt to carry on office work, social gatherings and classes over a virtual space, the bulk of us spent a good chunk of time trying to figure out how to get the program working.

We remember the boss who turned herself into a potato, the students and profs who gave us a glimpse into online class pranks, and the countless Zoom backgrounds at least one of us tried to install. (I still have no idea how to do it.) It was fun, but now Zoom fatigue is apparently a thing.

Gal Gadot’s “Imagine” video (March 19)

The pandemic highlighted multiple flaws in society but the overarching theme is inequity, privilege and distribution of wealth. An early example is the well-intentioned, but widely panned video of actor Gal Gadot rounding up a bunch of celebrities to sing John Lennon’s “Imagine” as a way to … somehow unite us all. Critics were quick to point out that it’s easier to imagine surviving a pandemic when you live in a big house and don’t have to worry about money. Did celebrities learn their lesson? Nope.

Tiger King (March 20)

The eight-episode true crime docuseries on Netflix gave homebound viewers a wild glimpse into the fight between wild animal owners and conversationalists: death threats, harassment campaigns, murder allegations, arson, an alleged cult. Who hasn’t been subjected to someone saying “Hey all you cool cats and kittens” or come across a discussion on who should play Joe Exotic in a movie?

The answer to the latter question: no one. Let’s leave this messy show with questionable editorial choices behind.

Animal Crossing (March 20)

The Japanese real-time simulation game doesn’t involve bosses or levels. Rather, your adorable avatar roams an open world and does things like fishing, gardening and socializing with other users (among them: Elijah Wood and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). Fans loved the aimless, stress-free nature of the game and used it as a proxy for not being able to go outside.

Windowsill Scallions (early-mid-April)

Concerns over food scarcity, economic uncertainty and limited trips to supermarkets led home cooks to stretch every bag of dried beans, canned tuna and head of cabbage into multiple meals. The grade-school experiment of regrowing green onions by simply placing them in some water remerged en masse early on during lockdown, as it’s an easy and relatively fast way to grow produce without needing much space or a speck of soil. The question is whether anyone actually harvested their regrown onions.

Choose Your Quarantine House (early April)

A reliable Twitter meme is asking users to choose between a set of options, be it the colour of a dress, which subway seat is best or in a time of lockdown, which groups of celebrities you’d prefer to self-isolate with.

The thought process would usually go something like: well, Céline Dion would be entertaining and Ayesha Curry could teach me a new recipe. But in the other house, JLo would be fun to exercise with and I could jam with Lizzo with my Grade 6 recorder skills. Tough choices.

Murder hornets (late May)

Just to make the pandemic more interesting, in late May, Canadians leaned of the existence of murder hornets, an invasive species known to devastate honeybee populations and, with enough stings, to kill people. They were discovered in B.C. in May, prompting fears that it could be the beginning of an invasion. So far, nothing yet.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4:25 p.m.: WestJet Airlines Ltd. says it will lay off 3,333 employees as part of major restructuring amid the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated the travel industry.

The company says it will consolidate call centre activity in Alberta, restructure its office and management staff and contract out operations at all but four of the 38 Canadian airports where it operates.

3:45 p.m. : Several players and staff members on the Toronto Blue Jays have tested positive for COVID-19, a source has told The Canadian Press.

The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not officially announced the positive cases.

The developments come a week before the start of training camp ahead of a recently approved 60-game regular season. The Blue Jays shut down their spring training complex last Friday in Dunedin, Fla., after a player presented symptoms consistent with the virus.

2:39 p.m.: Manitoba RCMP say they’ve been called for a second time this month because an airline passenger was not wearing a mask while flying.

The Mounties say they responded to a report Monday night of an unruly passenger on a flight from Vancouver to Winnipeg, and were told that the man had refused directions to wear a protective mask.

They say a 39-year-old Winnipeg man is facing a charge of refusing to comply with flight crew instructions, which carries a maximum fine of $5,000.

On June 14, a flight from Vancouver to Toronto was diverted to Winnipeg due to an alleged unruly passenger.

RCMP said a 60-year-old man from Surrey, B.C. was charged after lighting a cigarette during the flight and refusing to wear a mask.

The accused in that case was remanded in custody on charges including mischief, smoking onboard an aircraft and refusing to comply with flight crew instructions.

1:36 p.m.: Most of the region of Windsor-Essex will be allowed to move into Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan after originally being held back due to COVID-19 farm outbreaks, Premier Doug Ford announced Wednesday.

The only exceptions will be the communities of Leamington and Kingsville, which have seen large numbers of cases among migrant workers.

Ford said he has a plan to address the situation on farms, while also allowing COVID-19 positive but asymptomatic workers to continue on the job, with safety protocols in place.

“This is one of (farmers’) busiest times of the year,” Ford said. “They need the extra help and unlike other professions, most of it is outdoors and isolated.”

12:39 p.m.: The four Atlantic provinces have announced plans to ease interprovincial travel restrictions, creating a so-called “bubble” as the region has reported relatively few new COVID-19 infections in recent weeks.

As of July 3, residents of Atlantic Canada will be allowed to travel within the region without having to self-isolate for two weeks when arriving in another province.

Visitors from provinces and territories outside the region will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days and adhere to the local entry requirements in each of the four jurisdictions.

However, once the self-isolation period has passed, these visitors will also be allowed to travel within the Atlantic region.

Each of the four provinces will choose its own process for tracking and monitoring travellers.

The decision to ease travel restrictions was guided by each of the four provinces’ chief medical officers of health, who are asking travellers to adhere to ongoing public health directives.

12:27 p.m.: Quebec is reporting 17 new deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including 11 in the last 24 hours. There were also 53 new cases, for a total of 54,937.

There are 500 people in hospital, down 15 from the previous day. Of those, 52 are in intensive care.

The province also announced today it would cease providing daily updates as of Friday, in favour of once-a-week updates every Thursday.

A total of 5,441 people have died from the novel coronavirus in Quebec, and 23,710 have recovered.

12:20 p.m. (updated): Florida’s Department of Health on Wednesday confirmed 5,508 additional cases of COVID-19, setting another daily total record high since the start of the pandemic. The state now has a total of 109,014 confirmed cases.

Previously, the highest daily total of newly confirmed cases was on Saturday, with 4,049 cases. There were also 44 new deaths announced Wednesday, raising the statewide death toll to 3,281.

Less than half of the new cases were in South Florida. It is still unclear if any of the new deaths were in South Florida.

On Tuesday, Miami-Dade hospitalizations hit an all-time high for the second day in a row with 818 patients, according to Miami-Dade County’s “New Normal” dashboard data. According to Tuesday’s data, 108 people were discharged and 114 people were admitted.

While a record number of COVID-19 patients are filling Miami-Dade hospitals, with one medical center in Homestead reaching ICU capacity on Tuesday, hospitals countywide say they still have more beds available than beds filled with COVID-19 patients.

Hospital administrators say there is also a silver lining in the growing number of new cases and hospitalizations in Florida’s hardest-hit county: The patients are younger and not as severely ill as they were during the first wave in April, and doctors and nurses have gained valuable experience in the months-long pandemic — leading to shorter hospital stays and better outcomes.

Scientists are also still working to learn more about the virus, including how many people in the community are infected and have mild or no symptoms, which can make it difficult to determine what percentage of the cases hospitalizations represent.

10:52 a.m.: Ontario has extended its state of emergency to July 15.

Premier Doug Ford has said he is hopeful that will be the last extension of the emergency declaration. The motion passed the legislature this morning.

Many of the emergency orders made under the state of emergency are expected to continue even after July 15, including bans on large gatherings.

After the state of emergency expires, the province won’t be able to make new emergency orders, amend them, or re-enact old ones, but existing ones can be extended.

Local medical officers of health will still have certain powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, which is what some have used to require masks in commercial establishments.

10:37 a.m.: The Toronto International Film Festival has announced plans for this year’s annual movie marathon, which will include both physical and digital screenings, virtual red carpets and drive-ins.

The festival’s 45th edition is slated to run Sept. 10-19 and has been reimagined to follow the protocols set by authorities to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

Organizers say the 10-day event will have a lineup of 50 new feature films, five programs of shorts and an online industry conference.

It will also have outdoor experiences, press conferences, interactive talks, and Q-and-As with cast and filmmakers.

TIFF didn’t provide specific details on how such events will unfold, but it’s clear this will be a much different festival than the usual extravaganza of hundreds of films and a city crawling with stars, cinephiles and celebrity watchers.

The films include Francis Lee’s “Ammonite,” starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, Halle Berry’s directorial debut “Bruised,” and “Concrete Cowboy” by Ricky Staub, starring Idris Elba, Jharrel Jerome, and Lorraine Toussaint.

10:35 a.m.: The New York City Marathon, the world’s largest marathon and one of the city’s biggest annual spectacles, has been cancelled this year as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus continue to dash hopes of holding large-scale events, organizers announced Wednesday.

The race, one of the most prestigious and lucrative events of its kind, would have celebrated its 50th anniversary in November. It is one of the highlights of fall in New York and on the endurance sports calendar, attracting more than 50,000 runners, 10,000 volunteers and roughly one million fans, who line nearly every accessible yard of the 42.1-km course through the five boroughs.

City officials and New York Road Runners, which owns and organizes the event, decided holding the race would be too risky. Public health experts have said mass events, especially those that bring people together from across the globe, will remain a danger until a treatment or a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is widely available.

With the announcement, New York became the third of the six major international marathons to be canceled in 2020.

10:30 a.m.: The Toronto International Film Festival will go ahead Sept. 10-19 but will be much smaller, with a lineup of 50 new feature films, five programs of short films, virtual red carpets, press conferences and industry talks. as well as interactive talks.

10 a.m.: The COVID-19 outbreak has sparked “an ugly ticketing pandemic” rife with racial profiling by overzealous enforcement officers, a new Canadian Civil Liberties Association report finds.

In a 37-page study entitled “Stay Off The Grass: COVID-19 and Law Enforcement in Canada,” the rights watchdog calculates 10,000 tickets were issued between April 1 and June 15.

Ferries will operate at 50 per cent capacity, Tory told reporters at a news conference at Jack Layton Ferry Terminal.

Passengers will be required to bring their own masks and wear them on the boat. Visitors are being urged to buy their ferry tickets in advance online at www.toronto.ca/ferry — only 5,000 tickets a day will be sold.

Passengers are also urged to plan a visit at non-peak hours if possible — 9:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.-6:30 p.m. are the busiest times.

Only one ferry had been operating during the COVID-19 lockdown, principally for the 700 residents of the islands.

While washrooms on the islands will be open, Centreville Amusement Park and play structures on the islands will remain closed.

Ferry tickets must be purchased ahead of time online and are only valid for the date selected at the time of purchase. Additional staff will be on hand at the ferry terminal to assist visitors with these new requirements.

7:28 a.m. Oxford University said testing for coronavirus infection could become quicker and more accurate, following the launch of a multicenter national program of research to evaluate how new diagnostic tests perform in hospitals, general practices and care homes.

The COVID-19 National DiagnOstic Research and Evaluation Platform, or CONDOR, will create a single national route for evaluating new diagnostic tests in hospitals and in community healthcare settings, according to a statement on the university’s website on Tuesday morning.

The research program seeks to bring together experts who are “highly experienced in evaluating diagnostic tests and generating the robust evidence required” for a test to be used in the U.K.’s National Health Service statement.

Jointly led by the University of Oxford and the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, the program will put the many tests developed by the life sciences industry to either detect current coronavirus infection or to find out if someone has previously been infected through their paces in hospital, general practice, and care home environments.

7:26 a.m.: New virus cases declined Wednesday in China and its capital, Beijing, where a roughly two-week spike appears to be firmly on the wane.

A total of 12 cases were reported nationwide, compared to 22 the day before. Beijing had seven cases, down from 13. There were two cases in neighbouring Hebei province and three that were brought in from abroad.

No new deaths were reported and 359 people remained in treatment for COVID-19, with another 118 in monitoring and isolation for testing positive while showing no symptoms or for being suspected cases.

China has reported 4,634 deaths from 83,430 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Beijing’s ongoing outbreak has topped 250 cases, virtually all linked to the city’s biggest wholesale market, and led to lockdowns of some neighbourhoods and the closing of recently re-opened schools.

7 a.m.: Sicily’s governor says 28 migrants who were rescued at sea have tested positive for the coronavirus, confirming a new complication in Italy’s efforts to manage waves of migrants smuggled across the Mediterranean from Africa.

The migrants were being held on a ship off Porto Empedocle where they’re taken to quarantine after being rescued.

Sicily Governor Nello Musumeci said in a Facebook post Wednesday that the positive tests confirmed that he was right to demand special at-sea quarantine measures for migrants to prevent new clusters from forming in Italy, the onetime European epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The positive tests come as an Italian parliamentary commission is visiting Porto Empedocle precisely to check on migrant and health care issues.

Summertime has traditionally been peak season for migrant smugglers operating in lawless Libya, and officials have predicted an increase in efforts to reach Europe with the easing of the health emergency in Italy and the resumption of activities of humanitarian rescue ships in the Mediterranean.

6:10 a.m.: You can finally get a haircut, eat at a restaurant patio, or visit malls in Toronto and Peel Region for the first time in 13 weeks on Wednesday as they join the majority of Ontario in entering Stage 2 of the province’s reopening plan.

The province announced Monday that more businesses and services will be allowed to open with appropriate public health measures in place.

Restaurants and bars will be open for delivery, takeout and outdoor dining only, according to the City of Toronto. Shopping malls will be open, but you’ll have to go elsewhere to enjoy the food court as dining spaces will be prohibited.

Personal care services like barber shops, hair styling, nails, tattoos and esthetic services will be allowed to open. Though you will have to hold off on face-related pampering like facials and beard trims a while longer.

Recreational and cultural spaces are also allowed to reopen, including water recreational services like indoor and outdoor swimming pools and splash pads. Community centres will reopen for “a very limited number of modified uses,” the City says, including certain outdoor sports and recreational activities. Campgrounds, museums, galleries, aquariums, zoos and heritage institutions are also reopening. As are libraries with limited on-site services, film and television production, tours and guide services.

6:05 a.m.: New coronavirus cases in the U.S. have surged to their highest level in two months and are now back to where they were at the peak of the outbreak.

The U.S. on Tuesday reported 34,700 new cases of the virus, according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University that was published Wednesday. There have been only two previous days that the U.S. has reported more cases: April 9 and April 24, when a record 36,400 cases were logged.

New cases in the U.S. have been surging for more than a week after trending down for more than six weeks. While early hot spots like New York and New Jersey have seen cases steadily decrease, the virus has been hitting the south and west. Several states on Tuesday set single-day records, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas.

Cases were also surging in other parts of the world. India reported a record daily increase of nearly 16,000 new cases. Mexico, where testing rates have been low, also set a record with more than 6,200 new cases.

But China appears to have tamed a new outbreak of the virus in Beijing, once again demonstrating its ability to quickly mobilize vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days.

Tuesday 7 p.m.: The owner of a farm where some 199 migrant workers have tested positive for COVID-19 says his operation assiduously followed public health guidelines to prevent an outbreak, and has previously been lauded for providing quality accommodation to migrant workers.

In an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Scotlynn Growers president Scott Biddle said the local health department has “always used us as an example for what other farmers should be doing.”

“We’re building housing for another hundred men this year,” Biddle told the Star, adding that the new accommodation will be larger than what’s currently required by Health Canada to account for any changes to federally-mandated housing standards.

The comments come after a Star investigation revealed a history of complaints at Scotlynn by Mexican migrant workers about substandard housing and other concerns.

In reports to the Mexican Ministry of Labour between 2016 and 2018, workers described overcrowded bunkhouses, bedbug infestations, and sometimes failure to receive timely medical attention. Scotlynn received 33 complaints over the two year period, the highest number of any Canadian farm.

On Saturday, 55-year-old father of four Juan López Chaparro, who worked at Scotlynn, died after fighting COVID-19 for three weeks.

Tuesday 6:50 p.m.: Canada could avoid a second wave of the coronavirus if it learns the lessons of South Korea and Taiwan and attacks testing, tracing and treatment of COVID-19 cases and practices “dynamic distancing” from the get-go, MPs heard Tuesday.

That means as the economy reopens, communities must be ready to reimpose physical distancing and socially restrictive measures periodically with surges in disease activity in order to contain outbreaks and allow economic revitalization to continue, Asaph Young Chun, head of Korea’s Statistics Research Institute, told the Commons health committee.

Those “nonpharmaceutical” interventions are the best “exit strategy” from the COVID-19 lockdowns, he said.

Two American health experts said South Korea and Taiwan showed the path for other countries to follow, but they warned Canada against reopening too quickly even to its neighbours, the United States.

Her Reporting Is Funded The Canadian Government Through Its Local Journalism Initiative. Reach Her Via Email', 'Victoriagibson Thestar.Ca']",2020-06-24,"Sometime in the last few weeks, a person died in an encampment below a Toronto expressway. By the time police discovered the body over the weekend, they were unable to identify them — not their estimated age, nor race, nor ethnicity or gender.

The discovery underneath the Gardiner, prompted by a call for an overdose in progress, went unannounced — recorded by police as a sudden death and passed into the hands of a coroner.

The quiet end to a life has alarmed advocates, who question how someone could have died in the city unnoticed.

“I just feel like we failed somebody, and I don’t really know how to put that into words,” said Jennifer Evans, who’s been involved in outreach – bringing food and other supports – at the Lake Shore Boulevard and Spadina Avenue site for the last few years.

Evans heard of police in the encampment on Saturday, but has struggled to get answers about what happened.

Encampments have been thrust to the forefront of the conversation about homelessness in Toronto since the COVID-19 crisis began.

When the virus hit, the city stopped clearing outdoor sites. But by late April, they announced plans to start again – with Mayor John Tory citing concerns about the virus spreading through the makeshift camps.

The plan was to offer individuals living outdoors alternate housing in spaces like hotels and apartment buildings before clearings took place. That plan led to standoffs between outreach workers and the city, including one last month at the site beneath the Gardiner. Since the site was cleared, Evans said the “vast majority” of former residents were now in better housing.

Contrary to the city’s position, she said she had encouraged people to live in encampments instead of the shelter system during COVID-19. As of Sunday, seven shelters in the city were reporting outbreaks, with between three and 48 cases per facility.

But this overlooked death left Evans devastated. “Somebody got left behind,” she said.

On Tuesday afternoon, the person who died was identified as a woman by Mary-Anne Bédard, manager of the city’s shelter, support and housing administration, who did not name the deceased.

She originally connected with the city’s Streets to Homes in 2011, but dropped off its radar from 2012 to 2017. In 2018, she reconnected with the program, and as of early May, was living at an encampment on Lake Shore. She was offered space in a hotel, but after a few weeks was discharged from the program for, according to Bédard, using “racial language” and causing property damage. They offered the woman a referral elsewhere, Bédard said, but she refused.

The last time they touched base with the woman was June 5. An autopsy will determine how and when she died.

In light of the death, Bédard reiterated the city’s stance that indoor spaces, like shelters and hotels, were safer than living outside. She argued that the city and community agencies had gone to “extraordinary efforts” to prevent COVID-19 spread in their facilities, noting that encampments offer less opportunity for staff to check on a person’s well being.

Bédard, Evans and street nurse Cathy Crowe each pointed out that, when offering support at an encampment, they could only really call out to individuals. If no one responded, they wouldn’t start unzipping tents themselves. “We don’t want to invade people’s privacy,” Evans explained.

In her view, the city has made strides. She said there was now a clearer separation between the time encampment residents were offered alternate housing, and the actual clearing of the sites.

Crowe, though, has criticized the city for being slow to address the problem and find alternate housing options.

City Coun. Joe Cressy, whose ward includes the Gardiner encampment, acknowledged on Tuesday that the city needed to do more to address chronic homelessness – specifically noting that they’d have “failed” if they created new spaces during COVID-19, then sent people back into an overcrowded shelter system. But he also took aim at other levels of government, alleging that they hadn’t “stepped up.”

“Have all three levels of government done enough? Absolutely not,” he told the Star.

Not all encampments in the city are facing the same conditions. In Trinity Bellwoods Park, Michael O’Hare and Jason Hollis are among what they estimate to be around 20 people living in tents.

The men had lived in the park for about a week and a half, O’Hare said on Tuesday, and so far, haven’t been pressured by anyone to leave. “I know there are much worse places to be homeless,” O’Hare said.

They’ve still been able to pick up packed lunches from the Scott Mission shelter and people had dropped off food.

“It could be worse,” Hollis said.

The encampment beneath the Gardiner is a different story. “It’s scary underneath Spadina Bridge,” O’Hare said, warning of stray needles scattered among the rocks and rubble.

Early on Tuesday morning, the Gardiner encampment was quiet. Furniture was overturned, belongings were scattered about, an open bag of cereal was perched on the rocks and, near a makeshift shelter slung with blue and green tarp, a single naloxone kit had been discarded.

“That’s a person that had a family, and lived in a community of people,” Evans said on Tuesday, reflecting on the death discovered on Saturday. “And those people want to know what happened.”

In a news release, it says Carole Dawson, who died Sunday, will be remembered as a kind-hearted leader who fought for Indigenous title and rights.

Dawson worked as the union’s health liaison officer and later as its family, children and health Director.

The union says she was a survivor of St. Michael’s Residential School at Alert Bay and overcame trauma, violence and loss to help and heal others as an addictions and sex-abuse counsellor.

Grand Chief Stewart Phillip paid tribute to Dawson, saying her loss is a devastating reminder that the pandemic is far from over and continues to be a threat to Indigenous health and welfare.

He says he hopes the province takes every precaution to protect Indigenous lives and ensure the public is following proper health protocols.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"Hair salons, estheticians, barber shops, restaurants, bars and more can get back to business mid-week as Toronto moves into Stage 2 of reopening.

It is a moment many in the city have been waiting for, not only because Toronto is one of the last places in the province to receive the green light for Stage 2. But also because restaurant patios are beckoning, and shaggy hair styles and unvarnished nails have people itching to get back in the chair.

But patience will be needed as Toronto businesses enforce COVID-19 social distancing protocols and slowly ramp up ahead of Wednesday’s opening after being closed for months.

“The general difference is going to be things are moving slower,” said Janet Lourenco, the area manager for Paupers Pub and Madison Avenue Pub, which will both open on Wednesday.

“People are going to have to practice patience when they go out to restaurants. You’re going to be waiting pretty much for everything, because we have to be cautious. There’s a lot of cleaning, a lot more cleaning between guests, between activities. We can’t serve a table their food and then collect the dirty dishes off another table and then go give someone their bill. We have to really think through every step … it just means we’re going to be moving slow and deliberate throughout the process.”

Lourenco spent Tuesday holding run-throughs with staff, while 100 unopened reservations piled up.

For those who get a seat, expect “pretty much everything” to be different, Lourenco said.

All guests will be asked to line up in a social-distanced manner outside. A host will process reservations and walk ups outside. Inside, Lourenco and colleagues have changed the flow of traffic in the building so it moves one-way where possible. Staff will be wearing masks and guests will be asked to wear masks in line and when moving within the building.

Lourenco plans to reserve up to 75 per cent of Paupers’ seats, to allow for some walk-up traffic. It will be operating at half capacity.

“People definitely won’t be expecting to have to make a reservation,” she said. “We’ve been advertising on the building and on our social media that we are requesting reservations because also we have to provide information for contact tracing for Toronto Public Health.”

Tables on the patio will be first come, first served at King Street West restaurant Marben, which is opening patio doors as of Friday for dinner service and will be offering weekend brunch.

“We hate the idea of a table sitting empty, awaiting a reservation, when there are guests asking to be seated,” said head chef Chris Locke, though he said the restaurant may pivot to reservations in the future.

Diners will be able to access menus using QR codes on the tables, though laminated copies will be available if requested.

Locke said the restaurant has received “a lot of interest and support via social media” since announcing its reopening.

“As an independent, neighbourhood restaurant, we have been struggling to survive for the past seven weeks. We are very excited to be allowed to open our patio for dinner and weekend brunch service,” he said.

If it’s grooming services you’re looking for, expect much of the same — meaning many differences.

Sylvie Prud’Homme, owner and operator of west end hair salon The Loft, said that her staff are preparing to “hit the ground running” when they open their doors on June 26.

The salon is booked through August, she said, due in part to a newly implemented rule preventing double bookings.

“If you’ve gotten your hair done and gotten your colour done at a salon, your stylist walks away while you’re processing to take in somebody else,” Prud’Homme explained. “We’re not doing that because we have to limit the amount of people that are entering the salon and the amount of space that we have between clients.”

That means that a stylist who usually processes eight clients a day is now working on about four, stretching out wait times for an appointment.

The salon is working on a priority system of scheduling seniors, front-line workers and those who were booked in for an appointment before Ontario shuttered in mid-March.

Prud’Homme said more than 200 emailed booking requests have flooded in since the province announced Toronto’s reopening on Monday.

Among the safety protocols The Loft has implemented are the removal of their waiting area, Plexiglas barriers installed near the washing stations, temperature checks and a six-foot distance between cutting stations.

Civello Salons, which has three locations in Toronto, will also open on Friday morning, after a “final cleaning” this week, said CEO and founder Ray Civello. They’ll ask clients to come in with clean hair and no product. Hair dressers will not be shampooing or drying client’s locks.

“We feel if you can get in and out a little quicker, that’s better,” he said. “More comforting at this time ... That’s obviously going to change as quickly as we can.”

They had 6,000 appointments in their books in Toronto that had to be cancelled at the outset of COVID-19. The goal is to get a hold of as many of those clients as possible to reschedule, Civello said.

“It’s a totally unique experience,” he said. “It’s not like Christmas or like holidays or anything like that. It’s like nothing we’ve had to do before. We’ve been closed for three months now so that’s like a full cycle of clients.”

The hope is to book double the number of people into the next cycle than they normally would, Civello said. That won’t be easy with fewer chairs — every second chair was removed from the buildings — and an extra 10 minutes added to every appointment, but extended salon hours could help make up for lost time.

Civello Salons have already reopened salons in Vancouver and Oakville. Those reopenings have going “extremely well,” said Civello, despite not knowing what to expect when the doors initially opened. He doesn’t know of one salon in Canada or the United States that has been linked to a positive COVID-19 test, and he hopes to keep it that way.

“It’s exciting and at the same time we want to be so careful ... I think it’s amazing we’re doing as well as we are and I think that’s a testament to all the precautions that people are taking.”

Jeff Armstrong, owner of Majesty’s Pleasure spas on King Street West and in Yorkville, has been preparing to reopen since businesses were shut down by keeping in contact with Toronto Public Health and medical suppliers and developing internal policies.

Booking for the salons will start again on Wednesday, as the Majesty’s Pleasure venues are being deep cleaned and sterilized. About 85 staff members will be trained on new measures in the salon on Thursday — including temperature-checking guests with a touchless infrared thermometer, contactless payments and retails, mandatory masks and face shields for staff and tools sterilized in a dental-level autoclave — before doors open on Friday.

“The pent up demand for appointments, it’s a wonderful problem to have ... We didn’t realize but we left a few days open on our (booking) calendar, like by accident we had this Saturday already open on our calender, and we’re fully booked,” Armstrong said. “We expect to be fully booked starting tomorrow probably until the end of next week and probably well into July.”

Majesty’s Pleasure also offers bar service, which will still be available to clients after their appointments on their venues’ licensed, limited-capacity patio spaces, weather dependent. Inside, Armstrong said they’re lucky to have 2,500 square feet at both locations, larger than your average spa footprint.

Manicures, pedicures, hair cuts and colours, waxing anywhere but the face and massage are all available, though massages during manicures and pedicures are not yet allowed, Armstrong said.

For those who aren’t ready to go out, Majesty’s Pleasure has created at-home manicure box sets, with a portion of the proceeds going to The Frontline Fund.

But Armstrong and his staff are excited to welcome people back.

“It was a very difficult time … We feel proud that we defended the business and we’re able to have a place for people to come back to and it’s just so great to have the staff come back,” Armstrong said. “I think we were also an escape for people in their everyday lives to come and have some self care done and to know that our guests can now step out of their home and have a little bit of paradise in their day, it just makes me so happy.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Nicholas Keungimmigration Reporter', 'Immigration Reporter', 'Nicholas Keung Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Immigration For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"How close is too close in the age of COVID-19?

As countries, including Canada, slowly emerge from lockdowns, social-distancing rules have eased as authorities try to strike a balance between keeping people safe and being realistic while social interactions and commercial activities resume.

On Tuesday, England became the latest country to join the “one-metre” club as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the new physical-distance recommendation, paring it down to 100 centimetres from 200.

Currently, some countries — such as China, Denmark, France and Singapore are following the one-metre rule of the World Health Organization; while others fall anywhere between one and two metres.

In the United States, the CDC recommends a minimum of six feet or 1.83 metre.

The Public Health Agency of Canada follows the two-metre rule.

So, why the difference, and what’s safe?

Here’s what the experts said.

“Two metres is more a theoretical number based on our best assessment of how far droplets can travel,” said Dr. Alon Vaisman, an infectious-disease physician at Toronto’s University Health Network.

“It’s possible for droplets to travel further or shorter, depending on the individuals, but that two metres is the rough estimate of what it should be and what we recommend.”

While there’s a general consensus among scientists about the two-metre safe-distance rule, Vaisman said government policymakers don’t always base decisions on scientific evidence and often take into account other factors, such as practicality.

“If two metres is not practical for the majority of people where they work and live, you’re better off staying at one metre,” he said, maintaining that a two-metre distance strikes a “reasonable balance” between reducing risks and practicality.

According to Toronto infectious disease specialist Dr. Michael Gardam, up until a decade ago, the standard distance of isolation that was required for droplet-spread infections was actually just one metre. That optimal distance was based on clinical evidence from studies that go back to the middle of last century.

In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended that to two metres during the H1N1 pandemic, based on experimental evidence in labs.

“Both clinical and experimental evidence are important, and one doesn’t trump the other,” said Gardam, the chief of staff at Humber River Hospital.

(Clinic evidence is based on findings from treatment of patients while experimental evidence derives from experiments in a controlled environment.)

Currently experimental evidence is suggesting that people can get airborne transmission of the COVID-19 virus when they create airborne aerosols while singing, coughing or breathing.

“The problem is epidemiologically that doesn’t fit. We are not seeing evidence of airborne transmission. We are seeing large droplet transmission,” noted Gardam.

“With the case of the two-metre distancing thing, if you can, follow the precautionary principle, which is, until it’s absolutely proven there’s no risk, you should assume there’s a risk.”

Some health authorities also advise people to stay about two arms’ length from others, which Gardam said is not the most precise way to assert a social distance because shorter individuals, such as children, have shorter reach but still need to observe the safe distance.

“Safe distance doesn’t vary based on height,” Gardam said, noting that the concentration of particles dilutes with distance from the source.

“The further, the better.”

Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, said he believed the U.K. government adjusted the recommended social distancing in order to make the practice “sustainable” in the new normal.

“We don’t know what effect this may have. People are not good at judging distance. We don’t have magic compliance in telling distance. It’s really about how safe people feel and trust (the distance),” Furness said.

The experts said Canada’s two-metre rule is conservative but appropriate, and Ottawa should stick to that approach.

“The public is going to find it confusing every time there’s a change,” Vaisman said.

“From a practical point of view, for them to buy your message from public health, changes will probably be more harm than good because you start losing credibility.”

Furness said social distancing is among many new rituals — such as wearing masks and washing hands — people need to keep observing and following in this new age.

“You can’t substitute one with another. You can’t take your mask off because you keep your social distance and think you don’t need it,” said Furness. “The stakes are too high.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Gilbert Ngabostaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Gilbert Ngabo Is A Star Breaking News Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"Mohamed Dasu is angry at the coronavirus — for killing thousands of people across the world and bringing so much in life to a standstill. And especially for ruining a dream he’s had since Grade 9: the high school graduation ceremony.

“It hurts to not have your family and friends watch you at graduation and go to the prom parties,” said Dasu, a Grade 12 student who’s finishing up at Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute and heading to the University of Toronto next year.

“I guess it’s a life lesson for us to build character, because life is going to throw things at us that we’re going to have to somehow work with and find solutions around.”

He and other students in the final year at the school are thankful to a group of teachers who found a way to celebrate their achievement despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dozens of teachers held a parade Tuesday afternoon through the neighbourhoods of Flemingdon Park and Thorncliffe Park where the majority of the Grade 12 students at Marc Garneau C.I. live. The parade was the teachers’ way of showing love to these students and giving them the send off they deserve in a time of lockdown and physical distancing due to the coronavirus.

Many schools in Toronto have been planting congratulatory signs in the front lawns of houses where graduating students live. Across the country, some schools have found innovative ways to hold mini-ceremonies in front yards and give speeches and hand over diplomas to the grads, while respecting physical distancing measures. That’s all well and good, said Karen Herder, one of the parade organizers at Marc Garneau, but her school couldn’t do the same thing because many of their students live in highrise apartments and don’t have private lawns.

The organizers learned last week that TDSB was opposed to the plan, and that the parade was “not a board sanctioned activity.”

The school principal was informed by a TDSB lawyer that there were liability issues in case of an accident. The group originally had arranged for a police escort, but later was told that wouldn’t be possible as it wasn’t a board sanctioned event. The teachers were willing to sign a waiver that wouldn’t hold TDSB liable for any accident, Herder said, but they didn’t hear back on that.

TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star the board has not officially sanctioned any parades for graduates at any of their schools, and Marc Garneau wasn’t “being singled out at all.”

“We want to be very cautious with that, and health and safety comes first,” he said, insisting the board can’t be seen as allowing a large group of people to get together and perform a parade in time of COVID-19.

In a written statement, Bird added such activities can go ahead as long as they’re organized by the school’s community and not the school itself. TDSB has cancelled all graduation ceremonies until the fall and left it up to individual schools to find creative ways to celebrate that are still safe for everyone involved.

With highrise buildings, no front lawns and few options but a parade, the board’s stance just didn’t seem fair, Herder said.

“It feels even more unjust that there are schools in affluent neighbourhoods where the teachers can go around to their homes and grads can stand out on their porch and get celebrated. We’re just trying to do the same and we get told no,” she said.

So, the organizers plowed ahead, mobilizing dozens of cars on Tuesday decorated with balloons and posters to parade through students’ neighbourhoods. They were greeted with grads and families cheering from balconies and windows.

For Dasu, the parade is more than just a good gesture of support to the graduating students. It adds a sense of “finality” to an academic year that has been full of challenges.

“I think the teachers had an amazing intent,” he said, adding it will be historically remembered as the year when graduating students had a parade. “It came from a concern that students are feeling isolated. It’s a beautiful thing and it really touched me.”

Herder, who has been teaching in the co-op department at Marc Garneau since 2007, said it’s been an especially challenging time for students in the area, who already deal with long-standing issues like community violence and Islamophobia.

Taking time to paint cars with colourful and positive signs, and making dozens of stops in one afternoon to celebrate those graduating from the school is just one way to try and lift people’s spirit during a very difficult time, she said.

“I have students that have not left their buildings since the start of the pandemic. Their mental health right now is at an all-time low,” she said.

“We just want to support our grads and let them know we’re there for them. We have a lot of amazing teachers who are so supportive, and it’s been a really hard time.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Miami Herald analysis of public and nonpublic COVID-19 data found that through June 3, new cases in Florida had consistently been trending up since mid-May and the trends could not be attributed solely to increases in testing.

And as bars, gyms, vacation rentals and movie theatres reopened at partial capacity in all but three South Florida counties, the number and rate of new COVID-19 cases were rising statewide — a troubling indicator that the disease could be spreading more quickly.

Less than half of the new cases and less than half of the new deaths were in South Florida, according to the Florida Department of Health’s COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard.

One of the tools that officials are relying on to determine if the coronavirus situation is improving in the state is hospitalization data. Unlike testing, which might be limited or take days to report results, hospitalizations can help give officials a real-time snapshot of how many people are severely ill with COVID-19.

The health department says it does not “have a figure” to reflect the number of people currently hospitalized and only provides the total number of hospitalizations in its statewide and county-level data. On Tuesday, 199 hospitalizations were added, bringing the statewide total to 13,318.

While Florida’s Department of Health is not releasing current statewide hospitalization data to the public, hospitals in Miami-Dade are self-reporting a number of key metrics, including hospitalizations, to the county, which has made this data public. Some provide updates every day; others don’t.

On Tuesday, Miami-Dade hospitalizations hit an all-time high for the second day in a row with 818 patients, according to Miami-Dade County’s “New Normal” dashboard data. According to Tuesday’s data, 108 people were discharged and 114 people were admitted.

Scientists are also still working to learn more about the virus, including how many people in the community are infected and have mild or no symptoms, which can make it difficult to determine what percentage of the cases hospitalizations represent.

Testing in Florida has seen steady growth since the COVID-19 crisis began.

Testing, like hospitalizations, helps officials determine the virus’s progress and plays a role in deciding whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders and loosen restrictions.

The recommended number of daily tests needed varies among experts, but the dean of the University of South Florida’s College of Medicine told the governor that Florida needs to test about 33,000 people every day.

Florida’s Department of Health reported 37,169 new tests Sunday in Monday’s daily COVID-19 update. The positive rate was 8.98 per cent of the total, according to the report. In total, and 1,911,676 tests have been conducted.

To date, 1,618,540 people have been tested in Florida. Of the total tested, 100,217 (about 6.19 per cent) have tested positive. The state says there are 1,546 tests with pending results. Tuesday’s testing results were not immediately available.

Health experts have previously told the Miami Herald that they were concerned the number of pending results listed by the state is an undercount. This is because Florida’s Health Department only announces the number of pending test results from state labs, not private ones — and private labs are completing more than 90 per cent of state tests.

Previously, it has taken as long as two weeks for pending test results from private labs to be added into the state’s official count, making it difficult for officials to project the size and scale of the pandemic in the state. It’s unclear how quickly results are currently being sent to the state from private labs, as the turnaround time varies by lab.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Matina Stevis-Gridneffthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Matina Stevis-Gridneffthe New York Timestue.']",2020-06-23,"BRUSSELS—European Union countries rushing to revive their economies and reopen their borders after months of coronavirus restrictions are prepared to block Americans from entering because the United States has failed to control the scourge, according to draft lists of acceptable travellers seen by The New York Times.

That prospect, which would lump American visitors in with Russians and Brazilians as unwelcome, is a stinging blow to American prestige in the world and a repudiation of President Donald Trump’s handling of the virus in the United States, which has more than 2.3 million cases and upward of 120,000 deaths, more than any other country.

European countries are currently haggling over two potential lists of acceptable visitors based on how countries are faring with the coronavirus pandemic. Both include China, as well as developing countries like Uganda, Cuba and Vietnam.

Travellers from the United States and the rest of the world have been excluded from visiting the European Union — with few exceptions mostly for repatriations or “essential travel” — since mid-March. But a final decision on reopening the borders is expected early next week, before the bloc reopens July 1.

A prohibition of Americans by Brussels partly reflects the shifting pattern of the pandemic. In March, when Europe was the epicentre, Trump infuriated European leaders when he banned citizens from most EU countries from travelling to the U.S. Trump justified the move as necessary to protect the United States, which at the time had roughly 1,100 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths.

In late May and early June, Trump said Europe was “making progress” and hinted that some restrictions would be lifted soon, but nothing has happened since then. Today, Europe has largely curbed the outbreak, even as the United States, the worst afflicted, has seen more infection surges just in the past week.

Prohibiting American travellers from entering the European Union would have significant economic, cultural and geopolitical ramifications. Millions of American tourists visit Europe every summer. Business travel is common, given the huge economic ties between the United States and the EU.

The draft lists were shared with the Times by an official involved in the talks and confirmed by another official involved in the talks. Two additional EU officials confirmed the content of the lists as well the details of the negotiations to shape and finalize them. All of the officials gave the information on condition of anonymity because the issue is politically delicate.

The forging of a common list of outsiders who can enter the bloc is part of an effort by the European Union to fully reopen internal borders among its 27 member states. Free travel and trade among members is a core principle of the bloc — one that has been badly disrupted during the pandemic.

Since the outbreak, the bloc has succumbed to piecemeal national policies that have resulted in an incoherent patchwork of open and closed borders.

Some internal borders have practically remained closed while others have opened. Some member states that desperately need tourists have rushed ahead to accept non-EU visitors and pledged to test them on arrival. Others have tried to create closed travel zones between certain countries, called “bubbles” or “corridors.”

Putting these safe lists together highlights the fraught, messy task of removing pandemic-related measures and unifying the bloc’s approach. But the imperatives of restoring the internal harmony of the EU and slowly opening up to the world are paramount, even if it threatens rifts with close allies, including the United States, which appears bound to be excluded, at least initially.

Trump, as well as his Russian and Brazilian counterparts, Vladimir Putin and Jair Bolsonaro, have followed what critics call a comparable path in their pandemic response that leaves all three countries in a similarly bad spot: they were dismissive at the outset of the crisis, slow to respond to scientific advice and saw a boom of domestic cases as other parts of the world, notably in Europe and Asia, were slowly managing to get their outbreaks under control.

Countries on the EU draft lists have been selected as safe based on a combination of epidemiological criteria. The benchmark is the EU average number of new infections — over the past 14 days — per 100,000 people, which is currently 16 for the bloc. The comparable number for the United States is 107, while Brazil’s is 190, and Russia’s is 80, according to a Times database.

Once diplomats agree on a final list, it will be presented as a recommendation early next week before July 1. The EU can’t force members to adopt it, but European officials warn that failure of any of the 27 members to stick to it could lead to the reintroduction of borders within the bloc.

The reason this exercise is additionally complex for Europe is that, if internal borders are open, but member states don’t honour the same rules, visitors from non-approved countries could land in one European country and then jump onward to other EU nations undetected.

European officials said the list would be revised every two weeks to reflect new realities around the world as countries see the virus ebb and flow.

The process of agreeing on it has been challenging, with diplomats from all European member states hunkering down for multiple hours-long meetings for the past few weeks.

As of Tuesday, the officials and diplomats were poring over two versions of the safe list under debate and were scheduled to meet again Wednesday to continue sparring over the details.

One list contains 47 countries and includes only those countries with an infection rate lower than the EU average. The other longer list has 54 countries and also includes those nations with slightly worse case rates than the EU average, going up to 20 new cases per 100,000 people.

The existing restrictions on non-essential travel to all 27 member states plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein were introduced March 16 and extended twice until July 1, in a bid to contain the virus as the continent entered a three-month long confinement.

“Discussions are happening very intensively,” to reach consensus in time for July 1, said Adalbert Jahnz, a spokesperson for the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch. He called the process “frankly, a full-time job.”

The EU agency for infectious diseases, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, warned negotiators that the case numbers were so dependent on the level of truthfulness and testing in each country that it was hard to vouch for them, officials taking part in the talks said.

China, for example, has been accused of withholding information and manipulating the numbers of infections released to the public. In parts of the developing world, case numbers are very low, but it’s hard to determine whether they paint an accurate picture given limited testing.

And in the United States, comments made by Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Okla., over the weekend highlighted how easy it is to manipulate a country’s case numbers, as he suggested that domestic testing was too broad.

“When you do testing to that extent, you’re gonna find more people, you’re gonna find more cases. So I said to my people, slow the testing down, please,” Trump told supporters.

European embassies around the world could be enlisted to help verify or opine on the data provided that would inform the final list, negotiators said, another indication that the list could end up being quite short if European diplomats at embassies said reported numbers were unreliable.

Many EU countries are desperate to reopen their borders to visitors from outside the region to salvage tourism and boost airlines’ revenue while keeping their own borders open to each other. Some have already started accepting visitors from outside the bloc.

At the other extreme, a few European countries, including Denmark are not prepared to allow any external visitors from non-EU countries and are likely to continue with this policy after July 1.

Germany, France and many other EU countries want non-European travellers to be allowed, but are also worried about individual countries tweaking the safe list or admitting travellers from excluded countries, officials said.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-23,"EDMONTON—The Alberta government has quietly halted the closure of 17 provincial parks and recreation sites this year because of COVID-19.

The province had initially planned to fully or partially close 20 provincial parks and hand off another 164 to third-party managers, but officials quietly updated the COVID-19 response page on the Alberta Parks website.

“We will operate the 17 parks sites previously identified for closure this season because we want to give Albertans more opportunities to camp and connect with nature over the summer as we all recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” says a note on the website.

“This is a temporary measure for this camping season.”

Some of the parks and recreation areas staying open this summer include: Twin Lakes, Sheep Creek, Chain Lakes and Dry Island Buffalo Jump.

The plan to close some sites and hand over others has raised concerns among many, with one online petition getting more than 52,000 signatures.

The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society said the move to keep some parks open this season is an important step in the right direction that shows the voices of Albertans are making a difference.

“We are relieved to see this update, but emphasize that these sites need to be available to Albertans not just this summer, but also in the future,” the organization said in a statement.

It noted that the website doesn’t address what is happening with the 164 sites that were to be handed off to third-party managers.

No one from Alberta Environment was immediately available for comment.

Environment Minister Jason Nixon has previously said the sites for which no manager can be found will lose park status and revert to general Crown land, which can be sold.

Prior to the changes for this year, the plan would have seen the loss of about 16,000 hectares of parks and recreation area — small compared with the province’s total park system, but one-third of the number of sites the province manages.

Budget documents suggest the move would have saved about $5 million.

Read', 'Sarah Mervoshthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-06-23,"PITTSBURGH—After months of lockdown in which outbreaks of the coronavirus often centred in nursing homes, prisons and meat packing plants, the United States is entering a new and uncertain phase of the pandemic. New COVID-19 clusters have been found in a Pentecostal church in Oregon, a strip club in Wisconsin, and in every imaginable place in between.

In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, at least 100 people tested positive for the virus after visiting bars in the Tigerland nightlife district, popular among Louisiana State University students.

At a Christian summer camp near Colorado Springs, at least 11 employees fell ill just before the season’s opening, leading the camp to cancel overnight stays for the first time in 63 years.

And in Las Vegas, just weeks after casinos reopened, a handful of employees from casinos, restaurants and hotels have tested positive, and frightened workers on Monday begged guests to wear masks in a news conference conducted over video.

The newly emerging clusters — which vary in size from a handful of cases to hundreds and have cropped up in large cities as well as small towns — reflect the unpredictable course of the coronavirus. They also underscore risks that experts say are likely to persist as long as states try to reopen economies and Americans venture back into public without a vaccine.

New known virus cases were on the rise in 23 states on Monday as the outlook worsened across much of the nation’s South and West. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus reached their highest levels yet in the pandemic in Arizona and Texas, and Missouri reported its highest single-day case totals over the weekend.

Even as much of the Northeast and Midwest continued to see improvement, there were signs of new spread in Ohio, where case numbers have started trending upward after weeks of improvement, and in Pennsylvania, where several counties have had troubling numbers of cases.

“This is exactly what most people would expect when you lift stay-at-home orders and isolation orders,” said Rebecca Christofferson, an infectious-disease expert at Louisiana State University, who said that reopening along with fatigue over social distancing for many Americans were creating new sorts of virus clusters.

“All of those things combined just make it a complex problem — human behaviour, contact and virus,” she said. “You put it all in a big pot, and boom!”

The virus is now hitting places that had once escaped the worst of the pandemic, reflecting how a disease that initially ravaged urban centres like New York City has grown more widespread. Known cases now have been on the rise near places like McAllen, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; and Nogales, Arizona.

In Union County, Oregon, a rural community of 27,000 about four hours from Portland, officials had recorded only eight cases of the virus by early June. By June 20, the tally had swelled to over 250. Most have been tied to an outbreak at a local church, the Lighthouse Pentecostal Church.

“It was a little bit surprising, because so many people for so long were following stay-at-home,” said Paul Anderes, a Union County commissioner.

Houses of worship, which were once shut down under governors’ orders in many states, are now emerging as sources of major clusters. Outbreaks at churches have been reported in states including Alabama, Kansas and West Virginia.

Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said that six outbreaks had been linked to churches in the state, including three that were still active as of last week. He said he had no plans to close churches, describing them as “the most sacred ground,” but also acknowledged that they posed a significant danger.

“The reality is really simple,” he said. When congregants do not adhere to wearing masks or sitting every other pew, he said, “we’re asking for it.”

As more segments of the nation reopen, predicting where new clusters will emerge has grown complex. Public health experts are closely watching group gatherings, which threaten to become “super spreader” events, as well as less understood circumstances, in which certain people seem to be more predisposed to transmit the virus.

“The characteristic of this virus — and this is what makes it so difficult to control — is that you do not necessarily have uniform spreading,” said Dr. Arnold S. Monto, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “It’s erratic.”

Just as earlier in the pandemic, outbreaks continue to emerge in prisons, nursing homes and food processing facilities. More than 230 people were infected at a Dole vegetable packaging facility in Springfield, Ohio, and at least a dozen cases have been linked to an apple packaging facility in Oswego County, New York.

Public health officials in several states have identified coronavirus cases in more than 50 people who attended or worked at protests of police misconduct after the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in late May. So far, no major outbreaks had been directly linked to those gatherings.

Some of the newest clusters of cases have been tied to athletics, as student athletes return to campus and professional teams hope to play again. At least 23 football players at Clemson University have been infected, along with at least 10 athletes at Iowa State and at least five football players at Texas State. Several professional sports teams, including the Philadelphia Phillies and Tampa Bay Lightning, have also reported cases.

New outbreaks in some cities have overwhelmed hospitals.

Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, warned over the weekend of “a desperate situation for public health” in central Washington’s Yakima County, where coronavirus cases have spiked, hospitals have reached capacity and patients were being taken to Seattle for medical care.

It echoes an earlier stage of the virus, when Washington state was in crisis mode after it reported the country’s first known case of the coronavirus in January and the country’s first major cluster at a nursing facility near Seattle in February.

After getting the initial outbreak under control, officials saw a resurgence in Yakima County, home to 250,000 people and more than 6,400 coronavirus infections. The situation has now grown dire: The county has more cases than all of South Dakota, and the virus has spread so widely that many Yakima hospital employees are calling off work because they feel ill or are in quarantine.

“We are frankly at the breaking point,” said Inslee, who planned to require people in the county to begin wearing face coverings in public. “We don’t want to see people in parking lots unable to get hospital care. And if we do not act aggressively now, that is what’s going to happen.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Amy Qinthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Amy Qinthe New York Timestue.']",2020-06-23,"For years, animal rights activists in China have lobbied policy-makers, organized education drives and staged protests to persuade the government and the public to support banning the eating of dogs and cats. They scored few concrete wins.

The coronavirus, which spread from a food market in China, changed everything.

After the national government suspended the sale of wildlife in February, the southern Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai became the first in the country to ban the consumption of cats and dogs. Last month, the Ministry of Agriculture, in a major step, removed dogs from its list of approved domesticated livestock, referring to dogs for the first time as “companion animals.”

Even in the southern Chinese city of Yulin, a dog meat festival that has long courted controversy opened on Sunday to less fanfare than in past years, as fears of the virus kept revelers away.

“We have been working on this issue for years, but the government kept passing the buck,” said Cynthia Zhang, a Guangzhou-based animal welfare activist. “So we are using the epidemic as an opportunity to try to push through as much legislation as possible.”

It is long-fought validation for a loose but fast growing network of local animal welfare activists.

While China’s practice of eating dog meat has received global attention from celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais and American reality television star Lisa Vanderpump, an often overlooked group of animal activists and pet lovers has been the on-the-ground force for change in communities and cities across the country. They have succeeded despite growing pushback from nationalistic critics who say that eating dog meat is a Chinese tradition, no different than the American love of turkey.

The animal activists have managed to carve out a space for their work in a country where advocacy and dissent have rapidly shrivelled under China’s leader Xi Jinping. While human rights lawyers and women’s rights activists are regularly targeted by the Communist Party, animal protection is seen as a relatively fringe issue and less menacing to the party — giving activists more room to manoeuvre.

Over the years, they have petitioned lawmakers and set up animal shelters. Some of the more zealous players have intercepted trucks carrying dogs for slaughter and lobbied on the steps of government agencies. At least a few hundred formal and informal groups across the country are estimated to be working on animal protection issues.

It remains to be seen how the new guidelines will be enforced. China still lacks national laws banning animal cruelty and the consumption of dogs and cats — all of which activists say are crucial to fully eliminating the practice.

But their efforts have received tacit backing from the fast-growing number of pet owners in China, drawn mostly from the country’s booming middle class. One recent survey conducted by local animal associations found that there were 55 million pet dogs in China last year, up eight per cent from the year before. As their legions have grown, so too has support for banning dog meat consumption.

“The younger generation of Chinese is more international, they have more universal values,” said Qin Xiaona, founder of Beijing’s Capital Animal Welfare Association. “The officials are getting younger, too.”

One activist, Qi Qi, 37, started pressing the issue in 2014 when she answered a call for help on social media from volunteers who had intercepted a truck with hundreds of dogs on the outskirts of Beijing. Over two days, Qi helped care for the dogs as the volunteers negotiated with police and the driver to hand over the animals. Qi went on to participate in about 20 truck rescues, though not all were as successful.

Recently, Qi and her husband have shifted their focus to raising awareness. The couple recently opened a cafe in a trendy Beijing shopping mall where they host talks about animal protection and donate a portion of their proceeds to local trap-neuter-release efforts. Earlier this month, when a truck full of dogs was intercepted in northeastern China, Qi stood with a group of volunteers outside the Ministry of Agriculture every day for a week to urge officials to intervene by putting pressure on local authorities to release the dogs.

“We don’t say it’s to protect dogs, but rather to enforce the law and safeguard public health,” said Qi. “In China, if you say you are doing this because you are a dog lover, a lot of people will be turned off, so we try to circle around it.”

Zhang, the Guangzhou-based activist, said that for years, she and a group of volunteers had taken a more combative stance, staging protests at local government offices and going head-to-head with dog meat vendors.

“The space for doing our work has shrunk,” Zhang said. She noted that authorities had shut down several active animal protection group discussions on the popular social messaging app WeChat after some members had criticized the government.

“There is still room to get our message out there,” she said. “As long as you don’t criticize the government.”

Several years ago, Zhang said, they changed tactics to take a more “positive” approach, focusing their efforts on reaching out to national policy-makers instead.

Zhang figures that her group has sent out thousands of letters to delegates to China’s top legislative bodies in recent years informing them about the dismal conditions of the dog meat trade, which is largely unregulated in China. Since there are few legal dog farms in China, activists say that most of the country’s dog meat comes from captured strays or stolen pets.

In 2015, Zhang said she and her colleagues were able to convince one delegate, a vegetarian, to propose a bill to ban the slaughter and consumption of cats and dogs at the annual gathering of China’s top law-making body. The proposal sparked a national conversation, and more lawmakers began to show interest.

But it wasn’t until the unexpected emergence of the coronavirus earlier this year — and the renewed scrutiny over the wildlife trade in China — that some of the policies long under discussion gained traction.

“China has been in a civil war between animal lovers and people who support dog meat consumption, and the animal lovers are gaining the upper hand,” said Peter J. Li, a China policy adviser with Humane Society International. “The Chinese government sees this.”

Persuading the public can still be an uphill battle.

The practice of eating dog meat is limited to a few areas of China and most people do not eat it regularly. Instead, defenders often subscribe to a belief that “while I may not eat dog meat, I support your right to do so.”

Xu Zhe, 22, a recent college graduate from the northeastern city of Dalian, said he eats dog meat once a year during the Chinese New Year and had no qualms about it even though he grew up with a dog at home.

“I have a deep connection with my dog, but not with the dog I’m eating,” Xu said.

The environment, though, is improving, even in the home of the Yulin Lychee and Dog Meat Festival.

While activists say many locals still eat dog meat, local officials, facing domestic and international pressure, have distanced themselves from the festival in recent years. Activists on the ground said that the atmosphere was noticeably quieter compared with past years, with far fewer visitors.

Read', 'Sarah Maslin Nirthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Sarah Maslin Nirthe New York Timestue.']",2020-06-23,"NEW YORK—As a trained disaster responder, Dr. Robin Brennen was well versed in proper safety procedures when she entered a coronavirus patient’s apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side in late March. She pulled on protective plastic bootees, a face mask and an eye shield.

Then, with a gloved hand, she picked up the rest of her equipment: a five-pound bag of cat kibble and a litter box.

The pandemic’s devastating human toll in New York City has been well documented. But it has also affected people’s lives in ways that have gotten less attention, including what happens to the pets of those who become seriously ill.

Brennen, a veterinarian at Animal Care Centers of NYC, is part of a team of specialists who help the animal companions that have been left behind.

Across the city, animal specialists in full-body personal protective gear enter homes to feed, at no charge, famished pets whose owners are hospitalized with the virus, or to take custody of pets belonging to patients who do not return home.

Pet owners who have died of the virus have left behind dogs, guinea pigs and cats, at least one of which starved to death before anyone had checked the owner’s apartment, according to Animal Care Centers of NYC.

For cats, which are susceptible to coronavirus infection, the city’s standard strategy is to essentially quarantine them in their homes for at least 14 days, with city animal specialists monitoring them. (It is unclear whether cats can pass the disease to humans.)

On the Upper West Side that day in March, residents of the co-op building had alerted Brennen’s organization that a woman who lived there was in intensive care battling the virus, and that her two beloved cats had been left behind.

Brennen went in and fed the cats twice a week.

“I knew how much she wanted those cats and loved them,” she said. “And I wanted them to be there for her when she got home.”

Ultimately, the cats’ owner died; a neighbour later adopted them.

“They don’t have her, but they had people willing to help her,” said Brennen, the animal care organization’s vice-president of animal health and welfare. “And that is something.”

Some virus patients, intubated and in intensive care units, have been unable to tell anyone that their dog or cat has been left behind, leaving neighbors to figure it out from plaintive pet sounds down the hall.

In late April, New York City’s emergency management and animal welfare offices introduced a hotline for people who were struggling to care for their pets because of the virus.

Some questions that come into the hotline, which is staffed by members of local animal rescue groups and representatives of the city agencies, are fairly basic. One example: Can my dog get the virus? (There have been few documented cases of dogs contracting the disease.)

The hotline’s primary goal is to help struggling or sick New Yorkers avoid surrendering their pets, connecting callers to things like subsidized emergency veterinary medicine and the city’s network of free pet food pantries.

But sometimes, surrendering pets is the only option: As of June 17, roughly 145 had been turned over via the hotline. The animals have been cared for by Brennen’s organization and by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Manhattan.

Animals surrendered by people who have contracted the virus must be quarantined for 14 days. After that, they can be adopted.

“It is so important, especially at this time, that this human-animal bond is taken care of,” said Christine Kim, the city animal welfare office’s senior community liaison. “This is the time when people need that the most.”

When Howard Katz, 61, a limousine driver from Massapequa, on Long Island, was hospitalized with the virus in April, his primary concern was not for himself, his sister, Cynthia Hertz, said. Instead, he was worried about Lucy, his Shiba Inu, who was readjusting after surgery for an illness that necessitated removing her eyes.

Hertz said she and her boyfriend spent three days calling vets, dog boarding facilities and rescue shelters to find someone to care for Lucy. No one would.

“They were afraid,” she said. “Lucy could be carrying the COVID, and nobody was able to help.”

A call to the pet hotline connected her with Jenny Coffey, the community engagement director at the rescue group Animal Haven.

The group, which Coffey said had fielded 215 cases so far, arranged for Lucy to stay at a Long Island boarding facility for three weeks. The cost was covered by a grant from Red Rover, a group that provides financial help to people with pets in crisis.

“It was like a lifeline for my brother,” said Hertz, adding that Katz was overjoyed to be reunited with Lucy after three weeks in a hospital and rehabilitation centre. “I didn’t know if he was going to make it if something had happened to Lucy.”

Entering homes where the virus is believed to have been present can be nerve-racking, said Feraz Mohammed, an animal control officer at Animal Care Centers of NYC.

On one recent day, Mohammed drove an agency van covered with images of cats and dogs to a South Bronx apartment building. A resident who was thought to have contracted the virus had been hospitalized; her dog and cat had not had food or water for five days.

Mohammed pulled on a mask, gloves and a Tyvek suit, meticulously sealing the openings around his wrists and ankles with tape. Then he grabbed his dog-catching stick and cat carrier.

Upstairs, a blond mop of a dog bounded out of the apartment, a blur of canine joy. Mohammed snapped a leash on the small dog and then went inside. He fished a tabby cat out from under the couch, and he cooed gently at the two pets as he brought them downstairs and locked them in cages in the truck.

“Once we get them fed, get them water,” he said, stroking the little dog’s head, “it makes me feel better about all of this.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Raphael Minderthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Raphael Minderthe New York Timestue.']",2020-06-23,"ALMADÉN DE LA PLATA, SPAIN—Extremeño, an imposing black bull who weighs more than half a ton, was set to fight to death next month in the neoclassical ring of the Spanish city of Valencia.

Instead, the coronavirus gave four-year-old Extremeño an unexpected lease on life. Valencia’s fiesta was called off, along with the bulk of a Spanish bullfighting season that normally runs from March to October.

Although Spain ended its COVID-19 state of emergency Sunday, bull breeders and matadors are continuing to lock horns with a left-wing Spanish government that they accuse of wanting to use the epidemic as an accelerator for bullfighting’s permanent removal, in line with the wishes of animal welfare activists.

“I find it deplorable that the fiesta of the Spanish people has become so politicized,” said Aurora Algarra, who owns Extremeño and is among the few women to run a bull farm, which she took over after her father died in 2006. “We now find ourselves under tremendous attack from Spain’s government, but at least this crisis has united us in the face of adversity in a way that I had not seen before.”

Algarra had been preparing to send 70 bulls this year to fight in the rings of Spain and southern France. Instead, the coronavirus lockdown had led her to send 30 of them to the slaughterhouse. She is earning about 400 euros, or $610, for each animal’s meat. That is only one-tenth of the cost of its upkeep during the four years in which a bull roams her nearly 2,000 acres of land in the empty countryside of Andalusia, the southern and largest region of Spain.

For now, Algarra is keeping Extremeño and her other bulls, while hoping bullfighting can restart soon. A breeder can earn thousands of euros by providing six bulls for a traditional fight, or corrida, with the world-famous Pamplona festival paying as much as 15,000 euros for each animal, Algarra said.

The Pamplona festival, famed because its bulls also run the city’s streets, was among the main events that were scrapped shortly after Spain declared its state of emergency in mid-March.

In recent years, bullfighting has not only been caught in strong political and economic crosswinds in Spain, it has also increasingly found itself denounced by activists who see it as publicly torturing animals.

During a corrida, the matador skillfully draws the bull toward him, at the risk of getting gored. At the end of a fight, the matador usually plunges his sword deep between the bull’s shoulders; then the dead animal is dragged from the ring. In some rare instances, the public spares a bull’s life by asking for it to be “pardoned” for its bravery.

In 2013, after the global financial crisis also significantly hurt the bullfighting sector, the conservative government at the time came to its defence by declaring bullfighting part of Spain’s cultural patrimony. This declaration was also a response to the growing separatist movement in Catalonia, whose regional Parliament voted to ban bullfighting in 2010.

Idled by the coronavirus, several leading matadors have recently waded more vigorously into Spain’s debate over bullfighting, both on social media and on the streets.

“We now have a government in Spain that sees the coronavirus as an opportunity to remove bullfighting altogether,” said Andrés Roca Rey, a Peruvian matador who joined a demonstration in Seville on June 13, when defenders of bullfighting rallied in several Spanish cities.

The government, however, insists that it is not mistreating the bullfighting sector. Faced with calls for his resignation, Spain’s culture minister, José Manuel Rodríguez Uribes, met with bullfighting representatives June 17 in Madrid. Afterward, the industry’s officials said they had received the minister’s promise that bullfighting would be excluded from a planned law that would protect animals against mistreatment.

Still, the tensions are simmering. Last month, Pablo Iglesias, Spain’s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-left party Unidas Podemos, said in Parliament, “It makes me very uncomfortable that something is promoted as a cultural practice that I cannot avoid seeing as delivering a lot of pain to an animal in a show for the enjoyment of people.”

Most opinion polls suggest that Spanish society is deeply split over bullfighting, just as it is increasingly fragmented over politics.

Roca Rey, who is 23 and one of the younger stars of bullfighting, said that 16 of his 17 fights last year in Spain sold out. Some younger fans, he said, are probably drawn to the ring because it is such a powerful Spanish tradition.

“I think many younger people now want to identify with their country, and they understand that watching bullfighting is about embracing the culture of Spain, and certainly not about seeing an animal suffer,” he said in an interview on an estate that he bought this year from a descendant of William Randolph Hearst, the American publishing tycoon.

Juan Pedro Domecq, deputy president of the union of Spanish breeders, said Spain’s government, no matter its political leanings, had “a constitutional obligation to support bullfighting because it is the backbone of Spanish culture.”

“The coronavirus hit a sector that was already in a complicated economic situation, reliant exclusively on spectators and without sponsorship or television revenues,” Domecq said. Advertising revenues have evaporated, he said, because “no sponsor wants to face the fierce attacks of animal activists.”

Since the lockdown, some animal welfare associations have asked the government to disburse funds to help those working in bullfighting find alternative jobs. Many workers are contractually tied to a specific matador, making it hard for them to get jobs elsewhere. Even so, most of the support staff earn money only when there is a fight.

Ana Belén Martín, a politician from Pacma, a party that defends animal welfare, said that bullfighting had been declining for more than a decade and that it was heading for a natural death, with or without COVID-19. Last year, 1,424 bull fiestas were held in Spain, down from 2,684 in 2009, according to government figures.

But Martín said the COVID-19 crisis should not become a reason to extend a lifeline to bullfighting.

“This is the culture of our past, not that of the society we want to build, focused on compassion and empathy rather than on people who applaud while watching an animal agonizing,” she said.

How to manage screen time during the pandemic,"['Karon Liu', 'Karon Liuculture Reportertue.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-23,"Every night, after ending a two hour Skype chat with my partner in New Jersey, I find myself staying up into the early morning, constantly refreshing my newsfeed and Facebook groups. My mind reminds me that every minute that I stay awake means one less minute of sleep, but I keep clicking anyway.

Increased usage of computer and mobile screens has been inevitable the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many are still working from home, talking to friends and family in a Brady Bunch-like Zoom grid, following YouTube workouts, shopping online and of course, reading up on the latest news — whether about politics, COVID-19 or protests against systemic racism and police brutality.

Since late March, Canadian journalist Karen K. Ho, who previously worked at Star Media Group, helped popularize the term doomscrolling, the act of endlessly scrolling through newsfeeds and being fixated on the grim news headlines from around the world.

While Ho didn’t invent the term (she says it dates back to at least 2018), doomscrolling has entered the modern lexicon. Merriam-Webster started tracking the usage of the word and called it a word to watch out for. Every evening, Ho sends out a tweet to remind her followers to stop doomscrolling and go to bed.

“It’s a reminder that as much as we are surrounded by screens, we have an active choice in using them or being overwhelmed by them,” she said, adding that she has deleted Twitter from her phone. “They’re a source of crucial information around the world, but there can also be real limits on the value they provide.”

Screens are here to stay, but the key is how to keep them from taking a toll on our mental and physical health.

Dr. Catherine Birken is a staff physician in pediatric medicine and senior scientist in the child health evaluative sciences program at the Hospital for Sick Children. For years she has been working with families and studying the health impact of screen time on children, including mobile devices. In recent weeks she published a paper on what parents could do during the pandemic to mitigate their children’s screen time, and by extension their own.

She takes the harm reduction approach, a term most often associated with minimizing negative impacts of drug use, saying that going cold turkey and shaming individual behaviour aren’t effective solutions in managing screen usage.

“There’s a lot of guilt and shame when you aren’t able to achieve the amount of screen time that’s recommended and it can be very stressful during these times,” she said. “No one is going to be 100 per cent all the time, so these are just the guidelines.”

The advice outlined includes putting away phones during meals and bedtime. Being fixated on a screen rather than the plate distracts your mind from paying attention to the body’s cues that its appetite is satiated. Similarly, being glued to the screen while in bed can increase anxiety levels and disrupt the mind from preparing to rest for the night.

The guide also recommends assigning values to different types of screen use. Healthier screen use may include video conferencing with friends and family, as well as learning a new skill or taking an online class. Anything that encourages active interactions is ideal, especially for young children still developing communication skills.

Psychologists have also noted that our perception of time is marked by memorable milestones, such as vacations, sporting events or going out for a meal. When those markers are gone and daily activities get repetitive, our perception of time gets warped and each day blurs together. It’s another reason why Birken recommends cutting down on screen time in favour of human interaction when possible.

With news consumption, Birken encourages short bouts, rather than having it on in the background all day, which can provoke anxiety in kids.

“In pediatrics, you never think of children as an isolated subject because it’s always within the context of their families, and a lot of these guidelines are directed at the parents’ behaviour,” she said. “Just as it’s the responsibility of parents to provide the food, they can also be in charge of when screen time is available.”

P.E.I.’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, said Tuesday Phase 4 of the Renew PEI Together plan goes into effect Friday.

That means indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be allowed for such things as weddings, funerals and graduations.

Larger facilities, however, will be able to accommodate up to two groups of 50 people, as long as the two groups are kept separate. Venues that wish to welcome 100 people at one time will need to submit an operational plan to public health authorities first.

“They could have multiple gatherings of two groups of 50, totalling 100 at one time, as long as the groups can be separate and not mixed,” Morrison said Tuesday.

Phase 4 also includes the reopening of more companies that provide personal services including facials, nose piercings and teeth whitening.

Residents of long-term care facilities under Phase 4 can receive up to two visitors at once, as long as the visits are scheduled in advance. Public and private long-term care homes will also open up more access for clergy.

Morrison, however, cautions that people still need to do the basics to protect themselves.

“Social distancing with hand hygiene, not going out when you are sick, enhanced cleaning and keeping separate if someone is staying at your home that is self-isolating,” she said.

Morrison said the four Atlantic premiers and her counterparts in the region continue their discussions on an “Atlantic bubble” that would open up provincial borders within Atlantic Canada.

She said if the bubble becomes a reality this summer, anyone coming from outside the region will still need to self-isolate for 14 days.

“Screening would still continue at the bridge, ferry terminals, the airport and other points of entry to ensure that those needing to self-isolate have the support to do so and that everyone is well aware of our restrictions,” she said.

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Presstue.']",2020-06-23,"OTTAWA—A Liberal pledge to provide eight extra weeks of payments through the cornerstone benefit for people who’ve lost all or nearly all their work due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cost the government $17.9 billion, the parliamentary budget officer says.

The report from budget officer Yves Giroux released Tuesday said that would bring the net cost of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit to $71.3 billion.

The CERB, now budgeted at $60 billion, has paid out $52.14 billion to more than eight million people as of Sunday, as demand surges past original federal expectations.

With the first cohort of CERB applicants set to hit the 16-week limit on the payments early next month, the Liberals have promised to increase it to 24 weeks to provide help through the summer for those who need it.

Giroux’s report says the additional cost to the program depends heavily on the outlook for the economy and jobs, as well as the course of the pandemic.

The report says further uncertainty over the final cost of the program rests on the actual take-up of the separate federal wage subsidy program, which the Liberals plan to retool.

A report from a group of experts convened by the C.D. Howe Institute urged the Liberals to take the extra time bought by extending the CERB to rework the program itself and put in a program to help recipients retrain for other or better jobs.

Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough and Tiff Macklem, governor of the Bank of Canada, issued separate warnings Monday that not everyone will have a job to go back to as restrictions ease and businesses reopen.

It’s why the C.D. Howe paper also called for an update to the employment insurance system to handle a possible surge in applicants come September, and for clearer language around a newly imposed requirement on CERB recipients to look or take work when it is “reasonable to do so.”

The Liberals’ latest estimated cost of the total package of pandemic-related aid was about $153.7 billion, but Giroux’s running tally now estimates the cost at $169.2 billion.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau said next month’s fiscal snapshot will provide a comprehensive accounting of government spending, and a look at the potential deficit for the year and the debt — figures Giroux estimated at $256 billion and $962 billion, respectively.

Giroux has also said his spending estimates don’t account for additional stimulus the Liberals may have to use to get the economy going again once the recovery period rolls around.

Morneau didn’t say what kind of stimulus measures the Liberals may have to use, particularly if companies reopen and consumers don’t return to normal spending levels, leaving a dearth of demand expected by the Bank of Canada.

“We’re in an economic challenge that is unlike any we have seen before, so the notion of how we might come out of this challenge is likely to be different than what we’ve seen before,” he said during an appearance before the Senate on spending estimates.

“We so far have put money into the economy, both in terms of supporting people and in supporting businesses — and through them, people — that have, to a great extent, filled up some of the economic challenges that we’ve seen,” Morneau said.

“That may mean that kind of measure could hold promise for what we might need to do in the next stage, or we might need to go back toward more traditional measures.”

When the Liberals unveiled the wage subsidy and CERB, it was the subsidy program that carried the heftier price tag of more than $70 billion. The government styled it the largest social support program in the country’s history.

But fewer companies than envisioned have used the subsidy, which now is budgeted to cost $45 billion. As of Monday, the government had approved $15.77 billion in payroll help to 236,360 companies.

Morneau said the government was getting close to final decisions on changes to the program’s eligibility rules to improve take-up after consulting with business and labour groups.

Fuelling demand for the CERB has been a steep drop in employment, with three million job losses in March and April as non-essential businesses were ordered closed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Although the country recouped in May about one-tenth of what was lost in the previous two months, there is still the possibility that many of the temporary layoffs become permanent.

The Liberals on Monday extended the recall period for furloughed workers due to “a great deal of uncertainty” companies have about when they can bring back employees, Labour Minister Filomena Tassi said in a statement.

The Canadian Armed Forces ended its deployment to Hawthorne Place on Monday, the facility’s executive director Gale Coburn said.

“We’re obviously very pleased to be out of outbreak and we hope that things will continue to improve as they have been over the last several days,” she said in a brief phone interview Monday.

Military personnel, dispatched to the facility to help during the pandemic, observed forceful feeding by staff causing choking, patients crying for help with staff not responding for hours and an insect infestation, according to a report released last month.

“Protocols in place have a near 100 per cent contamination rate for equipment, patients and overall facility,” the report said. “Nurses/PSWs (personal support workers) are often observed not changing PPE (personal protective equipment) for several hours while moving between numerous patient rooms. Equipment is seldom/ever observed to be disinfected.”

Coburn said in a statement Monday that “vigilance around the processes and protocols that have helped us turn the corner in the COVID-19 pandemic will be ongoing, as well as the partnership with (North York General Hospital), which is providing temporary management oversight at Hawthorne Place for a period of approximately 90 days.”

A small “closing ceremony” was held at Hawthorne Place on Friday to signal the end of the military deployment and to show gratitude.

“Following several weeks of assistance providing hands-on care and support to residents and staff, as well as support from North York General Hospital’s Infection Prevention and Control team, the outbreak of COVID-19 at Hawthorne Place has ended,” Coburn said in the statement. “On June 17, Public Health confirmed no active COVID-19 cases among residents or staff.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And even if they were relaxed, a strong majority wouldn’t be comfortable taking part in activities that would bring them closer to other people, like going to a movie theatre.

Sixty-six per cent of respondents to the poll, conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies, said two metres should remain the safe distance kept between people, as recommended by Canada’s public health authorities.

Just 12 per cent favoured reducing the distance to 1.5 metres, as is required in many European countries, and only 10 per cent favoured a reduction to one metre, the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization.

If the physical distancing rule were reduced to one metre, just 40 per cent said they’d be comfortable dining in a restaurant, 28 per cent going to a movie theatre, 24 per cent to a gym and 21 per cent to a bar or night club.

“We’ve been schooled on two metres for over three months now,” said Leger executive vice-president Andrew Enns.

“It’s difficult for Canadians to now suddenly start to be convinced that it’s OK to make that a closer distance.”

The online poll of 1,521 adult Canadians was conducted June 19 to 21. It cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based polls are not considered random samples.

Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said Tuesday that she and her provincial counterparts are constantly reviewing their recommendations for safe physical distancing but, for now, agree that two metres should remain the rule.

Keeping two metres away from others means keeping yourself away from most of the droplets someone sick with COVID-19 might emit, public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says, and having fewer cases circulating in Canadian communities hasn't changed that safer distance. (The Canadian Press)

“The two-metre distance is based on the usual sort of way droplets that are emitted from people, if they’re coughing or sneezing et cetera, fall to the ground or fall on top of someone else,” she said.

“The bottom line is that one metre catches a whole bunch of droplets. Two metres, there will be more droplets that you may be able to avoid if you kept the two-metre distance.”

Enns said the reluctance to get closer with their fellow Canadians reflects a “very persistent level of anxiety” about the deadly new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, despite a steady decline in the number of new cases in Canada.

Just 43 per cent of respondents said they believe the first wave of the pandemic is over and 74 per cent think there’ll be a second wave, according to the poll. And 51 per cent said they are very or somewhat afraid of contracting COVID-19.

Forty-two per cent said they believe the worst of the crisis is over but an equal number said we’re in the worst of it now or the worst is yet to come (10 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively).

Almost half (46 per cent) said they find it very or somewhat stressful to leave the house and go out in public.

Sixty-two per cent said it will take time before life returns to normal, while 28 per cent said it will never return to normal.

All those measures of continued anxiety about COVID-19 are likely contributing to people saying “I’m not going closer than two metres because this thing’s not over,” Enns said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The council, which meets twice a year in person to discuss nominations, is not scheduled to meet again until November.

In the meantime, Julie Rocheleau, a spokeswoman for Payette, says the team responsible for the administration of Canadian honours has taken advantage of the delay to develop new evaluation tools for the advisory council and to identify technology that will help process more nominations per year starting in 2021.

In the absence of the traditional Order of Canada announcement this July 1, Rocheleau says Payette will instead shine a spotlight on lesser-known Canadian honours: decorations for bravery and meritorious service and the Sovereign Medal for volunteers.

7:00 p.m.: The owner of a farm where some 199 migrant workers have tested positive for COVID-19 says his operation assiduously followed public health guidelines to prevent an outbreak, and has previously been lauded for providing quality accommodation to migrant workers.

In an interview with the Star on Tuesday, Scotlynn Growers president Scott Biddle said the local health department has “always used us as an example for what other farmers should be doing.”

“We’re building housing for another hundred men this year,” Biddle told the Star, adding that the new accommodation will be larger than what’s currently required by Health Canada to account for any changes to federally-mandated housing standards.

The comments come after a Star investigation revealed a history of complaints at Scotlynn by Mexican migrant workers about substandard housing and other concerns.

In reports to the Mexican Ministry of Labour between 2016 and 2018, workers described overcrowded bunkhouses, bedbug infestations, and sometimes failure to receive timely medical attention. Scotlynn received 33 complaints over the two year period, the highest number of any Canadian farm.

On Saturday, 55-year-old father of four Juan López Chaparro, who worked at Scotlynn, died after fighting COVID-19 for three weeks.

6:50 p.m: Canada could avoid a second wave of the coronavirus if it learns the lessons of South Korea and Taiwan and attacks testing, tracing and treatment of COVID-19 cases and practices “dynamic distancing” from the get-go, MPs heard Tuesday.

That means as the economy reopens, communities must be ready to reimpose physical distancing and socially restrictive measures periodically with surges in disease activity in order to contain outbreaks and allow economic revitalization to continue, Asaph Young Chun, head of Korea’s Statistics Research Institute, told the Commons health committee.

Those “nonpharmaceutical” interventions are the best “exit strategy” from the COVID-19 lockdowns, he said.

Two American health experts said South Korea and Taiwan showed the path for other countries to follow, but they warned Canada against reopening too quickly even to its neighbours, the United States.

6:20 p.m.: Ontario nursing homes need an extra $1.8 billion a year to hire more staff and improve care of vulnerable residents in the wake of COVID-19 horrors, says the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.

The increase of 41 per cent would allow the 626 long-term-care homes to provide at least four hours of hands-on care daily for their 80,000 vulnerable residents, a new study from the think tank recommends.

The study was released Tuesday as Premier Doug Ford prepares to launch a promised “independent commission” in July into the pandemic’s impact on nursing homes, where the killer virus spread easily.

COVID-19 infected almost 5,400 nursing-home residents and killed 1,803. Another 2,205 staff members caught the virus, and seven of them also died.

The study by the left-leaning think tank also called for wage increases to bring non-unionized nurses, personal support workers and other staff up to levels of unionized staff, which would cost $285 million out of the $1.8 billion.

“The premier has heaped praise on front-line health care workers for their work during the pandemic, and rightly so,” says the study. “Now is the time to go beyond words and support them in a very real way, and that means better jobs and more co-workers.”

As of 5 p.m. Tuesday, Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,810 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,663 deaths, up a total of 239 new cases since Monday evening.

As was the case the day prior, most of the case growth on Tuesday came from outside Toronto, which saw 63 new cases reported — marking the city’s 12th consecutive daily report below triple digits. The rate of new infections in the city has fallen sharply this month. For the last seven days, Toronto has seen an average of 65 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for on the seven days ending May 25.

Elsewhere, the same seven-day average has jumped slightly in the GTA outside Toronto and the rest of the province over the last two days.

Meanwhile, the 10 fatal cases reported Tuesday were also up slightly over recent trends, but still well down for the province’s peak in early May, when the health units reported as many as 90 deaths in a single day.

Earlier Tuesday, the province reported that 288 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 75 in intensive care, of whom 54 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,619 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

2:55 p.m.: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told House lawmakers that the nation is experiencing a “disturbing surge” of coronavirus infections as states reopen too quickly and without adequate plans for testing and tracing the contacts of those infected with the virus.

In a break with President Donald Trump’s upbeat assessments of the pandemic’s trajectory in the United States, Fauci told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that while some states like New York were “doing very well” in controlling spread of the virus, the surge in other states was “very troublesome to me.”

“The next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surges we are seeing in Florida, Texas, Arizona and other states,” Fauci told the panel as he and other leaders of the White House coronavirus task force appeared together for the first time in more than a month to brief Congress.

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday that Texas has surpassed 5,000 new coronavirus cases in a single day for the first time, another troubling milestone as the largest pediatric hospital in the U.S. begins taking adult patients to free up bed space in Houston.

The announcement comes days after Texas eclipsed 4,000 new cases for the first time just last weekend.

2:50 p.m.: Top federal health officials say they continue to deal with the World Health Organization despite President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the U.N. health agency, which serves as a forum for the global coronavirus response.

Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday that they continue to have regular interactions with scientific peers at the WHO.

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the World Health Organization after complaining about its response to the coronavirus and alleged favouritism toward China.

Fauci and Redfield both said they were not directly consulted about the president’s decision.

Fauci said his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has a memorandum of understanding that governs regular collaboration with the WHO. Redfield said his agency is working with the world body on Ebola, polio and influenza.

1:50 p.m.: (updated): The number of Ontarians requiring hospital care for COVID-19 unexpectedly shot upward after weeks of decline and the province has recorded the first death of a child, according to figures released Tuesday by the Ministry of Health.

Another 23 patients have been admitted to hospitals with the highly contagious virus, increasing the total to 288. That’s well below highs of more than 1,100 at the peak but enough of a change for officials to flag.

Circumstances of the child’s death were not immediately known but Toronto Public Health issued a statement to the Star’s David Rider.

“We are aware of a recent death of a Toronto resident who was in the 0-9 age category who died with COVID-19, but not as a result of COVID-19. We extend our deepest sympathies to the individual’s family during this difficult and tragic time, and also to everyone who has lost loved ones to this virus.”

More details on the latest Ontario numbers from the Star’s Rob Ferguson.

1:45 p.m.: The Manitoba government is offering a subsidy for people who return to full-time work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Premier Brian Pallister says the money will be available to people who return to work and stop collecting the federal government’s income programs for those who lost jobs due to the pandemic.

Pallister says there will be up to four payments of $500 each over six weeks, as long as recipients work at least 30 hours per week.

He says the aim is to ensure people are not penalized giving up the federal subsidies and returning to work.

Pallister also revealed more details about the province’s plan to reopen schools on Sept. 8 while adding extra instruction time to make up for lost classes this spring.

The premier says the aim is to reduce the number of days teachers spend on professional development, replacing them with regular classroom days.

1:15 p.m.: The AGO has announced that it will be reopening its doors to members and annual pass holders on July 2, which the general public will have to wait until July 23.

Capacity will be limited and guests will have to purchase timed-entry tickets, which will go on sale for members on Thursday and for pass holders on Friday.

The gallery is also limiting opening hours to Thursday through Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and has increased its cleaning schedule.

12:52 p.m.: Public health officials in New Brunswick are reporting one new case of COVID-19 today.

The new case involves a person in their 50s in the Moncton area, and the case is travel-related.

Chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell says the person was self-isolating at the time of diagnosis and there were no close contacts.

The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick is 165 and 143 people have recovered.

There have been two deaths, and the number of active cases is 20.

Two patients are hospitalized with one in an intensive care unit.

12:27 p.m.: The federal Liberals say the government will go back to using competitive bid processes to get protective equipment needed across the country due to COVID-19.

Procurement Minister Anita Anand says the process usually used to award contracts will only apply in situations where there is enough time to run a competition.

The government is spending billions of dollars to acquire everything from ventilators to masks, though a full accounting is not expected for months.

Many contracts have been signed using national security exemptions to quickly snap up gear in high demand globally.

Speaking at a midday press conference, Anand says nine more cargo planes carrying supplies such as gloves, gowns and masks arrived in the last week.

She says another shipment of hand sanitizer, the country’s 13th, arrived at the Port of Vancouver in recent days.

12:25 p.m.: Prince Edward Island is set to enter the next phase of relaxed COVID-19 restrictions.

P.E.I.’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, said today Phase 4 of the province’s reopening plan goes into effect Friday.

That means indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people will be allowed for such things as weddings, funerals and graduations.

Phase 4 also includes the reopening of more companies that provide personal services including facials, nose piercings and teeth whitening.

Morrison also addressed the concept of the Atlantic bubble, whereby travel would be permitted throughout the four Atlantic Provinces, an idea the region’s leaders have been discussing in recent weeks.

She says screening will still be done at border points to ensure that anyone from outside the region is instructed to self-isolate for 14 days.

12:20 p.m.: Quebec is reporting seven new deaths attributed to COVID-19, for a total of 5,424.

Authorities say five of the new deaths occurred in the past 24 hours while two occurred before June 15.

The province is also reporting 49 new cases of the novel coronavirus, for a total of 54,884.

Hospitalizations continue to drop, with 515 patients in hospital being treated for COVID-19, a reduction of five.

There are 56 people in intensive care, a drop of one from the previous day.

Authorities are conducting significantly fewer tests than they were in recent weeks, with 5,582 performed on June 21, the latest day for which data is available

12:15 p.m.: The mayor of Windsor, Ont., is calling on farmers in the surrounding area to have all of their workers tested for COVID-19.

Drew Dilkens says the high rates of the virus on farms in Essex County has held back the entire region from reopening.

He says if farmers take the lead on testing, they can help the region “assess and contain” the spread of the virus and reopen the local economy.

Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that Windsor-Essex would not yet proceed to Stage 2 of reopening because of the farm outbreaks.

Ford warned farmers if they did not co-operate with the province’s plan to test workers he would take “extreme” action, though he gave no specifics.

Hundreds of migrant workers in the region have tested positive for the virus and three have died.

12 p.m.: The top infectious disease expert in the United States has told House lawmakers it’s a question of “when, not if” the U.S. will have a vaccine for COVID-19.

Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday that he thinks a coronavirus vaccine could be available by the end of this year or early 2021.

One vaccine candidate will enter advanced trials next month.

Fauci says “we feel cautiously optimistic based on the concerted effort.”

The White House has launched an effort called “Operation Warp Speed” to make sure a vaccine can be quickly mass produced and distributed when it’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

11:30 a.m.: The Town of South Bruce Peninsula has announced that Sauble Beach will be closed after an influx of out-of-town beachgoers over the last two weekends.

“Most of our residents followed the rules and we thank you for that but the day trippers flagrantly defied our restrictions and took over many parts of the beach,” South Bruce Peninsula mayor Janice Jackson wrote on social media.

Jackson said the town only had six officers enforcing restrictions on the beach, about a three-hour drive from Toronto, and have asked the province for OPP assistance.

“The sooner we can get assistance, the sooner we can open the beach. We know this won’t be a popular decision for many, and it was a very tough decision to make but we stand by it,” said Jackson.

11:15 a.m. (updated): On Tuesday, Mayor John Tory announced $4.97 million was being distributed to community organizations helping vulnerable populations deal with the fallout of COVID-19.

The fund — made up of provincial contributions and donations from outside organizations — will go toward mental health supports, access to food, hygiene products, Wi-Fi and other services, Tory said at a city hall news conference.

“There are some people who undoubtedly have much bigger challenges and obstacles in front of them in terms of getting through the pandemic than others,” said Tory, saying the fund would address some of the unique needs of Black, Indigenous and other hard-hit communities.

More than 50 organizations will receive varying levels of funding “based on their need to respond to the urgent, unmet needs of Toronto’s vulnerable populations,” a city press release said.

11:10 a.m.: Investing in stocks sure feels like a roller-coaster ride these days, but it’s one where you don’t know whether the next stretch of the ride will be up, down or level.

First came a dramatic meltdown in stocks starting in late February when major stock indices fell more than 30 per cent in little more than a month. That has been followed by a sharp rebound where stocks regained most of the lost ground in record time.

Now everyone wonders how the pandemic will play out, what the path to economic recovery will be, and how markets will respond from here, all of which is hugely uncertain.

That drama and uncertainty begs the question about what you should do with your investment portfolio now.

11 a.m.: Ontario is reporting its first COVID-19 death in a patient under 20 years of age.

According to provincial data, the patient was female from Toronto. She was tested on June 18 and the data says she acquired the virus from community spread.

More than 95 per cent of the more than 2,600 fatal cases in the province have been patients over the age of 60, with only a handful of deaths among much younger Ontarians.

10:15 a.m.: The parliamentary budget officer estimates in a new report that it will cost the federal government $17.9 billion to provide eight extra weeks of payments through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

The report this morning from budget officer Yves Giroux says that would bring the total cost of the benefit program for people who’ve lost all or nearly all their work to the COVID-19 pandemic to $71.3 billion.

The CERB, now budgeted at $60 billion, has paid out $43.51 billion to 8.41 million people as of June 4 as demand surges past federal expectations.

10 a.m.: Scotlynn Growers, a massive Norfolk County farming operation about two hours southwest of Toronto that describes itself as “North America’s Farm Stand,” is the site of one of Ontario’s largest recorded COVID-19 outbreaks. Some 199 workers there have tested positive for the virus.

In the years leading up to the outbreak, Mexican migrant workers at the farm had repeatedly sounded the alarm about poor living conditions they described as unsafe and sometimes hazardous, records obtained by the Star show.

9:45 a.m.: Robots that clean surfaces. Fogging that cleanses departure waiting areas. Touchless entry points. A spray that disinfects as you leave.

Whether you’re coming or going, your experience at Toronto Pearson International Airport is about to change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has grounded airlines around the world.

The Star’s Kevin McGran has the details.

9:25 a.m.: The Toronto Zoo has announced plans to reopen this weekend for members only.

Visitors will be asked to follow a one-way path to maintain social distancing. The zoo is also requiring visitors to wear face coverings to enter zoo buildings.

Some areas of the zoo will continue to be inaccessible.

The zoo had previously been only offering drive-thru tours as well as online livestreams of its animal enclosures. Those tours will continue.

9 a.m.: The military has ended its deployment to Hawthorne Place Care Centre, a 269-bed nursing home in the Jane-Finch area that has had 48 deaths due to COVID-19.

The Canadian Armed Forces ended its deployment to Hawthorne Place on Monday, the facility’s executive director Gale Coburn said.

8:18 a.m.: Novak Djokovic tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday after taking part in a tennis exhibition series he organized in Serbia and Croatia.

The top-ranked Serb is the fourth player to test positive for the virus after playing last week in Belgrade and last weekend in Zadar, Croatia. His wife also tested positive.

Djokovic has been criticized for organizing the tournament and bringing in players from other countries. His charity tennis exhibition series, combined with an overall softening of coronavirus restrictions in Serbia and Croatia, has been followed by an increase in the number of positive cases among professional athletes.

Viktor Troicki said Tuesday that he and his pregnant wife have both been diagnosed with the virus. Grigor Dimitrov, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist from Bulgaria, said Sunday he tested positive for the virus. Borna Coric played Dimitrov on Saturday in Zadar and said Monday he has also tested positive.

8:15 a.m.: Disneyland Paris plans a limited reopening July 15, a day after the country’s Bastille Day celebrations. The theme park in Marne-la-Vallee joins the Eiffel Tower, set to reopen Thursday, and the Louvre Museum, which plans to reopen its doors July 6, in opening amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Disneyland Paris is the latest site in the Disney empire to reopen after shutting down in March. Like other Disney sites, there will be new safety protocols in place, and some attractions will remain closed.

Disneyland, Walt Disney Studios Park, Newport Bay Club Hotel and Disney Village will reopen in coordination with French government and health authorities, according to a Monday announcement. Other hotels will reopen later.

Attendance will be limited to allow for social distancing, visitors 11 and older must wear face coverings, and advance ticket purchases and reservations will be required through a new online system. FastPass won’t be offered, allowing the park to manage lines.

8:02 a.m.: President Donald Trump faces another test of his ability to draw a crowd during a pandemic Tuesday as he visits Arizona and tries to remind voters of one of his key 2016 campaign promises.

Trump’s weekend rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was meant to be a sign of the nation’s reopening and a show of political force but instead generated thousands of empty seats and swirling questions about the president’s campaign leadership and his case for another four years in office. The low turnout has sharpened the focus on Trump’s visit to Arizona, which doubles as both a 2020 battleground state and a surging coronavirus hot spot.

First, the president will travel to Yuma to mark the construction of more than 322 km of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an issue that he built his campaign on four years ago. Later, he’ll address a group of young Republicans at a Phoenix megachurch, where event organizers have pledged thousands will attend.

Throughout the trip, the COVID-19 pandemic will shadow Trump. The Democratic mayor of Phoenix made clear that she does not believe the speech can be safely held in her city — and urged the president to wear a face mask.

8 a.m.: Global shares rose Tuesday as investors appeared to look past reports of surging coronavirus cases in the U.S. and other countries to focus on evidence of economic recovery.

European shares advanced after a measure of economic activity in the eurozone, the purchasing managers’ index, rose significantly in June from the month before. The index was just shy of the level that indicates the economy is growing again after a devastating plunge in the spring.

France’s CAC 40 gained 1.6 per cent to 5,027, while Germany’s DAX rallied 2.6 per cent to 12,584. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 1.3 per cent to 6,235.

U.S. shares were set for gains, with Dow futures up 1 per cent and S&P 500 futures up 0.9 per cent.

7:50 a.m.: German economic experts say output won’t completely bounce back to pre-virus levels until 2022 after a sharp plunge of 6.5 per cent this year, describing the pandemic recession and recovery as taking the shape of a “pronounced V.”

The five-member German Council of Economic Experts said Tuesday the economy would see an upswing in the second half of this year followed by more moderate growth reaching 4.9 per cent next year. It said unemployment would continue to rise this year before falling gradually next year.

The experts said recent economic data had made clearer the impact of the widespread restrictions on travel, business and interpersonal contact. Those restrictions hit hardest in April and are being gradually loosened as the number of new infections has fallen.

7:20 a.m.: A top English cricket official says Pakistan’s tour of England could still go ahead even if more players from the travelling party test positive for the coronavirus.

Three members of Pakistan’s extended 29-man squad — Haider Ali, Haris Rauf and Shadab Khan — tested positive following checks for COVID-19 on Sunday, and more results were due in the coming days.

Ashley Giles, England’s director of cricket, said on Tuesday the situation was a “concern” but the tour was not currently in doubt.

Pakistan’s squad is scheduled to fly to Britain on Sunday for three tests and three Twenty20s in England from August.

The coronavirus is spreading in Pakistan at one of the fastest rates in the world, with new cases in the country leaping from around 2,000-3,000 a day in late May to up to 6,800 a day in mid-June. On Tuesday, Pakistan reported 105 new COVID-19 deaths and the total cases in a country of 220 million has risen to 185,034.

7:21 a.m.: A Saudi official said Tuesday that the hajj pilgrimage, which usually draws up to 2.5 million Muslims from all over the world, will only see at the most a few thousand pilgrims next month due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.

The kingdom’s Hajj Minister Muhammad Benten said a “small and very limited” number of people — even as low as just 1,000 from inside the kingdom — will be allowed to perform the pilgrimage to ensure social distancing and crowd control amid the global virus outbreak.

“The number, God willing, may be in the thousands. We are in the process of reviewing so it could be 1,000 or less, or a little more,” Benten said in a virtual press conference.

While the decision to drastically curb this year’s hajj was largely expected, it remains unprecedented in Saudi Arabia’s nearly 90-year history and effectively bars all Muslims from outside the kingdom from travelling there to performing the pilgrimage.

7:03 a.m.: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called Tuesday for early general elections despite the coronavirus, saying the outbreak has stabilized and there is no assurance it will be over by next April, when the current government’s term ends.

Parliament was dissolved to pave the way for the polls, which the Elections Department said would be held on July 10.

The announcement came just four days after the city-state lifted most coronavirus restrictions, and appeared to be an attempt to take advantage of a quiet window before a possible worsening of the pandemic’s impact.

7 a.m.: With coronavirus cases rising in about half the states and political polarization competing for attention with public health recommendations, Dr. Anthony Fauci returns to Capitol Hill on Tuesday at a fraught moment in the nation’s pandemic response.

The government’s top infectious disease expert will testify before a House committee, along with the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services.

Since Fauci’s last appearance at a high-profile hearing more than a month ago, the U.S. is emerging from weeks of stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns. But it’s being done in an uneven way, with some states far less cautious than others. A trio of states with Republican governors who are bullish on reopening — Arizona, Florida and Texas — are among those seeing worrisome increases in cases.

6:45 a.m.: The COVID-19 pandemic has put the kibosh on the annual Canada Day celebration of recipients of the country’s second highest award.

Governor General Julie Payette would normally announce a list of new Order of Canada nominees on July 1.

But her office says that is impossible this year because the spring meeting of the advisory council that recommends nominees was cancelled due to the pandemic.

The council, which meets twice a year in person to discuss nominations, is not scheduled to meet again until November.

6:10 a.m.: South Africa’s coronavirus cases have surpassed 100,000 as the country makes up close to one-third of all recorded infections on the African continent.

The latest daily update shows a worrying new trend as Gauteng province, home to South Africa’s economic hub of Johannesburg, has a higher number of new cases than the hot spot of Western Cape province centred on the city of Cape Town.

Virus cases in Gauteng, which also contains the capital, Pretoria, now make up more than one-fifth of South Africa’s total.

South Africa continues to loosen its lockdown despite the rise in cases because of economic pressure, with casinos and beauty parlours the latest businesses allowed to open.

Africa overall has more than 315,000 cases including more than 8,000 deaths. The true number of cases remains unknown because of the low level of testing on the continent due to a shortage of materials.

6:05 a.m.: A new poll suggests two-thirds of Canadians don’t want to relax the physical distancing rules imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.

And if they were relaxed, fewer than half would feel comfortable taking part in activities that would bring them closer to other people, like going to a movie theatre.

Sixty-six per cent of respondents to the poll, conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies, said two metres should remain the safe distance kept between people.

Just 12 per cent favoured reducing the distance to 1.5 metres, as is required in many European countries, and 10 per cent favoured a reduction to one metre, the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization.

Monday 5:45 p.m.: Ontario saw an uptick in reported COVID-19 infections outside the GTA on Monday as the daily case count continues to fall in Toronto, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 5 p.m. Monday, Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,571 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,653 deaths, up a total of 223 new cases since Sunday evening.

In Toronto, the daily report of new cases fell to just 37, the lowest single-day total since April 1, back when the city had reported fewer than 1,000 cases. The rate of new infections in the city has fallen sharply this month. For the last seven days, Toronto has seen an average of 68 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for on the seven days ending May 25.

Meanwhile: Health units outside the GTA saw 100 new cases reported on Monday, up more than 70 cases from the previous day and the first time they had hit triple digits in 20 days.

In recent weeks, several health units have stopped reporting case totals on the weekend, meaning their tallies reported on Mondays included multiple days of data.

Since Sunday evening, the health units have reported another eight fatal cases, five of which were in Toronto.

Earlier Monday, the province reported that 265 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 76 in intensive care, of whom 58 are on a ventilator. All three totals are now near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

A Previous Version Said Both Orders Were Repealed Last Week.']",2020-06-22,"VICTORIA—British Columbia’s ombudsperson says the province’s public safety minister made two pandemic-related orders that were not authorized by law.

Jay Chalke says Mike Farnworth made one order that waived time limits related to any civil or family lawsuits as well as other situations where deadlines may be involved, including tribunals.

The second order allowed local government meetings to be held without the public in attendance and gave municipalities the power to adopt bylaws quicker than usual.

Chalke says Farnworth did not have the legal authority to make the orders under the Emergency Program Act, but the second order was repealed last week after he shared a draft report of his investigation with the province.

He says the new order includes safeguards against arbitrary or inconsistent decision-making.

The government has introduced legislation that, if passed, would validate the two orders.

“I recognize speed was important in responding to the pandemic,” Chalke says in a statement. “However, while the intent and even the content of these orders may be worthy that is not enough. Every exercise of public authority in a democratic system must find its source in law.”

Note to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said both orders were repealed last week.

495,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/06/22/violence-top-concern-for-indigenous-women-during-pandemic.html,Violence top concern for Indigenous women during pandemic,"['Julie Chadwick', 'Jcjulie Chadwicklocal Journalism Initiative Reporter', 'Windspeaker.Common.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Julie Chadwicklocal Journalism Initiative Reporter', 'Local Journalism Initiative Reporter']",2020-06-22,"As many provinces move to cautiously open some services in the wake of COVID-19, advocates say Indigenous women still struggle to navigate a variety of challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.

This month, the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) released the results of their needs assessment survey, in which domestic violence emerged as one of the top concerns.

Some key findings were that many more Indigenous women had experienced violence during the pandemic, and there was a strong correlation between the financial impact of COVID-19 and that increase in violence.

In response to the pandemic, many organizations like NWAC and the Ontario Native Women’s Association (ONWA) have successfully shifted services and how they’re delivered.

However, advocates remain concerned about the impact on Indigenous women who they say are disproportionately affected by the fallout from COVID-19.

“The women were more afraid of being home with the violence, than they were of the pandemic and the virus itself,” said NWAC President Lorraine Whitman, citing the survey, in which a majority of women said they were also “very concerned” about Elder and child abuse.

Whitman describes the interlocking issues as being like “a basket”, in that they all fold in on one another and weave together.

“There’s not enough housing, there’s overpopulation in housing, and that leads to what we’re dealing with today with violence that’s occurring more with our women in the homes, because they can’t get away from the abusers,” said Whitman. “You have Elder abuse, who still live in the home because of the multiple families, and you have abuse of young children that can’t escape. They’re not in daycare. They’re not in schools. They’re not even in any of the playgrounds.”

Those already in precarious or domestic violence situations may find that suddenly their normal safety plans are no longer possible, said Dr. Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of ONWA.

“Whether it be a family member or a friend who would have normally been your escape place, you now have to second-guess: Will they let me in because of COVID? Or even going to hotels, there’s these questions of ‘Am I putting my children or myself at risk by exposing myself to the virus versus exposing myself to the violence?’

“So there’s this constant weighing back and forth of which is the greatest risk,” she said. “We have had to be more creative in terms of our family violence workers, our family violence responses. Obviously going to a shelter during a pandemic is not a good thing. We have to look at things where families can escape violence but not put themselves at risk of the virus.”

One of the ways ONWA has addressed the challenge is to offer at-risk women a paid cellphone that they can hide, use to privately access online services like counselling, or take with them while on the run.

“You have to try to make sure women are safe. Especially for women on the streets, a lot of the normal street outreach programs have been shut down. Whether it be for women who are involved in trafficking, women who are homeless, especially youth; all of the normal outreach services that people rely on have been shut down,” said Lavell-Harvard.

Prior to the pandemic, housing, child care, and economic opportunities for Indigenous women were also pressing issues that have now been exacerbated: either lack of employment or risky front-line work, isolation, especially in remote locations, disruptions in support networks of friends and family, and the extra burden of having children home from school. In many cases, the access to food that school provided has also been curtailed.

Many of these challenges are ones of basic survival, Lavell-Harvard said. Early on, ONWA scrambled to ship supplies of food, toilet paper and personal protective equipment up to vulnerable Northern communities and bundled up basic supplies like diapers and sanitary products into “go bags” that were widely distributed.

“We had quite a number of cases of Elders who were afraid to leave their homes to go get groceries or go pick up their medicine. Literally, Elders breaking down in tears and crying when they were given the gift of hand sanitizer because it allowed them to leave their homes,” said Lavell-Harvard.

The subsequent impact of these burdens on mental health has resulted in a steep increase in demand for counselling and emotional support services over the last few months.

NWAC established a 1-800 number to take calls and four Elders have been made available to talk and assist people in crisis.

The pandemic has created “massive increases in need for mental health services,” and the counsellors have been overburdened, says Lavell-Howard.

“There was that sort of first wave where everybody was in a panic, and then actually we’re seeing a resurgence right now as everybody realizes that this is not short term, as the isolation and depression and anxiety kicks in.”

Though these issues may seem insurmountable, the federal response to COVID-19 demonstrates just how quickly the government can mobilize to address an urgent issue, said Whitman. In light of this, she finds it inexcusable that the government is dragging its feet on delivering their national action plan on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

The strategy was due to be unveiled this month, on the anniversary of the Inquiry, and has now been delayed.

“We have sent in recommendations and suggestions from grassroots women when we had a roundtable discussion on MMIWG. There were suggestions that were sent to (the office of Crown-Indigenous Relations) and they neglected to read it. So there’s no excuse,” said Whitman.

Solutions to many of these issues have been identified and just need support in their implementation she says, such as setting up resiliency centres aimed at Indigenous women, youth, and gender-diverse populations in every province.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says the premier is expected to announce later this week when the province will move into the third phase of its restart plan, which allows overnight camping and the opening of hotels, resorts and RV parks.

She says travellers have to exercise caution, be respectful of the communities they plan to visit and take the same care they do at home to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Henry says travellers need to plan before they leave, which means finding out what services are available and be as self-sufficient as possible.

B.C. has had 32 new cases of COVID-19 over the past three days, including one new death.

Henry says the province has had a total of 2,822 cases of COVID-19 with 182 of them still active.

There have been 169 deaths.

Health Minister Adrian Dix says as people are allowed to do more things together, the need to physically distance is becoming more important.

These 4 charts explain why some experts are urging caution,"['Patty Winsa', 'Kenyon Wallace', 'Patty Winsadata Reporterkenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reportermon.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Patty Winsadata Reporter', 'Data Reporter', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2020-06-22,"As Toronto and Peel Region prepare to enter the province’s second stage of reopening this week, a recent spike in new reported cases of COVID-19 in the city has some experts urging caution.

On Monday, Toronto Public Health reported 37 new cases of the new coronavirus, a decrease of 51 cases from the day before. That brought the city’s rolling seven-day average down to 68, down from 102 new cases per day a week ago. Still, that seven-day average is down substantially from a high of 230 cases per day a month ago.

“I’m confident that we can enter stage two with ongoing care,” said Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa on Monday, noting that she is sympathetic to those who might be concerned with the ongoing risk of infection.

“We also need to keep watching and learning from our own experiences and from other places that have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks earlier than us. We will need to be watching very carefully for any flare-ups of new cases. Around the world, we are finding the balance between protecting our health and reopening many of the businesses and activities that are important to all of us,” she said.

As most areas of the province have already entered the second stage of reopening, or are about to, the Star asked several experts to weigh in on the status quo here in Ontario, what’s been happening elsewhere, and what might transpire.

So if you’re sipping a beverage on a restaurant patio, sitting in the barber’s chair or strolling through the mall in the coming days, here are a few things you may want to keep in mind.

Are Toronto and Peel ready?

After several days of decline late last week, the number of new cases reported in Toronto spiked to 88 on Sunday before dropping again to 37 on Monday. At the same time, the number of recovered cases reached 11,879.

Of the total 13,893 confirmed and probable cases reported to Toronto Public Health, most originated from a close contact with a confirmed case or in the community.

While the city’s numbers are better than what they were a month ago, “every stage of reopening should be approached with caution,” said Dionne Aleman, a University of Toronto professor and expert in pandemic modelling. “The city should be willing to be flexible.”

She noted that a declining rolling seven-day average is just one piece of the puzzle.

“That rolling seven-day average helps smooth out some of the noise and randomness in the observations that we see of positive test case results, but at the same time just because it’s showing a decreasing trend doesn’t mean we’ve actually hit a point where it’s safe to open,” she said. “It just means that we are improving.”

Todd Coleman, an epidemiologist at Wilfrid Laurier University, noted that even with the downward trend of new cases in Toronto, the city is still seeing hundreds of new cases every week (almost 400 in the last seven days).

“Adding hundreds of new cases over the course of week in a geographic area that has high-population density and a higher probability of people coming into contact with each other, I’d be extremely cautious to start opening things up,” he said.

With the reopening of shopping malls in the city for example, Coleman said it could mean a “potential influx of people into the downtown core, an influx of people on transit, influx of people coming into contact with each other. That could be potentially problematic.”

On Monday, it was also announced that Peel would move to Stage 2, despite the region being one of the few in the province to report a two-digit increase in cases.

Peel Public Health reported 61 cases on Monday, down from a high of more than 200 one day in late April, when the region was dealing with a number of institutional outbreaks.

“While the commitment and sacrifices of residents and businesses to reduce the spread of COVID-19 has paved the path for Peel to move into Phase 2, we must continue to remain vigilant to safeguard the gains we have made,” said Dr. Lawrence Loh, Peel public health’s interim medical officer of health.

“As we reopen more of our community, practicing the four core behaviours will help reduce risk and keep our community open,” he said. “Stay two metres apart when interacting with anyone outside your social circle of 10, wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing is challenging; wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your face; and if you’re sick, get tested and then stay home.”

Loh also called on local businesses to implement preventative measures.

Both Halton and Durham reported four new cases Monday, while York had an increase of 17 new cases.

The province

More than half the public health units across the province were reporting no new cases of the virus on Sunday and many more reported one-day growth in the single digits.

The downward trend has surprised experts such as epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong, who said he was expecting cases to increase as soon as restrictions were relaxed.

“That hasn’t happened,” said Kwong. “I was glad to be wrong about that!”

Kwong, who is a specialist in public health and preventive medicine as well as a family physician, credits the low growth to workplace measures to reduce COVID, such as asking customers to wear masks and limiting the number of people in a store, along with wider testing and more contact tracing.

“Hopefully, things will continue to improve, but in my opinion, it will be highly dependent on everyone continuing to practice physical distancing, frequent hand-washing, and masking in indoor spaces,” said Kwong. “If we can maintain these behavioural changes, then we’ll probably be OK.”

He doesn’t want people to become complacent.

“I don’t want people to think that we are out of the woods, because we are nowhere near that,” said Kwong. “Outbreaks are popping up every day in countries that had previously managed to get their cases down.”

Windsor-Essex, the only public health unit not moving to Stage 2, continues to deal with outbreaks among farm workers, who have been reticent to report their symptoms or see a doctor.

“We will do everything we can to get our final region, Windsor-Essex, into Stage 2 as soon as possible,” said Premier Doug Ford on Monday. “That’s why we are ramping up testing and inspections on Ontario’s farms to protect workers and keep our food supply chains strong and healthy.”

In Ontario, there have been 35,571 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 reported to date, while 2,653 people have died of the virus. More than half of the new cases are originating in the GTA.

Infections rise steeply in parts of the world

Early mass testing and contact tracing is credited for Germany’s reduction in new cases, but an outbreak at a meat-processing plant in Gütersloh, north east of Cologne, led to reports Sunday of more than a 1,000 workers being infected with COVID-19. Employees and their families were quarantined and schools were closed.

Brazil and the U.S. continue to report thousands of new cases each day — the latest numbers were at 35,066 and 29,609 respectively — with India in a not-too-distant third, reporting nearly 15,000 new infections on Monday. Russia was reporting about half that number, according to the latest daily figures.

South Africa, which by March had some of the toughest restrictions including a ban on the sale of cigarettes and alcohol and limited movement outside the home, has eased lockdown measures because of the economy, according to news reports.

Meanwhile, Iran, which began reopening the country in mid-April after a decline in cases, is seeing a resurgence of the virus.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Alex Boydcalgary Bureau', 'Calgary Bureau', 'Alex Boyd Is A Calgary-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-22,"Alberta Premier Jason Kenney tweeted out a polished new video Monday in his ongoing efforts to sell the NHL on Edmonton as a hub city once the league resumes play.

But one small detail about the video rankled locals: Not one attraction shown in the video is actually in Edmonton.

“It’s the obvious choice to bring the @NHL to #Edmonton,” Kenney tweeted. “We look forward to welcoming the league and players to Alberta to take in the beautiful province we have to offer.”

The video is a fairly standard highlight reel for the Canadian Rockies. It jumps around a bit geographically, but the Columbia icefield is shown several times, as is Jasper’s Spirit Island and Peyto Lake in Banff. A family sits down to a meal. A hand strokes a white rug. Snippets of text such as, “All this. All yours,” and “Room to Breathe,” flash onscreen.

But aside from the skyline shot under the video’s title, Edmonton, is notably absent.

“That would be like saying, ‘Let’s have it in Boston! The Statue of Liberty, Broadway, the MOMA, the Met! It’s all in (4 hours from) Boston!” one user tweeted in response.

The video was meant to market to players’ families, retorted Matt Wolf, one of the premier’s issues managers.

In order to throw their hat into the ring, potential hub cities have had to check off a list of basic requirements, from facilities within their arenas, to nearby hotels, to practice facilities. Beyond that is where the marketing comes in.

Within the world of hockey, the city has plenty of cred. It’s home to the Oilers dynasty that once won five Stanley Cups in 10 years. These days, the city boasts a brand new arena with surrounding hotel district, and Connor McDavid.

Kenney has seemingly been working hard to attract the NHL to Edmonton as the COVID-19 lockdown eases and plans to bring back pro hockey take shape.

Speaking in late May, Alberta’s chief medical officer, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, said the province was working on more flexible rules for teams coming from the U.S., such as creating a “cohort quarantine.”

“A group that came in from international travel, such as an individual team, would have to stay together in that quarantine period and would not be able to interact with others outside of that cohort group,” she said.

“They would be effectively sealed off from the rest of the community.”

After the 14-day quarantine was over, people would be free to travel.

Perhaps, to the mountains.

“I’m a little discouraged and I want to gain it back,” McPhee said.

McPhee was among a handful of gym rats at Prestige Fitness in LaSalle on the first day gyms and restaurants in the Montreal area were allowed to open since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He was initially concerned that the gym would be overflowing with customers, despite its 50-person limit, but felt comfortable once he realized there weren’t many people inside.

“For me, if I come in and I see it’s packed, I still want to be safe,” McPhee said. “But, there’s not that many people so I’m going to stay and train.”

Prestige Fitness owner Theano Kolovos said her clients have been following the rules, including cleaning exercise equipment before and after usage, as well as sanitizing their hands before entering the facility.

“Everybody’s excited: I’m excited, the members are excited,” Kolovos said.

“We’re glad that everything is back to normal — at least, semi-normal.”

A few blocks away, Sarah Leblanc enjoyed a drink at the Brasserie des Rapides pub.

She said she was excited to get back to her routine of visiting two to three times a week, either alone or with friends.

“I’ll probably be here a lot,” Leblanc said.

“I’m not going to walk on eggshells,” she said. “I keep my distance, of course, I take my precautions. I wash my hands. If I’m going to get it, I’m going to get it, right? Everybody’s probably going to get it in the future because it’s not just going to disappear,

Brasserie des Rapides owner Domenic Macri said there were close to 25 patrons at his restaurant for breakfast — some of them coming as soon as they reopened at 7 a.m.

“We had reservations for breakfast, which — usually, on a Monday, we do not have reservations for breakfast. We usually have ample room,” Macri said.

On the same day Montreal restaurants and gyms reopened, Quebec announced there were no new deaths from the novel coronavirus.

It was the first time since March that the province hadn’t reported a death linked to the virus, and the current toll stands at 5,417.

Quebec reported 69 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, for a total of 54,835, with 23,506 cases considered recovered.

Malcolmson provided the prayer from her home during a Zoom call, saying she wasn’t scheduled to make the opening, but would do her best.

The summer sitting is starting with a much different format than the usual face-to-face political debates.

The pandemic requirements of physical distancing mean the normally crowded 87-member chamber will be limited to 24 politicians and media interviews will be held virtually.

There were also 12 new deaths announced, raising the statewide toll to 3,173.

A Miami Herald analysis of public and non-public COVID-19 data found that through June 3, new cases in Florida had consistently been trending up since mid-May and the trends could not be attributed solely to increases in testing.

And as bars, gyms, vacation rentals and movie theatres reopened at partial capacity in all but three South Florida counties, the number and rate of new COVID-19 cases were rising statewide — a troubling indicator that the disease could be spreading more quickly.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week that another shutdown is not in the plans.

“We’re not rolling back,” DeSantis said during a news conference last Tuesday when asked whether he would consider stopping some reopening efforts. “The reason we did the mitigation was to protect the hospital system.”

CONFIRMED COVID-19 CASES IN SOUTH FLORIDA

Less than half of the new cases were in South Florida. None of the new deaths were in South Florida’s four counties, according to Florida’s COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard.

—Miami-Dade County reported 449 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no new deaths. The county now has a total of 26,239 confirmed cases and 884 deaths, the highest in the state.

—Broward County reported 172 additional confirmed case of the disease and no new deaths. The county now has a total of 11,327 known cases and 373 deaths.

—Palm Beach County saw 189 additional confirmed cases and no new deaths. The county’s known total is now at 10,943 with 468 deaths.

—Monroe County reported three additional cases of the disease and no new deaths. The Florida Keys now have a total of 165 confirmed cases and four deaths.

More than half of the state’s known COVID-19 cases are in South Florida’s four counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe. Miami-Dade continues to lead the state with the most confirmed cases and deaths. It has 26,239 confirmed cases and 884 deaths.

One of the tools that officials are relying on to determine if the coronavirus situation is improving in the state is hospitalization data. Unlike testing, which might be limited or take days to report results, hospitalizations can help give officials a real-time snapshot of how many people are severely ill with COVID-19.

The health department says it does not “have a figure” to reflect the number of people currently hospitalized and only provides the total number of hospitalizations in its statewide and county-level data. On Monday, 82 hospitalizations were added, bringing the statewide total to 13,119.

While Florida’s Department of Health is not releasing current statewide hospitalization data to the public, hospitals in Miami-Dade are self-reporting a number of key metrics, including hospitalizations, to the county, which has made this data public. Some provide updates every day; others don’t.

On Sunday, 65 people were discharged and 105 people were admitted to Miami-Dade hospitals, bringing the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 complications to 714, the highest it has been since April, according to Miami-Dade County’s “New Normal” dashboard data.

Scientists are also still working to learn more about the virus, including how many people in the community are infected and have mild or no symptoms, which can make it difficult to determine what percentage of the cases hospitalizations represent.

Testing in Florida has seen steady growth since the COVID-19 crisis began.

Testing, like hospitalizations, helps officials determine the virus’ progress and plays a role in deciding whether it is safe to lift stay-at-home orders and loosen restrictions.

The recommended number of daily tests needed varies among experts, but the dean of the University of South Florida’s College of Medicine told the governor that Florida needs to test about 33,000 people every day.

Florida’s Department of Health reported 41,028 new tests on Saturday in Sunday’s daily COVID-19 update. The positive rate was 13.59 per cent of the total, according to the report. In total, 1,889,662 tests have been conducted.

To date, 1,600,335 people have been tested in Florida. Of the total tested, 97,291 (about 6.08 per cent) have tested positive. The state says there are 1,625 tests with pending results. Monday’s testing results were not immediately available.

Health experts have previously told the Miami Herald that they were concerned the number of pending results listed by the state is an undercount. This is because Florida’s Health Department only announces the number of pending test results from state labs, not private ones — and private labs are completing more than 90 per cent of state tests.

Previously, it has taken as long as two weeks for pending test results from private labs to be added into the state’s official count, making it difficult for officials to project the size and scale of the pandemic in the state. It’s unclear how quickly results are currently being sent to the state from private labs, as the turnaround time varies by lab.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-22,"Ontario farmers who employ temporary foreign workers received a warning Monday from Premier Doug Ford and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: Protect those workers from COVID-19 or face consequences.

The strongly worded messages came amid outbreaks on farms that have seen hundreds of migrant workers testing positive for COVID-19 and the Windsor-Essex region held back from moving to Stage 2 of reopening.

Three workers have died from the disease.

Ford, who last week pleaded with farmers to bring their workers to get tested, repeated the appeal Monday — this time singling out some farmers in Windsor-Essex who he said “brushed off” his first request.

“We’ll give it another shot,” Ford said. “I’ll go to the extreme, whatever tool I have, to protect the people of Windsor, and the food supply chain, and the farmers, and the workers.”

Ontario’s labour minister said the province will increase inspections of farms this week, including the migrant workers’ living conditions, in partnership with the federal government and local health units.

“We are stepping up our efforts to work with the agricultural community to help them adjust to the new realities where temporary foreign workers are working and living very closely together,” Monte McNaughton said. “The consequences are serious.”

Advocates have said the cramped “bunkhouses” migrant workers share on farms have contributed to the spread of the novel coronavirus, and they have called on the province to include those spaces in workplace spot checks.

Approximately 20,000 migrant workers come to Ontario each year to work on farms and in greenhouses — many of them from Mexico, Guatemala and the Caribbean. This year, they were required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival.

Ford’s announcement came just hours after Trudeau said some farmers were not following strict federal rules designed to protect workers.

“Anyone doing work, let alone essential work as part of our food chain, needs to feel protected,” Trudeau said. “Obviously, in the case of these three tragic deaths, that wasn’t the case. We are ensuring that changes are made and that there will be consequences.”

The province has struggled to contain the outbreaks in the Windsor-Essex and Haldimand-Norfolk regions, where dozens of workers have been exposed to the virus.

Last week, a temporary centre set up in Leamington, Ont., to test the Windsor-Essex region’s 8,000 workers was shuttered after it tested roughly 10 per cent of the population — prompting hospital officials to call it an inefficient use of resources.

Ford said Monday the province will send mobile testing units to farms to alleviate some of the fears farmers and workers have of testing, but he again appealed for co-operation.

“I’m going to tell it the way it is, farmers just aren’t co-operating,” he said. “They aren’t sending out the people to get tested. We’ve got to bang our heads off the wall and figure out why. It’s good for the farmers, good for your workers, good for the food supply chain on safety.”

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit said Monday that 31 of the region’s 32 new cases come from the agricultural sector.

Two migrant workers have died in the region due to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit reported a migrant worker at a local farm had also died from the illness.

That farm currently has 199 infected migrant workers and 18 other people associated with the farm who tested positive for COVID-19, the health unit said.

The president of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture said Monday he was concerned about Ford’s warning of “extreme” actions if farmers don’t co-operate.

Keith Currie said the OFA has been working with the Ontario government and supports increased testing.

“We need to continue to push our members to just suck it up and go get the testing done,” he said. “Then you know where you’re at because the last thing we need is some of these folks to have a huge outbreak at harvest time. Then the whole year is gone.”

In addition to the increased inspections, the province’s chief medical officer of health suggested Monday that local health units tighten regulations on farm workforces.

Farms are filling current labour gaps using a mix of temporary foreign workers, local workers and employment agency workers, which heightens the risk of transmission, Dr. David Williams said.

He recommended increased employee screening and isolation protocols, and said any domestic worker coming onto a farm must have tested negative for the virus 48 hours prior to starting work.

“We need to have much more control, much more regulation and registration and more assurances of the safety before you bring other people in and contaminate what was already a fairly clean workforce,” Williams said.

Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said the pandemic has exposed the inequality between how we treat migrant workers and local workers. He said the province must change the “two-tier system” to prioritize migrant worker safety.

“It is not fair that seasonal workers might be afraid to report an illness or might be living and working in unsafe conditions that they cannot speak out about,” he said.

Read', 'Keith Doucettethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Keith Doucettethe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-06-22,"HALIFAX—A small Halifax-area company that has transitioned to making face shields during the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a novel approach that doesn’t involve a production line.

Dartmouth, N.S.-based Spring Loaded Technology, which also manufactures knee braces, has devised a system that allows its workers to assemble its reusable shields in the safety of their own homes.

Company CEO Chris Cowper-Smith said the idea was created to maximize physical distancing, given that production staff working on the knee braces were the only ones allowed to be in the office. Other employees were asked to work from home.

“When we wanted to start adding shields, we didn’t want to just add a bunch more people into our space after we asked others to work from home,” said Cowper-Smith.

He said once the decision was made to manufacture the shields in May, the company doubled the size of its workforce, adding another 25 temporary and full-time workers.

Each person on the shield production team has been equipped with a work station they are using at home, and they are regularly brought the materials needed to assemble the shields by technicians who also pick up the finished products.

Cowper-Smith said each worker is given enough material to make anywhere from 100 to 130 shields a day. They’ve also been trained to keep their work areas clean to cut down on contaminants during the assembly process.

The shield design is a collaboration between Spring Loaded and another Dartmouth-based company, Ring Rescue.

Dalhousie University medical student Ella Vermeir is one of the production team members working from home.

Vermeir said she decided to spend her summer building shields after her clinical elective in family medicine was cancelled.

“It’s been a really smooth process for someone like myself who hasn’t done a lot of assembling or manual labour kind of tasks before,” said Vermeir.

She said she can usually make about 100 shields over the course of her work day — a task that took her about seven hours to complete when she first started the job.

“Now it takes about five or six hours working at my top speed, because obviously I want to do a good job,” she said. “There’s a sense of responsibility knowing who is getting them. All of the assemblers feel like we really want to do a good job and give them something that’s going to protect them.”

The company has sold its face shields to a number of hospitals in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as well as to food producers, the seafood industry and dentists, and it recently completed a contract to equip the Victorian Order of Nurses.

Cowper-Smith said Spring Loaded has made about 40,000 face shields so far and expects to make about 200,000 more in the coming months.

He said work on the shields would continue for at least the rest of this year, and his company would assess how the need for personal protective equipment develops over time.

“The model is rapidly scaleable,” Cowper-Smith said. “If the demand for them dies down, we can reduce our output and if it increases we can quite quickly add people and start producing more shields.”

After posting substantial decreases in COVID-19 infections and deaths, Toronto is officially moving into Stage 2 of reopening for business on Wednesday.

There are caveats — social distancing measures remain in place, so businesses must strive to provide room for customers to remain two metres (six feet) apart.

Masks must be worn in some circumstances, and are being encouraged in all indoor spaces.

For now, access to the Toronto Islands remains restricted, but Mayor John Tory told residents on Monday they can expect positive news on that front soon.

Some changes will take place immediately — for example, Toronto began deploying life guards to six city beaches on Monday, to help residents stay safe while they stay cool.

Other restrictions will be lifted effective Wednesday.

Here is a breakdown of what’s included in Stage 2 and what’s not included:

Hair salons can reopen and so can estheticians and salons offering manicures and pedicures.

Patrons and staff must wear face coverings where physical distancing cannot be maintained and the number of people in businesses at any one time will be limited.

Restrictions include any services that tend to a customer’s face, including facials, eyebrow grooming and makeup.

Steam rooms, saunas, bath houses, hot tubs, floating pools and sensory deprivation pods remain closed, except for medically authorized purposes.

House-sitters may resume work and so can personal trainers and sports trainers, outside of gyms only.

Restaurants, bars, food trucks, wineries, breweries and distilleries may open for dining in outdoor areas only, including patios, curbside, parking lots and adjacent premises. While patrons may walk through the interior to pick up food, use the washroom or access the patio, indoor dining will remain prohibited.

Tory promised restaurants without patios to expect more good news soon.

Shopping centres, malls and markets may open, but the experience of shopping in malls will be changed.

Eating at indoor food courts will remain prohibited, but you’ll be able to buy food for take-out. Operating hours may be different. The number of people allowed into the mall will be controlled. Shoppers will have to follow walking traffic patterns — think of those arrows on the floors of grocery stores. Fitting room access may be restricted, as the rooms are supposed to be cleaned between customers. There may be efforts to screen people for COVID-19 symptoms at shopping mall entrances.

Movie theatres and water parks will remain closed, but all indoor and outdoor swimming pools, outdoor splash pads and wading pools will be opened. Slides and climbing structures in pools will remain closed.

Change rooms and showers may or may not be open, depending on whether operators can keep the areas adequately sanitized and disinfected.

Film and television production may resume, along with photography services and tour guide services.

Outdoor recreation facilities may open, including paintball and mini-golf, but amusement parks, water parks, playgrounds and play structures will remain closed.

Parks and campgrounds may reopen and outdoor recreation team sports may resume for training only, with no scrimmage or games.

Weddings and funerals may resume, with limits on indoor venues set at 30 per cent capacity and a limit of 50 people outdoors.

Libraries can reopen with limited services, including computer access and contactless book pickup and drop-off. Patrons will not be permitted to handle books or materials on shelves.

Community centres can reopen but will offer only limited or modified programming.

Museums, galleries, aquariums, zoos, landmarks, botanical gardens and other attractions may reopen, but interactive and high-contact exhibits will remain closed.

Read', 'Mayo Clinic News Network']",2020-06-22,"The 2020 hurricane season is underway and this year, coupled with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there may be added stress when it comes to ensuring safety from both storm damage and the spread of infection. Being properly prepared can help ensure personal safety and well-being, and it’s equally important to have appropriate medical provisions on-hand as it is food and water.

“It is important to have food, water and other household supplies when preparing for a hurricane or other disaster, but it is also important to take stock of your health-care necessities and prepare a first-aid kit, as well,” says Dr. Vandana Bhide, a Mayo Clinic internist.

Dr. Bhide recommends these supplies:

Antibiotic cream or ointment

Band-Aids and gauze

A two-week supply of any prescription medications

Disinfecting wipes or hand sanitizer

Bug repellent

Sun block

As you put your plan into place, the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers these extra considerations to protect you and others from COVID-19.

Give yourself more time than usual to prepare your emergency food, water and medicine supplies. Home delivery is the safest choice for buying disaster supplies; however, that may not be an option for everyone. If in-person shopping is your only choice, take steps to protect your and others’ health when running essential errands.

Protect yourself and others when filling prescriptions by limiting in-person visits to the pharmacy. Sign up for mail order delivery or call in your prescription ahead of time and use drive-through windows or curbside pickup, if available.

When you check on neighbours and friends, be sure to follow social-distancing recommendations (staying at least six feet, about two arms’ length, from others) and other CDC recommendations to protect yourself and others.

If you need to go to a disaster shelter, follow CDC recommendations for staying safe and healthy in a public disaster shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-22,"Quebec Premier François Legault made major changes to his cabinet Monday, including replacing the province’s health minister in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Danielle McCann, who shepherded the Health Department of the province worst-hit by COVID-19, will take over the higher education portfolio, which had belonged to Education Minister Jean-François Roberge.

Treasury Board President Christian Dube will replace McCann to run the province’s biggest department.

Questioned whether he was demoting his health minister, Legault said he didn’t think education was less important than health. He did, however, say Quebec “had a failure and a victory” during the pandemic.

“We had a failure in the long-term-care homes and a victory in the community,” referring to the fact that 64 per cent of the province’s 5,417 deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus occurred in those facilities for seniors.

Legault said McCann did “extraordinary” work on improving front-line care, such as increasing the responsibilities of pharmacists and nurses. And he also praised her for preparing the province for a possible second wave of infection in the fall.

But what Quebec’s health network needs right now, the premier said, is to modernize its “stone age” information system and to hold regional managers accountable. The Gazette reported in May, for example, that health authorities were contacting and tracing COVID-19 infections with a fax machine.

Improving information systems, Legault said, is Dube’s “specialty.”

“Christian Dube has a lot of experience in management — not necessarily in the health care system — but in management, and I think it’s about time we evaluate the managers in our health care network.”

Dube, who comes from the business world, is the first person outside the province’s health care network to run the Health Department since Legault was named to the job between 2002-03 as a member of the Parti Québécois.

“So, I believe that it is possible, when you are a businessman, to change things and then improve things in the health network,” he said, referring to his pre-politics job as the co-founder of Air Transat airline.

Opposition parties said the reshuffling was an attempt to hide the government’s pandemic record.

“A reshuffling that only has one goal: to hide the government’s negligence in preparing for the pandemic,” Liberal leader Dominique Anglade said on social media.

Interim Parti Quebecois leader Pascal Bérubé noted that Quebec accounted for nearly two-thirds of the country’s COVID-19 deaths, despite only making up 23 per cent of the population.

“The change of minister and deputy health minister in the midst of a pandemic indicates that the government recognizes the failure of its preparations for (long-term care homes),” Bérubé said.

McCann’s new post means Roberge will now be responsible solely for the primary and secondary school systems.

Sonia LeBel will leave the justice portfolio to oversee the province’s purse strings, replacing Dube.

LeBel, a former chief counsel with Quebec’s corruption inquiry, known as the Charbonneau Commission, will be responsible for negotiating a massive collective bargaining agreement with the province’s 500,000 public sector workers.

But Legault said LeBel’s first task will be coming up with a replacement for Bill 61, which sought to fast-track 202 construction projects for things such schools, seniors residences, road work and public transit.

The bill was tabled late and required the consent of the opposition parties to move forward — which it didn’t get before the session paused for the summer.

LeBel also brings a woman aboard Legault’s all-male economic team, for which he has heard criticism.

Simon Jolin-Barrette, who led the government’s major legislative changes on secularism and on reducing immigration, will take over the justice portfolio while remaining house leader.

Legault noted that Jolin-Barrette, who will also remain minister in charge of the French Language, is the youngest justice minister in the province’s history.

International Relations Minister Nadine Girault will retain her portfolio while also taking on the immigration file. She was recently appointed as co-chair of a task force on racism.

No backbenchers were promoted as part of the shuffle.

The Coalition Avenir Quebec government holds a majority in the 125-seat legislature with 76 seats.

The Opposition Liberals hold 28 seats, Quebec solidaire follows with 10, the Parti Quebecois has nine seats and there are two Independent members of the legislature.

Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-06-22,"OTTAWA—Canada’s roughly 250,000 federal public servants are being primed for an eventual return to their workplaces, though many are expected to continue working remotely for the foreseeable future.

The preparations, which include the distribution of a 30-page guidebook, come as provinces continue easing restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 and more Canadians return to their offices and other places of employment.

The vast majority of federal public servants have been working from home since mid-March, during which time many have been called upon to help roll out huge new support programs for Canadians affected by the pandemic.

In a message to public servants on Monday, Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos, who oversees the bureaucracy as a workforce, said the return to federal work sites would vary based on local conditions and each department’s requirements.

“Reopening access to federal work sites will be gradual and will vary from organization to organization, each according to their own operational circumstances,” Duclos said. “As plans unfold, the health and safety of employees will be our priority.

“Planning is being guided by the decisions of public health authorities, including Canada’s chief public health officer, and will take into consideration the local public health situation and the nature of the work.”

The federal public service has been praised for the speed with which it has rolled out a variety of support programs such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit during the pandemic.

It has also been criticized for the closure of Service Canada offices across the country since March, particularly as minimum-wage employees in grocery stores and other workplaces continued to work.

There have also been concerns about the impact that working from home has had on the federal access-to-information system along with tasks requiring access to sensitive government material such as military procurement.

Questions have also been raised about whether many public servants will eventually work from home on a permanent basis, reflecting discussions that many other industries are starting to have.

The guidebook released on Monday includes directions to senior management to take into consideration their departments’ own requirements as well as the circumstances of individual employees and their families.

“Employees whose work can be done remotely should continue to take advantage of recent investments in IT infrastructure and digital skills, as the work and equipment permit,” the guidebook tells federal workers.

“Employees who are considered vulnerable as defined by public health agencies should be supported to continue to work remotely when possible; this includes people with chronic illnesses or are immunosuppressed (or living with others who qualify).”

The guidebook makes clear that the return to “normal” will take time while leaving open the idea that some federal public servants may end up working from home for good.

Federal departments and agencies are also directed to track and report on cases of COVID-19 among their staff, which includes tracking incidents in which employees refuse to work on safety grounds.

“The information provided by departments and agencies in the COVID-19 tracker will enable decision making on the return to the work site from a health and safety lens,” the guidebook says.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Pressmon.']",2020-06-22,"OTTAWA—The Mexican government says it will resume sending farm workers to Canada after securing promises for more inspections and oversight to curb outbreaks of COVID-19.

At least two Mexican men have died and hundreds more have fallen ill with COVID-19 in recent weeks on farms across the country.

The situation led Mexico to temporarily stop allowing workers to leave for Canada, sending shock waves through the agricultural sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labour.

But the Mexican government says it has now struck a deal with the federal Liberal government that will lead to improvements in the temporary foreign worker program.

In a press release late Sunday, Mexico says Canada has committed to increased inspections, as well as more support for Mexican officials and workers to identify and report unsafe working conditions.

A working group will also be set up with Mexican and Canadian government officials to deal with the issue.

In a letter to Mexico’s ambassador to Canada, sent Friday, federal employment minister Carla Qualtrough says Canada is committed to ensuring the safety of people crucial to Canada’s food security.

A copy of the letter was obtained by The Canadian Press.

It lays out some of the detailed options under consideration by the federal government, including assessments of farms where there have been outbreaks to see what instructions need to be improved, as well as increased inspections on farms where new clusters of COVID-19 infection emerge.

The federal government also promises to reach out to employers to make sure they are following all the rules that have been put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 on farms.

“In cases of significant non-compliance by employers of temporary foreign workers, strict sanctions will be applied,” the letter says.

A spokesperson for Qualtrough said the government had no further comment and would let the letter speak for itself.

There are no timelines attached to the Liberal government’s commitments, but the letter describes them as “short-term measures,” and promises the government is exploring other options.

In their press release, the Mexican government said they appreciate that Canada was willing to work with them to find solutions, and the deal is evidence of the strong bilateral relationship between the two countries.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-22,"Toronto is ready to move to Stage 2 reopening, the public health chair says, even though “that means that we will see more cases of COVID-19.”

Coun. Joe Cressy was both optimistic and cautious Monday after Premier Doug Ford decreed Toronto and Peel region ready to shake off many lockdown restrictions and move, starting Wednesday, to a wider reopening.

For the first time since March, residents will be able to get professional haircuts, eat and drink on restaurant patios, shop in malls and more, as long as physical distancing and other virus-containment rules are followed.

“Over the past two weeks, the daily case counts in our city have shown that the measures we have taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are working,” Cressy said in a statement.

He noted the city has a new online dashboard for residents to track new infections and other indicators, tools to track outbreaks in seniors homes and similar group settings, and online maps showing where virus hotspots exist in Toronto.

“While I am optimistic about moving forward, I also know that we need to remain cautious,” Cressy wrote. “Moving forward with reopening means that will see more cases of COVID-19, because we cannot completely eliminate the risk of this virus until there is vaccine.

“We will experience new outbreaks, and we will, sadly, see deaths. This in inevitable.”

The new phase will see resumption of some city services paused during the pandemic. Splash pads will open Wednesday, followed by outdoor city swimming pools starting Friday and then wading pools.

CampTO, the scaled-down, physically distanced city day camps for kids aged 6 to 12, can now officially proceed. Registration for Etobicoke/York and Scarborough districts starts Wednesday at 7 a.m. People in Toronto/East York, West Toronto/York and North York districts can start signing up Thursday at 7 a.m.

Dr. Eileen de Villa, the public health chief, said that as Torontonians emerge more from their homes, her team will keep a close eye on indicators such as virus spread, health-care capacity and testing levels.

“That will be a foundational part for making a determination as to whether we need to dial back (and reimpose restrictions) or whether we can continue forward,” toward Stage 3, with most workplaces and community spaces reopened.

Infection levels dropped to the point that Toronto can move to Stage 2 because residents followed physical distancing rules, washed their hands and stuck to social circles, she said, urging Torontonians to keep up the good work.

If Torontonians follow the rules in Stage 2, Mayor John Tory said, he’s confident the city can “move safely but quickly into Stage 3.”

But last weekend Toronto might have had a taste of what’s to come, with parties on Toronto beaches, including Cherry Beach, where people did not physically distance and left behind big messes.

Tory said the city has boosted the number of bylaw officers and cleanup crews but warned people not to put the city at risk.

“While we want people to enjoy our beaches, the beach parties themselves are not consistent with applicable and necessary health orders,” he said.

De Villa repeated Monday that her efforts to keep a lid on infections as lockdown lifts will not include following the lead of her counterparts in Guelph and Windsor-Essex in ordering stores to mandate mask use indoors.

De Villa said the city’s legal advice to her remains that she can strongly recommend cloth face coverings, but she does not have the legislative power to order their use, even though use on the TTC is mandatory starting July 2.

Rob Shirkey, a lawyer with expertise in municipal legislation, disagrees. “Dr. de Villa can issue an order to mandate masks inside commercial establishments under section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act,” he said.

“There’s also a strong legal argument that Mayor Tory (i.e., the head of council) can mandate masks under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act or that Council can pass a bylaw under its general health and welfare powers of the City of Toronto Act.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-06-22,"Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are all easing more of the restrictions they implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Quebec, which accounts for just over half of Canada’s COVID-19 cases, is reopening several sectors today, impacting the Montreal area in particular.

Restaurants can open again in the greater Montreal and Joliette areas while indoor gatherings of up to 10 people from three households are now permitted in these regions, as they have been elsewhere in Quebec since last week.

Day camps, along with gyms, arenas, cinemas, concert venues and places of worship can reopen across the province with a maximum capacity of 50 people for indoor gatherings.

Meanwhile, Saskatchewan moves to Phase 4.1 of its reopening strategy today, which allows camping in national parks to resume, but by reservation only.

Youth camps can reopen, but for day use only, and with guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19, including the constant disinfection of play structures and monitoring of children for coronavirus symptoms.

Outdoor sports like soccer, softball and flag football can resume, though full-contact sports remain prohibited, as does competitive play, tournaments and interprovincial travel for games.

Shared equipment must be disinfected frequently, and no high-fiving or handshakes are allowed.

Saskatchewan’s outdoor swimming pools and spray parks can also reopen with physical distancing, maximum capacity, and stringent cleaning rules in effect.

However, some municipalities, including Regina and Saskatoon, have said they won’t be reopening their outdoor pools right away.

The province is also doubling the allowable size of indoor public and private gatherings to 30 people where space allows for two metres between participants.

Manitoba moved to relax more of its restrictions yesterday.

Restaurants and bars no longer have to operate at half capacity, however, tables must be two metres apart or have a physical barrier between them.

Non-smoking bingo halls and video lottery terminal lounges can also reopen at half capacity.

Child care centres and retail stores can return to normal capacity, and people arriving in Manitoba from other western provinces, northern territories and northwestern Ontario no longer have to self-isolate for 14 days.

Larger public gatherings are also permitted. People can now fill up to 30 per cent of the capacity of any venue as long as they can be split into groups of 50 indoors or 100 outdoors.

By the end of Sunday Canada’s COVID-19 case total stood at 101,337, including 8,430 deaths and 63,886 cases resolved.

8:00 p.m.: British Columbia’s top doctor is warning people not to let their guard down against COVID-19 as the province prepares to allow more travel this summer.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says the premier is expected to announce later this week when the province will move into the third phase of its restart plan, which allows overnight camping and the opening of hotels, resorts and RV parks.

She says travellers have to exercise caution, be respectful of the communities they plan to visit and take the same care they do at home to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

B.C. has had 32 new cases of COVID-19 over the past three days, including one new death.

5:45 p.m.: Ontario saw an uptick in reported COVID-19 infections outside the GTA on Monday as the daily case count continues to fall in Toronto, according to the Star’s latest count.

As of 5 p.m. Monday, Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,571 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,653 deaths, up a total of 223 new cases since Sunday evening.

In Toronto, the daily report of new cases fell to just 37, the lowest single-day total since April 1, back when the city had reported fewer than 1,000 cases. The rate of new infections in the city has fallen sharply this month. For the last seven days, Toronto has seen an average of 68 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for on the seven days ending May 25.

Meanwhile: Health units outside the GTA saw 100 new cases reported on Monday, up more than 70 cases from the previous day and the first time they had hit triple digits in 20 days.

In recent weeks, several health units have stopped reporting case totals on the weekend, meaning their tallies reported on Mondays included multiple days of data.

Since Sunday evening, the health units have reported another eight fatal cases, five of which were in Toronto.

Earlier Monday, the province reported that 265 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 76 in intensive care, of whom 58 are on a ventilator. All three totals are now near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,609 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

3:02 p.m.: Saudi Arabia said Monday that this year’s hajj will not be cancelled, but that due to the coronavirus only “very limited numbers” of people will be allowed to perform the major Muslim pilgrimage.

The kingdom said that only people of various nationalities already residing in the country would be allowed to perform the hajj.

The government did not specify how many people would be permitted to take part.

The annual pilgrimage, which is set to begin this year at the end of July, traditionally draws around 2 million Muslims from around the world for five intense days of worship and rituals in Mecca.

Saudi Arabia has never cancelled the hajj in the nearly 90 years since the nation’s establishment.

It halted the minor umrah pilgrimage, which can be performed year-round, in February, as the coronavirus began spreading across the region.

2:38 p.m.: Guatemalan Preisdent Alejandro Giammattei said Monday that 151 of the people who work at his official residence have tested positive for COVID-19, and one has died.

Many of the infections were found among workers in the Secretariat of Administrative Affairs and Security at the presidential residence, which includes his offices, in downtown Guatemala City. Giammattei said 69 of those infected have recovered and at least five, who had been in critical condition, have improved.

The president, himself a physician, has not tested positive.

Giammattei made the announcement during an event at the Foreign Relations Ministry to announce that the European Union had donated laboratory material for 72,000 COVID-19 tests.

Guatemala’s tax agency has reported 36 cases and the prosecutor’s office 19. Nationwide, Guatemala has reported 12.614 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 531 deaths.

1:10 p.m.: Ontario and the federal government will begin joint inspections of farms with migrant workers, says Labour Minister Monte McNaughton. A third migrant worker from Mexico died of COVID-19 over the weekend, and 31 of 32 new cases in Essex County today were on farms.

1 p.m.: The Manitoba government is planning to give people more freedom to visit loved ones in personal care homes.

Currently, people are allowed outdoor visits only, to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Health Minister Cameron Friesen says the government is looking to build all-season, heated shelters next to all personal care homes by the fall so that the visits can continue through the winter.

Friesen says the government is also looking to allow some indoor visits, where conditions permit, starting this week.

Friesen says the indoor visits will only be for designated family caregivers, and visitors will have to be screened on arrival and wear non-surgical masks.

Friesen says Manitoba has not seen the type of COVID-19 outbreaks in personal care homes that have occurred in Quebec and Ontario.

12:34 p.m.: Health officials in Nova Scotia are attributing an additional death to COVID-19, along with reporting no active cases of the novel coronavirus.

Officials say a man in his 60s with underlying medical conditions died several weeks ago in the province’s central zone.

The death had been under investigation to determine if COVID-19 was a factor. The man’s death brings the total number of deaths since the outbreak to 63.

Nova Scotia’s last new case of the infection was identified on June 9.

There have been a total of 1,061 confirmed cases, and 998 are now resolved.

12:07 p.m.: Residents of Toronto and Peel Region can get their hair cut, dine out on a restaurant patio, and shop at indoor malls as of Wednesday after coronavirus restrictions are lifted following 14 weeks of lockdown.

Premier Doug Ford will make the news official later Monday, with Windsor-Essex, plagued by new cases of COVID-19 among migrant farm workers, the lone Ontario region remaining in the first stage.

Toronto and Peel will join Durham, Halton, York, and Hamilton, which moved to the second stage of reopening last Friday.

It will have been 100 days since Toronto restaurants could serve dine-in meals or stylists and barbers can cut hair.

Read the full story from the Star’s Robert Benzie.

12 p.m.: Public Health officials in New Brunswick are reporting no new cases of COVID-19 today.

The number of confirmed cases in the province stands at 164.

Authorities say 135 of those cases are considered recovered, including 14 related to the outbreak in the Campbellton region.

There have been two deaths in New Brunswick attributed to the novel coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, and two patients remain in hospital with one in intensive care.

All parts of the province except the Campbellton area are currently in the Yellow level of the COVID-19 recovery plan, while Campbellton remains at level Orange.

At the Orange level, a two-household bubble is permitted, but personal services businesses such as barbers, hair stylists, spas, and tattoo parlours are not allowed to operate.

11:50 a.m.: More than 100 days ago, buildings across New York City shut their doors and companies sent their workers home. As the coronavirus pandemic swept across the city, lockdown orders left offices dormant, stores shuttered and streets and sidewalks all but abandoned.

On Monday, two weeks after it began easing restrictions, New York City marked another major milestone when it entered a much larger reopening phase, allowing thousands of offices to welcome back employees for the first time since March.

Yet with offices required to limit their maximum capacity and to ensure distance between workers, the number of those returning to work appeared to be a fraction of those that once jostled elbows on crowded subways and packed into high-rise elevators.

11:45 a.m.: Quebec is reporting no new deaths attributed to the novel coronavirus today.

It is the first time since March that the province hasn’t reported a death linked to the virus, and the current toll stands at 5,417.

Quebec is reporting 69 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 54,835, with 23,506 cases considered recovered.

Meanwhile, Quebec opened large swaths of its economy today, particularly in the greater Montreal area.

Restaurants, churches and indoor fitness centres reopened across the city, and public indoor gatherings of up to 50 people are now permitted provincewide.

Private homes still may only welcome a maximum of 10 people from three different families.

10:40 a.m.: Several Raptors players and staff members are leaving Toronto today for Florida to prepare for the resumption of the NBA season.

The Raptors will remain in the Fort Myers area until entering the NBA campus at Disney, near Orlando, in early July for the remainder of the season.

Group workouts will only begin once teams have reported to the NBA Campus at Disney.

The NBA wants to play out the rest of the season on the campus in Florida starting in late July, but coronavirus cases in the state continues to surge.

Florida added another 3,494 new coronavirus cases on Sunday as the state continues its explosive trend of people testing positive for the disease.

The state now has recorded 97,291 people with COVID-19. At the current pace, Florida will almost certainly hit that the milestone of 100,000 on Monday.

The latest number of new cases is the third highest daily total since the beginning of the pandemic. But it’s fewer than the highs of 4,049 cases the state reported on Saturday and the 3,822 cases on Friday.

10:10 a.m.: Canada’s roughly 250,000 federal public servants are being primed for an eventual return to their workplaces, though many are expected to continue working remotely for the foreseeable future.

The preparations, which include the distribution of a 30-page guidebook, come as provinces continue easing restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 and more Canadians return to their offices and other places of employment.

The vast majority of federal public servants have been working from home since mid-March, during which time many have been called upon to help roll out new support programs for Canadians affected by the pandemic.

In a message to public servants this morning, Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos, who oversees the bureaucracy as a workforce, says the re-opening of federal worksites will vary based on local conditions and each department’s requirements.

The federal public service has been praised for the speed with which it has rolled out a variety of support programs such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit during the pandemic.

Yet it has also been criticized for the closure of Service Canada offices across the country since March, particularly as minimum-wage employees in grocery stores and other workplaces continued to work.

10 a.m.: Half of Chinese-Canadians say they have faced insults and name-calling since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in North America, according to a poll by Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta released Monday.

The survey results, taken from 516 Canadians who self-identify as ethnically Chinese, suggest just how commonplace racist behaviour against people of East Asian descent has become since the pandemic arrived in North America.

Forty-three per cent of respondents said they have been personally threatened or intimidated at least once, and 13 per cent said it happens frequently. Eight per cent of respondents said they have frequently been physically attacked by strangers.

9:30 a.m.: A third migrant farm worker from Mexico has died of COVID-19 after an outbreak at Scotlynn Farm in Norfolk County.

The Migrants Right Network has identified the worker as 55-year-old Juan López Chaparro, who had been coming to Canada since 2010. He died Saturday. The group is calling for migrant workers to be given permanent resident status.

The Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit says as of Sunday, there were 18 cases of COVID-19 at the farm and 199 cases among migrant farm workers throughout Haldimand and Norfolk Counties.

This comes after Mexico announced it would be resuming sending farm workers to Canada after Ottawa committed to increased inspections, as well as more support for Mexican officials and workers to identify and report unsafe working conditions.

8:55 a.m.: City hall is expecting Doug Ford to announced today that Toronto is ready to move to Stage 2 reopening. Mayor John Tory expects Ford to announce which municipalities are ready for restaurant patio dining, hairstyling services, mall reopenings and more, at his 1 p.m. Queen’s Park announcement, Tory spokesperson Don Peat said Monday.

Tory “believes the numbers have been trending in the right direction and is optimistic but it is a provincial decision,” Peat told the Star.

As of Friday, all Ontario municipalities except Toronto, Peel Region and Windsor-Essex were in Stage reopening. Officials in those municipalities had asked for extra time to reduce their COVID-19 infection rates.

8:15 a.m.: The Mexican government says it will resume sending farm workers to Canada after securing promises for more inspections and oversight to curb outbreaks of COVID-19.

At least two Mexican men have died and hundreds more have fallen ill with COVID-19 in recent weeks on farms across the country.

The situation led Mexico to temporarily stop allowing workers to leave for Canada, sending shock waves through the agricultural sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labour.

But the Mexican government says it has now struck a deal with the federal Liberal government that will lead to improvements in the temporary foreign worker program.

In a press release late Sunday, Mexico says Canada has committed to increased inspections, as well as more support for Mexican officials and workers to identify and report unsafe working conditions.

7:36 a.m.: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel may have to renew its lockdown following a surge in coronavirus cases.

“‘We must flatten the curve now,” Netanyahu said at the beginning of Sunday’s weekly cabinet session. “If we don’t change our behavior immediately, and begin to wear masks and keep a distance from each other, the lockdowns will return. None of us want that.”

Netanyahu said he will hold a meeting of ministers on Monday to decide what steps should be taken. Over 20,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Israel, including more than 300 fatalities. The number of cases has steadily risen, from less than 17,000 a month ago, after restrictions were significantly eased and many people ignored instructions to wear masks and maintain social distancing.

While the number of deaths has not spiraled, Netanyahu said the forecasts he was given over the weekend were all “harsh,” without giving further details.

The Health Ministry instructed hospital directors in a letter sent to them on Sunday to be prepared to reopen coronavirus wards immediately, if necessary. The ministry also asked hospitals to refresh personal protection instructions to medical staff, noting that in addition to the increase in the number of coronavirus cases, there has been a rise in the number of personnel who are in quarantine due to exposure to infected patients.

6:22 a.m. A Pakistan Cricket Board medical official says the upcoming tour of England during the coronavirus pandemic is a “big risk” but one that is necessary to help the country get through the crisis.

“During the pandemic it’s (the tour) a big risk,” said the PCB’s director of medical and sports sciences Dr. Sohail Saleem on Monday.

“We haven’t experienced (playing during a pandemic), but for both teams it will be a first. The pandemic means risk, but consider them (players) as ... providing people entertainment.”

Saleem said he was encouraged by soccer resuming in Europe where the Bundesliga in Germany and the Premier League in England have staged games played in empty stadiums.

The Pakistan team is scheduled to leave for England on Sunday to play three test matches and three Twenty20s in August and September. The PCB is sending an extended squad of 29 players in case replacements are needed for anyone testing positive during the tour.

All 29 players will be tested twice for COVID-19 before they board the flight to London. Once the team lands in the UK, Saleem said the players will go through another testing session before they start training in a bio-secured environment.

6:12 a.m.: Ottawa should earmark at least $2.5 billion for child care out of $14 billion in federal funds announced this month to help provinces reopen safely in the wake of COVID-19, says a new report by a national advocacy organization.

The money, on top of about $550 million already allocated to the provinces for child care this year, would begin to set the stage for Canada to build a long-awaited national system of high quality, affordable child care for all parents who need it, says the report by Child Care Now, being released Monday.

“It has taken a public health crisis for the essential role of child care to be widely recognized, and for the fragility of child care services in Canada to be laid bare,” said the group’s executive director Morna Ballantyne.

5:15 a.m.: Quebec, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are all easing more of the restrictions they implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Quebec, which accounts for just over half of Canada’s COVID-19 cases, is reopening several sectors today, impacting the Montreal area in particular.

Restaurants can open again in the greater Montreal and Joliette areas while indoor gatherings of up to 10 people from three households are now permitted in these regions, as they have been elsewhere in Quebec since last week.

Day camps, along with gyms, arenas, cinemas, concert venues and places of worship can reopen across the province with a maximum capacity of 50 people for indoor gatherings.

Meanwhile, Saskatchewan moves to Phase 4.1 of its reopening strategy today, which allows camping in national parks to resume, but by reservation only.

Youth camps can reopen, but for day use only, and with guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19, including the constant disinfection of play structures and monitoring of children for coronavirus symptoms.

5:08 a.m.: China reported 18 new cases of the coronavirus, including nine in Beijing and two in neighbouring Hebei province. It was the first time in more than a week that the number fell to single digits in an outbreak in the Chinese capital.

Previously, the city had reported more than 20 cases every day for eight straight days. The total number of cases since the first one was confirmed on June 11 rose to 236.

3 a.m.: South Korea has reported 17 new cases of COVID-19, the first time its daily jump came down to the teens in nearly a month. Its 40 to 50 cases per day increases over the past two weeks have occurred as people increased their public activities amid eased attitudes on social distancing.

2:10 a.m.: The coronavirus is spreading in Pakistan at one of the fastest rates in the world, and overwhelmed hospitals are turning away patients. But the government is pushing ahead with opening up the country, trying to salvage a near-collapsed economy where millions have already slid into poverty from pandemic restrictions.

Further complicating the dilemma, as the government pins its main hope for stemming the virus’ rampage on social distancing and masks, many in the public ignore calls to use them.

Millions crowd markets and mosques. Hard-line clerics tell followers to trust that faith will protect them. Many call the virus a hoax. Even some government officials dismiss warnings, saying traffic accidents kill more people.

Pakistan is a prime example of fragile developing countries that say they’ll just have to live with rising infections and deaths because their economies cannot withstand an open-ended strict lockdown.

But the rapid acceleration in infections in Pakistan this month could be an indicator of what faces other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The rate of new cases in Pakistan leaped from around 2,000-3,000 a day in late May to as high as 6,800 a day in mid-June. Deaths are nearing 150 a day. So far, more than 180,000 people have been infected in this country of 220 million, and the government on Sunday said that the number could total 1.2 million people in August. Authorities have reported 3,590 deaths.

9:12 p.m.: An email from baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred to union head Tony Clark led to a balk in the drawn-out talks to start the pandemic-delayed season.

The executive committee of the players’ association was set to vote and reject Major League Baseball’s latest offer for a 60-game season on Sunday.

Players want 70 games and $275 million (U.S.) more than teams are offering. They are worried that if a resurgence of COVID-19 causes the 2020 season to be cut short, the deal being negotiated would lock in innovations for 2021 and lessen the union’s bargaining power.

Among the items in the proposed deal for 2020 and 2021 are expanded playoffs, use of the designated hitter in games involving National League teams and allowing advertisements on uniforms. The 2020 only items include starting extra innings with runner on second and a discussion of whether to allow tie games after a specified total of innings plus player re-entry in extra innings.

8:01 p.m.: Iran’s health minister said on Sunday that the coronavirus outbreak in the country would last until 2022, the Isna news agency reported.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said that according to official estimates, Iranians would “have to live with the coronavirus for another two years,” the report said.

After the number of new infections eased in May, Iranian authorities started to lift coronavirus-related restrictions. However, the fact that people have been taking hygiene and social distancing measures less seriously has led to a new rise in infections, authorities say.

More than 200,000 people have had or currently have the virus in Iran, with more than 9,500 having died as a result.

Read', 'Wanyee Livancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Wanyee Li Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-22,"VANCOUVER—“Every day, I pray that you people die.”

That’s just one example of the kind of insults and name-calling that half of Chinese-Canadians say they have experienced since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in North America, according to a poll by Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta released Monday.

The survey results, taken from 516 Canadians who self-identify as ethnically Chinese, suggest just how commonplace racist behaviour against people of East Asian descent has become since the pandemic arrived in North America.

Forty-three per cent of respondents said they have been personally threatened or intimidated at least once, and 13 per cent said it happens frequently. Eight per cent of respondents said they have frequently been physically attacked by strangers.

Researchers from the university helped craft the questions in the survey, done from June 15-18. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

The goal was to collect data on how Chinese-Canadians’ experience has changed since the pandemic started dominating headlines, said Angus Reid Institute executive director Shachi Kurl.

“What has made the news and what we hear about tends to be the really overt, violent, more extreme examples” of such prejudice, she said.

In Vancouver, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.

“No doubt there would be some out there who say these are just isolated examples,” said Kurl. “This study really aims to measure the breadth and the scope and size of the issue — and now we have a sense of that.”

Six in ten respondents said they have changed some aspect of their routine in order to avoid abuse, “run-ins” or “unpleasant encounters” since the pandemic was declared in Canada. Fifty per cent said they have been insulted or called names due to their ethnicity. One in three survey respondents said they have been made to feel like they posed a threat to the health and safety of others.

Of the people who participated in the survey, 44 per cent per cent were born in Canada, 22 per cent in China, 22 per cent in Hong Kong, and three per cent from Taiwan. Ten per cent were born in another country.

Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said that being Canadian was an important part of their identity and that they love Canada and what it stands for. Yet a quarter said they feel like outsiders in their own country. Of those who were born in Canada, one in five said they felt like outsiders.

“These data shows us that everything from insults to a sense of othering, to being made to feel that somehow you’re to blame for this — it’s all part of what affects someone’s psyche,” said Kurl.

In a 2016 Angus Reid poll, about half of visible-minority respondents said they believe others see them as Canadians “all the time.” Respondents in this most recent survey were asked the same question. Only 13 per cent said they feel this way.

A majority (64 per cent) of respondents said they believe North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadians’ views of people of Chinese ethnicity.

“The whole point of taking measurement of this is we are no longer dealing with anecdotes. This is something that brings empirical data, that brings facts to what has been, up to this point, more of an anecdotal conversation,” said Kurl. “You can’t argue with that.”

The survey, designed with help from University of Alberta researchers, also gave respondents a chance to share details from their experiences. Some of the anonymized responses were published in the report.

One person wrote, “While walking on the streets in Kitsilano (Vancouver), a Caucasian man in his 30s said to me and my daughter, ‘every day, I pray that you people die.’”

Another wrote, “I was at a local Loblaws in the queue to pay and a person behind me got too close. I requested that he back up to allow for social distancing and he stated, ‘shut up and go back to where you came from.’”

About 1.6 million people in Canada — 4.6 per cent of the population — identify as being ethnically Chinese, according to the 2016 census.

Kurl said she hopes even people who have not experienced anti-Asian discrimination personally will pay attention.

“It’s happening under our roof. We have to clean it up.”

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"OTTAWA—The Mexican government says it will resume sending farm workers to Canada after securing promises for more inspections and oversight to curb outbreaks of COVID-19.

At least two Mexican men have died and hundreds more have fallen ill with COVID-19 in recent weeks on farms across the country.

The situation led Mexico to temporarily stop allowing workers to leave for Canada, sending shock waves through the agricultural sector, which is highly dependent on foreign labour.

But the Mexican government says it has now struck a deal with the federal Liberal government that will lead to improvements in the temporary foreign worker program.

In a press release late Sunday, Mexico says Canada has committed to increased inspections, as well as more support for Mexican officials and workers to identify and report unsafe working conditions.

A working group will also be set up with Mexican and Canadian government officials to deal with the issue.

In a letter to Mexico’s ambassador to Canada, sent Friday, federal employment minister Carla Qualtrough says Canada is committed to ensuring the safety of people crucial to Canada’s food security.

A copy of the letter was obtained by The Canadian Press.

It lays out some of the detailed options under consideration by the federal government, including assessments of farms where there have been outbreaks to see what instructions need to be improved, as well as increased inspections on farms where new clusters of COVID-19 infection emerge.

The federal government also promises to reach out to employers to make sure they are following all the rules that have been put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 on farms.

“In cases of significant non-compliance by employers of temporary foreign workers, strict sanctions will be applied,” the letter says.

A spokesperson for Qualtrough said the government had no further comment and would let the letter speak for itself.

There are no timelines attached to the Liberal government’s commitments, but the letter describes them as “short-term measures,” and promises the government is exploring other options.

In their press release, the Mexican government said they appreciate that Canada was willing to work with them to find solutions, and the deal is evidence of the strong bilateral relationship between the two countries.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-19,"Just like many Ontario youngsters during the COVID-19 pandemic, Shannon Reaume’s four-year-old son Lucas misses playing baseball and soccer, and longs to see his friends at preschool.

But for Lucas, who needs a ventilator to breathe at night due to a rare congenital disorder that causes his brain to stop communicating with his respiratory system when he sleeps, the global health crisis means he is at much higher risk of becoming seriously ill.

And it means Reaume has had to screen out most of the nurses who usually monitor the ventilator overnight because they also work in long-term care or hospitals where they could contract the virus and bring it into their home.

The Elora, Ont. family’s roster of seven or eight nurses has dropped to just one who comes three nights a week. It has left Reaume, a PhD candidate in public health, and her husband Logan, an accountant, struggling to monitor Lucas themselves four nights a week while also trying to work from home.

Reaume and her husband are among several dozen parents with medically fragile children who would like to use funding they receive from the provincial Family Managed Home Care program to hire relatives to help during the pandemic.

But their Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) has refused to give them permission, despite provisions that allow it under exceptional circumstances, Reaume said.

“My son’s ventilator can become detached as many as 40 times a night” when Lucas stretches or rolls over, said Reaume who suffers from the same congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). An alarm sounds to indicate trouble and if the ventilator is not reconnected, Lucas will die.

Reaume also relied on a ventilator at night as a young child, but has been using non-invasive ventilation — a face mask similar to those used by people who have sleep apnea — since she was about eight years old

“We are so lucky that he is meeting his developmental milestones and is normal in every other way,” she said of Lucas.

“But we both fall into the vulnerable category and know if we were to contract COVID-19, our odds of having really bad outcomes with it are much higher than someone without medical conditions,” Reaume added.

Reaume’s parents take Lucas for one 22-hour stretch a week and her sister looks after him for one afternoon. But Reaume would like to use some of her provincial funding to compensate them for what she feels goes “over and above” what could be considered typical family support for a child like Lucas.

Reaume would also like to use some of the money to pay for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks the nurse and other family members use in the home.

“But our LHIN has said that is not covered in our contract,” she said.

Sherry Caldwell, co-founder of the Ontario Disability Coalition, says about 20 families with medically fragile children have contacted her for help since the pandemic began in March.

“It’s a very small group,” she said. “The parents want to be able to hire family members who they trust.”

A spokesperson for Health Minister Christine Elliott said the program, which serves about 150 families, has changed “to help ease the burden for parents during this difficult time.”

LHINs can designate family members as paid caregivers “in exceptional circumstances” and the ministry has recently waived some technical requirements such as police checks, certifications and other insurance requirements that would be difficult to fulfil during the pandemic, said Hayley Chazan.

Medical equipment has always been covered by the Family Managed Home Care program and this would extend to PPE, Chazan added in an email.

While she said she was unable to comment on the Reaume family’s case, Chazan said “our government will continue to ensure that vulnerable families and children receive the care they need and deserve.”

But Caldwell said families have been hearing this for months.

“What is the point of the policy if children with complex medical needs like Shannon’s son can’t access it?” she asked. “The Ontario government is failing these families.”

Read', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Lee Berthiaumethe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"OTTAWA—Wreaths were laid and the call of a single bugle rang out near Parliament Hill as a subdued ceremony was held on Sunday to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War.

The ceremony, attended by a small group of Canadian and Korean officials and a handful of surviving veterans from the conflict, was one of the first of its kind in months after COVID-19 forced the cancellation of numerous military commemorations.

Those included plans to mark the 75th anniversaries of the liberation of the Netherlands in the Second World War and Victory in Europe Day, when Nazi Germany was officially defeated.

Many of those attending this morning’s ceremony wore masks and stood at a distance from each other even as they came together to mark the sacrifices of those Canadians who fought and died in Korea.

“It’s important that we have these ceremonies,” 86-year-old Bill Black, who served on board a Canadian destroyer during the war and is now president of the Korea Veterans Association.

“Even if we have to suffer a little bit with numbers down and wearing masks. So be it. We’re not going to forget our Canadian soldiers, sailors and airmen who served in keeping countries free. These are days that we will not allow to slip by.”

Around 26,000 Canadians fought in the three-year conflict, which started on June 25, 1950 when Communist North Korean forces supported by China and the Soviet Union invaded the U.S.-backed south.

Five-hundred sixteen Canadians died during the war, which ended in a military standoff that continues to this day.

Sunday’s ceremony would normally have been held at the National War Memorial next to Parliament Hill, but was moved down the street to nearby Confederation park where the Korean War Monument is located.

The official delegation was restricted to 10 people and included Canadian Army commander Lt.-Gen. Wayne Eyre, who recently served as deputy commander of United Nations’ forces in South Korea, as well as politicians, Korean diplomats and veterans.

Under a bright blue sky and amid sweltering heat, those in attendance remembered the fallen while reflecting on the importance of the war, which is described as “the Forgotten War” due to being overshadowed by the Second World War and the U.S. Vietnam War.

The park is owned by the National Capital Commission, which manages federal green spaces in the Ottawa area. The NCC ordered several restrictions — including on the size of the gathering — as a condition for letting the ceremony go ahead despite COVID-19.

Conservative Sen. Yonah Martin, whose father was separated as a child from his family during the war and who is now working to raise awareness of the conflict among Canadians, said it was important to press ahead with the ceremony.

“We were trying to abide by the guidelines to the best of our ability,” said Martin, the first Korean-Canadian to serve in Parliament.

“We would not have done this if the veterans did not want it. But they are quite insistent. They have survived a lot and this is very important to them.”

While the commemoration was able to go ahead despite COVID-19, attendees were reminded of the threat posed by the respiratory illness — especially for older people — when one of the veterans who was scheduled to speak was unable to attend.

Black said the veteran, who was also expected to lay a wreath, was on his way to get tested for COVID-19 on Sunday after calling to say that he had a higher-than-normal temperature and was not feeling well.

Read', 'Rolburlington Post', 'Burlington Post']",2020-06-21,"It’s been a long journey, but it ended with accordion music.

Ronald Weston, 61, was officially discharged from Burlington’s Joseph Brant Hospital on June 19 after spending 85 days in the hospital as a result of COVID-19. The Burlington man was diagnosed with the virus on March 25 and was put in a medically induced coma for 30 days during treatment.

What’s the first thing he’s going to do once he gets home?

“Having a beer,” said Weston. “Spend some time with my family, relax and start continuing the rehab at home.”

As of June 19, the region reported 710 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Halton. Weston is one of its 682 recovered or resolved cases.

When he left the hospital main entrance he was greeted by cheering family and supporters and one man who played “When the Saints Go Marching In” on accordion. The atmosphere was jubilant and people held signs welcoming him home and said “Joseph Brant presents Ron Weston as the Covinator.”

Weston had a message of caution to those who may not be taking COVID-19 all that seriously.

“It can happen to you — take precautions,” said Weston. “I didn’t think there was any chance I would get this because I tend to not to get a lot of viral infections like the flu. So don’t be arrogant — it can happen to you.”

Even after the months of hospitalization, he is still feeling the effects of the diseases. Weston has lost roughly 30 pounds, has a reduced lung capacity, a slight tremble and will be in rehab for some time now as his strength returns.

Weston’s condition on COVID-19 went from nothing to serious in a remarkably short amount of time. He said that in two days he went from feeling fine to being in such a serious state that they put him in a medically induced coma for 30 days.

Weston described waking up from such a long coma as a profoundly strange experience.

“I’ve never done LSD, but I imagine it’s something like that. The drugs are kind of still in your system so you have these hallucinations. I was a little confused because I don’t remember anything other than arriving in hospital. So all of a sudden I wake up in this room with strangers around, no family telling me what happened. That was the hardest part the first few days,” said Weston.

As of May 26, all residents who have at least one COVID-19 symptom are encouraged to get tested for the virus at an assessment centre. For more information on how to get tested and what the symptoms are visit www.halton.ca.

Weston does have a number of positive takeaways from the ordeal.

“I feel really lucky,” said Weston. “Incredible outreach by friends and people I haven’t seen in 20, 25 years emailing me, calling me. So if I’m trying to find a positive out of a negative situation I reconnected with a lot of friends and if it’s possible the love I feel for my family is probably a little deeper.”

Read', 'David Nickletoronto.Com', 'David Nickletoronto.Comsun.']",2020-06-21,"Spadina—Fort York Councillor Joe Cressy, who chairs Toronto’s Board of Health, will be taking an earlier and shorter parental leave to care for his infant son, Jude — in anticipation of a second wave of COVID-19 possibly hitting Toronto in the fall.

Cressy said in a written statement issued Father’s Day, June 21, that he’ll be moving the planned four-month parental leave starting in September to just two months of parental leave starting in July.

“The truth is, with the current pandemic, there is no perfect way for me to combine all my roles,” he wrote. “With the potential for a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall, I have adjusted my plans in order to continue overseeing Toronto Public Health’s response and recovery efforts at that time.”

Cressy’s son, Jude, was born in November 2019 — less than two months before COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, and Cressy and the Toronto Board of Health began preparations for the possibility of the novel coronavirus’s spread in Toronto.

In an April interview with Toronto.com, Cressy compared the work he and members of Toronto’s public health team had been doing since then as sprinting up a down escalator.

“You have to continue to sprint, and if you stop, you fall — but you never get to the top,” he said at the time.

Cressy said he will continue to chair the Toronto Board of Health remotely during the summer but will step back from his other duties as a Toronto councillor until September.

He said he will also continue to sit on Mayor John Tory’s daily COVID-19 Strategic Command Team and attend Toronto council to vote on key matters during his leave.

“I feel a duty and responsibility to be fully present to tackle the second wave of COVID-19 that public health experts are predicting could occur in the fall or winter, and that has been the main factor influencing my decision,” he said.

Cressy wrote that his office will remain open during his parental leave, “and my exceptional staff will continue to respond do issues and concerns.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 500 military members and their associated equipment were gathered at Canadian Forces Base Borden north of Toronto in early April to support the federal government’s response to COVID-19 as the pandemic spread across the country.

Many of those troops ended up being deployed to seven long-term care homes in the GTA hit hard by COVID-19, where they found cases of abuse and negligence as well as bug infestations, bleeding infections and residents being left crying for help for hours.

Their observations were compiled into a damning report released last month that has sparked several lawsuits as well as calls for an overhaul of how Ontario’s long-term care homes are managed.

Troops remained in two long-term care homes on Sunday and won’t formally wrap up their mission until Friday, but the military says hundreds of others who have completed their mission will hit the roads and return home on Monday and Thursday.

“Despite very challenging circumstances, CAF personnel and civilian staff have made an important impact and set the conditions for success in these facilities,” the Department of National Defence said in a statement to The Canadian Press.

“The overall number of new cases is decreasing, and conditions — including hygiene, staffing, and access to personal protective equipment — are improving for residents and staff.”

It was not immediately clear whether similar moves would be made in Quebec this week, where the military has deployed more than 1,000 troops to help in 47 long-term care facilities since April. Like in Ontario, their mission is set to end on Friday.

The Armed Forces were first put on high alert because of COVID-19 in late March as military commanders prepared to respond to requests for assistance from federal and provincial authorities in relation to the pandemic as well as floods and wildfires.

While those natural disasters have not materialized in any significant way, the military did end up mobilizing Ranger units in several northern communities before deploying into the long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec.

The deployment involved most of the Armed Forces’ medical personnel. Quebec Premier Francois Legault had indicated he wanted to the military to stay in the homes until September, but military officials subsequently warned that was not sustainable.

The military did indicate that the returning troops will remain ready to respond to future requests for assistance.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Amy Smartthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Amy Smartthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"Organizers of a major Indigenous festival in Ottawa considered postponing or cancelling it entirely after COVID-19 restrictions meant they couldn’t gather in person.

But as an anti-racism movement swept the country, bolstered by news of Indigenous deaths during police interactions, Trina Simard said it only affirmed their decision to take the Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival online.

“I can’t speak for everybody but for me it’s part of what drives me about this education,” the festival producer and executive director of Indigenous Experiences said.

“It’s more than a festival, it’s our cultural and community connection and it’s really that one time of year where we get to share and celebrate with our neighbours who we are. I think that’s the first step in reconciliation.”

The Summer Solstice Indigenous Festival wraps up three weeks of events and activities Sunday on National Indigenous Peoples Day. It’s among many Indigenous organizations across the country finding ways to celebrate amid restrictions at a time when they say it’s especially important to do so.

Adaptation has meant mailing food kits to participants in a virtual traditional cooking workshop, Simard said. And the festival has partnered with the Social Distance Powwow Facebook group to host its performers and others, with finalists competing Sunday.

The Facebook group has almost 200,000 members since its creation in mid-March as a platform for dancers to dance, vendors to recoup their losses and to recreate a sense of community online.

Virtual powwow participants this week have posted videos in full regalia in front of backdrops of oceans, mountains and fields across North America.

Belle Bailey, 19, posted her dance from Meath, Ont. She is an Alongquin from the First Nation of Pikwakanagan.

In her video, she wears her favourite regalia honouring Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and has a hand print across her mouth, painted in red, the colour believed to be visible from the spirit world.

“My hope is that their spirits find peace dancing with me,” she says in her post. “Since I can’t dance in the Sacred Circle of my home traditional Powwow this year, I’m still dancing with my moccasins on the grass where I can smell the cedars and pines.”

Bailey’s mother Holly John said in an interview the celebration of Indigenous culture shouldn’t be limited to National Indigenous Peoples Day.

“We do celebrate the one day but it should be integrated into Canadian history, not just a one-day celebration,” John said.

Bailey recently spoke in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement at a rally this month.

“I felt like I knew where they were coming from because as an Indigenous woman you have gone through what they’ve gone through and you know how they’re feeling,” she said.

In Montreal, Land In Sights is still organizing a fire ceremony for National Indigenous Peoples Day. Beginning at sunrise, a Mohawk elder will preside over the ceremonial, which will be webcast, a release says.

“Montrealers are invited, at that time, to open their computer and their window and to burn some tobacco in order to participate in this propitietory rite which is intended to herald better times,” the release says.

Artists and personalities from Aboriginal communities will share recorded messages of hope and healing addressed to Montreal and the country. Programs shot during the 2019 Montreal First Peoples Festival will also be broadcast.

On the east coast of Vancouver Island, more than a dozen dancers and musicians gathered on a sandy stretch of beach under the sun. The Kumugwe Cultural Society and Dance Group recorded a video circulated this weekend in honour of the day.

Hereditary chief Negedzi, whose English name is Rob Everson, said the song was passed on to his younger brother in the early ’80s by his late grandfather, Chief Andy Frank of the K’omoks First Nation.

“We’ll use that dance to cleanse or bless the place that we’re dancing,” he said.

This is the first time in 20 years since the group’s formation that they haven’t spent the day performing in the local big house for hundreds of people and sharing traditional meals.

“This is totally different,” Negedzi said.

Although the group won’t be able to share their culture together locally Sunday, he said the video may mean the group reaches new audiences in its efforts to promote a better understanding of Indigenous ways.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"VICTORIA—In a building where face-to-face debates between political opponents are normal activities, the British Columbia legislature will be a much different place when it returns Monday for a summer sitting.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the required physical distancing to slow the spread of the virus will see the normally crowded 87-member chamber reduced to 24 politicians. Meetings and scrums will be held virtually through Zoom from locations around the building or across B.C.

It will be historic, unique and exciting, say members of the legislature, who agree democracy will prevail during the pandemic.

“There’s several books to be written about this,” said Adam Olsen, interim Green party leader.

“This parliament continues to amaze me in that just when you thought it wasn’t going to get any weirder, then a global pandemic happens. I am often finding myself marvelling at how unique a time it is to be elected to the legislature to this particular parliament.”

Since the 2017 election, he said, B.C. has been rolling through a historic political period with a minority NDP government relying on support from the Greens, and the COVID-19 pandemic adds one more chapter.

NDP house leader Mike Farnworth said discussions with the opposition parties, the Speaker and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry have resulted in a plan for the legislature that is safe and functional.

“People will be impressed by what’s in place,” he said. “It’s going to allow every member to participate either in the chamber or by Zoom, by virtual. There will be question period. There will be debates on legislation.”

The legislature is scheduled to sit until Aug. 12, said Farnworth.

Politicians who are not in the chamber will participate virtually in debates. Committee meetings and interviews will be done from their offices in the legislature or their ridings, he said.

Farnworth said the pandemic plan will serve as a model in case of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in the future.

The government plans to introduce legislation and pass the budget it tabled in February before the pandemic took hold.

Finance Minister Carole James recently said the B.C. economy has plunged into recession, with more than 300,000 people losing their jobs, hitting the province’s finances hard.

Opposition Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said his party has supported Henry’s public health measures, but now the focus is on the economic recovery.

“We’ve been writing letters to the premier for the last month with dozens of suggestions about how we can get B.C. rolling again, including things like a three-month suspension of the provincial sales tax so that people can get the confidence to go out and involve themselves in the economy again,” he said.

Wilkinson said the NDP can expect vigorous debate during budget estimates because the government’s “assumptions have been shot to pieces by the pandemic.”

Andrew Weaver, the former Green party leader who now sits as an Independent, said the return to the legislature sets the stage for the pandemic recovery.

“If we go back in history, some of the greatest advances in human civilization occurred after some of the greatest tragedies,” he said. “Every challenge, I view and I think others should to, view through the lens of what opportunity does it create. That will be my focus going into this session.”

Weaver, who will continue to support the minority government, said he expects a quieter, more respectful tone in the legislature.

“If you are sitting at home, it’s kind of hard to get riled up, desk thumping, heckling,” he said. “I don’t see how people will do that from home.”

Read', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Stephanie Levitzthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"OTTAWA—Watching the farms and highways of Ontario out of the oval windows of an Airbus A320, it’s easy to forget for a moment how COVID-19 has so thoroughly changed familiar routines.

From cruising altitude, the fields look as they always do, a bucolic quilt of greens and browns, shadows moving over them as the clouds cross underneath the sun.

But then, your field of vision goes blurry. Your glasses have fogged up, again, because of the mask you’ve had to wear from the moment you stepped into the airport.

Welcome to the dystopian experience that is air travel in the pandemic era.

At the Ottawa airport, circles dot the floors at check-in, at security and in the hallways to show where it is safe to stand.

With passenger air traffic nearly non-existent, boarding announcements are few and far between.

Instead, a cheerful but stern disembodied voice repeatedly reminds people to wash their hands, cough into their sleeves, and wear a mask.

In the departure lounge, seats are cordoned off so people don’t sit too close. As those who’ve chosen to take a midday flight to Toronto take every other spot, they’re kitted out in everything from homemade masks to full face shields.

The anticipatory energy normally buzzing at a gate ahead of a flight has morphed into an eerie sense that what’s at the end of the ramp isn’t a modern jet but a spaceship beaming people to an unknown world.

Dutiful queues form for a mandatory temperature check, and once past that, the normal scanning of boarding cards and checking of IDs. The gate agent asks for masks to briefly be pulled down so faces can be matched to photos. She tells one passenger there is a camera watching to make sure it’s done.

The musty smell of the airplane cabin is cut with the scent of cleaning solution, and the flight attendant smiles with her eyes, her bilingual “Hello! Bonjour!” greeting muffled by her mask.

Each passenger is handed a kit — not a fancy eye mask or cozy slippers, but a clear plastic bag with a face mask, rubber gloves, tiny bottle of hand sanitizer and cleansing wipes.

There’s a small bottle of water too. Physical distancing restrictions mean no in-flight service.

After takeoff, the seat-belt sign dings off and the in-flight reminders crackle over the speakers, with new additions to the familiar lyrics: Use the air sickness bag to dispose of a soiled mask, and also, remember to wash your hands.

That slightly disorienting sense of arriving in a different place, even if it is a familiar airport, is kicked up a notch when everyone is in a mask.

There are no throngs of smiling family and friends waiting just outside the luggage carousels at Toronto’s Pearson international airport. No one but passengers and staff are allowed inside. That romantic moment in the movies where people are wrapped in the love of family and friends they haven’t seen in months? It is replaced by dire signs reminding of COVID-19 symptoms, and yet another plea to wash your hands.

Stepping outside and into the sunshine, the deep inhale of fresh air after a flight feels even fresher without a mask blocking the way. It’s quiet and not just because there are few people, no screeching luggage carts, or idling cabs or shouting security officers.

There are also no roars from departing or landing jets.

It’s not just the routines of travel changed by COVID-19. It’s also the rituals.

Arriving at the departure zone to begin the trip home, there’s always a little game to play. On the six or eight screens listing dozens of international flights leaving soon: Which exotic locale would you jet off to at a moment’s notice, if you had the chance?

On this weekday, the number of flights is under a dozen, nearly all to Canadian cities. Timmins, Ont. Hmmm. They say it’s nice this time of year.

The airport shop is open, its normal sundries and souvenirs bolstered by one for the ages: a T-shirt, for $12.99, that reads: “I’ve been social distancing since before it was cool.”

Headed to security, an art installation catches the eye. The images are of what happens to atoms when they are frozen to the coldest temperature possible.

They’re striking, these photos, but it is the title of the exhibit itself that perhaps best sums up travel in the time of a pandemic: “A New Way of Seeing Reality.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9:12 p.m.: An email from baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred to union head Tony Clark led to a balk in the drawn-out talks to start the pandemic-delayed season.

The executive committee of the players’ association was set to vote and reject Major League Baseball’s latest offer for a 60-game season on Sunday.

Players want 70 games and $275 million (U.S.) more than teams are offering. They are worried that if a resurgence of COVID-19 causes the 2020 season to be cut short, the deal being negotiated would lock in innovations for 2021 and lessen the union’s bargaining power.

Among the items in the proposed deal for 2020 and 2021 are expanded playoffs, use of the designated hitter in games involving National League teams and allowing advertisements on uniforms. The 2020 only items include starting extra innings with runner on second and a discussion of whether to allow tie games after a specified total of innings plus player re-entry in extra innings.

8:01 p.m.: Iran’s health minister said on Sunday that the coronavirus outbreak in the country would last until 2022, the Isna news agency reported.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said that according to official estimates, Iranians would “have to live with the coronavirus for another two years,” the report said.

After the number of new infections eased in May, Iranian authorities started to lift coronavirus-related restrictions. However, the fact that people have been taking hygiene and social distancing measures less seriously has led to a new rise in infections, authorities say.

More than 200,000 people have had or currently have the virus in Iran, with more than 9,500 having died as a result.

6 p.m.: As of 5 p.m. Sunday, Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,348 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,645 deaths, up a total of 160 new cases since Saturday night, according to the Star’s latest count.

In Toronto, the daily report of new cases jumped by 35 cases to 88, ending a three-day stretch of falling totals. Still, the average rate of new infections remains well down in the city. For the last seven days, Toronto has seen an average of 75 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for on the seven days ending May 25.

Meanwhile, Toronto was once again the only health unit to report fatal cases Sunday, accounting for all five new reported deaths in the city. Thursday also saw no new fatal cases reported outside the city — something that hadn’t been seen since mid-March when the province’s death toll was in the single digits.

Earlier Sunday, the province reported that 286 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 86 in intensive care, of whom 59 are on a ventilator. All three totals are now near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,606 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

4:40 p.m.: Quebec reported nine COVID-19-linked deaths on Sunday, the lowest daily tally since late March.

Only six of Sunday’s deaths are new, with three others dating back before June 13, bringing the total to 5,417 deaths.

The province also reported 92 new confirmed cases of the virus, raising the total to 54,766.

There are 521 people in hospital, including 61 patients in intensive care.

The province is preparing to reopen several sectors and relax the rules for gatherings indoors on Monday, particularly impacting the Montreal area.

Restaurants will reopen in the greater Montreal and Joliette area while indoor gatherings of up to 10 people from three households will be permitted in these regions, like elsewhere in Quebec since last week.

2:30 p.m.: Tyson Foods is looking into reports that China’s customs agency has suspended poultry imports from a Tyson facility in the United States after coronavirus cases were confirmed among its employees.

A Tyson spokesman said Sunday that the plant in question is in Springdale, Arkansas.

On Friday, Tyson Foods announced the results of coronavirus testing at its facilities in Benton and Washington Counties and said that a majority of employees who ultimately tested positive for the virus didn’t show any symptoms. Of the 3,748 employees tested, 481 tested positive for COVID-19, and 455 were asymptomatic.

There have been several other COVID-19 outbreaks at Tyson plants around the United States, including in North Carolina, Nebraska, and Iowa.

10:50 a.m. : Ontario drivers are being told to stay on the lookout for military vehicles on the roads this week as hundreds of Canadian Armed Forces members deployed to long-term-care facilities in the Greater Toronto Area start to head home.

Around 500 military members and their associated equipment were gathered at Canadian Forces Base Borden north of Toronto in early April to support the federal government’s response to COVID-19. Many of those troops were eventually deployed to seven long-term care homes hit hard by COVID-19.

7:50 a.m. : Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel may have to renew its lockdown following a surge in coronavirus cases.

“‘We must flatten the curve now,” Netanyahu said at the beginning of Sunday’s weekly cabinet session. “If we don’t change our behaviour immediately, and begin to wear masks and keep a distance from each other, the lockdowns will return. None of us want that.” The number of cases has steadily risen, from less than 17,000 a month ago, after restrictions were significantly eased and many people ignored instructions to wear masks and maintain social distancing.

7:45 a.m.: Fairs and events in Toronto and around the country are suffering through one of the worst years in memory as measures remain in place to stem the spread of a disease that has killed more than 1,000 people in the city to date.

While rules have been relaxed around small gatherings, a ban on large gatherings remains in place.

Though some events have moved online, writes the Star’s Francine Kopun, organizers worry about the effects of not having cultural gatherings in the community.

7:33 a.m.: In the initial, frantic months of the pandemic, modern society was upended in the interest of saving lives. The economy was halted in a desperate bid to stop the spread, as hospitals scrambled to keep some of the sickest COVID-19 patients alive. So far, the disease has infected more than 100,000 people across Canada; roughly 8,400 have died.

The next phase carries its own set of challenges. As lockdowns ease and governments tentatively roll out their COVID-19 recovery plans, there are now thousands of survivors of the disease in Canada who are also in recovery.

Read the Star’s Rachel Mendleson write on the long road to recovery for the COVID-19 survivors who didn’t want to go to rehab.

7:15 a.m.: Spain’s national state of emergency has ended after three months of restrictions on movement to rein in its COVID-19 outbreak.

As of Sunday, 47 million Spaniards will be able to freely move around the entire country for the first time since the government declared a state of emergency on March 14. The lockdown measures have been rolled back gradually over recent weeks.

6:55 a.m.: South Korea has reported 48 new cases of COVID-19 as health authorities struggle to contain a resurgence that’s erasing some of the country’s hard-won gains against the virus.

Health authorities said 24 of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which have been the centre of the country’s outbreak since late May.

Ten others were reported in the central city of Daejeon, indicating that the virus was beginning to spread more broadly, apparently as a result of increased public activity and complacency in social distancing.

Nearly 200 infections so far have been linked to employees at a door-to-door sales company in Seoul, which mostly hired people over 60. Seventy other cases were linked to a table tennis club in another part of Seoul, where members also passed the virus at a church.

6:30 a.m.: Chinese authorities reported 25 new cases — 22 in Beijing and three in neighbouring Hebei province. They say 2.3 million people have been tested in an effort to contain the outbreak in the capital that led to the closure of its biggest wholesale food market.

China, where the outbreak began late last year, had eased controls on travel and business as new cases fell. But monitoring and some other restrictions have been reimposed following the recent jump in infections. The Beijing health commission gave no details of where the latest cases might have originated.

Saturday 10 p.m.: President Donald Trump suggested to supporters that he has told members of his administration to slow the rate of coronavirus testing in the United States.

Speaking at a campaign rally in Oklahoma, Trump said the U.S. had tested 25 million people, and far more than any other country. He also told the crowd that more testing leads to finding more cases of people who test positive.

“So I said to my people: Slow the testing down, please,” Trump said at the 19,000-seat BOK Center, which appeared to be roughly half full.

Saturday 9 p.m.: Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,188 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,640 deaths, up a total of 180 new cases since Friday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

In Toronto, the daily total of new cases fell again to just 53 as the rate of reported infections continues to fall sharply. For the last seven days, the city has seen an average of 76 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for the seven days ending May 25.

Meanwhile, the city also reported a large uptick in reported deaths Saturday, mostly stemming from newly completed investigations into older cases. Of 25 fatal cases reported Saturday, 24 were from outbreaks that occurred between mid-April and mid-June, Toronto Public Health said.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported that 333 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 80 in intensive care of whom 63 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,595 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-21,"The bands, venues and speakers were booked and the tickets sold for Canadian Music Week when COVID-19 intruded.

It was March and the music conference, held in Toronto each year, was set to launch at the end of June.

“We had to undo everything,” said CMW president Neill Dixon, adding the production is now $1.5 million in debt as a result of the cancellation.

“This is probably the biggest crisis in 38 years of running this event.”

Canadian Music Week, which includes a new music festival and offers networking opportunities for professionals, is not alone.

Fairs and events in Toronto and around the country are suffering through one of the worst years in memory as measures remain in place to stem the spread of a disease that has killed more than 1,000 people in the city to date.

While rules have been relaxed around small gatherings of a couple of households, a ban on large gatherings remains in place.

“Mass gatherings is what we’re built on, so it’s been very difficult,” said Christina Franc, executive director of the Canadian Association of Fairs and Exhibitions (CAFE).

“The future is definitely uncertain.”

Dixon tried rebooking his event for September, so he wouldn’t lose the deposits he had made on venues, but the new date quickly fell apart. It wasn’t economical for bands that had planned to swing by Toronto as part of a tour to book travel to a single city, and speakers from abroad either couldn’t travel internationally or didn’t want to come, only to face a 14-day quarantine when they returned home.

“So we cancelled it a second time, if you can believe that, and just said that we’re taking a pause until 2021,” said Dixon. “Now, from everything I’ve read, 2021 might be early.”

Dixon had to give up the Mississauga offices the event had moved into just two years ago and furlough most of his 20-member staff.

CMW is working on providing some online content.

In fact many events, including Pride, have moved events online. The Beaches International Jazz Festival is working on a virtual event scheduled for July. But about 30 per cent of sponsors have cancelled their support, said founder and executive director Lido Chilelli.

“Basically there’s sponsors that will not participate in a virtual festival because they want to interact with the clientele at the festival. For example, samplers — say they’re sampling a soft drink or a chewing gum or a taco chip — so all of a sudden they just sort of disappeared,” said Chilelli.

Their main sponsor TD, has continued to fund the festival.

“It’s because of their co-operation and their assistance and their expertise that we’re able to function this year,” said Chilelli.

Aneesa Oumarally, Toronto Caribbean Carnival CEO, said she is concerned about all the large and small industries that rely on the event for income — from the music trucks to the artisans who craft the costumes and decorations.

The carnival is supported in part by federal, provincial and municipal funding, but has lost numerous sponsorships and is working with a skeleton staff of four or five key people, down from 20 or more, said Oumarally.

“We are in the process of figuring out how do we work on recovery.”

For others, the intermission is an opportunity to rethink things. Beverly Bain, a lecturer at the University of Toronto, Mississauga and member of the No Police in Pride Coalition, says it’s time for Pride to return to its political roots instead of focusing on ceding to the authority of the city and corporate sponsors.

“It’s an opportunity for many of us to think about how Pride, as a festival, can be re-imagined,” she said.

Mary Fragedakis, executive director of the GreekTown on the Danforth BIA said cancelling a Taste of the Danforth in August this year was devastating to local businesses, already suffering financially as a result of the lockdown that began in March that shuttered all but essential businesses and limited restaurants to selling take-out.

Several businesses have closed in the areas, including the popular Pappas Grill, after more than 30 years in operation.

Fragedakis is hoping the city’s new liberal policy towards patios will draw customers back to the popular strip.

“At the moment we’re just trying to help our businesses survive. That’s our number one priority.”

Oumarally and Franc are also concerned about the societal impact on cities without their popular festivals, which they say have significant cultural and heritage value, especially events that are held year after year over decades or even centuries.

“It becomes a community reunion for a lot of people,” said Franc.

Franc said CAFE is lobbying the federal government for funding to keep fairs and events afloat through COVID and is working with the Tourism Association Industry of Canada for broader opportunities for funding.

TIFF declined to comment for this story and Pride did not respond to request for comment.

Read', 'Karon Liuculture Reporter', 'Culture Reporter', 'Karon Liu Is A Toronto-Based Culture Reporter For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-21,"Days before Suneel Khanna and Carl Wolter were supposed to have their socially distanced wedding of five people at the Fairmont Royal York, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that groups of 10 people could now gather. That meant Khanna’s parents were now able to see their son get married.

“When I came out 20 years ago, gay marriage just wasn’t legal,” Khanna said. “I remember my mom not even looking at me in the eyes for six months. But she went from that person to wanting to be at her gay son’s wedding. In South Asian culture, your parents are everything. We were fighting for the legalization of marriage and the journey of acceptance my parents went through. The cruelty of them not being able to attend their son’s wedding would have been terrible, but in the end it was a dream come true.”

The couple’s original plans to have a ceremony incorporating Hindu and Christian traditions at a church, followed by a reception dinner at The Chefs’ House on King East with 100 guests were scrapped, as venues shut down and gatherings of more than five (now 10) people were forbidden amid the COVID-19 pandemic. But Khanna, 45, and Wolter, 65, say it was vital that they wed during Pride month.

The two met in April 2018 through a dating app. Khanna was vacationing in Palm Springs where Wolter lived and worked in the non-profit sector. They shared common ground in their advocacy work for the LGBTQ+ community and, on a more trivial note, the fact neither really cared for baseball.

The two maintained a long-distance relationship and at last year’s Pride in Toronto, Khanna marched in his first parade alongside Wolter to support Casey House, a hospital specializing in caring for people with HIV/AIDS. Both of them are board committee members there.

“As a kid during the AIDS crisis, I remember they used to bring in patients in haz-mat suits,” Khanna said. “During the parade I remember turning off Bloor and onto Yonge and the crowd went off while Madonna’s “Express Yourself” came on. We both looked at each other and cried. It was such a Toronto moment.”

The two got engaged in Palm Springs on New Year’s Eve 2019. Months later the pandemic led to borders being shut down. Wolter was unable to go back to America, nor could his family and friends come to Toronto.

Still, this month meant too much for the couple to postpone their wedding. It was the one-year anniversary of Wolter coming to Canada and Khanna’s first time marching in a Pride parade. It’s a month of celebration, but the two say it’s also a reminder that there is still much to be done to improve the lives of marginalized communities, and to not take existing freedoms and privileges for granted. Their original wedding ceremony involved a tribute to pioneers in LGBTQ+ activism.

“Society should just be happy that two people want to take care of each other,” says Wolter. “Pride is about affirming ourselves who we are and letting the world know we have value and dignity.”

The couple was able to get a wedding licence from city hall and Khanna’s sister heard about the Fairmont Royal York starting to offer socially distanced weddings for up to five people at the end of May. The grooms’ tailored sherwanis and pagris, ordered through Ethnic Collections in Etobicoke, also arrived from New Delhi before COVID-related shipping delays. A new wedding came together in two weeks.

Khanna and Wolter got married this past Sunday afternoon in the empty ballroom of the Fairmont Royal York.

The officiant along with Khanna’s sister, Anshu and the couple’s friend Linda Ing-Gilbert made up the original party of five. Under the new social gathering guidelines, Khanna’s parents, Jyoti and Chander, were added to the guest list along with his brother-in-law Brendan Dolan.

Also in attendance were Eri Yamada, the hotel’s director of convention services and catering, who ensured Khanna’s parents were able to arrive and leave the hotel without coming into contact with anyone else and Peter Bregg, former chief photographer at Maclean’s, who captured the wedding.

The ceremony started with lit diyas being placed on the officiant’s table, followed by the groomsmen touching Khanna’s parents’ feet for blessing. Wolter did a reading from the first Corinthians and Khanna’s father surprised everyone by singing the Gayatri Mantra hymn and recited the Shanti Path, a peace prayer.

“He sang my whole life and you really had to be there to hear the acoustics in the whole room,” Khanna said. “I don’t think we missed out on anything. Our whole relationship was a gift and there are no ‘I wished’ or ‘should haves’ with the wedding. The fact that I could hug my father and kiss my mother, that’s just the basics I wanted.”

“We’re just fortunate to have each other to get through COVID-19,” Wolter added.

When it was made official and the men kissed, “Nagada Sang Dhol”, a celebratory song from the 2013 Bollywood blockbuster “Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela” played. Their first dance as a married couple was to Frank Sinatra’s “Young At Heart” (a tribute to Palm Springs where they met and Sinatra called home).

As the hour-long ceremony wound down, Khanna’s parents were ushered out of the hotel and the celebration continued in a hotel room where the groomsmen video chatted with friends and family abroad and toasted with champagne and a raspberry and lemon buttercream cake made by Khanna’s childhood friend, Monika Singh of Cali’s Creations bakery.

The couple doesn’t have a honeymoon planned (they say they were already too tired from planning the original wedding that was cancelled and the last-minute one). Instead they are getting ready to move from their current home in Leslieville to Old Town Toronto.

“Part of why we wanted to get our story out is because there’s a kid stuck at home, just looking for someone or a community to feel connected to,” Khanna said. “We’re hoping that it will give some hope to people who don’t feel a lot of hope right now.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Rachel Mendlesonstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Rachel Mendleson Is A Toronto-Based Investigative Reporter For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-21,"Ashley Comrie just wanted to go home.

It was late May, and the 37-year-old had just spent three terrifying weeks at Toronto General Hospital, fighting a COVID-19 infection that landed her in the intensive care unit, where she narrowly avoided intubation. Lying on her stomach, hooked up to oxygen, she had felt as if she were underwater, breathing through a straw. Death seemed a distinct possibility.

Now, with the worst of the disease finally behind her, Comrie’s doctors wanted to transfer her to an in-patient rehabilitation program created for people like her, who had survived COVID-19 but faced a long road to recovery.

Comrie was still on oxygen. She couldn’t bathe herself or walk unassisted. She was also having trouble concentrating and carrying on conversations.

But she missed her husband, who had suffered through his own coronavirus infection at home, alone. She was desperate to return to ordinary life.

It wasn’t until she was admitted to rehab at Bridgepoint hospital that she realized her healing had only begun.

Three weeks later, she is doing puzzles on an iPad, and starting to tackle stairs. She is amazed at her progress — and how much work lies ahead.

“I had no idea how much this part would be integral to my recovery,” Comrie said in a phone interview from her room at Bridgepoint. “As important as being in acute care and the ICU has been, this has been key.”

In the initial, frantic months of the pandemic, modern society was upended in the interest of saving lives. The economy was halted in a desperate bid to stop the spread, as hospitals scrambled to keep some of the sickest COVID-19 patients alive. So far, the disease has infected more than 100,000 people across Canada; roughly 8,400 have died.

The next phase carries its own set of challenges. As lockdowns ease and governments tentatively roll out their COVID-19 recovery plans, there are now thousands of survivors of the disease in Canada who are also in recovery.

Shortness of breath can linger for weeks, even after relatively mild bouts of COVID-19. Those hit with more serious infections, like Comrie, who is immunocompromised, have spent weeks in hospital, immobilized in bed, isolated from friends and family. Some have been hooked up to ventilators, and need support from a speech therapist to learn how to swallow, or sound like themselves again. The therapies are complex, and in some cases may be limited by the realities of the pandemic.

“I would hope that we could dispel the notion that if you survive COVID, you’re better right away,” said Dr. Larry Robinson, the chief of Sunnybrook hospital’s St. John’s Rehab Program, which also has a dedicated unit for COVID-19 patients.

“The way the public thinks about (COVID) is you get a cold. If you get a bad cold you go to the hospital, but then you’re OK,” said Robinson. “For many, it’s going to be a slow, slow recovery — in the months kind of range — before you get back to normal.”

There are still a lot of unknowns about the effects of COVID-19 on the body. But in Toronto, where several hospitals have hived off separate units for in-patient rehabilitation after serious bouts of COVID-19, those treating these patients say their needs can be complex.

Dr. Ashley Verduyn, chief and director of medical affairs at Providence Healthcare, a rehab hospital in Scarborough that has also set aside space for COVID-19 patients, said these patients “really benefit from a multidisciplinary program.”

Long stints in bed can rob people of the strength needed to perform even basic tasks, such as dressing and feeding themselves. And in some cases, these patients are also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from being in the ICU, or are mourning a loss.

“We’ve had patients who have lost their partner to COVID,” she said. “So not only are there physical challenges — like muscle weakness and deconditioning … They need a lot of psychological support as well.”

Verduyn said some patients also struggle with loss of memory and cognition.

“It is a very complicated rehab,” she said. “It’s not just doctors. It’s not just physio. It’s not just (occupational therapy) … Patients recovering from COVID really need everybody.”

When Joe Kotelniski, 83, arrived at Providence in late May, he was weak and delirious after several weeks in hospital, battling COVID-19. He wasn’t intubated, but still couldn’t get anything down besides purées.

“It was this place here that pulled me out of the quagmire and brought me back to my senses,” he said in an interview last week, the day before he went home. “My appetite is back. I could eat a horse if they put one up here.”

Laura Conway, the speech therapist at Providence who treated Kotelniski, said the muscles in the throat can become deconditioned, making it difficult to co-ordinate swallowing and breathing. To rebuild that strength, she said she asks patients to pretend they’re swallowing a ping pong ball.

“The best practice for swallowing is swallowing,” she said.

In some cases, patients who were intubated in hospital complain that their voices sound different — the result, perhaps, of damage to the larynx, caused when the tube is removed. Ordinarily, Conway said she would refer these patients to a specialist to assess the damage, but these consultations are on hold during the pandemic because voice problems are “not considered urgent.”

Where possible, health professionals providing rehab after COVID-19 are taking their cues from what they know about recovering from other illnesses. For instance, Robinson said that acute respiratory distress syndrome — which, like COVID-19, can affect other organs such as the heart and brain, and lead to intubation — is proving to be “not a bad model.”

“You have lost muscle mass,” he said. “You have lost some of your peripheral nerve function. You have lost some of your cognitive function.”

However, the big difference with COVID-19 is that because of strict and necessary social distancing measures in hospitals and rehab facilities, patients are battling illness and recovery alone.

“Patients get a little bit disoriented or delirious when they’re sick for that long,” Robinson said. “That’s usually offset by family visits and connecting with those who they know so well — their loved ones.

“A big part of rehabilitation is family teaching. So how do you take care of your loved one after they get home? But we can’t really do that.”

Predicting the size of the wave of patients requiring intensive rehab after COVID is difficult, in part, because it will depend largely on our adherence to physical distancing guidelines and other public health measures, and how long it takes to find an effective treatment or vaccine.

But estimates suggest the numbers will be substantial. In Greater Toronto, for instance, Dr. Mark Bayley, who is vice-chair of the GTA Rehab Network, projected that over the next year 300 to 800 patients would need rehab services after COVID-19, based on the number of infections and the rate of ICU admissions as of last month.

Although Bayley, the program medical director at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, is “worried about a second wave” of new infections in the fall, the drop in new cases in recent weeks suggests “our lower estimates are probably more reflective of the needs.”

Unlike in some COVID-19 hot spots in the U.S., where there are reportedly significant wait lists to access in-patient rehab, the doctors interviewed for this story said there is currently enough capacity in the GTA to provide in-patient rehab to those who need it.

However, some doctors expressed concerns about the availability of outpatient rehab during the pandemic, both for COVID-19 patients and for others living with disabilities.

And there are still a lot of unknowns.

“We don’t know what it’s going to look like in the future,” said Dr. Chris Fortin, the head of the physical medicine and rehabilitation division at Sinai Health System, which includes Bridgepoint.

“We’re going to have all these patients who’ve had serious illness, whose lives have changed because of COVID, and we don’t know what kind of services they’re going to need in the future, or how we’re going to co-ordinate their services to meet their needs.”

Trevor Annon, 59, is trying to remain optimistic. Like Comrie, Annon initially pushed back against the idea of in-patient rehab after his battle with COVID-19.

“But (I realized) I can’t move like this,” he said. “So I thought it was an opportunity to change my whole perspective.”

Annon, a musician, was sick before COVID-19, with a heart condition and another virus that left him with a cough he couldn’t shake.

Since arriving at St. John’s, he has sworn off meat, and has dedicated himself to a rigorous exercise program that includes squats, leg lifts and bicep curls. He said rehab has given him “a chance to reflect” and “make necessary changes.”

“I’m not saying I’ll never get sick,” he said, “but I’ll never have the baggage that I have right now.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Word was they had been cleared by health officials to perform outdoors at local establishments to entertain real, live guests.

Alas, after months of performing online for free for charitable causes during the pandemic, the singing microphones will stay shut off for now as the information about patio music was unclear — unless they are willing to perform instrumental music only.

A representative from the North Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit had erroneously given the thumbs up to live patio music in response to an inquiry from Matt Ouellette, a member of the local hospitality industry. What was not made clear in the exchange was the live patio music could not include singing or dancing.

The Health Unit clarified today, “Live instrumental music is permitted on outdoor restaurant and bar patios, provided musicians and patrons practice physical distancing protocols or if applicable, social circle recommendations.”

“It was an honest mistake,” says musician Gary Davison. “At first, when I saw a copy of Matt’s email, I was happy because musicians want to play and that was good news. Two days later, we hear from the same office and from (Medical Officer of Health) Dr. Chirico that there was no live music.”

Once the error was realized, the Health Unit responded, citing Ontario Regulation 263/20 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which clearly states, “No dancing or singing may be permitted in the outdoor dining areas.”

The Health Unit explains “respiratory droplets and aerosols generated during singing or loud speech may travel further than two metres. When dancing you may be more likely to breach personal space — coming closer than two metres to someone outside your social circle, and if you are singing while dancing the respiratory droplets and aerosols generated may travel further than two metres. Additionally, lowering the volume of live music is encouraged, as patrons may be more likely to breach personal space when leaning in to talk over loud music.”

The COVID-19 Health Unit Response Team also advises, “We do not have the capacity to monitor every person and business in our community to ensure everyone is following the COVID-19 safety guidelines. you can call the North Bay Police Service non-emergency line at 705-472-1234 to report your concerns.”

Ouellette, says he reached out for his “own knowledge and mostly so I could inform local musicians who are frustrated about it because some places have already been allowing live music.”

Davison says he does not want to speak for all musicians but says those he knows well were simply looking for some clarity on the matter and will abide by any health regulations in place.

“Everybody knows now there is no music allowed on outdoor patios, until further notice,” adds Davison. “It’s more a sense of disappointment, than anything.”

The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care maintains banning singing is based on science as the physical motions involved can lead to easier transmission of the virus. The provincial measures also prevent singing in child-care operations and place of worship.

“I can see the confusion. Somebody in the Health Unit made an error but with this pandemic, you learn as you go along. There’s going to be hiccups and mistakes,” observes Davison.

Despite the false hope, Davison knows North Bay’s talented patio performers will be in-tune and ready to play with any changes from the government allowing them to get back to work — and doing what they love most.

“Musicians are fine people, all artists are,” he says. “The pay isn’t very good. They do it because they love it, they love entertaining people and making people happy.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-06-20,"TULSA, OKLA.—In the city that bore witness to the Black Wall Street massacre of 1921, the twin epicentres of America’s seismic shift on justice, race and social disparity found themselves in close proximity Saturday as U.S. President Donald Trump slammed his stalled bid for a second term back into gear.

Supporters, undaunted by either the prospect of contracting COVID-19 or the possibility of clashes with Black Lives Matter protesters, poured into Tulsa’s fortified downtown core to see the man himself back in his element: blasting back with both barrels at his legions of political enemies and detractors.

But by the time Trump took the stage at the BOK Center, there were still vast tracts of empty seats in the upper deck, despite the president’s insistence that demand for tickets to see him kick off the “Great American Comeback” exceeded more than a million requests.

It didn’t slow him down much, though. Over the course of his nearly two-hour speech, Trump repeatedly pressed down — hard — on the open wound that has Americans taking to the streets in search of social justice.

“The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments ... tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands,” he declared.

“This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place.”

Following the president’s speech, tensions were high on the streets of Tulsa.

As supporters filed out of the building, a large group of several hundred protesters who were gathered not far from the BOK Center clashed briefly with police, who fired pepper balls into the crowd before organizers eventually managed to lead the group out of the area.

Trump also lingered, to great effect, on the media speculation about his health following his West Point commencement speech, which featured a tentative-looking, two-handed sip of water and his careful walk down what he described as a slippery ramp from the stage.

He was wearing leather-soled shoes and the ramp was treacherous, he insisted, pantomiming his crouched old-man walk for an appreciative crowd. And his arm had been tired from saluting graduates “600 times,” he said before quenching his thirst again — one-handed this time — and lobbing the glass to the ground.

The crowd erupted with delight.

“I just want him to know that we all still support him, even with all this craziness going around,” said Jonathan Johnson, 30, who made the 90-minute drive from Oklahoma City for the chance to see Trump in person.

“People need to open their eyes. He’s not as bad as people make him out to be, and they’ve just got to give him a chance. He’s gonna get four more years and we’re excited about it — Trump 2020, baby.”

Like many other rallygoers milling about the BOK Center, Johnson was unmasked and unconcerned about the prospect of catching COVID-19. So, too, was Gary Stanislawski, an Oklahoma state senator and devout Republican supporter of the president.

“We accomplished what I think the goal was, and that was to flatten the curve,” Stanislawski said.

“I still want to be smart, protect myself, watch for others — if there’s people who suddenly start coughing around me or something, we brought our masks, we’re ready to go. But no, I’m not concerned.”

It was clear, however, that the prospect for infection was real: the campaign confirmed Saturday that six members of its advance team in Tulsa had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. None of them, nor anyone who had contact with them, would attend the rally, a spokesman said in a statement.

The threat of infection didn’t seem to bother Johnson.

“I don’t think it’s as dangerous as what they make it out to be,” he said. “Not going to get one of those swabs, that’s for sure, I’ll tell you that much — heck, no.”

Inside, amid the familiar throb of a classic-rock soundtrack, fans waved signs, danced and erupted into cheers whenever they saw a familiar face: Eric Trump, the tag team known as Diamond and Silk or Mike Lindell, an entrepreneurial devotee of the president known to most Americans as “the My Pillow guy.”

Before the rally, one small group took up positions right inside the lion’s den: a street party where Trump supporters were gathered, clad in — and shelling out for — the usual assortment of pro-Trump memorabilia, including flags, T-shirts, “Make America Great Again” hats and even face masks and shields.

The interlopers silently brandished placards and Black Lives Matter messages as the Trump crowd milled about, largely uninterested. Nearby, a crowd gathered around two men at an Infowars kiosk as they took turns on the mic, insulting Democrats and mocking mask-wearing liberals.

“This is important,” said one of the protesters — a man wearing a Black Lives Matter flag as a cape who identified himself only as Ryan — when asked why the group chose such a provocative spot to set up camp.

“It’s no coincidence that Donald Trump chose the city of the Tulsa massacre to come and do this, on the weekend of Juneteenth, and we wanted to send a message.”

At one of the entrances, a woman wearing a shirt with the slogan “I Can’t Breathe” — George Floyd’s dying words when he was killed while being arrested on a Minneapolis street last month — was arrested by Tulsa police after sitting down in an area inside the security perimeter deemed to be private property.

Soldiers and police officers stood guard at every corner, and a two-metre steel barrier, the same used to ring the White House at the height of the protests earlier this month, circled a wide area around the arena. Many downtown streets were closed to vehicles — all the more room for Trump-friendly visitors and merchants to mingle.

10 p.m.: President Donald Trump suggested to supporters that he has told members of his administration to slow the rate of coronavirus testing in the United States.

Speaking at a campaign rally in Oklahoma, Trump said the U.S. had tested 25 million people, and far more than any other country. He also told the crowd that more testing leads to finding more cases of people who test positive.

“So I said to my people: Slow the testing down, please,” Trump said at the 19,000-seat BOK Center, which appeared to be roughly half full.

9 p.m.: Ontario’s public health units are reporting a total of 35,188 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,640 deaths, up a total of 180 new cases since Friday evening, according to the Star’s latest count.

In Toronto, the daily total of new cases fell again to just 53 as the rate of reported infections continues to fall sharply. For the last seven days, the city has seen an average of 76 cases reported each day; that average peaked less than a month ago at 230 cases daily for the seven days ending May 25.

Meanwhile, the city also reported a large uptick in reported deaths Saturday, mostly stemming from newly completed investigations into older cases. Of 25 fatal cases reported Saturday, 24 were from outbreaks that occurred between mid-April and mid-June, Toronto Public Health said.

Earlier Saturday, the province reported that 333 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 80 in intensive care of whom 63 are on a ventilator. All three totals are near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. The province also cautions its latest count of total deaths — 2,595 — may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system, saying that in the event of a discrepancy, “data reported by (the health units) should be considered the most up to date.”

The Star’s count includes some patients reported as “probable” COVID-19 cases, meaning they have symptoms and contacts or travel history that indicate they very likely have the disease, but have not yet received a positive lab test.

8:50 p.m.: Donald Trump pressed ahead Saturday night with a comeback rally amid a pandemic by declaring “the silent majority is stronger than ever before,” but what was meant to be a show of political force was instead met with thousands of empty seats and six new coronavirus cases on his campaign staff.

Ignoring health warnings, Trump scheduled the rally in Tulsa, Okla. It was intended to be the largest indoor gathering in the world during the outbreak that has killed more than 120,000 Americans, put 40 million more out of work and upended Trump’s re-election bid. But in the hours before the event at the 19,000-seat BOK Center, crowds seemed significantly lighter than expected. Campaign officials scrapped plans for Trump to speak at an overflow space.

Trump tried to explain away the crowd size, blaming it on the media.

8:40 p.m.: Los Angeles County public health officials reported 2,055 new cases of COVID-19 and 48 related deaths Saturday, marking the third-highest daily case count since the pandemic began. Officials attributed the high number in part to delays in lab reporting.

Long Beach, which has its own public health department, reported an additional 48 cases and two deaths, bringing the county’s total to more than 81,000 cases and more than 3,100 deaths.

7:30 p.m.: The number of Quebecers in hospital due to COVID-19 continues to drop as 33 new deaths were added to the toll in the province.

Authorities say 15 of the 33 deaths recorded Saturday occurred before June 12. The province’s death toll is now 5,408. Quebec health authorities also report 124 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total infected in the province to 54,674.

The province reports that 23,201 have recovered from the virus.

6:25 p.m.: The U.S. National Institutes of Health stopped two clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug that President Donald Trump promoted to treat and prevent the coronavirus, one because the drug was unlikely to be effective and the other because not enough patients signed up to participate.

The agency halted a trial that had aimed to enroll more than 500 patients after an independent oversight board determined that the drug did not appear to benefit hospitalized patients. The same day, the NIH said it had closed another trial — of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin — because only about 20 patients had enrolled in the planned study of 2,000 people.

4:50 p.m.: Swedish activist Greta Thunberg said she wasn’t too worried about the challenges the coronavirus pandemic has created for the climate change protests she began.

“A crisis is a crisis — and in a crisis, everyone needs to take a few steps back and act in the best interest of society and our fellow human beings,” the 17-year-old told Swedish radio’s P1.

People started acting as they should during the pandemic, she added.

Supporters of Thunberg’s Fridays for Future protest movement, which calls for action against climate change, have been unable to gather for months because of the pandemic and related measures to stop its spread.

9:19 a.m.: Zimbabwe’s health minister on Saturday was charged with criminal abuse of duty as a public officer, accused of illegally awarding a multimillion-dollar contract for COVID-19 testing kits, drugs and personal protective equipment to a shadowy company.

The country’s anti-corruption agency arrested Obadiah Moyo on Friday as the scandal roiled the country and played out on social media, where some local journalists exposed how Moyo allegedly chose the company to sell medical supplies to the government at inflated prices that included face masks for $28 each. The government cancelled the contracts following public uproar.

7:49 a.m.: The Cruise Lines International Association announced Friday that ships will not be sailing from U.S. ports throughout the summer, extending a pause put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The current no-sail order issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on March 14 is set to expire July 24. The association says cruise lines have decided to voluntarily prolong this pause until Sept. 15 because they need time “to resolve barriers” with U.S. authorities to restart sailing.

7:47 a.m.: The U.S. State Department says COVID-19 infections have been reported at its embassy in the Afghan capital and the staff who are affected include diplomats, contractors and locally employed staff.

The State Department did not say how many were affected. An official at the embassy in Kabul, who could not be identified because of not being authorized to talk to the media, said as many as 20 people were infected, the majority of whom are Nepalese Gurkhas, who provide embassy security.

7:45 a.m.: China’s capital recorded a further drop in coronavirus cases amid tightened containment measures, while Brazil surpassed 1 million confirmed infections, second only to the United States.

Europe, in contrast, continues to emerge warily from lockdown, with hard-hit Britain considering easing social distancing rules to make it easier for restaurants, pubs and schools to reopen.

Officials reported 22 new cases in Beijing on Saturday, along with five others elsewhere in China. There were no new deaths and 308 people remained hospitalized for treatment.

South Korea recorded 67 new cases, the largest 24-hour increase in about three weeks. Most of them come from the densely populated Seoul area, where about half of the country’s 51 million people reside. Many cases have been linked to exposure in nightlife outlets.

The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that the pandemic is “accelerating” and that more than 150,000 cases were reported the day before — the highest single-day number so far.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that nearly half of the newly reported cases were from the Americas, with significant numbers from South Asia and the Middle East.

7:37 a.m.: Pope Francis welcomed doctors and nurses from the coronavirus-ravaged region of Lombardy to the Vatican on Saturday to thank them for their selfless work and “heroic” sacrifice.

Francis dedicated one of his first post-lockdown audiences to Italy’s front-line medical and civil protection personnel, telling the delegation that their example of professional competence and compassion would help Italy forge a new future of hope and solidarity.

The northern region of Lombardy, Italy’s financial and industrial capital, was the hardest-hit region in the one-time European epicentre of the pandemic. Lombardy has counted more than 92,000 of Italy’s 232,000 official infections and half of the country’s 34,500 dead.

7:30 a.m.: Federal Conservatives have crusaded for a return to parliamentary business as usual but they’re opposed to the one thing Liberals and New Democrats insist is necessary to do that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: electronic voting.

Conservative House leader Candice Bergen says her party is suspicious of anything promoted by the Liberals that would keep most MPs out of the House of Commons and, in her view, help the government avoid accountability.

Besides, she says there are other options that would allow all 338 MPs to vote in person in the chamber while maintaining physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In a letter to Commons Speaker Anthony Rota earlier this month, Bergen suggested six different options, including having MPs line up in “yea” and “nay” queues in the courtyard space surrounding the chamber from where they could individually enter the Commons to have their votes recorded.

Friday 5 p.m.: After three consecutive days with fewer than 200 new COVID-19 cases, Ontario’s regional health units reported a slight increase in the number Friday, according to the Star’s latest count.

The health units reported a total of 35,008 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19, including 2,613 deaths, a rise of 206 new cases in 24 hours.

Despite the slight province-wide increase in the daily report, Toronto reported another day of falling cases, down again to just 54, the lowest total in a string of falling daily reports this month.

The city’s seven-day average for new cases, 81 per day, is now lower than at any time since April 4.

The city accounted for seven of the nine new fatal cases reported in the province Friday.

The province-wide rate of new deaths has been falling steadily since hitting a peak of 90 in a single day, in early May.

Earlier Friday, the province reported that 331 patients are now hospitalized with COVID-19, including 82 in intensive care, of whom 62 are on a ventilator. All three totals are now near the lowest the province has reported in data that goes back to early April.

The province says its data is accurate to 4 p.m. the previous day. It cautions its latest count of total deaths, 2,564, may be incomplete or out of date due to delays in the reporting system.

Read', 'Laurie Monsebraatensocial Justice Reporter', 'Social Justice Reporter', 'Laurie Monsebraaten Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Social Justice For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-20,"Working mother Stephenie Summerhill believed she had it all — until COVID-19.

And now, like millions of Canadian women who have been locked down at home with children for the past three months — and counting — she wonders if she will ever get her life back.

“I was born in 1977, the first generation of women who were raised for careers,” she says. “I prefer to work.”

But when her boss phones as her three-year-old is calling for help in the bathroom, “who do you choose?” asks Summerhill, 42, who suddenly found herself juggling her high-powered job in the non-profit sector with two sons under age six.

“I was trying to do a good job at work and trying to do a good job at home. And I was not doing a good job at either,” she says.

On April 24, she threw in the towel and took an unpaid leave.

She and her husband, a lawyer for a construction company, agreed she would be the one to step back from her career because he is the higher income earner.

“Unfortunately, it really comes down to who makes more money,” says Summerhill. “And it’s usually the men.”

As Canadian employment figures have confirmed, women were the first to lose their jobs when the country shut down in mid-March, accounting for almost 62 per cent of the newly unemployed. In May, as many provinces began to reopen, men were the first to return to work, gaining back jobs at roughly twice the rate of women, according to Statistics Canada.

The unprecedented fallout — a recession led by women’s job losses when tourism, restaurants and shops were shuttered to prevent the spread of COVID-19 — threatens to wipe out a generation of women’s economic and social gains.

Policy-makers of all political stripes, from Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Ontario Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford, have acknowledged the need to support women and women’s employment as the country slowly reopens.

Many economists say that means turning women’s marginal employment in the so-called “caring economy” into good jobs with higher wages and better working conditions. It also means getting serious about creating a pan-Canadian system of high-quality, universally accessible, affordable child care, a long-standing barrier to women’s employment and economic equity.

As economist Armine Yalnizyan has been saying for more than a month: “No recovery without a ‘she-covery.’ And no ‘she-covery’ without child care.”

But academics and women’s advocates say it will take more than catchy phrases to ensure patriarchy — the male-dominated status quo — and outright misogyny — hatred or prejudice against women and girls — don’t thwart the “she-covery” in the wake of COVID-19.

“It’s important for us to recognize that the concepts of patriarchy and misogyny that play out on a day-to-day basis, are not particularly visible or dramatic,” says Andrea Gunraj, vice-president of public engagement with the Canadian Women’s Foundation, the country’s only public foundation dedicated to women and girls.

Rather, these concepts are embedded in the way our societies are structured and in how we value and fund things, she says.

“Many people are challenging us to look at racism in the same systemic way,” she notes.

Along with housework, the caring work women do in the home for children and elders is largely unpaid, Gunraj says. The undervaluing of this work continues outside the home in child care, personal support and senior’s care.

The goal of the foundation and women’s advocates is to eliminate patriarchy and misogyny by using a gender-based analysis of policy and funding decisions that also includes “intersectionality,” or the interplay of race, culture, age, education, disability and other identities, Gunraj says.

“What we have seen is that the pandemic has deepened inequalities that were already there,” she says. “The same folks that were already on the margins are being pushed over the line.”

Trudeau, the first prime minister to ensure women MPs make up 50 per cent of his cabinet, has made so-called Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) a signature policy of his government.

“COVID-19 is a crisis unlike any other,” says a spokesperson for Maryam Monsef, federal minister for women and gender equality.

“It has hit women hardest with jobs lost and women taking on more unpaid work than they already were for their kids as well as their elders,” says Marie-Pier Baril.

“Women are the majority of those on the front lines of the fight against COVID. That includes nurses, of course, but also personal support workers, other health-care workers, child-care workers, food-sector workers and social workers.”

Ottawa is committed to applying a GBA+ lens to its COVID-19 emergency response measures and recovery efforts, she says in an email.

Data and evidence will be crucial, advocates say.

“The discussions I have had with parents is that because the female parent earns less, she is the one who has quit her job or is staying home now because there is no child care or it is unaffordable,” says Julia Smith, a research associate in the health sciences faculty at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.

Smith has just received a $500,000 Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant to co-lead an international study on the gender impact of COVID-19. The study is the first of its kind to look at the impact of pandemics on women and will include case studies in Canada, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and China.

“Women have told me quite candidly that when it comes to making these decisions, it’s just assumed by their partners, by their families, by the people they work with, that they will be the ones who give up work,” adds Smith, whose team has identified child care as an early ask.

Another area Smith would target for more public support is the non-profit sector, which is not only dominated by female workers, but provides important social services that support them.

Although it is a two-year research project, Smith and her team are posting their preliminary findings on a website in an attempt to impact decision-making now.

“I am quite encouraged by the response at the federal, provincial and municipal level here in Canada,” she says. “People want to know what the impacts are for various groups and really want to tailor their response accordingly.”

But too often, cost becomes a major stumbling block to advancing women’s equality.

For example, after Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government in 2018 committed to build a universal child-care system in Ontario by introducing free daycare for two- and three-year-olds, Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives axed the $2.2 billion program as part of his plan to slay the provincial deficit once they took power.

With Ottawa’s pandemic deficit expected to crest $250 billion, there will be calls to rein in spending, says economist Lindsay Tedds, an associate professor at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy.

But fighting deficits through austerity is “just the patriarchy being the patriarchy,” she says. “Austerity constricts and constrains economic growth.”

Targeted government spending is a much better way to grow the economy out of deficit, she argues. And instead of viewing spending as a cost, governments need to see the benefits.

Twenty years of research in Quebec shows spending on child care is especially beneficial, returning $5 to the province’s economic bottom line for every $1 invested through the ripple effect of more women earning, spending and paying taxes, Tedds says. And that doesn’t include the positive impact on child development and poverty reduction.

“If people say we can’t afford to pay for (child care), I’m saying, we can’t afford not to. It almost costs less — if you do it right,” she adds.

Child care is also essential to addressing the gender-pay gap, says Tedds, who notes European research shows men and women earn essentially the same until women begin taking time off work to have children. “And they never recover,” she says.

In 2018, Canadian women earned an average of 87 cents for every dollar earned by men.

But as Tedds and other academics argue, Canada also needs to improve the wages and poor working conditions of women in the caring economy.

“If we get more child care only to enable women to go back to jobs where they earn considerably less than men, then that’s inadequate,” says University of Manitoba sociology professor Susan Prentice.

“I am very heartened by the degree to which the gendered aspect of this economic crisis is being addressed,” says Prentice, who wrote her PhD thesis on women’s fight to keep wartime daycares open after the Second World War.

“But it’s got to tip into action.”

Toronto Coun. Joe Cressy, whose baby Jude was born just four months before the city went into lockdown, was instrumental in arranging free emergency child care for essential workers at the end of March. He says the model is one the province should emulate for all Ontario families.

“Here you have a singular moment where the provision of free child care for front-line workers — which has enabled us to withstand this pandemic — showed us a better path forward,” he says.

And yet with the province’s announcement earlier this month that child care would reopen with regular parent fees “we are immediately going back to what existed before, but worse.

“While there is a lot of excitement about the possibility of building a new and better normal, with each passing day in this province, it feels like we are going back to the status quo,” he says. “There is no better example of that than child care.”

One of the problems with child care is that no one level of government is responsible, Cressy says.

“Why is it so complicated to explain funding related to child care? Why is it so complicated to explain service agreements and the role of the province and the cities and the feds?

“Everybody can always point their fingers at someone else. It’s failure by design,” he adds.

To end the finger-pointing, Cressy thinks Ottawa needs to create a Canada Child Care Act, similar to the Canada Health Act that sets out a funding framework with principles to guide the provision of universal health care. If Ottawa funds it properly, provinces won’t be able to afford to say no, he adds.

Lawyer Kathleen Lahey, a gender equity scholar and Queen’s University Law School professor, says she hopes more men emerge from the pandemic with a clearer understanding of what raising children involves and get behind the push for more child care.

But child care would be just a start, she argues, noting more women in gender-neutral Norway work part-time than anywhere else in Europe, despite the country’s highly regarded universal child-care system.

“Why? Patriarchy raises its head. Because the norm is that women take care of kids. It’s these really deep structural things that have to change,” she says.

“But they can change. People are working on it all around the world,” adds Lahey, who is involved in several international research projects on women’s equality.

Some advocates are focused on addressing the unequal sharing of housework and child rearing in the home and starting to empower women there, she says.

“Some people are saying, let’s rip the lid off ... income inequality. Others are looking at gender equality from an (environmental) perspective. And some are tackling it as part of the anti-poverty movement,” she says.

Increasingly, these large groups are converging.

“Women’s equality is increasingly understood to be ... an intersectional movement where if you don’t bring in everyone who needs a better life, then you aren’t going to make it.

“It’s going to be all groups together seeing what patriarchy and concentration of wealth has done to governments and to more vulnerable groups,” she adds.

Since leaving her job, Summerhill has poured herself into making life livable. She has set up Lego tables and crafts in the living room for her sons and has created a “kids’ paradise” in the backyard with a sandbox, water table and slide off the deck.

Her fear, however, is that she doesn’t know how long the lockdown will go on, if her daycare and school will reopen, if her job will still be there and if she will be able to go back to work under whatever the “new normal” looks like.

“At what point do I get to think about me again? At 50? I’m really struggling,” she says, her voice catching with emotion.

“My husband is trying to be supportive. But I’m just angry.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

National Defence says troops deployed to long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec and others will be paid an extra $78 per day.

The military says the Exceptional Hazard Allowance is retroactive to when they started their duties and will be in effect until Sept. 30.

National Defence says these Forces members face the physical hardship of spending all of their shifts wearing full personal protective equipment for up to 12 hours a day.

It says many have served in these facilities for months while being away from their families during a highly challenging time.

The military estimates that about 4,500 troops will be eligible to receive the extra pay.

“From the earliest days of the pandemic, our troops stepped up, as they always do, despite the risk to their own health and safety,” Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Friday in a release.

“This Exceptional Hazard Allowance is one way we can recognize the significant efforts and risks faced by Canadian Armed Forces members, who have worked hard to keep our family members and loved ones safe during this challenging time.”

I’ve been in a happy second marriage for ten years, with a son, age nine, and a daughter, age seven. But I’m shocked at how my older children have become extremely “entitled” in their attitudes, and lazy.

They live with me and their stepmother half the time. Neither she, their mother, nor I raised them toward the self-centred, unhelpful, uncaring manner they’re both now displaying.

Yet, many of their friends who also came home from college due to the coronavirus lockdown here, started working on or creating useful projects … e.g. helping out at a food bank, making and selling masks for only the cost of their materials, etc.

When I suggested that my older kids get involved with something useful, they flat-out said they just wanted to hang out or be in the backyard pool once it opened.

I’m now back at work, and so is my wife. Now, these older kids want to have their friends over to the pool when we’re not home, and insist they’ll “look after” the young ones and still keep social distance. But they’ve shown no sense of responsibility so far.

Meanwhile, I have a father who’s seriously health-compromised, for whom I must bring food weekly, but I get no offers of help.

How do I deal with behaviour so unlike all that I’ve taught them in the past about responsibility and respect?

Fed-Up Father

A: With their college lifestyle interrupted by the pandemic, these early-adults were forced (like many others) to return to moving between two homes and two parents’ somewhat different lifestyles, plus young half-siblings in at least one of the scenes.

Rather than rise to the needs of others, they both responded by feeling put-upon.

They needed firm direction with definite expectations — e.g. each preparing a family meal once a week, taking up a useful task such as baking bread, etc.

They also needed to feel welcome at home, even if their presence was an interruption.

Now is the time for parents and kids alike to talk openly with concern as well as caring, not time to throw up your hands as their father.

Start from a base of working together … they want “freedom” from the former pandemic stresses. You want freedom from worrying about pool parties getting out of hand, and about everyone’s safety.

Discuss making a deal with safety, not distrust, as the main element: example, the pool is available only after one homeowner returns, but only to a specific and limited number of guests.

If trust is broken, the pool gets drained and everyone suffers.

Be clear that you will do this, even though it punishes all, unfairly. It may be the most meaningful lack of entitlement for only them vs. family cohesion, that they can understand.

Q: After the lockdown started, my ex-girlfriend sent a text saying she was bored, and I must be too, so why not have a little action together like the “good old days.”

It was a good tease, except that we broke up when I found her cheating with my workmate and dumped them both.

What makes people think they can hurt you deeply, then reel you back in whenever they want?

Making something is a great way to escape the stresses of everyday life, helping to distract you — even if just for a few minutes — from the reality of living in the midst of a pandemic.

Crafts like knitting keep our hands and minds busy and can be therapeutic, says Amelia Lyon, who owns Yarns Untangled, a knitting shop in Kensington Market.

It’s not uncommon for customers to come into the shop looking for ways to relax and de-stress, says Lyon, who has had customers stop in because a therapist or friend prescribed it. “It can help relax you, the repetitive action of your hands, the same one or two stitches over and over. Some days I get wound up and I realize it’s because I haven’t knit in a little while. I pick up my needles and calm right down.”

From knitting to folding origami or updating old furniture with paint, here are some crafts to help you pass the time and feel a little more relaxed — using stuff you probably have at home or can easily get at a local shop with curbside pickup.

Keep little hands occupied with origami

All you need is paper and a little patience to make simple origami creations. There are countless shapes to fold paper into; the paper crane may be the most well-known design of the age-old Japanese art. It’s a great craft to keep kids entertained and, as an added bonus, it requires minimal materials and makes very little mess.

Any type of paper can be cut into a square and used to fold origami, says Jocelyn Tamura, a student at the University of Toronto and member of UTFold, an origami club whose community projects include an origami program at the Hospital for Sick Children. Origami is a way for patients to relax, says Tamura, who hosts workshops that patients and their families can attend before or after appointments.

“It requires focus and distracts from any other thoughts or worries related to their hospital visit; it’s similar in some ways to meditation,” says Tamura. “Instead of focusing on the breath, we focus on the folds of the paper. It’s surprised me how much it can help young children, who may start off in a bad mood and leave far happier and calmer.”

If you don’t have origami paper on hand, it’s easy to make your own squares. A typical A4 size sheet of paper works perfectly. Help younger children get started by cutting paper into squares and try models beforehand to make sure the difficulty level is appropriate. Tamura recommends choosing simple models like animals and paper airplanes to start.

There are lots of how-to videos online but, for inspiration, look to Oriland, an online paper fantasyland of origami creations run by internationally recognized artists Katrin and Yuri Shumakov from Toronto. Learn origami, find 70-plus free design diagrams and instructions on basic folds. The couple have written over 30 books about origami and created more than 800 unique designs. Find supplies at the Paper Place.

Jump on the dried flower trend

It’s no secret that flowers are a great pick-me-up, but fresh flowers don’t last forever, which could be one of the reasons dried flowers are making a comeback.

“Dried flower arrangements now make up about one-third of our business” says Shannon Whelan, a floral designer and owner of Euclid Farms in Toronto. “The idea of buying something that you can enjoy, and will also dry and last, definitely makes sense,” says Whelan. “If a bouquet doesn’t sell I can hang them upside down and dry them.”

It’s easy to do yourself. All you need are fresh flowers and string. After you’ve enjoyed the flowers, tie string around the stems and hang them upside down so they are spaced apart. Keep them out of direct sunlight and humidity, and leave them to dry until the base of the flower head is strong and brittle, about two to four weeks.

A good rule of thumb is to choose blooms with a woody stem and avoid flowers that hold a lot of water, like tulips, which have thick, watery stems that won’t dry well and end up mouldy, says Whelan. Opt for heartier stems like roses, hydrangea varieties like Annabelle, or eucalyptus.

Get creative arranging dried blooms in vases, jars or other containers that you have around the house. A quick search online will yield project ideas and video tutorials, from making a wreath to something as simple as filling a cloche with leftover dried flower heads. “People are buying gold hoops to use as wreath frames and only decorating one small portion of it, and it becomes this really interesting hanging element,” says Whelan.

Learn how to knit

Anyone can learn to knit, says Lyon of Yarns Untangled, which offers small-run, hand-dyed yarn suited to Toronto’s knitting and crochet community. “I have yet to find somebody that I can’t teach to knit, if they want to learn. It just takes the right combination of tools and the right teacher, video or instruction,” says Lyon, who learned to knit as a child.

Beginners should learn the basics by focusing on smaller projects like a mug cosy or coaster, before moving on to bigger projects like a sweater or blanket, says Lyon. “A lot of people start with a scarf, but these days we’ve been gently steering people away from that, because they take a really long time. The beginning of your project is going to look like you were learning, but by the end it will look smooth.”

Stick to an acrylic blend yarn when starting out; it’s inexpensive and a basic approachable material, says Lyon. She also steers beginners away from traditional straight needles to circular needles, which are more versatile and just as easy to use.

While the shop’s classes have been cancelled and weekly stitch nights have moved online due to COVID-19, Lyon recommends online for how-to videos or books. “Once you know the basic stitch, you can make a scarf, a hat, all kinds of different things.”

Use paint to transform old furniture

Spring is a good time to get outside and start a paint project. Whether it’s an old chair or table in need of sprucing up, or painting terracotta pots — perfect for the kids — painting can be a relaxing and satisfying DIY.

“It’s wonderfully soothing to pick up a paintbrush,” says Annie Sloan, an artist and inventor of Chalk Paint by Annie Sloan. Her first flagship shop opened its doors in Toronto last spring.

“Finding a creative outlet can make a huge difference to one’s well-being during these worrying times. If you are able to get your hands on a tin, then now’s the time to start painting those walls or transforming a piece of furniture,” says Sloan.

If you’ve got a little leftover paint from a past project, try adding a stripe or two to jugs and vases, or stencil trays and tables: the simplest splashes of colour and pattern can breathe fresh life into your home and can also be a great way to keep children occupied.

Get creative with some fruit and vegetable printing. “It’s not just for potatoes,” says Sloan. “Try using some lemons, limes, peppers, okra or whatever you have available in the kitchen, to add some fun prints to napkins or an old tablecloth.”

Read', 'Debra Norton Special To The Starthu.']",2020-04-09,"Two years ago, clothing designer Kate Theriault was at home healing from an injury and needed something to occupy her hands and mind, so she turned to sashiko – the centuries old Japanese art of mending.

“In that moment, when I knew I needed to mend myself, I was looking around for something to do, and sashiko came back to me,” says Theriault who had taken a sashiko workshop a couple of years before. “I was mending myself, my garments and I started to think, what else could I mend in my life?” says Theriault, a life-long sewer who teaches mindful mending and sashiko workshops in Guelph, Ontario, and sells sashiko supplies at her online shop Cedars + Sage.

Even if you’ve never heard of sashiko, which translates as “little stabs,” you may be familiar with the look which includes bold geometric patterns hand-stitched with white thread onto indigo dyed fabric. It’s a type of mending that is meant to be seen.

The technique originated in rural, northern Japan about 400 years ago to mend and patch clothes, extending the life and increasing the warmth of worn garments with added layers of cloth.

Today, visible mending is also an antidote to fast fashion – enabling crafters to mend rips, tears and general wear of clothing and other textiles, and it’s having a revival.

“We are becoming more conscious of our impact on the earth. This is a way to lesson our impact, to not throw away things, to keep them and avoid buying more,” says Theriault. “I also feel that anything that is working with our hands is having a bit of a revival right now.”

Toronto maker Stacey Sproule has seen a surge of interest in the craft since she started teaching visible mending classes in 2015. Classes would get cancelled, rarely selling out, but in the last year or so, she says every class has sold out.

“My workshops are aimed at getting you ready to feel empowered to start fixing your clothes. But I think that to say that you have to do this because it’s pragmatic is not enough, it’s visually satisfying too – it’s good for the planet and also beautiful – it’s a win-win,” says Sproule.

The craft appeals to everyone from sewers to people who haven’t worked with a needle and thread at all and makers such as Sproule say that the craft appeals to all ages – from younger people in their mid-twenties to the elderly.

Locally, the craft is taking off with shops such as The Make Den on Sterling Rd. and The Workroom on Queen St. offering workshops and classes.

Mending forces us to slow down.

Judith Martin is a Canadian textile artist from Manitoulin Island who uses naturally dyed thread and cloth to create hand stitched quilts. “Stitching the quilts makes me feel good,” says Martin. “I do this repetitive motion with my hands and run my hands over this beautiful texture that I’ve made, I feel better, I slow down and I think about things that come into my head and solve problems.”

Craft enthusiast Julie Cathro-Silver, took a sashiko workshop after noticing it had become trendy. She’s still working on mending the jeans she started and during this period of social distancing has started working on them again. “I’ve always found creativity to be therapeutic, with Sashiko mending, it’s the same thing — sitting with a project, even when my skills aren’t great, feels good, peaceful, and calming … the tactile nature of sewing is something that is very therapeutic to me, especially when the world is in full blown chaos.”

Although there are rules around sashiko, such as: the size of stitch (¼ inch, which works out to be the same size as a short grain of rice), the size of the spaces in between, stitches must be done in an order — all the horizontal lines and then all the vertical lines no matter how intricate your pattern. There is a lot of mindful thought in how you prepare to stitch but “the stitch itself – a running stitch, is the most basic stitch you can do,” says Sproule. “I’ve never had anyone throw up their arms and say I can’t do this.”

Basically, all you need is a needle and thread to get started. The idea is that you’re gathering several stitches of material onto a needle and then pulling it through, rather than going up and down, so a long needle is helpful. “But you can still do it with any needle,” says Sproule. “It’s just going to feel a little bit different.” If you can’t get hold of sashiko needles, long darner needles also work, and although 100 per cent cotton Japanese floss works best, in a pinch, you could use embroidery floss. When tackling a mending project, she recommends starting with woven materials such as cotton, linen or denim.

“I like to talk about it as feeling empowered to repair the things that you love. Nothing is hopeless. It’s a meditation on hope in some ways,” says Sproule.

Arts and crafts are often a go-to activity for parents and whether that includes a box of crayons and a sheet of paper or something more complex, the experience of taking a moment to create something can also offer a little bit of comfort in these uncertain times.

“Making space for creativity is transformative,” says Heather Phillips, owner of Articulations an art store in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood. “We’ve always been big believers in daily creativity. Just taking the time to be present in the moment and create something is important for your well-being.” Phillips says she could sense the collective uncertainty in the community and a lot of idle hands, so she decided to do something to help parents. In just a few days, the store created, packaged and distributed 120 Stay Home Art Kits to give to families for free or by donation.

“We couldn’t offer any programs because we all have to stay home so we thought it would be nice to just share the items that we have. Whatever we had in the studio, we packaged them up into bite-sized pieces that parents could share with their kids,” says Phillips, who advertised the project on social media. “The response was insane, as soon as I posted the information online, the appointment slots quickly sold out.”

The kits were made up of a combination of used and new materials that the shop had accumulated from running children’s art programming over the past eight years, and included materials to create crafts such as hand puppets, paper weaving, acrylic painting and card making kits.

Phillips says that there are lots of crafts that you can do with materials around the house, including the recycling bin – such as painting cardboard boxes, using Styrofoam containers to make stamps or creating a family time capsule as a snapshot of this unique time together.

Here are 7 crafty activities that will help keep little hands busy and can be ordered online from local shops or downloaded for free.

Toronto artist Lindsay Stephenson created a series of free colouring sheets that can be downloaded from her shop The Penny Paper Co.

Stephenson says she finds the act of colouring meditative not only for her but also her 9-year old son Oscar. “It’s amazing how quiet the room goes as everyone focuses on their own sheets.”

Go ahead, let the kids draw on the walls with a giant colouring poster that can be hung on a wall or placed on the floor. Kids can colour and doodle to their hearts content. Order online from the Roncesvalles neighbourhood shop Early Bird & Worm - have it shipped or if you live locally, take advantage of the free porch drop-off. Giant Colouring Poster, $22.

Cross Stitching is a great hands-on craft for kids. With only one basic stitch to master, it’s a great introduction to embroidery. Stitching helps them to hone fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination and because it uses a blunt-end embroidery needle, it’s not as sharp as a sewing needle. The colourful over-the-rainbow cross stitch kit from Diana Watters Handmade is a fun starter project that includes everything they need to get started making a rainbow keychain or backpacker charm. Over the Rainbow Cross Stitch Kit, $22.

Adrian Ocneanu and Britta Evans-Fenton of Low Poly Crafts, create a line of pre-cut, pre-scored ready to assemble paper kits to DIY your own geometric wall art. They are offering free, downloadable projects that families can print at home and work on together. Ocneanu says that after sending a few kits to quarantined family members living in Italy, they realized how important it was to have something to fill their time. “That made me realize that our work is more meaningful now, in these times of social distancing, yet not everyone is aware of us or able to purchase our products.” So, they created a line of small print-at-home “Stay Safe, Craft Away” kits, and although the projects are generally meant for adults or older kids - the free, printable kits allow for a lot of trial and error and keep little, crafty hands busy and out of trouble.

I grew up during so-called sexual freedom since birth control pills and other pregnancy prevention methods were easily available.

Some of my friends started having sex in their early teens. I had my first experience at 17, with a boyfriend I liked but certainly didn’t love.

The first half of my 20s were about experimenting. I didn’t like dope, but did like wine. Sex with a good-looking guy who treated me nicely was great!

Now, at 41, everything’s changed, at least in me. I have children, a boy of 12, a girl, 14. Their father has a girlfriend and though they think she’s nice, they find it difficult to see them hugging and kissing.

No way can I be that dating Mom who almost dances out the door on the arm of a man my kids don’t know, laughing too loudly at something “he” said.

(That’s how my daughter described a scene from a TV show that she said was “yucky.”)

Everyone says that dating online is the only way to meet a lot of guys and choose whom you want. But how can I be honest with my very curious, smart children if they ask me how I met someone new?

I feel like I’m a throwback to the mode of how my mother’s dating life must’ve been: Meeting someone at their mutual workplace, or the library, or church.

In fact, my ex and I met at our mutual workplace.

So how does a freedom-loving child born in 1981, who enjoyed the “entitlement” years of the millennial generation, now find a comfortable, responsible approach to single life and dating?

Specifically: How do I date in a way that I’m not embarrassed for my children to know about?

Fresh-Start Dater

A: Good for you for considering your kids first.

They’ve already had to adjust to their father’s relationship, and they’ll adjust to your dating, too, if you maintain your priorities.

Wisely, you haven’t rushed to dating apps or a dating site too soon.

But there’s no reason (outside of the pandemic’s restrictions) to miss being with friends and meeting new people with whom you share interests.

The availability through Zoom and other online platforms to join a gathering, and/or broaden your knowledge of something through a webinar, is a perfect start to “socializing.”

And after months of social isolation and home-school, it’s healthy for your children to see you enjoying a wider community online.

That exposure may initiate dating someone whom you meet online because you already have something in common.

Once you connect with someone, if a date is suggested, be open about how new this feels for you and how you want a slow introduction — e.g. taking a walk together.

If another date is going to happen, talk to your kids about it right away. Explain that it’s a very early friendship and you’re going to take time getting to know him.

Keep it simple, and open to the kids: e.g. a visit in a park nearby where the children can see you and get to you if they feel the need.

If there’s a negative reaction, discuss it with them immediately and reassure them that this is only a new friend for you, someone to talk together and share some ideas.

If there’s a more worrisome reaction, talk to a therapist yourself and if considered necessary, bring the children into the process.

We dated exclusively after just one month then, due to COVID, moved in together.

I could work from home, but he lost his job and was very bored, so picked up his photography hobby. He already had a lot of equipment at home.

He constantly takes pictures of me: when I’m just waking up, even when I’m asleep.

He snaps me in different sitting or lying down positions when I least expect it. He even tries to pose me when I’m in the midst of doing my work.

I’m glad that he got busy with an interest, but I’m a little uncomfortable as to what he’s done or is planning to do with all those pictures.

I’m often complimented on my figure, so I’m not being conceited when I say that I wonder if some of those wake-up or sleeping shots of me are suggestive.

If I’d been asked and agreed to that kind of photography, it’d be one thing. But he just shot whatever he wanted while I was focused on work.

I think I can trust him fully, but something’s niggling the back of my mind. I don’t want to accuse him of anything and cause a big fight.

How do I ask if he’s used me for selling soft porn?

Am I His Girlfriend or Model?

A: Just ask. What’s pestering your mind is doubt.

You haven’t mentioned whether he was eligible for government assistance during the pandemic. If he’s not, and yet seems to have income, it could be a factor troubling you.

You moved in together during very early dating. Your unasked questions about something so personal show that trust isn’t a firm factor in this still-new relationship during unusual circumstances.

Maybe he just finds you a delightful subject for photography. Or maybe there’s more to it.

But, as partners in a relationship, if you can’t inquire what he’s done, or plans to do, with so many close-up camera portraits of you, then trust IS missing.

My brother (married with two kids) lives with my parents in Europe. He’s abusive to his wife, has a violent relationship with my father.

He won’t move out, won’t get therapy, won’t admit to any wrongdoing. He blames everyone for the failings in his life, especially my parents.

I told him to seek therapy. He shamed me.

His explosions occur frequently. I fear for my mom’s life (she’s 71), how long she can take it. I fear my brother harming himself or someone else. I fear the terrifying hate between him and my father.

How to Help My Brother?

A: Try to help those caught in the middle of this terrifying hatred.

Contact the mental health resources in the country and area where your parents’ home is located.

Explain the volatile danger facing everyone there, including two children.

Ask for confidentiality assurance regarding the authorities not informing the women and kids, who’d be at further risk if suspected of reporting the situation.

Seek whatever help’s available, plus learn the laws regarding when authorities can intervene. Stay in close, private contact with your mother.

If things worsen, try to convince her to find safety elsewhere (quickly and also privately) along with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren.

Each time my stepson pushes for “more” relaxation of the lockdown (parties in the yard, haircuts, etc.), we’ve asked him to wait and explained why.

He then becomes rude, threatening and disrespectful to my husband.

I feel that if he wants to live like an adult making his own choices he should move out into his own place, which he can afford.

It’s causing great stress in our marriage and I don’t know how much more I can take. It’s also beginning to affect my physical and mental health. I feel unsafe in my own home, always wiping down everything, yet have no say.

Is it wrong to feel that we, as the true adults in the home, have a right to only move into Phase 2 at our comfort level?

What rights do these young adults have, making decisions that could be risky for others who are more vulnerable in our bubble?

They’ve been able to get out for walks and runs, have backyard visits to their other sets of parents, go for drives …

We’re just pleading with them to stay home as much as possible.

I know that I’ll have to re-emerge into this new world but feel that, given resurgences in the states that have opened too quickly, I’d rather wait this out a little bit longer.

I believe that my husband and I should have the right to make that decision in our own home.

Who Should Rule Our Home?

A: These are not kids, but they’re acting like spoiled teenagers avoiding any responsibilities.

They’re old enough to care for, and can afford, a home that they can rent together.

Your stepson’s been rude and thoughtless, taken advantage of his father and your joint hospitality to both him and a boyfriend you two hardly knew.

They’ve demonstrated no gratitude, offered no help and argued against your efforts to protect your elderly parents.

Whatever kept your stepson distant from you in the past, you’ve accommodated him long enough during the unusual demands of a pandemic.

His father also needs to tell his son, kindly but firmly, that it’s clear that he is ready for a great deal more say in how he lives.

And the natural and logical way for that to happen is by moving to his own home.

No other choice, no further indulgence, no more needless strain on your marriage during a time that’s stressful enough when aged parents’ lives need protection.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-01-09,"This story is part of a week-long series on dieting in 2020. Next up: Dieting and social media.

With a new year comes new trends. But when it comes to diet culture, a quick scan of the glossy magazines at grocery store checkouts shows how much we prize the dramatic weight loss story.

But just what effect does all this diet talk have on children?

Sarah Landry — known as @thebirdspapaya to her over 814K Instagram followers — has been vocal in her efforts to change how we talk about and display the diversity of the human body.

Landry, who lives outside of Toronto, went through a transformation several years ago, losing roughly 110 pounds in the span of a few years, ultimately dropping to an unhealthy weight for her — 114 pounds — and a size zero.

It wasn’t until she reached her “goal weight,” that she realized she wasn’t happy, nor was she healthy.

People were still congratulating her, even after she lost even more weight because of stress and life circumstances.

“I began to realize how many red flags there were toward diet culture and disordered eating,” says Landry. “It was unhealthy ... It was almost impossible to maintain (my weight) with how little I could eat and how much I had to exercise to stay that weight.”

She was obsessively calorie counting, weighing herself multiple times a day, and exercising out of guilt and fear around food and weight gain.

The mother of three wanted to set a better example for her children, especially her two daughters, Jemma, 11 and Maya, 13.

“It bothered me when my daughter, Jemma, was speaking about me and said to me something like ‘People love you for your weight loss,” said Landry.

And yet, her transformation story and her powerful posts on Instagram about accepting her body, landed her dedicated followers, magazine covers and media attention.

As she struggled with where the weight loss ended and she began, she worried what affect this behaviour was having on her kids.

“I can’t control TV and how inclusive it is but I can control the words that come out of my mouth and the conversations we have at home, and it starts with how I talk about myself and what I’m proud of,” Landry said.

After Jemma commented about the praise her mom receives, Landry made immediate changes, starting in their home. “There’s no diet culture talk allowed at home. We’ve gotten rid of scales in the house. I don’t want there to be this defining moment for them that they have a number. I want to continue to have a redirection of conversation and a change in the ways we talk about our bodies and ourselves,” said Landry.

Kyla Fox, clinical therapist and an eating disorder specialist, tells the Star that kids are sponges to their surroundings and are acutely attuned to their caregivers and their environment.

“The ways you feel about food and your body will be a mirror for your children. More of the work is on caregivers to heal themselves and their ideologies around food and their body in order to influence a positive relationship for their children,” says Fox. “If you don’t believe in the messages you’re hoping to instill like, ‘everything in moderation,’ ‘beauty from the inside out,’ ‘love the skin you’re in,’ neither will your kids.

Fox who has two young daughters, struggled with an eating disorder when she was younger and noticed care gaps and fundamental flaws in the treatment and recovery approach, which is why she developed The Kyla Fox Centre, a clinical and holistic eating disorder centre in Toronto.

The language we use within the house around food affects kids from a young age so it’s important to be mindful about talking about healthy dietary habits, she said.

But how can parents change the conversation to have a positive effect on their kids?

“To feel healthy is to learn how to live healthier. Perhaps the conversation is more about that. Mom wants to live her best life, feel stronger, happier, safer, share feelings more easily, take up more space in the world, go after what matters, listen in to her body more, understand what makes her feel full,” said Fox. “If we lived in a world where there was more open and honest communication about how to really feel healthy, we would be tapping in way deeper to ourselves and to each other.”

While parents can monitor language at home, they can’t control external forces that play on a child’s insecurities. This includes comments by other children or things they see on social media. Fox says a parent should be attentive to a child’s behaviour and address issues as soon as they are noticed. Is your tween reading calories on labels and selecting the item with a few less? If so, this is an opportunity to educate, have a deeper conversation to discover the root of why they’re behaving this way.

“The relationship your child develops with their body is an articulation of the way your child feels about themselves. And so being emotionally filled up — emotionally communicative, emotionally able to process, emotionally validated, emotionally supported — means that a child will be less likely to take out their feelings on their body through food. People who love themselves don’t hurt themselves,” said Fox.

“The only way to actively support others is to not hide behind your concerns, but address them. ‘Hey, I noticed you’re doing these things now that you didn’t do before, are you OK? Why do you think you have started this? Know that I’m here for you and want to be able to talk honestly.’ Opening up space for a bigger, safer conversation is key to bringing someone’s suffering/rituals/preoccupations forward,” said Fox.

Jemma now has an Instagram account of her own, bearing witness to her mom’s positive messaging, affirmations and body empowerment.

“As parents we can get so caught up being distracted by our bodies that we forget how many amazing things are going on around us,” Landry said.

Instead of asking your partner or friends whether an outfit makes you look fat, or asking how many calories are in something, or constantly complaining about having to lose 10 more pounds — all which create a negative dialogue for children — share what you love about yourself, she said.

Landry suggests “being mindful about how we speak about ourselves, and reminding each other to not comment on others bodies, when it comes up.”

Most importantly, don’t speak poorly about yourself, she said.

It’s not easy to learn to do but “When you take that out of the picture, you can connect more fully. More completely,” said Landry.

“I’m proud I got to change my own tune and have (my kids) be witness to it,” she said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What’s the first thing everyone does when they set out to lose weight? Join the gym.

That might be an important symbolic gesture. And it’s certainly good for other reasons. But it’s probably not going to help you lose a lot of weight, despite what most of us think. That message is starting to get out there, thanks, in part, to internet advice suggesting we put less stock in exercise to lose weight. Or, as the clickbait headlines put it, “Stop exercising to lose weight.”

The headlines might be misleading (we’ll get to that), but they are getting more people to face a certain reality: We burn way fewer calories than we think we do, even with a rigorous workout.

“It breaks down to the fact that it’s really hard to exercise enough to make a really big caloric deficit,” says Dr. Jennifer Kuk, associate professor at York University’s Faculty of Health. “When you look at shows like The Biggest Loser, people have to quit their jobs and exercise all day to get into the thousand calories of energy expenditure range, which is what you need for fast and dramatic weight loss.”

And, despite the fact that many of us have fitness apps on our phones and wrists, few of us are really thinking about what our calorie expenditures really mean—when translated into food. We have a tendency to over-estimate what we burn and underestimate what we consume and, as a result, some people over-compensate for lost energy by indulging in an over-the-top post-workout binge that’s three or four more times what they just lost. Stories of marathon runners who gained weight while training (often from sugary beverages) surface pretty regularly, demonstrating that even so-called “extreme athleticism” doesn’t give people a carte blanche to eat anything they want.

“We are so much better at eating back the calories than we are at exercising,” says Dr. Kuk, “I used to work in fitness clubs that had those organic healthy stores with the shakes and the cookies and I would see people on the treadmill, then see what they consumed afterwards. I guarantee you they more than doubled the number of calories they burnt.”

That doesn’t mean we should give up or cut back on exercising, though. Dr. Kuk, whose research is on obesity, diet and physical activity, says benefits transcend weight loss, and is alarmed that some people might be getting the wrong idea from online headlines.

“I know where that advice comes from,” she explains, “Basically there have been studies that have looked at different doses of exercise and divided people into three groups, thinking that the groups that did the most exercise would lose more weight. Instead, there was a tapered effect and the people doing the most exercise lost less than what you might expect. They actually did a little bit worse than the group below them.”

Dr. Kuk says that study started a debate about exercise and its relationship to weight loss, noting that it’s still unclear whether or not surpassing the “threshold of vigorous exercise,” really makes us eat more. Another interpretation, for example, could be that, having really gone to town at the gym, people are more likely to give themselves the rest of the day off—and fail to burn the calories they normally would. Either way, some clinical studies working on reversing Type-2 diabetes have actually discouraged subjects from increasing exercise while trying to lose weight.

Of course, this all assumes you’re exercising to lose weight. There are a lot of other reasons to hit the gym, advises Dr. Jason Fung, a well-known Toronto diet doctor and author of the forthcoming The Obesity Code Cookbook.

“I always say it’s like brushing your teeth,” says Dr. Fung. “It’s good to do it everyday so you’ll have better breath and fewer cavities, but don’t expect it to help you lose weight. It’s the same with exercise. You’re going to get benefits, but weight loss is something that’s really very inefficiently done by focusing on the exercise.”

Dr. Fung says we should think of diet and exercise as two separate things, with exercise playing a very small supporting role in weight loss. Instead, we should focus our energies on eating less and eating better food. “Willpower is sort of a finite resource,” he says, “So if you’re spending all your willpower on getting up and running, even when you don’t want to, you’re going to have less strength to avoid the foods that are testing you, like the donuts that are sitting in front of you at the Tim Hortons.”

So maybe keep on exercising, just maybe stop exercising to lose weight. Instead, he suggests we exercise to improve flexibility and/or become stronger. That’s something Dr. Kuk would agree with, given her research has shown that, even if people fail to lose a single pound, health risks associated with obesity can be mitigated with regular physical activity.

“Exercising for 30 minutes every day, even going for a walk after lunch, has been associated with beneficial effects for blood pressure, mental health and energy levels,” she says. “I mean, there are so many positive health effects from physical activity just, unfortunately, it isn’t as good at helping you lose weight as most people think.”

So go ahead and join the gym. Just don’t count on it as the key to shed pounds. And maybe try to find a fitness club that doesn’t have a handy little shake shack to tempt you into gaining back all those calories before you even walk out the door.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diets are so last year.

That’s the message a lot of registered dietitians are hoping to get out there, in hopes of convincing people not to embark on a new diet — any new diet — as a New Year’s resolution. Why not? Because nutrition experts are trying to encourage people to give “lifestyle management” a shot instead.

“The idea of following a diet is something we’ve been walking away from for a very long time,” explains Joanne Lewis, director of healthcare provider education and engagement at Diabetes Canada. “In fact, we try very hard not to use the word ‘diet’ anymore, because changing behaviour is not something that comes easily to people in general, since humans adopt their eating habits over time. It’s not something we can just flip a switch and easily change.”

That’s one reason most diets tend to fail the vast majority of people. One registered dietitian recently told me the average time people stick to a diet is about 30 days — and three months is a real success story. It might be thrilling to radically change-up your diet and feel like you’re really making a difference — at first. However, big changes don’t tend to survive the first high-stress period at work, or the first family vacation.

Worse, perhaps, is the fact that diets are a one-size-fits-all solution, as opposed to a plan for change based on an individual’s tastes, needs and limitations (be they time or money). At its best, lifestyle management begins with a solid assessment of your actual lived life to see what can be changed and what cannot. When done in a clinical setting to help a person dealing with, say, an obesity-related illness, it’s called a “lifestyle intervention,” meaning the patient has outside help, like a coach or nutritionist. Lewis says it’s not impossible to do on our own, although she strongly suggests people enlist friends or family to support lifestyle changes.

“To start off, before you change anything, just write down everything that you consume every day for a few days, making sure to include a weekend in there,” she advises. “People are much more successful when they start keeping a food diary and really look at it. The reality is most people know what they should be doing but don’t know where to start. They can start to see where they can make changes when it’s all laid out in front of them.”

From there, a lifestyle coach would suggest starting with one small change that can be made relatively easily. Lewis uses the example of starting to eat breakfast, if, say, you’re the sort of person who skips it, then becomes so hungry later that you overeat. Once eating breakfast is old hat, it’s time to introduce a new habit, like, for instance, taking a walk after lunch. Once you’ve mastered that, cut out that afternoon frappuccino and drink hot tea instead. The key here is to think about what needs to be done, then wade in slowly, getting used to the temperature.

That’s not nearly as sexy as plunging right into, say, the grapefruit diet, which dangles the promise of nine pounds lost over seven short days. We seem to fall for these diets time and again, mainly because we’re not satisfied with gradual weight loss.

“I think you don’t notice gaining two or three or four pounds in one year, but then, you know, cumulatively, after say five years, you start to notice it,” says Lewis. “And then one day it hits you. Nothing fits and then you want to go back to where you were five years ago right away, not realizing that it took you five years to put the weight on in the first place.”

In a 2006 book, Mindless Eating, Dr. Brian Wansink suggested we’d all be better off if we could get used to the idea of taking weight off slowly (the way we put it on in the first place) instead of being determined to take it all off at once. He says gradual weight loss is much easier, since our bodies fight against low-calorie deprivation diets by going into “conservation mode” — making it harder to burn fat. Add to that Wansink thinks there’s a limit to the amount of self-denial we can handle, especially in an environment where our willpower is constantly tested by an abundance of readily available snacks and a constant barrage of food porn. And he was writing before everyone Instagrammed their breakfasts.

For Wansink, the key is to skip the deprivation and, instead, focus on cutting out the mindless eating — finishing off the last slice of pizza just because it’s there, grabbing a donut to break up the day, or grazing on post-dinner snacks while binge-watching a TV series. That’s how we put the weight on — 100 or 200 calories per day that we never even realized we were eating — so, Wansink reasons that’s also the best way to take it off.

That fits in perfectly with lifestyle management — a diet you don’t even know you’re on. It starts with paying attention, then becomes a lifestyle when you reform most of the bad, mindless habits, and swap in good ones instead. This includes not just diet, but also physical activity, which could be something as small as getting up from your desk every once in a while. And not for a snack.

Best of all, unlike the grapefruit diet, it’s sustainable. And the new mantra in nutritional advice is quickly becoming: “If you can’t do it for the rest of your life, don’t do it at all.”

So maybe this year, resolve to give up dieting, and focus on lifestyle instead.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a lifetime of dieting and problems with binge-eating, Bobby Umar is down 35 pounds.

The weight loss began in June, when the 48-year-old motivational speaker decided to finally give the keto diet a 30-day trial run. Umar had resisted that low-carb, high-fat diet for years, since he didn’t think he’d ever be willing to give up pasta, rice and bread permanently. A 30-day challenge, though, seemed like a reasonable amount of time to try something new, so he gave it a shot.

“The first two weeks were really hard but, once I got past that, things really took off,” recalls Umar. “If you can get to that point, that’s when the hunger goes down significantly. I would say my appetite dropped by about 70 per cent and that’s when the weight really started coming down.”

More important, he says, was his change in mindset. After radically reducing both carbs and sugar, he found himself re-defining his idea of a “treat.” Instead of rewarding himself with an occasional dessert or sweet, Umar started thinking of a piece of good bread as an indulgence. Best of all, the binge-eating just stopped, something he attributed to both the keto and the fact that he started skipping breakfast.

“Breakfast is where all the sugar comes from like the bread and jam and things like that that I love, so avoiding breakfast works really well for me,” he says. “And I was worried that I’d eat too much at lunch, which is one of my triggers but, after two weeks, I wasn’t even binging at lunch for the first time in my life.”

As someone deeply immersed in diet culture, though, Umar was keenly aware that a lot of people who lose weight on deprivation diets can’t maintain the regimen and wind up putting the weight back on a year or two later. So Umar figured out ways to make it more sustainable for his lifestyle and preferences by tweaking it and combining it with other diets, including intermittent fasting, which touts the virtues of skipping or postponing breakfast. He says he sometimes gets comments from people who complain he’s not authentically keto, thanks to his modifications to the diet, which include less fat, more vegetables, and a stubborn refusal to give up popcorn.

He’s not alone. A lot of people try to get the best out of super-diets like keto, vegan and intermittent fasting by cherry-picking the things they like. There’s even one that’s trending these days, the “pegan” diet, a paleo/vegan hybrid that encourages people to cut out all sugar, legumes, alcohol and grains and, instead, eat mainly plants. One version of the pegan diet does allow for a tiny bit of meat (think along the lines of bacon on a salad), but it’s pretty restrictive.

“It kind of sounds like two worlds colliding,” explains Lianne Phillipson, a Toronto area registered nutritionist, consultant and author. “Because those on the paleo diet are really eating a lot of fish and meat, and then add in veganism to it, which restricts people to just plants. Combining the two seems really restrictive and I’m not really sure how anyone would be able to follow it for any period of time.”

Unlike peganism, most people’s Franken-diet plans aim to be less restrictive, not more, says Phillipson, who says it’s really common to see people modifying low-carbohydrate diets, in part, because it’s hard to stay on them for a long time, but there are some aspects of them that are good for our bodies and help us lose weight. “Those diets work for a lot of people because you get rid of a lot of the grains, like that morning sugary muffin or croissant or donut or whatever,” she says. “That’s really quite a good boundary to put up.”

Instead, fill that hole with a little inspiration from the vegan diet—fresh fruit and nuts, refried black beans with guacamole or, perhaps, a breakfast salad—which all help on the overall nutrition front, since Phillipson says almost everyone she’s ever worked with needs more fruits and vegetables. Although Phillipson thinks the pegan diet doesn’t offer enough variety to be sustainable for most people, a good vegan diet is nutrient-rich and low-fat—so long as you’re steering clear of processed faux-meat.

Although there’s a lot of variation when it comes to the philosophy, the elements that seem to work in a lot of diets, be they vegan, keto or (as Phillipson points out) Mediterranean, are remarkably similar, namely, avoiding processed food and excessive sugar and trying to eat as much “real food” as possible, especially fruits and vegetables.

All of that fits in perfectly with intermittent fasting, too, since these foods make it easier to feel full for a longer time than refined carbs and ultra-processed foods. Dr. Jason Fung, the Toronto doctor who wrote the book (several books actually) on fasting, calls fasting a “powerful addition to any diet,” since, he says, no matter how good the diet is, if you’re snacking all the time, it’s not going to work.

Bobby Umar would surely agree. “All my life, I never felt in control of myself and for the first time, I actually felt in control,” he says. “I was resigned to the idea that maybe I was going to have binge-eating as part of my life but I never binged once.”

He adds: “It’s hard to explain but, as someone who struggled with weight for 35 years, having control is extremely empowering.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next up: Keto, vegan, fasting —how to get the most out of the super-diets.

Whether you’re dieting to improve your health or physical appearance, it’s hard to go it alone. While people used to seek out friends to hold them accountable and struggle alongside them, it’s becoming more and more common to find support online.

No matter what the niche, from fasting to keto and paleo, it’s easy to find a group of health-enthusiasts who are following the same regime you are, but can this lead to dangerous misinformation?

“When we’re talking about these kinds of forums or support groups, we really position them in the social aspect that it may affect how someone starts to view their body, their thoughts, feelings and behaviours around food and weight. If that starts to get really negative, it can lead to behaviours that can cause disordered eating,” says Ary Maharaj from the The National Eating Disorder Information Centre.

Weight loss can be a slippery slope, especially when it comes to more extreme diets like intermittent fasting, a trendy diet followed by celebrities including Kourtney Kardashian and Hugh Jackman, it consists of scheduling your meal times within a certain window. The most common form is 16:8, which means you fast for 16 hours and have an 8 hour eating window (ie. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

And within the fasting umbrella is the snake diet, a more controversial regime that requires zero food consumption, just electrolyte-filled supplements. Founded by trainer Cole Robinson, the snake diet consists of only drinking a mixture of water, sea salt, potassium chloride, baking soda, and sulfate salts to keep your energy up. Fasts can last a day to as long as a month.

Zovel Olivia Hyre, 28, is a Markham-based medical student, former national soccer player and a member of a snake diet fasting group on Facebook. After gaining weight, Olivia Hyre decided she needed a detox or cleanse of some sort, and thought a fast would do the trick. She first decided to try a juice cleanse, but then moved on to intermittent fasting, but finally came across the snake diet online, but before she even decided to experiment with the trend, she spent hours reading on the subject and watching the founder’s explanatory videos that broke down the science behind the regime.

Once she was convinced, she began fasting a few days at a time and felt a major, positive difference in her health. She began sharing her journey with her Instagram followers, and saw there was a lot of interest on the topic, and that led to her coming across the International Facebook group in April.

“Through finding that support, you realize that there are other people willing to do what you think you’re isolated doing on your own, there are actually others out there that are very avid about it,” she says, adding that the group is valuable because it’s able to actually inform individuals who are in need of more guidance.

“If someone posts about feeling dizzy, people can quickly respond and say they need to simply up their electrolytes and it’s natural the first day or two,” she says. “But if someone’s been fasting for 30 days and says they feel terrible and are vomiting, that’s when a bunch of people often jump in and say—pull the brakes.”

Listening to your body is key with any new diet, especially when it involves fasting for a long period of time. When part of an online forum, it can be especially tempting to compare yourself to the slew of before and after photos, but that’s when things can go awry. Social dieting forums are a wonderful way to stay motivated, connect with other health fans and learn more about various lifestyles, but anything can gradually go from moderate to extreme.

“Healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle is an admirable thing to work towards, that sometimes does require social support to keep on track, but there’s also more adaptive ways of doing that,” says Stephanie Cassin, a Registered Clinical and Health Psychologist and director of Ryerson University’s Healthy Eating and Lifestyle Lab, emphasizing the importance of adapting a lifestyle that’s lenient and not too rigid in order for it to actually be healthy and sustainable.

In moderation, fasting has been scientifically proven to improve inflammation, blood pressure, brain function, and potentially even cancer prevention according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, but the main worry is what happens when it’s taken a step too far, especially when there’s a crowd of digital fans cheering you on.

“If somebody had a susceptibility or predisposition to an eating disorder, and they started on a really restrictive fast, that kind of short term impact on their actual weight can become quite reinforcing,” said Cassin. “Sometimes people with anorexia will say that it actually just started as a diet that went too far and just kind of got off track.”

When it comes to more severe diet plans like fasting, it’s important to listen to your body and gauge whether you’re doing it to reach your weight goal or to genuinely improve your health. Just because it worked well for one person’s body, doesn’t mean you will have the same success.

Another issue is the spreading of misinformation. Misinformation can proliferate on social media, and it can spread quickly. For example, one member of an intermittent fasting thread on reddit wanted to break down big pieces of misleading information that they’ve come across in the thread, but even their post was littered with errors. In response to a few posts about being overweight due to drinking alcohol, the user responded saying that “Beers are high in calories but you urinate out lots of alcohol as it is a diuretic, it’s not in your system long enough to really affect weight. The real reason is when you are drunk you make worse decisions. Pizza, kebabs, pasta.”

But while millions of opinionated people and a wide and open database would seem to be a recipe for inaccuracy, others argue that social media users tend to fact check each other. One recent post saw dozens of intermittent fasters in the same thread were quick to point out all the errors in the post, one even wrote, “When correcting people, anecdotes are no substitutes for actual sources. I think the term for this should be fastplaining.”

Sarah Black, a 44-year-old Bowmanville-raised massage therapist, has been fasting for more than 25 years and is also part of an intermittent fasting thread. During her time pursuing a diploma in massage therapy at Centennial College, Black also had to take courses in health and nutrition, but her interest in the topic dates back to when she was 16 and diagnosed with celiac disease. Reddit is the only social platform she likes to engage in because she feels misinformation gets clamped down a lot faster than on other platforms —especially by her. Her level of experience on the subject has led to her chiming in occasionally on the thread whenever she came across someone fasting in an unhealthy or extreme manner.

“I’ll pipe up here and there, but more so if I see something that’s blatant misinformation, or something that sounds like orthorexia (obsessive behaviour in pursuit of a healthy diet) or any approaches that are inherently unhealthy,” says Black. “I tend to get mixed reactions. People are sort of appreciative like, ‘Wow, I hadn’t really considered that part or idea to this,’ and then other folks will get kind of defensive, like, ‘Who are you to say this?’ I try to back it up with research if I can, but some of it’s anecdotal.”

For example, in mid-November, a reddit user posted a question into the thread enquiring how they could be adding more caffeine into their fasting routine. A few people, including Black, were quick to jump in and say it’s not healthy to add caffeine to a fasting diet due to it being a “diuretic” and the intense craving may be due to a caffeine addiction.

One thing Black said she’s noticed, especially among less experienced fasters is the habit of being “overzealous” and extreme.

“Some people tend to get very dogmatic with their approach and don’t take the time to really assess if something is healthy or is verging on being unhealthy,” she says. “A lot of people get so invested in the process, that they’re not actually honing in on how their bodies are feeling while they’re doing it.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Carly Ostroffspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Carly Ostroffspecial To The Starwed.']",2020-01-08,"This story is part of a week-long series on dieting and weight loss for 2020. Next up: How do you juggle dieting with positive messages about body image?

Eating healthier can be hard, and harder still is the price tag that comes with eating more fresh vegetables, fish and whole grains, as the popular Mediterranean diet recommends.

“Out of all the diets, it’s the most sustainable,” says local holistic nutritionist and wellness expert, Jordana Hart. “The Mediterranean diet encourages people to eat real foods,” she says. It’s effective because it makes people feel nourished. “Some crash diets might be something someone can follow for two weeks; this is something someone can follow long term.”

While the Mediterranean diet is nothing new, if you live in Toronto, accessing it can be challenging and costly, as winter produce can be inconstant, and seafood has to travel long distances.

“We live in this world where people are eating a lot of processed food,” says Hart. “You can buy macaroni and cheese for 99 cents and call it dinner.” That said, the Mediterranean diet is manageable on almost any budget. “It just requires a bit more planning,” she says.

It also takes some added thought when shopping for the diet, says certified holistic nutritionist and best-selling author, Joy McCarthy. To keep costs accessible, McCarthy recommends emphasizing a lot of plant-based proteins like beans and legumes. “If you’re getting them dry and cooking them yourself, they’re one of the most inexpensive foods you can possibly buy,” she says. Don’t overlook frozen fruits and vegetables either. “I think people assume fresh is better, but we live in Canada and a lot of the foods here are imported anyways,” says Hart. The same goes for canned foods. “Instead of buying a fresh piece of tuna, you can buy canned tuna, salmon or anchovies. All of these canned fish are still high in nutrients and healthy fats,” she explains.

When buying fresh fish, thinking beyond tuna and salmon can drive down costs. “More affordable options would be proteins like West Coast or B.C. snapper,” says David Owen, owner of De La Mer Fresh Fish Market’s four locations. “It’s a Canadian fish that has a sweet flavour and firm but flakey texture like European sea bass and sea bream.” At about $10 a pound, tilapia is another great option according to Owen, who recommends it for fish tacos. “It’s relatively lean for those people who want a lower fat diet and it’s very mild, so good for kids,” he says. In terms of shellfish, Owen says mussels offer great bang for your buck. “There, you are looking in the ground beef bubble pricing. You can feed two people for like $7 or $8,” he says. Steaming mussels in white wine with garlic, shallots and diced tomatoes or cooking them in a green curry sauce makes for an easy and delicious meal says Owen.

Buying in season helps too. Depending on the time of year, McCarthy recommends farmer’s markets. “When zucchinis are in season, you can get one for less than $1,” she says as an example. It’s similar to buying in bulk. “Packaging can be 10-20 per cent of the cost, so if you’re buying dried chickpeas, mung beans or lentils, buy them in bulk not in a package,” says McCarthy. Lastly, keep an eye out for sales. “Every grocery store discounts from time to time to clear things out.”

Since the diet is flexible, places to shop for it are too. While McCarthy loves to support local independent businesses with great produce like the Sweet Potato, it’s not always the most cost-effective option. “I also like Organic Garage for things that are non-perishable or frozen,” says McCarthy. “No Frills actually has a huge organic section and very good prices. They also have a whole aisle of natural foods as well, which is very affordable,” she says. Both nutritionists agree that any major grocery store like Loblaws or superstore like Costco would be easy places to find everything needed for the diet too. Online, shoppers can buy produce through local delivery services like Mama Earth Organics, which partners with Ontario farms to deliver fresh and organic, vegetable and fruit baskets. Starting at $30 for a small sized bin, each order can be customized weekly based on consumer needs, so you’re getting high-quality in-season produce exactly when you need it.

Although the Mediterranean diet is high on simple unprocessed ingredients that doesn’t mean meals can’t be creative. McCarthy points to a lentil casserole and vegetable soup with beans and chilli as examples of hearty dishes that will keep you satisfied especially during cooler months. Sweets aren’t completely off the table either. “You can make something like an apple crisp, and if you didn’t want to use oats, you could do it with walnuts and seeds instead,” says Hart. Energy balls made with honey, oats and almond butter also make for great snacks she says.

McCarthy recommends batch cooking. “I’m a big fan of it because if you make it, you’ll have it for the whole week to enjoy,” she says. Like meal planning, batch cooking can help eliminate waste and cut down on costs. “Rather than buying new ingredients every day to make something, plan ahead and just know you’re making this vegetable casserole and meatballs,” adds Hart. “I find a lot of people buy groceries and don’t end up using them and that’s where the expense really is.”

Where Hart recommends investing more is on one particular Mediterranean diet staple. “Buying a good olive oil is very important,” she says. Shoppers should look for bottles that read “extra virgin olive oil.” It’s the best bang for your buck, because it has all the healthy fats with so many health benefits she advises. “Healthy fats are the building blocks for so much that goes on in our bodies. They create the healthy hormones responsible for mood and sleeping and help with memory and weight loss.”

The city’s newly opened Italian hot spot, Eataly, is an emporium for high-quality olive oils at all price points. “The Frantoi Cutrera Primo ($24.90) is made from the Tonda Iblea cultivar cultivated in a certified organic regime that received the BIO International prize in 2010 for the best organic olive oil,” says Dino Borri, VP of Global Partnerships at Eataly. “It’s fruity with intense hints of green tomato and fresh herbs plus a full-bodied flavour that lingers,” Borri continues. He suggests drizzling on soups and salads, but also on legumes, boiled rice and grilled vegetables. “One of Frantoio Franci’s most awarded oils from Tuscany, Villa Magra ($39.90) is intensely fruity with aromas of green olive, fresh and pungent grassy notes with hints of artichoke and elegant notes of roasted coffee,” he says. “Use this oil fresh in soups, on boiled or raw vegetables, bruschetta, red meats, tomato salads, with plain rice or pasta, as well as well-matured cheeses.”

“In the past 20 years alone, there have been so many fad diets, but the Mediterranean diet is more realistic because it incorporates all the essential foods into one place,” says Hart. It’s the diet’s flexibility rather than it’s hard and fast rules that make it so appealing. “It’s okay to make it your own,” says McCarthy.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Ricardowed.']",2016-10-12,"Here’s a secret most parents know: the trick to making any vegetable appealing to kids is to smother it in cheese. This recipe is no exception, but here’s a surprise: the squash in this recipe is actually an essential part of why this dish is so beloved by kids. Well, my kids anyway. The great thing about butternut squash is how sweet and creamy it becomes once it’s cooked. In this recipe, the squash also soaks up the irresistible flavours of leeks, onions and garlic sautéed in butter. This is such a fragrant dish (the whole house will smell like garlic butter!) that you won’t even really need cheese. But I would make it au gratin, so the kids will gobble it up.

Squash and Leek Rigatoni au Gratin

4 cups (600 g) peeled, seeded and cubed butternut squash

2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil

3/4 lb (375 g) rigatoni

3 cups (285 g) thinly sliced leeks (about 1 or 2)

1 small onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, chopped

1/4 cup (55 g) butter

1/4 cup (40 g) unbleached all-purpose flour

2 cups (500 mL) chicken broth

1 cup (250 mL) milk

8 cups (240 g) lightly packed fresh spinach, stemmed and coarsely chopped (2 bags of 6 oz / 170 g)

Red pepper flakes (optional)

Grated nutmeg (optional)

1 cup (100 g) grated cheddar cheese

1/2 cup (35 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Salt and pepper

1. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Place the squash on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for about 20 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through cooking. Set aside.

3. Meanwhile, in a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta al dente. Drain. Lightly oil and set aside.

4. In the same pot over medium-high heat, soften the leeks, onion and garlic in the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the broth and milk. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.

5. Off the heat, with an immersion blender, purée the leek mixture until smooth. With a spatula, stir in the squash, pasta and spinach. Adjust the seasoning. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and nutmeg, if desired.

6. Pour the mixture into a 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking dish. Sprinkle with the cheeses. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Carolyn Evans Hammondcontributing Columnist', 'Contributing Columnist', 'Carolyn Evans Hammond Is A Toronto-Based Wine Writer', 'A Freelance Contributing Columnist For The Star. Reach Her Via Email', 'Carolyn Carolynevanshammond.Com']",2020-07-09,"I’m just going to say it: Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks. But there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Here’s the lowdown.

When you don’t care that the ice will dilute the wine as it melts, or that the deep chill is going to mask all the subtle complexity in the wine, go ahead and toss a few cubes in the glass. Otherwise, refrain.

My bet is, if you’ve dropped a generous bundle of cash on a bottle of fine wine, you’re not going to want to wreck it by watering it down and muting it. Which is why serving fine wine on the rocks is not usually a good idea. But there’s one exception.

And that’s Port. That sweet, fortified wine from Portugal that’s typically associated with Christmas gifting, by-the-fire sipping and post-dinner cheese boards is actually quite fabulous in the summer served on ice. Especially with a dish of salted almonds. Here’s why it works.

First off, Port is so concentrated that a little dilution isn’t going to kill the experience. In fact, it will actually enhance its drinkability.

Secondly, ice ratchets up the refreshment factor and offsets the style’s considerable sweetness.

And third, at about 20 per cent alcohol by volume, Port is a slow sipper. So it has time to warm up a little bit in your mouth as you drink it, giving the considerable complexity time to open, cascade and linger — even when served cold.

All that to say, if you haven’t tried Port on the rocks, I’d encourage you to do so with a bottle of white, tawny or ruby Port. Here are a few favourites that offer tremendous value.

White wine lovers will appreciate Taylor Fladgate NV Fine White Port (Vintages 69856, $15.95/750mL). Gleaming golden in the glass, this is a sweet, full-bodied wine made from a blend of eight white grape varieties and aged in wood for three years. Each sip saturates the palate with a blast of candied pear and orange zest, salted caramel and hazelnut, vanilla and a whisper of nutmeg. This is especially good served with a slice of orange in the glass. Score: 93

A tasty tawny to try is Warre’s Otima 10-Year-Old (LCBO 566174, $22.00/500mL). Tawny Ports are red fortified wines that have shed their deep ruby colour and turned amber, or tawny, from maturing in wood for an extended time. This version, comprised of wine aged an average of 10 years in oak, shines a deep amber hue and tastes of toffee and nuts, candied citrus and cherries, with touches of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s a sweet, satin-textured drink that goes well with the setting sun. Score: 92+

For a ruby Port that overdelivers, consider Taylor Fladgate 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LCBO 46946, $19.00/750mL). Ruby Port is made from a blend of black grape varieties aged for two to six years in wood, thus retaining its deep colour. Taylor Fladgate’s version here shines dark red and unfolds with intriguing layers of fruit that taste sweet and poised yet dark. Blackberry and black licorice mingle with black cherry and cola, burnt almond and coffee, and a whisper of black peppercorn and smoke. And it’s of course long. Score: 93

If you’re inspired to whip up a batch of salted almonds to go with any of these wines, here’s my favourite way to make them.

Pour three cups of raw, unsalted almonds into a bowl. Dissolve one heaping teaspoon of salt in about two tablespoons of hot water. Pour the salty water over the almonds and toss. Spread the nuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a 400° F oven for about 10 minutes until golden, stirring halfway through. Remove the tray from the oven, pour the almonds into a bowl, drizzle them with about a tablespoon of really good olive oil and stir to coat. The nuts will quickly absorb the oil.

You can serve the almonds warm or let them cool and store them in an airtight container.

And if you’ve got a bottle of fine table wine kicking around that you want to chill fast, don’t be tempted to throw ice in the glass. Instead, make an ice bath — about half ice, half water — and submerge the bottle. Doing so will chill it faster than ice on its own and you’ll be enjoying your wine nicely chilled (but not too cold or diluted) in no time.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This roundup of some of the best offers out there will keep you drinking well at the best possible price, while supporting Ontario producers.

One of the smartest deals is from Pillitteri Estates Winery in Niagara. It’s selling its 2019 Canadian Gothic White VQA Ontario for $99.00 per case of 12 bottles, reg. $156.00, and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario. This wine is normally only available at farmers’ markets, but it can now be purchased online at pillitteri.com for what works out to $8.25 per bottle. That price for a delicious local white is a steal.

The 2019 Canadian Gothic White is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio and Gewurztraminer. It swirls with aromas and flavours of dried apricot and sun-drenched grapefruit, then it shifts toward tangerine zest, lemon curd, wildflowers and rose before leaving a crushed stone and salt finish. Taut, shimmering acidity hems in the effusive off-dry fruit. And this light-bodied, honest value white clocks a relatively low 12 per cent alcohol. Outstanding value for money. Score: 93

Here’s an insider tip for those enamoured by mineral-driven, dry styles of Chardonnay. Bachelder Niagara has just released a brilliant bottle to consumers, which is normally reserved for its restaurant clients—who would of course mark it up considerably. It’s the 2018 Minéralité de Niagara VQA Niagara Peninsula. They’re selling it for $22.95 at BachelderNiagara.com and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario for three bottles or more. That wine is deeply undervalued for what it is.

The attack is quick and racy, instantly mouthwatering. Then it fills out, broadens, and saturates with a powerful punch of luminosity that seems to glow in the mouth. Glossy mouthfeel, citric zeal, stone, salt, sweet butter, a touch of mushroom maybe—it’s all there. Then, it tapers to a resounding finish of grapefruit—flesh and peel—that goes on for ages. This wine will astound and amaze those with a thing for fine, mineral-driven, focused whites. Though marketed as a summer sipper, this wine will lift and tune the senses 12 months of the year. Score: 96

From Prince Edward County, Rosehall Run Vineyards offers a mixed six-pack of rosés valued at $160.00 for $125.00, with free shipping anywhere in Ontario. And they’re throwing in four GoVino wine glasses—those shatterproof, reusable and recyclable plastic glasses with a cult-like following.

The six pack—available at rosehallrun.com—includes two bottles each of the 2019 Just One Rosé and the NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé, which are both VQA Ontario. And it includes one bottle each of the 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir and the 2019 Pét-Nat, both from Prince Edward County. Each of the four wines offers an interesting variation on the rosé theme.

The 2019 Just One Rosé is a dry Gamay seasoned with a touch of Pinot Noir and a dash of Zweigelt. It shines sunset pink in the glass and rivets the senses with bright, forthright flavours of raspberry-lemonade—without the sweetness. It’s the kind of drink you’ll want to enjoy chilled on a porch swing in the country somewhere—but your balcony or back garden will do too. Score: 91

The coral-tinted NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé with its boho-label is made from Vidal and Pinot Noir and unfolds with sheer, off-dry flavours of wild strawberry and lemon-lime before the soft peach and cranberry undertow emerges along the length of the finish. It’s a well-balanced quencher with great purity of fruit. Score: 91

The salmon-hued 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir tastes dry and crisp—a bit more serious, really—with understated flavours of violet, raspberry, beetroot and stone. It would work very nicely with grilled salmon or a mushroom quiche. Score: 89

And the 2019 Pét-Nat is a curiosity more than anything. Pét-Nat is short for Pétillant Naturel, a style of sparkling wine made by bottling the wine mid-fermentation. Doing so traps the carbon dioxide in the bottle while the remaining yeast gives the wine a cloudy appearance while adding complexity. This bottle is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Gamay, Riesling, Pinot Noir, and other varieties, and the result is a fizzy, hazy pink wine with flavours of mixed red berries, salted lemon zest, crumbled herbs, cranberry, and many other nuances. It’s tasty, but there’s also a certain rusticity about it. Score: 88

And for those looking for a six pack with a white, rosé and red tucked inside should look to Marynissen Estates Winery in Niagara. This producer now offers two bottles each of its 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling VQA Ontario, 2019 Rosé VQA Niagara Peninsula, and 2017 Heritage Collection “Nanny’s Blend” Red VQA Niagara Peninsula. The six-pack is $99.95, regularly $135.70, and is available at marynissen.com. And they’re waiving the shipping fee in Ontario.

The 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling is a lovely blend of Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Muscat that tastes off-dry and elegant. It starts with the compelling scent of French lemon tart. The attack is brisk and lively with a mouthfilling hit of lemon lime and chin-drip peach laced with a touch of cool stone minerality on the finish. And the hint of sweetness is balanced by bracing acidity, so each sip finishes clean and dry. Great value. Score: 93

The 2019 Rosé is a riveting blend of Riesling, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Muscat. This cheerful, off-dry style offers immediate pleasure with quenching flavours of yellow plum, ruby grapefruit, and tangy raspberry. Lots of levity and oodles of clean, bright fruit. Score: 90

The 2017 Heritage Collection “Nanny’s Blend” Red is a grippy, bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot with tight-fisted flavours of black olive, black tea, and blackberry mostly with black pepper, roasted walnut and crushed stone on the finish. It’s the sort of wine that you’d want to serve with grilled meat or aged cheeses to match the wine’s firm structure and robust flavours. Score: 87

If you’d asked for a fizz, say, 100 years ago, the bartender would have handed you a gin cocktail, since the Gin Fizz was one of the most popular drinks of the day.

What made it so popular? Aside from being delicious and refreshing, having a carbonated cocktail was still a bit of a novelty. Carbonated water was invented in the 1700s, but it wasn’t until the soda siphon (a.k.a. a seltzer bottle, that made water fizzy with carbon dioxide cartridges) became widely available and affordable that bubbly cocktails became common. For home bartenders, that was in the 1920s.

Fancy bars had carbonated water for making sparkling cocktails earlier. One of the most famous and flashy fizzy cocktails was the Ramos Gin Fizz, which was invented in New Orleans in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon and, within 20 years of its creation, had become a veritable cottage industry. Some of its appeal was the spectacle of teams of bartenders shaking fizzes for exceptionally long times, which was part of the secret to getting a frothy top.

The other part of the trick was adding an egg white, which, when added to a drink and shaken, turns foamy, pretty much the same way an egg white turns into meringue when whisked. The final touch comes from adding soda water at the end, which, just like a soda fountain drink, makes the bubbles rise even higher.

Because it contains cream, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is really an indulgent boozy soda fountain drink. It’s delicious, but it’s next-level cocktail-shaking and I prefer to steer clear of dairy in the hot summer months, so I thought it best to use a different Fizz for this column. There are plenty of options, since the family includes at least a dozen different recipes. Some people even include the Mojito and Tom Collins in the family. I have a soft spot for the Silver Gin Fizz—gin, lemon, egg white, sugar and soda water.

For this 100-mile version of the recipe, we’ve tweaked this classic slightly by using lime instead of lemon and Beattie’s Farm Crafted Potato Gin ($39.95; LCBO 645622), which is distilled from potatoes in Alliston, Ontario. It’s a neat distillery, since they use the odd-sized potatoes (chip industry rejects) to make vodka and gin, so it’s part of the zero-waste movement, too.

Alliston Fizz

2 oz Beattie’s Gin

1 oz lime juice

1 egg white

2 teaspoons special fine granulated sugar

1 tiny pinch of salt

2 oz soda water

Add ice, gin, juice, salt, sugar and egg white to a cocktail shaker and shake rigorously for 60 seconds—until the shaker is ice-cold. Strain into a tall glass with four or five ice cubes. Slowly pour soda water to make it froth up.

PRO TIP: Many bartenders keep a small bottle of saline solution at their stations and add a couple of drops to a range of cocktails, including the Fizz. It’s used for the same reason it is in baking, namely, that it helps bring out flavour. A lot of cocktail technique is actually pretty similar to baking, such as the use of egg whites or specific grades of sugar. Cocktail recipes may seem finnicky but, details are important. Special fine granulated sugar, for example, is much easier to dissolve in the cold shaking process than the normal granulated sugar you stir into your coffee.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"This is the summer that gin made the pivot — from pink to orange.

It’s worth noting that they weren’t in the pink for long. It was only last summer, really, when we saw everyone, from behemoths like Beefeater to local craft producers like Willibald Farm Distillery, launch a pink gin. This year, judging from the new gins at the LCBO, well, orange is the new pink. Life moves at you pretty fast in the liquor world.

From my point of view, this is a good turn of events. The pink-gin craze was largely inspired by the phenomenal success of Empress 1908, a blue gin from Victoria, B.C., that turns pink when you add tonic or citrus. This colour-changing trick is the result of butterfly pea flower but, other than that additive, it was still a proper gin. Many of the pink gins that followed in its footsteps, however, also had a lot of added flavour and sugar. Some had as much as 70 grams of sugar per litre, which verges on being a gin liqueur, as opposed to a spirit.

Unlike the pinks, most of the orange gins have little to no added sugar. And, having tasted all the ones I can find at the LCBO, I can say that they’re all also pretty delicious. Not all are orange (sometimes it’s just the bottle), and that’s just fine with me.

What follows is a little roundup, from blood orange to Valencia oranges, with a little explainer on how to best enjoy them, since there’s a surprisingly wide range of flavour profiles involved.

Most people know blood oranges for their colour first and flavour second, but with the hue-free and aromatic Whitley Neill Blood Orange Gin ($44.95; LCBO 14754), it’s all about the taste. It’s got a bold, candied-orange peel flavour, but with none of the candy sweetness, making it pretty easy to pair with ginger ale or tonic. Our favourite way, by far, to drink this is to turn it into a Blood Orange Negroni — equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and this gin, stirred and strained into a glass filled with ice. No garnish required.

Since Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla ($30.95; LCBO 573956) is the sweetest of the six at the LCBO, the best way to serve this is to keep it simple — on the rocks with a spritz of soda. One of the nicest things about this light-coloured gin is that you can still taste the juniper through the delicate Seville-orange flavour, so you don’t want to drown it with mix. Two parts gin, one part soda and a wedge of lemon is all it needs.

If it weren’t for the fact that this is a full-strength spirit, Beefeater Blood Orange ($30.45; LCBO 15765) could pass for a punchy Italian aperitivo such as Aperol. It’s brightly coloured and has flavour to spare, so it will hold its own in a champagne cocktail like a modified French 75 — one ounce this gin and four ounces cava or other sparkly wine. Of course, gin and bubbly wine is a powerfully dangerous combo, so, if you want to tone it down a little, it’s also delicious with Lemon Tonic — one part spirit, three parts tonic.

Made with Sicilian oranges, Malfy Gin con Arancia ($39.70; LCBO 10715) is dry and lively with a complex blend of bitter and spicy notes — frankly delicious. You could stir this over ice and turn it into a lovely Martini with a twist of lemon to fully appreciate its sophisticated flavour profile, or pair it with a straightforward tonic water, such as Fever-Tree Mediterranean.

They call the region south of Barcelona the “orange blossom coast” for its ample sweet-orange groves, which provide the inspiration for Botica Valencian Orange Gin ($42.45; LCBO 12668), an international collaboration between folks in Spain and the Netherlands. It’s gin first, orange second, which is also just fine with us — especially mixed with grapefruit and soda water (two parts gin, two parts fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, one part soda).

You can’t really call Hendrick’s Midsummer Solstice ($59.70; LCBO 12564) an “orange gin” per se, since this colour-free botanical-forward gin also showcases fresh berry and floral flavours, but there’s a distinct orange-peel finish that we think qualifies it for inclusion. Like all Hendrick’s products, this is a crowd-pleaser, that becomes even more of an easy-drinking refresher when you add a little Elderflower Tonic. Also makes a great Martini.

Read', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Christine Sismondo Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'Contributor To The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-24,"One of the oldest cocktails in the canon, the Old Fashioned, needs little introduction.

Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.

So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry.

I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good.

Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin.

Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario.

Old Fashioned

2 oz Canadian whisky

1 sugar cube

5 dashes Angostura bitters

1 oz soda water

Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches)

Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.

Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down. Jumbo ice-cube trays can be bought at cocktail supply shops like Toronto’s Cocktail Emporium.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kelly Boutsalisthe Kit', 'The Kit', 'Kelly Boutsalisthe Kittue.']",2020-07-07,"Christian Allaire is rewriting the rules of fashion journalism. Allaire, who is Ojibway, is the fashion and style writer at Vogue. When his first Indigenous-focused fashion article for the venerable fashion title, “How 6 Indigenous Designers Are Using Fashion to Reclaim Their Future” went live, Indigenous people sent him a over a hundred tweets, DMs and comments.

“It opened the floodgates. I started receiving a ton of pitches and started being introduced to so many great new artists and designers,” says the writer by phone, from his parents’ home in Nipissing, Ontario, where he’s riding out COVID-19. “Indigenous designers don’t get the same coverage as others, so once we saw that it resonated, and there was talent out there to write about, I just really ran with it, which is a dream.”

Speaking about fashion, Allaire is simultaneously funny and serious, admitting that he thought he’d be in Ontario for a weekend and only packed two wild printed shirts and jeans. Three months later, “This is not the look,” he jokes.

Allaire can trace his love of fashion to cultural events and powwows he attended on his home community of Nipissing First Nation in Ontario. Years later, ignited by beautiful regalia at powwows, he decided to pursue a career in fashion journalism.

“I knew that it was a very competitive field and what sets me apart from the thousand other fashion writers out there [is that] I come from a culture that really is not respected in the fashion industry and their designs are often appropriated or copied without any recognition,” he says. “I write about authentic design and what that means today. A lot of people think it’s an old, traditional bygone craft, but there’s still designers doing it today. I knew from day one that’s what I was going to do.”

At Ryerson University in Toronto, Allaire was determined to get his fashionable feet in the door and aggressively pursued internships, completing several stints at Flare and Interview magazines, with the latter bringing him to New York City, his new home.

After covering New York and Milan fashion weeks and interviewing Christian Louboutin for Footwear News, Allaire went freelance in 2017. Soon after, an opportunity opened on Vogue’s production team during fashion month. The month-long gig involved tasks like building online galleries for runway shows. The next fashion season, he returned to do it again.

“I just sort of stuck around,” he recalls, beginning with working for the site as a contract writer before transitioning to a full-time employee for the digital arm of Vogue last summer. His first print piece, on Choctaw artist Jeffrey Gibson, appeared in the May 2020 issue. He captioned his Instagram post on the achievement as “Baby’s first print story!”

“I think I’ve gotten to where I am based on two things: hard work and luck. I have always been driven and always took internships whenever I could, started writing for free, networked my ass off. But every job I have gotten has also been thanks to the relationships I built and just good timing in general,” says the 28-year-old.

The Vogue gig has brought Allaire to the Met Gala twice, and he made sure to wear an Indigenous-made piece at the huge fashion event, a custom-made red beaded flower pin made by Toronto-based Skye Paul of Running Fox Beads, for the 2019 theme of Camp. “It would be campy for me to wear something very traditional, which was beadwork in my eyes, in a new fun way, so I paired it with a frilly shirt and sequined boots.”

Allaire jokingly likens picking his favourite designers to that of “picking a favourite child.” Still, his eye for beautiful work and understanding of the culture has brought incredible designers like Jamie Okuma, Warren Steven Scott, Keri Ataumbi, Liandra Swim and Tania Larsson into the fashion conversation. Although it has long upheld Western-centric notions of fashion, a name like Vogue still carries the kind of mainstream legitimacy that money can’t buy and can bring invaluable awareness to designers.

Allaire has recently covered Indigenous designers from South Africa and Australia, as the publication broadens its coverage of brands outside of North America. “It’s American Vogue and we will obviously spotlight American designers, but I think people are interested in hearing about brands from countries that they don’t live in. Shopping is not focused on where you live but on your emotional ties to a designer’s story.”

Sharing those stories will be something he’ll continue to do. “Indigenous brands seem like such a small market, but I literally can’t keep up.” In May, Allaire included 15 Indigenous designers in a story on sustainable fashion. One of those designers was Tania Larsson, a Gwich’in fine jewelry designer from Yellowknife. “He is a person who is changing our history,” Larsson says by phone “He’s impacting us in such a huge way, and I know that it’s going to ripple through ages.”

The writer, meanwhile, often underestimates the profound effect his stories have but does admit to frequently hearing about the significance of his stories from the people he covers and readers alike. “I want to give a platform for the voices who haven’t really been heard. There’s always a new brand, and that’s inspiring because it means that someone can feel more confident than ever to pursue fashion design and find resources.”

For Larsson, Allaire’s work goes beyond fashion. “It’s like sharing our culture, which for the longest time has been under attack.” With Allaire on Vogue’s masthead, representation of Indigenous designers can finally turn a new page.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2020/07/13/meredith-shaw-is-bringing-body-positivity-to-food-television.html,Meredith Shaw is bringing body positivity to food television,"['Lara Buchar', 'Lara Bucharthe Kitmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Lara Bucharthe Kit', 'The Kit']",2020-07-13,"The body positivity movement has made waves in the worlds of fashion and beauty in recent years, but one industry where it’s noticeably missing? Food television.

Style expert Meredith Shaw and her partner, chef Rodney Bowers, are out to change that with their new self-shot cooking series, “Double Your Dish,” where they transform one base ingredient into two totally different dishes in their home kitchen. While Rodney takes the lead on the cooking side, Meredith flexes her food styling and sous chef skills, and also acts as camera operator.

Beyond the delicious food, the series is noteworthy because it signals a shift in the types of bodies that are seen on television, particularly food television. “It’s pretty cool to have a cooking show with two people in bigger bodies because I don’t think you see that very much,” says Shaw. Bowers’ experience backs that up: “In the past, I was told that I wouldn’t have my own cooking show because of my size, that it’s not something that networks or sponsors want.”

Where do you see the intersection between body positivity and love of cooking?

Shaw: Society puts a lot of guilt on enjoying food. I hope that through the food that we make, and the style that we do it in and our passion for what we’re doing, it allows for that intersection to be even stronger and to provide actual examples of it happening in real time.

Bowers: I’ve worked on many different television shows over the years as a guest cooking expert and I was often met with negative comments about being a larger man even when I was cooking healthier food. There was a weird dichotomy between a large man cooking and promoting healthier food. It sat with me for a while and I questioned how to deal with it, because I wanted to promote good, healthy, organic, balanced eating for everyone. On the flip side of that, when I would cook with lots of butter and meat, I’d get negative comments … associated specifically with my weight. I think it’s so important for people in larger bodies to show that food can be good and dynamic and tasty and healthy and fun. It doesn’t have to be associated with their body image. It can just be food that they’re cooking.

What kinds of recipes do you prepare on ‘Double Your Dish’?

Shaw: The series was inspired by our Instagram Lives in our kitchen, when we were preparing meals together. Once we were offered the show, we sat down, cracked a bottle of wine and said, “What do we want to cook? What do we want to show? What do we want to share with the country? What would be useful? What would be personal?” Rodney uses really simple, accessible ingredients and makes them so delicious, and shows that I — and the viewers at home — can do it, too.

Meredith, you’ve done a lot of great work for the body positivity moment. How did that start?

Shaw: I have always been in a bigger body and there was no word for that when I was growing up. There was no “curvy,” there was no sort of activism; it was “big-boned” or “fat.” I started off as a singer-songwriter and I had many a meeting with record executives — which I hope don’t happen now — where they’d say, “We love your voice, we love your song, but we basically don’t like what you look like.” That was hard to handle. I had a tough journey with it and I went down the wrong path for a while. I tried to be less than, tried to be smaller, and it didn’t work for me. That’s why I have such empathy and passion for helping other women through that, because it’s so much better on your own team. It’s so much better to love your body and to know that you are more than your body, and to know that your worth isn’t tied to the size of your body.

Rodney, have you had similar experiences?

Bowers: I think the anxiety and depression that can come with being overweight affects men as well. I definitely struggle with self-image when we’re talking about cooking food on TV. Producers have told me that it all came down to an image thing and it turned me off for a while, thinking that no matter how I present myself on camera there’s always going to be this stigma about my size that other people are going to hold me back for. But then you get over it and you prove them wrong.

Meredith, how did your experiences propel your work as a fashion expert?

Shaw: I think you can really express yourself with style; it’s a way of stepping into your purpose. If your closet is full of things that don’t fit and make you feel bad and shameful when you open it, get rid of that stuff and stock it with new things. I scream that from the rooftops as often as I can. I come at my role as a style expert from a real place of love and empathy as a result of my own experiences.

How does that come into play on ‘Double Your Dish’?

Shaw: The show is important in terms of that visibility for both men and women. Rodney is a superhot dude and I have him in great clothes on the show. He’s in bright, fashionable, co-ordinated looks that fit him well. These aren’t clothes that fade into the background. He’s owning it and conquering it, which I think is really inspiring.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA—A national clinical trial this summer will focus on protecting cancer patients against severe COVID-19 infection by attempting to boost their compromised immune systems.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system.

Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die.

“The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday.

“And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.”

Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further.

Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement.

A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment.

“A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says.

“And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.”

Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective.

The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat.

The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101.

Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots.

Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts.

The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec.

Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial.

Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines.

“These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial.

Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness.

She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19.

Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Heather Hudsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-07-08,"If the kitchen is the heart of a home, the bathroom has become a refuge as we continue to stay at home and stay safe

Here are three inspiring master bathroom renovations that were dreamed up and completed before the pandemic.

Back to the future: Andrea McQueen was called in to rescue a Burlington, Ont. couple’s master bathroom from a hopeless time warp.

“That bathroom would have been pretty luxe in the ’80s,” said the owner of Andrea McQueen Design, of the dusty-rose-carpeted corner tub, melamine counters, massive wall mirror, shiny black wallpaper and track lighting.

“The couple wanted a functional bathroom that was really beautiful. However, we were conscious about where we invested and where we saved to achieve the look they were after,” said McQueen.

First step: reconfiguring the layout to create a huge, glass-enclosed double shower and provide room for a free-standing tub sourced from Costco.

McQueen cleansed the room of its frenzied patterns and colours, updating it with a soothing white palette. The Carrera marble inside the shower plays off the dove-grey vanity. White porcelain floor tile was a cost-effective choice, and the herringbone pattern elevates the look. Pot lights, sconces and a pretty chandelier cast all kinds of illumination in the room.

“We saved the splurge for plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, lighting, mirrors and a heated floor,” said McQueen.

The big spend was on the double vanity with a mullion detail and big drawers from Top Notch Cabinets in Oakville. “Drawers are super functional storage as opposed to doors,” added McQueen. “Having a place for everything in the bathroom and no clutter really does make your life better,” said McQueen.

A refuge for health-care workers: In pre-pandemic times, interior designer Beth Lowenfeld, principal of Four Blocks South, created a master bathroom oasis for a Forest Hill couple who are both doctors.

“Because they both lead hectic lives and have high-stress jobs and two small kids, the couple wanted to create an area where they could retreat,” said Lowenfeld.

The homeowners were looking for watery hues and sandy tones that remind the wife of her native Newfoundland. “It was exciting to work with more colour than the average Toronto homeowner would choose.”

Enter a deep turquoise shower. “We showed them a much more neutral option and there was no contest. They both immediately gravitated to the turquoise,” said Lowenfeld.

The standard ceramic tiles are set off up by smaller enameled glass tiles from Montreal-based Céragrès with a cascading effect meant to mimic the rippling of water.

The couple loved the streamlined look of the Vanico walnut vanity they happened upon in Roman Bath Centre. “It has lots of storage and sneaky details in the drawers that accommodate everything you can imagine.

“The couple had been living in a small condo for a long time with little kids. And the wife had reached her breaking point with chaos, so being strategic and having a place for everything was huge for her.”

A corner soaker tub is strategically situated under a skylight. “During the day, the way the light reflects on the tiles and reflective surfaces is beautiful.”

Final touches in the the seven-by-11-foot room included a heated towel rack and heated floor.

“Of all the spaces we worked on in the house, this room was one of the most rewarding. The wife said she had a bath the first night they moved in and it was just like heaven,” said Lowenfeld.

A retreat in the trees: Before Laura Stein and her husband could create a new master bedroom and ensuite, they had to serve an eviction notice to a brood of raccoons.

“Yep, there was a full family of raccoons in what would become our bedroom. They even made themselves raccoon-sized doors by cutting through the siding on the outside of the house and pulling it back to gain entry,” said Stein, owner of Laura Stein Interiors.

After a humane goodbye to the former tenants, Stein got to work designing a challenging ensuite bathroom in their 100-year-old Roncesvalles home.

A window on one side of the room, a door on the other and two sloped ceilings in between meant Stein had to experiment with different layouts and ultimately installed a floating wall smack in the middle of the room.

“This became the plumbing wall. On one side is the shower and the other side holds the vanity and sink. And what’s nice about this design is that it separates the shower and sink area so we can both be in there at once and not be in each other’s way.”

Beneath one angled wall is a closet for her husband and beneath the other is a built-in cabinet to store linens and towels.

The floating wall has porcelain tile made to look like marble on the vanity side, and it wraps around to play off the river rock stones on the floor of the shower on the opposite side.

Stein custom-designed the walnut vanity, including the mirror featuring two face-flattering strip lights on either side and cabinetry above it. “It gives us a high-end contemporary feel. And since it’s floating, it lets more light move through the room,” she said.

“I wanted the bathroom to feel like an upscale treehouse. We have a lovely tree on our front lawn. We have a top-down/bottom-up blind that is usually open at the top, so it feels like we’re up in the trees.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Mike Seelythe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Mike Seelythe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Harley Sitner was in Brooklyn for a wedding in March, feeling as if he’d just been sprayed by a skunk. Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled.

Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off.

School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs.

“We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said.

Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop.

“People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said.

But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with.

“We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.”

Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office.

He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead.

Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said.

Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van.

“We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.”

(“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.)

Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.)

Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.”

His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.”

Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas.

But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California.

“Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.”

Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades.

While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.”

“It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon.

He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor.

And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.”

Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years.

When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.”

As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.”

She then added, “They’re superexpensive, but probably with what I had to have my van restored, I could have bought one.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Thames Valley Trail follows a meandering 130-kilometre path along the Thames River, one of southern Ontario’s major waterways. The river’s three main branches — known today as the North, Middle and South Thames. The trail follows these branches through diverse habitats in the Carolinian Forest Region, in which a wide range of plant species thrive. In spring, populations of trilliums and other wildflowers explode in the forests, while the pungent smell of early-blooming skunk cabbage permeates the air in swampy wetlands. In open areas, you’ll find everything from meadow herbs to cultivated crops.

The North Branch and South Branch meet at The Forks in the heart of the City of London, and flow through downtown parks. Thanks to these green spaces, urban wildlife, from rabbits and groundhogs to white-tailed deer and coyotes, flourish. The sight of an eastern spiny softshell turtle sunning itself along the muddy banks is a special treat. With its pancake-shaped leathery shell and long, pointed nose, this threatened reptile is extremely distinctive. Much of its habitat has been lost to shoreline development, so Ontario’s softshells are left to depend on sites like the Thames to survive.

There are many spots from which hikers can access the trail along its length. Start at London’s Ivey Park, follow the river northward to Harris Park, and then cross the river at Blackfriars Street. Wander the opposite bank back south to Riverside Park. Kensington Bridge returns you to your starting point.

The St. Williams Conservation Reserve is part of the Norfolk Sand Plain, a delta that formed on the northern shore of Lake Erie after the retreat of the last ice age’s glaciers. Early pioneers eventually settled much of this land, clear-cutting populations of native trees and plants over time and exposing the sandy soil to the elements. The St. Williams Forestry Project was established more than a century ago to grow and plant seedlings in an effort to stabilize what had effectively become desert areas. As one of the first projects in Canada, it serves as a model for subsequent initiatives.

Made up of oak woodland, oak savannah, forest, wet- lands and sand barrens, the St. Williams Conservation Reserve is located on Crown land within the Long Point Biosphere Preserve. With more than 1,000 hectares at two sites, the reserve is a multi-use area that supports a great number of Canadian species at risk. Today, it is being managed to restore and preserve the richly diverse Carolinian habitats and flora and fauna populations that once flourished here.

While exploring the trails, keep your eye open for one of Ontario’s most beautiful and endangered woody plants, the eastern flowering dogwood. This small tree is alive with large blooms in May. Interestingly, the white “petals” on the four-parted flowers are not petals at all but bracts, a leaf-like structure that has taken on the petal’s job of attracting pollinators with their showy colour. The familiar poinsettia and bougainvillea plants share the same characteristic.

Another St. Williams denizen to watch for is the eastern hog-nosed snake. When attacked, it hisses, makes a striking motion, flattens its neck and even plays dead. It’s a harmless display intended to discourage potential predators. Unfortunately, in recent years, this snake has moved from threatening to threatened as its population has declined; a research project at St. Williams is focused on how to preserve this intriguing Ontario species.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But like you, we dream of travelling again, and are publishing these stories with future trips in mind.

KILLARNEY MOUNTAIN LODGE — Moose and black bears occasionally wander the grounds of this historic resort on Georgian Bay’s rugged north shore.

But nobody gets concerned until a beaver waddles ashore, because Killarney Mountain Lodge is now home to the world’s largest log-built conference centre.

It looks delicious to beavers and magnificent to humans.

The 2,500 trees London lawyer Holden Rhodes planted at the 72-year-old resort he bought five years ago have been wrapped with plastic tubes to keep beavers at bay. But it was the 500 people busily building Canada House last year that kept the beavers from chewing on the pine logs from Ontario and Douglas fir trees from British Columbia that eventually became this palace of timber.

Now that the 34,000-square-foot conference centre is up and open, Rhodes and his wife, Carey, are hoping a steady flow of vacationers, wedding parties, convention delegates and those looking for fine dining will scare beavers away from the impressive Canada House.

Rhodes named his conference centre Canada House because it displays the primary features of Canada: rocks, trees, water galore, big space and fabulous views.

It’s one of Ontario’s finest meeting places, but it has no subway connection. It’s 430 kilometres north of Toronto and 110 kilometres southwest of Sudbury, but it does sit on Canada’s 400-year-old principal canoe route.

Little has changed in the village of Killarney since executives of Detroit’s Fruehauf Trailer Company arrived here in the late 1940s to build a remote hideaway so its senior executives, best customers and principal suppliers could escape from the pressures of big business in the city.

You could only reach the village by boat or float plane and it offered some of the finest fishing, hunting, hiking and sunsets on the continent. Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa used to come to this wilderness to negotiate labour deals in comfort with Fruehauf execs between poker games. There are rumours that he is still here.

At age 38, Maury East and his wife, Annabelle, bought the private retreat in 1962 and swung open its thick wooden doors to the travelling public. That’s when Ontario decided to connect Killarney to the rest of the world and built a 65-kilometre paved highway through the woods to connect with Highway 69, the principal highway between Southern Ontario and Sudbury.

The East family operated the 14-hectare Killarney Mountain Lodge for 53 years, selling it to Rhodes five years ago.

After graduating from a British law school and postgraduate law studies at Western, Rhodes became a partner in London’s McKenzie Lake law firm, practising corporate law.

In his spare time, he launched a small agency that traced the ownership and maintenance history of used cars across Canada. His part-time firm, Carproof, grew substantially until he sold it to the owners of Carfax in the U.S. for $650 million.

Rhodes has poured $42 million into KML, upgrading the various cabins, cottages and motel suites that can accommodate 301 visitors, plus another 94 at neighbouring Sportman’s Inn, also owned by Rhodes.

About 25 per cent of Killarney’s 500 residents are employed at the resort. The village and resort sit on the Killarney channel, a body of calm waters protected from the waves of Georgian Bay by uninhabited George Island.

More than 725 boats, averaging 12 metres in length, but some at nearly 34 metres, were moored at KML’s marina last season, 60 per cent of them visiting from the U.S. Most days, there are usually two or three float planes at the marina as well.

Last year, the channel was full of float planes when a bush plane pilots group held its annual general meeting in Canada House.

Thousands of canoes also arrive at Killarney each summer. Close by is the historic French River — Ontario’s first major highway — which was the principal route 400 years ago for Coureur des bois, wilderness explorers and Indigenous travellers moving from Montreal to Georgian Bay.

The French River is the first declared heritage river in Canada and is still a popular canoe route.

The nearly 162,000-hectare Killarney Provincial Park sits next door to the village. The wilderness park has 183 campsites on 50 separate lakes, 80 kilometres of marked hiking trails, 11 different canoe routes, is open year-round and last year was Ontario’s first provincial park to be designated a Dark Sky Preserve. There are fewer than 100 such preserves in the world and 19 are in Canada.

Rhodes plans to make KML nearly as popular in winter as it is in summer with snowmobile rentals, cross-country skiing, ice fishing, star gazing into a clear, dark sky and outdoor campfires.

If you prefer indoor campfires, Canada House has two of the largest stone fireplaces built in Ontario.

More than 15,000 hours of masonry work went into building the two fireplaces, plus all the stone flooring and walls used throughout Canada House. Some of the stone comes from a quarry in Wiarton on the Bruce Peninsula, plus pink granite from Manitoulin Island. And there is plenty of exposed pink granite protruding through the grass on the lodge’s 14-hectare campus.

Rhodes is no stranger to Killarney and the vicinity. His mother and his grandmother were both born in the village and he spent many summers in his youth exploring the area woods, the waters and the village.

His grandmother worked at the lodge for East. His family goes back practically to when Killarney was founded as a fur trading post in 1820.

For many years, the village was known as Shebahonaning, Ojibwa for “safe passage.” The village and the lodge had proposed a joint celebration of the community’s 200th anniversary on July 1, but Rhodes said the celebration has been postponed to 2021.

Canada House displays paintings by Indigenous painters on all its walls, many from the Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island.

Two dozen ceremonial dancers from Wiikwemkoong participated in the official opening of Canada House last June.

Soon, Rhodes will lift a 12-ton wooden canoe paddle on to the exterior of Canada House and plans to make Killarney the paddle capital of Canada. The paddle will be a time capsule to be opened in 200 years. It’s being crafted by local resident Mike Ranta, who twice has paddled his canoe coast-to-coast across Canada.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
562,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/life/relationships/2020/07/13/a-short-history-of-the-word-simp.html,A short history of the word ‘Simp’,"['Ezra Marcus', 'Jonah Engel Bromwich', 'Ezra Marcusthe New York Timesjonah Engel Bromwichmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Ezra Marcusthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-07-13,"The word “simp” isn’t new. In fact, it’s pretty old.

But it has been dragged into fresh popularity. In the same way that older songs can find new audiences on TikTok, older slang emerges on the app to be championed by a broader, younger audience.

Too Short, the bawdy West Coast rapper who used the word in lyrics as early as 1985, said that he was not surprised that the word is more popular than ever.

“It still means the same thing,” he said. “If I was in a room with a bunch of 20-somethings or even teenagers, I would expect them to know what I’m talking about.”

The Evolution of Simp

Simp’s new status as a prime insult — a misogynist one, that implies a person is “unmanly” — has lasted most of a year. Mel Magazine, an online journal quick to note cultural trends, deeply dissected the resurgence in October.

The “New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English,” defines it as a shortened version of simpleton, so the phrase’s original meaning is rooted in calling someone stupid. The dictionary lists its first known usage as 1946, although it appeared in The New York Times as early as 1923.

The most recent entry in the dictionary dates to the 2000 novel “My Once Upon a Time,” by British novelist Diran Adebayo, where “simp” appears twice in the first 20 pages.

Adebayo said he had used it to inject an old-fashioned noir tone into the book.

“Simp would have been used in an old-school way,” he said. “Not the other way it’s been used as a very soft kind of man, who is very soft to his female friends.”

That newer sense of the word — as an insult for being “soft” or “overly sympathetic,” particularly to women — became more prominent in the 1980s and early 1990s. A set of West Coast rappers who regularly addressed pimping, including Hugh-E. M. C., Too Short and E-40, started using it in their songs.

“To me it’s like the opposite of the pimp,” Too Short said. “It really degrades the person who you’re aiming it at.”

He added that it evoked the sense of something counterfeit: “Like you’re a knockoff pimp.”

Too Short said that he may have drawn it from 1970s Blaxploitation movies, where the word thrived. The 1982 B-movie “Penitentiary II” even had a character named Simp.

In the early 2010s, the word, still used with some regularity by rappers, was seized upon by members of the nascent “manosphere,” the world of men’s rights activism. Simp became a staple of men’s rights forums, where feminism is derided as weakening men — just waiting for an enterprising TikToker to dust it off and give it a new sheen.

Do We Know Where Simp’s Going To?

The word’s current definition isn’t too far from Too Short’s. It’s a person, often a man, who throws money or attention at someone else, often a woman, in order to win affection. (It doesn’t work.)

That usage only became popular on TikTok in 2019 and may have peaked thanks to a trope made popular by Marco Borghi, whose account, @polo.boyy, has more than 2 million followers.

On Dec. 16, he posted a video that showed him posing beneath a block of text. It read: “If she rants to you about her relationship problems and you comfort her,” while Post Malone’s “Rock Star” played. The beat switched. The chords of OutKast’s “Hey Ya” began to play and a text banner flashed: “Welcome To Simp Nation.”

Borghi had been making videos riffing on the notion of simps throughout the year. But that one seems to have inspired a boom of simp content on TikTok.

The @polo.boyy videos marked the first time that Sterling Fournier, 21, had seen the word on TikTok, where he himself has over 675,000 followers. He made his own video in the same format.

He said he had already been aware of what it meant.

“If you were out with the boys, you’d say, ‘Oh, I had such a great date with Sydney. I paid for her food,’ and then you know, like, just as a teasing word, we’d be like, ‘Oh dude, you’re such a simp,’” he said.

Hope She Sees This, Bro

The first wave of simp content on TikTok and YouTube was driven by men. More recently, a simp-related video trope driven by female creators has emerged.

Lauren Halbach, 19, posted one such video in May. In it, her boyfriend is resting his head on her torso in bed. A song called “Simp (Simp Nation Theme Song)” starts playing. He jumps up, laughing.

“I feel like my boyfriend definitely fits the context of being a simp,” Halbach said.

The boyfriend-simp meme gave her the chance to turn the tables on TikTok’s alpha male culture, she said, where women are often “shamed or slammed for being too clingy or being too obsessive over men,” and men mock each other for doing “overly special things for women.” She called the dynamic “very toxic.”

The ubiquity of the term “simp” has taken some of that sting out of it. Like other insults, it has been taken up by fan communities, who often refer to themselves as simps for their favorite stars. Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist and the author of “Because Internet,” a book about language online, compared this usage to terms like “stan” or “trash,” as in, “I’m trash for this.”

McCulloch called it a self-conscious approach to fandom — “preemptively putting yourself down so that other people can’t,” she said.

So ... It’s Sexist?

Yes.

The word expresses discomfort with equality when it comes to gender and offers a simple way to dismiss the people causing that discomfort. Its resurgence cuts against simplistic ideas about young people, who are often caricatured as beacons of political correctness — woke saviours arriving at a time when America desperately needs them.

Fournier said the word’s edginess was part of its appeal. “I think it caught on because it was just, just within that perfect margin where it wasn’t something that you could get like too, too angry about, but it was also something that was still pretty politically incorrect,” he said.

McCulloch places simp in the same category of terms as “white knight” and “whipped,” used to degrade men who are “perceived as trying to curry the favour of women.” These also crop up in the world of men’s rights activism where simp is frequently used.

Adebayo teaches creative writing at Kingston University London. He said that when he saw the word in his students’ work, it reflected a character’s “backlash or irritation, or even confusion, around quite what you’re supposed to be as a man in terms of furthering your appeal to women.”

“A simp is someone that puts like, woman on a pedestal,” said Tiago Garcia-Arenas, 22, a TikTok creator with more than 2 million followers who released a song called “Simp” this year. Such men, he said, see women “as a higher being, or something like that.”

And Nelson Cam, 19, a TikTok user with over 150,000 followers, said that the word has also retained its economic associations. Simps, he said, are “guys that spend a lot of money on girls and get nothing in return.”

“I feel like a lot of guys saw this word as an opportunity to, whenever they’re in an argument online with I guess, a male feminist or any male that’s sticking up for woman’s rights, they have an automatic weapon that they can just use,” he said.

The Enduring Power of Simp

Simp has linguistic qualities shared by a lot of timeless slang. It’s short, punchy and easy to pronounce.

“You look at the list of words for cool — you know, ‘rad’ or ‘hot’ or ‘bad,’” McCulloch said, “a lot of them are monosyllables that have like a consonant and a vowel and a consonant.”

Adebayo agreed that it benefits from sound alone.

“It’s a word that sounds quite dismissive and authoritative in its way,” he said. “You can see it being kind of a useful, insulting term.”

And longtime users of the word expect it to retain that meaning.

“I don’t know what simp will evolve into but it will always be a negative word if you’re called that,” Too Short said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a quarter century of multimedia storytelling, Millgate traverses the country in search of dynamic topics, researching issues thoroughly then translating core elements via video, photo and words with credibility.

Her latest project is an immersive experience which will keep her on the roads, and streams, of the Pacific Northwest all summer long.

“Ocean to Idaho” debuts on social media platforms this summer. The multimedia experience offers audiences the opportunity to track the journey of migrating salmon from — as the title implies — the Pacific Ocean to the Salmon River in central Idaho, an 1,368-kilometre journey.

“We have so many things going on, and so many layers of priorities, whether it be figuring out how to feed our family tonight to how we’re going to try to plan a summer vacation,” Millgate said. “And within all of that is wildlife in wild land just trying to do their thing with all of us on top of them. And, just for a minute, I can help people engage in what is going on within our natural resources, despite all the things that we’re doing on top of them.”

Her outdoor adventure began at the mouth of the Columbia River in Oregon and will end at the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. Footage gathered during the trip will turn into a finished film plus stories for print and video media outlets countrywide in 2021.

“I go stretches at a time, like 10- to 12-day trips at a time, and then I get ahead of the fish so then I can come home, hug my kids, take a shower, catch up, make sure that everything social media-wise is running because that can turn into its own separate beast.”

The immersive social media campaign has been a challenge for the veteran journalist.

“By having social media, we can reach these audiences in a more dynamic way that really makes them feel involved. My credibility, my accuracy, my journalistic integrity — all those things still exist, but there’s this more accessible layer there where people can engage more.”

During her time at home, she writes, edits, cuts video, schedules more interviews — it’s a hectic pace.

“As a reporter, it changes the expectation because they want more of the personal behind-the-scenes stuff. I get asked for more of that in the last five to 10 years than ever before. But, we’re still just real people. And so, I go on these assignments and I’m not trying to tell you how to think on an issue, I just want you to think.”

Millgate hasn’t run into too many surprises on her trip yet — at least with the fish.

“What is surprising me is that everything is falling into place,” she said. “I’m pulling off the impossible here, and I haven’t gotten lost. I find every spot I need to be. I find it when I need to be there. Everyone that agrees to be interviewed is in their spot when I get there. And that’s pretty unbelievable.

“It’s almost serendipitous, you know? It’s like, everything that could go wrong is not going wrong.”

Millgate is well familiar with the Idaho section of her journey this summer. The rest has been an exciting discovery for her.

“You get me past like the very end of this migration route and I don’t know what anything looks like, I don’t know where anything is,” she said. “And so it’s this whole new world of shooting a landscape I’ve never seen and I love that.

“There’s nothing boring about it when your eyes are overwhelmed with everything that’s new. I like those days. So the fact that there’s like this rain forest which is the Lower Columbia sitting in the middle of this basic desert migration route, it’s awesome.”

Millgate shot a film a few years ago on the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River in central Idaho that was dredged for gold and left in ruins.

There she found the genesis for her current project.

“When I was in there shooting — I’d never seen a salmon. I’ve never caught a salmon in Idaho. I’ve never touched one. But I saw them in there and I thought, I’m watching them, you know basically on their last day of life and they’re guarding their spawning bed. And thinking, ‘How on earth does this fish do that and what on earth does that journey look like?’ I’m looking at a fish that just swam 850 miles to lay eggs and die. So my imagination kind of wandered: ‘What does that journey look like and how do I chart this back to the ocean?’”

Then last year, Millgate severely broke her leg when she was hit by a puck coaching her kids’ hockey team.

She was incapacitated for four months.

“When that happens to you, and you get thrown down on the couch like that, you really have no other choice but to look at yourself and your work, and where you’re at and what really matters. And I had a lot of those things already lined up in my life. But that concept of following the fish just kind of started sticking with me.”

In October of last year, she planned out how she’d pull the project off, with intricate levels of detail, lining up travel schedules and lodging and crews. But then, the pandemic hit, throwing much of the plan out the window.

“When that happened, as a freelancer a lot of my work fell away instantly. And there was nothing I was going to do about that. But this project kind of hung on and it morphed into this whole other thing — ‘OK, now we’re going to stack even more odds against you. See if you can pull this off.’ And so, I dumped my flights, I dumped my hotels, I dumped crew, and figured out how to do it in a way that was safe, responsible and reasonable.”

Toyota and Four Wheel Campers came through as sponsors for the project, giving Millgate self-contained transportation and lodging in one.

“There was all this time between October and May where it was a total wild roller-coaster ride of, ‘OK, this is going to happen. Oh, this is totally off the table,’ to, ‘Hey this is going to happen and it’s gonna look totally different. We’re going to pull it off.’”

The practicality of driving through the Pacific Northwest during a pandemic has been a challenge logistically and emotionally for Millgate.

“It’s kind of interesting to travel right now, because you get a different sense of how each area is handling it,” she said. “And I’m not with people. But you can feel it. Parts of Oregon are so shut down right now that even passing through without any interaction in a certain county feels uncomfortable.”

Millgate doesn’t want to give the impression she’s flaunting any of the pandemic precautions.

“I’m not trying to rebel in any way, I’m just trying to bring something that’s important, and bring it in a way that’s responsible,” she said.

“And frankly, sometimes it’s quite lonely. You’ve got your interviews, but then you don’t have anyone to hang out with when you go back to your camper. You work 15-hour days because that’s how many hours of light we have right now. And then you go back to your camper. And you’re camping in places where nobody is, that you’ve arranged with someone to let you have a safe place to park in their back lot, or whatever.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Darcel Rockettchicago Tribune', 'Chicago Tribune', 'Darcel Rockettchicago Tribunefri.']",2020-07-10,"CHICAGO—Twenty-one debutantes (14 high school seniors and seven juniors) spent a portion of their weekends from January until spring learning etiquette and things like how to waltz, how to tango, and how to curtsy. And when you add the young men who would be their escorts and backup escorts, that number more than doubles. All the work was intended to lead to The Links Inc. Chicago chapter’s 60th annual Debutante Cotillion, a formal ball where the debutantes are presented to society with the support of their escorts, family and friends. But just like proms, graduations and other milestones for young people, COVID-19 squashed this event.

“The original cotillion date was April 25, but then we changed it to June 13, and then we changed it to the first weekend in August, and then we said this isn’t going to be accomplishable,” said 2020 Cotillion chair and The Links member Dr. Joy West. Originally scheduled to be held at the Fairmont Chicago under the theme of “Diamonds and Pearls,” the cotillion is now planned for May 1, 2021. “This was devastating for us, basically because of the families. The senior families in particular.”

According to West, when the idea for a virtual cotillion was presented, families turned it down.

“Families wanted the full experience, and they didn’t think the virtual experience could capture the beauty and grace of the moment for their debutantes, so they opted to wait,” West said.

The move didn’t sit well with Havilland Williams, a rising senior at the Chicago High School for the Arts. When she mentioned to friends that she was preparing for the cotillion, she said, many of her peers weren’t familiar with the concept of the ball. She likens it to a quinceanera, but it’s not a birthday party.

Cotillion is a rite of passage for young women in the Black community. It’s a tradition that has been going on for 60 years in Chicago under the guidance of the Chicago chapter of The Links Inc., the national women’s service organization based on friendship and community service. Founded in 1950, the Chicago chapter places a special emphasis on volunteering in the fields of youth services, international trends, health services and promoting African American art.

“To find out school was cancelled and the cotillion was cancelled? I was really upset,” Williams said. “But what can you do?”

Her escort, Lorenz King, who will be attending Morehouse College in the fall, calls the recent spate of cancellations and postponements unfair. As a St. Rita of Cascia High School senior, he trained for the ball alongside Williams but won’t be coming back to escort her. Instead his younger brother will go.

“We’ll never get this again in our lives. I’ll never get to graduate high school, I’ll never get prom, and we work so hard. It’s just the feeling of accomplishment, after everything you’ve done, and you’re just not going to get it,” King said. “It gets frustrating sometimes. ... It’s kind of sad that we didn’t get a payoff of everything we did.”

West said that all of the debutantes have the opportunity to walk in 2021, and while all the juniors will do so, only about four or five seniors will return from college to participate. It’s a huge miss for participants, after the community service, fundraising, classes and workshops. And let’s not forget finding the proper ball gown, which has to be floor-length and white, accompanied by white gloves.

Participants raise money by selling ads to small businesses, and the cotillion class chooses a community organization to receive the money raised. The Chicago chapter of The Links focuses on mental health and wellness, West said.

“Our national mission is to transform communities through service, and we feel like continuing the legacy of cotillion by providing an opportunity for our young people to witness resilience through times of unrest, is important,” West said. “What we wanted our current families and community to see is a dedication to continuing to transform communities through service. Even though our goal to give $60,000 (U.S.) back to the community for our 60th did not happen, we have recommitted to doing just that for 2021.”

According to LaTisha Williams, Havilland’s mother, the cost to the family of making the cotillion happen runs in the thousands of dollars, and that includes selling $150 tickets to relatives and friends for seats at tables during the event. But Williams said it’s worth it for her only daughter to have this opportunity for education, mentorship and camaraderie. Havilland Williams and King said they not only learned etiquette, but have taken part in financial workshops about stocks and bonds as well as ones centred on mental health.

Havilland Williams considers cotillion to be on a higher level than prom.

“It has more elegance and grace in it and kind of like ballet — makes me feel poised and pretty, and I like how that makes me feel,” she said. “With prom, it’s just everyone is there, everyone wants to look better than you, but in cotillion, it’s more about unity.”

“In the end, you just see the dancing, but there’s a lot that goes into it,” King said. “A lot you can take away from it — years down the line, and that’s why I think it’s better than a homecoming or a prom.”

Camille Lonzer, a 2019 debutante from South Shore, says the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that she’ll remember forever.

“It’s just a rush of happiness seeing everyone in their dress. ... I would compare it to a graduation or a prom because you get to show off and show out. It’s definitely exciting,” she said. “I wasn’t too much of a social person beforehand, and it sort of opened my eyes to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions and perspectives. But also the community service aspect of the cotillion, it was life changing for me. I think that’s a nice aspect of it because you really feel like the community needs you as a person.”

“2021 will still be our 60th anniversary, although I don’t know what the flavour of that will look like,” West said. “But what we do know is that the journey to cotillion — the rehearsals and workshops — will be a fun and informative time for the debutantes and escorts. We want to make this next year just as interesting as this past year was.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/sponsored_sections/on-the-food-frontlines/05/16/a-family-focused-grocery-empire-commits-to-the-community.html,A family-focused grocery empire commits to the community,"['Tue.', 'May', 'Min. Read']",2020-05-19,"When the COVID-19 crisis upended the world as we knew it, grocery stores remained sturdy beacons of near normalcy. The way we shop has changed—socially distanced line-ups, one-way aisles, plexiglass cashier shields—but the vital relationship between supermarkets and their customers endures.

In this spirit, Sobeys Inc. launched the Community Action Fund, an initiative aimed at giving back to local communities by committing millions of dollars in donations to organizations helping those in need during these difficult times. The program is focused on creating localized solutions, empowering the company’s some 1,500-strong grocery and drugstore banners—including Safeway, Foodland, FreshCo, IGA and Lawtons—to decide how to best to support their neighbourhoods.

“Nobody has a better idea of what their local communities need now than our frontline store teams across the country,” says Michael Medline, president and CEO of Empire Company Ltd, owner of Sobeys. “It’s inspiring to see how quickly they banded together to give back to people in need.”

For store managers like Don McWilliam of Foodland in Stratford, Ont., the program presented an opportunity to lift up a fellow small business. Upon learning that local spirit-maker Junction 56 Distillery was pivoting its production to create much-needed hand sanitizer—donating much of it to high-risk essential services like shelters, and selling the rest to the public at cost—McWilliam and his team knew they’d found a worthy endeavour. Their contribution—pre-purchasing $1,000 worth of product to be distributed for free—helped two-fold: sanitizer would reach the hands of Canadians faster while helping to alleviate the economic stress faced by the craft distillery after generously transitioning its business.

Standing behind his community feels natural for McWilliam, crisis or not. “I’ve always looked out for the underdog,” he says. Growing up, he remembers that grocery stores were always giving back, a tradition he’s keen to preserve.

Another casualty of the COVID-19 crisis has been food security amongst our most vulnerable populations. Sobeys Inc. and its dedicated partners have stepped up to the plate. Across Ontario, the company has donated $300,000 to resource-strapped food banks like the Daily Bread Food Bank, Second Harvest and regional organizations in North York, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Thunder Bay and Ottawa. The company’s contributions—financial support plus donated gift cards, thousands of prepackaged hampers and cases of pantry essentials—helps those who need it most.

Through the Community Action Fund, Myles Power, store manager at FreshCo University & Bridge in Waterloo, Ont. was able to present $1,500 worth of $50 gift cards to his local chapter of Food4Kids. Since 2016, the non-profit organization has been dedicated to serving snacks and meals to children through school programs. But in light of school closures, Food4Kids was struggling to get food on the plates of kids who needed it.

As a grandfather of nine and a two-decade-long owner of the FreshCo store, where he’s employed generations of family members, Power couldn’t fathom the thought of any child in his community going hungry. “This one is close to my heart,” he says.

The concept of family, and of making a difference in the lives of others, has been a throughline within Sobeys Inc. since its inception in Nova Scotia over 100 years ago.

Even as the increased risks and mitigating precautionary measures descended on the stores, this “family first” attitude helped to unite the staff at the Sobeys Queensway location in Etobicoke, Ont. “Everyone looks after each other and helps out, chips in when needed,” says store manager Shawn Bergman. “If someone’s down, we’re there to pick them up.”

When it came time to decide how they’d allocate their share of the Community Action Fund, the Sobeys Queensway staff turned their efforts to nearby St. Joseph’s Health Centre, which recently reported a COVID-19 outbreak. Bergman and his team donated $2,000 worth of Sobeys gift cards to hardworking hospital staff, giving them a chance to pick up lunch or stock their fridge without worry after a long shift.

“As much as we’re frontline workers working in grocery stores, the true frontline workers are the ones working in hospitals and the healthcare system,” says Bergman. “With the hours that they’re putting in and all their dedication, we just wanted to show that we care and appreciate what they do.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kathryn Hudsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-14,"Just over a month ago, if you wanted to pop into Itacate restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon, you would’ve been out of luck. Its owners, the Moreno family, reserved Tuesdays as a day off from making mouth-watering tacos de carnitas and traditional mole. But that changed in the wake of COVID-19: They decided to open their doors to feed the community for free.

The Moreno family immigrated to Toronto from Mexico City in 2007 and opened Itacate in 2016 to cook the kind of soulful food they had grown up on. Now, outside the door of the little counter-serve spot on a strip of St. Clair West dotted with family businesses, a simple sign invites anyone in need—frontline workers, those who have lost their jobs, homeless people—to pick up a hot meal at no charge. Last week, they prepared 150 portions of chicken fajitas, each served with a steaming side of rice and beans.

“My mom decided we were going to start making free meals for people who need it because, well, she's like that: She feels good when she’s taking care of people,” explains Jahaziel Moreno, who runs the restaurant along with her parents and sisters. “We don't ask for identification to prove you’re a frontline worker or anything. We just let people know that there is good food here for those who need it.”

The restaurant has faced its own financial pressure: Plans to open a second storefront have been shelved after sales drastically slowed because of COVID-19 restrictions (they used to do a solid late-night shift, for example, serving hearty tortas to the party crowd). “My mother had some savings, so we are using that at the moment,” says Moreno simply. “She has a saying in Spanish, which is basically: If you give to people, then one day God will give it back to you.”

Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre on Oakwood Avenue, just around the corner from Itacate, wasn’t surprised to see the Moreno family in masks, serving take-out meals to neighbours free of charge. “They’ve passed through very difficult times since arriving in Canada, and they have been resilient,” he says. “I helped them with the process of becoming permanent residents, and when that happened last winter, they invited more than 100 people from the neighbourhood to a party. It was a way to say thank you to the community for helping them to stay in Canada.”

Kerri Romeo, who says she could live off of Itacate’s “incredible” chilaquiles for days, has lived in the St. Clair West and Oakwood area for four years and sees its community spirit thriving despite recent hardships. “It’s great to see everyone keeping this neighbourhood alive,” she says. “This stretch of St. Clair West is in transition—there are a lot of empty storefronts—but newer businesses like Primrose Bagel Co. have offered free coffee and bagels, and little free pantries have popped up across the neighbourhood for those who might need it.”

Rico-Martinez, who brought the FCJ Refugee Centre to St. Clair West 16 years ago, feels the same way. “This remains a neighbourhood of family businesses,” he says. “I’ve been amazed at the donations from the community. Every day, we receive groceries on our porch, we receive packages of art supplies for children. The Moreno family is a huge part of the sense of belonging that exists in this community.”

Itacate has long been a taste of home for Josue Hernandez, who immigrated to Canada from Mexico a decade ago and stops several times a month get his fix of authentic tacos and crisp, weighty pambazo sandwiches. “My relationship with the family is bigger than the restaurant now: I have a friendship with them,” he says. “Every time I go, I joke about soccer with Jahaziel’s father, because our favourite teams are rivals. It’s the kind of place where you feel like you know everyone—but they literally know everyone. They are so close with each other, and they treat everyone like a part of their family.”

Before social distancing stopped the Morenos from seating customers at their two small tables, they relished offering sit-down hospitality—they wanted every guest to feel welcome. “Do you know what Itacate means?” asks Rico-Martinez. “It’s the word people in Mexico use for the big bag of food your mom might prepare for you to take home after a visit. That gives you an understanding of the type of restaurant they wanted to create.”

The Morenos’ dedication has not gone unnoticed; neighbours pop their heads in often to offer thanks and encouragement to the family as they prep meals. “A customer left us a card that read: ‘Not all heroes wear capes or scrubs—some wear aprons.’ My mom cried,” says Moreno. She stops to think for a moment. “My mother cooks with love and people can feel that.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-14,"There are basically two things people talk about these days: COVID-19…and all the bread they’re making. Social media is filled with people proudly showcasing their fresh loaves and arranging sourdough starter swaps. As pandemic baking rises in popularity, Ontario’s independent mills are grinding around the clock to meet the demand.

Matt Faust, the general manager of mill and bakery Brodflour in Liberty Vilage, says that prior to the pandemic, the business’s main source of income was the café. Flour sales were about $1,500 per month. Once COVID-19 hit, however, flour sales jumped to $15,000 in April alone. Now, Brodflour baristas are lifting a lot more than lattes.

“In the past, we’ve been making sandwiches and toast and coffee, and now those people are helping us get large flour orders out the door, helping package up wholesale orders, managing wholesale customers,” says Faust. “I wouldn’t say we’re frontline workers, but I like to think that we offer an essential service.”

Brodflour over-bakes every day, providing loaves to local community and respite centres and food security programs. Contactless pick-up is available for customers, but Brodflour is on UberEats as well, allowing baking-mad citizens to place an order from the comfort of their couch.

About 100 kilometres west of Toronto, in Fergus, 1847 Stone Milling has been overwhelmed with flour-delivery demand. The mill has seen a 3,000 per cent increase in flour sales, much of it going to Toronto (and some being donated to a local bakery making bread for health care workers). The surge has required multiple sets of grandparents to pitch in and help fulfill orders. Everyone is working seven days a week. The mill used to have farm-gate pick-up, but now it’s delivery-only, with a stream of FedEx, UPS, and Canpar drivers rolling through every day to pick up dozens of sacks.

“It’s too bad that people have to pay for shipping, but I think it’s better in the long run so that they have the flour delivered right to them,” McKeown says. “Plus, it’s bulky and heavy and it’s nice to have it arrive at your door.” The mill recently received a telephone call from the area’s MPP, Ted Arnett, thanking them for continuing to serve the community during these strange times.

K2 Milling in Beeton, Ont. also has a growing stable of admirers. Mark Hayhoe—who also goes by the moniker “Kaptain Flour”—is descended from a long line of flour millers and has been milling flour in Beeton for almost three decades. But he says he’s never seen anything like this. Home flour sales are up 500 per cent since the pandemic started. K2 developed their own way to mill flour that “focuses on flavour, not colour,” and take pride in the “accessibility, transparency, and traceability” independent mills can offer customers, but maintaining an adequate supply of grains has been tricky these days. So has “seeing and hearing the fear and worry from our new customers and trying to remain calm, re-assuring and alert,” Hayhoe says. “But people have been uncannily kind, gracious and truly appreciative towards our daily grind. I hope our little artisanal flourmill in Simcoe County has encouraged people to understand the resiliency of the artisanal food system in comparison to the industrial food one. It did bend, but it did not break.”

It has, in fact, flourished. The pandemic has even inspired new flour businesses. Flour-delivery service West End Flour started up at the end of March via Instagram, ferrying 20-kilogram bags of K2 Milling’s Viking, Bianca, Ferdinand, and Red Tail varieties to west end denizens, all the way from Beeton. Why are people so wild for baking right now? “Comfort,” Hayhoe says. “Bread is a historically important basic food. It has been given a bit of a rough ride the past decade, and it takes times like this to realize how vital the staff of life is to humanity.”

And, so, the millers persevere, ensuring that the breadboxes of Toronto remain blessedly full. “We’re really thankful that we can keep working and that we’re able to provide our community with something that they really need right now,” McKeown says. “It’s not just the flour: it’s that sense of normalcy and making them happy. When you’re baking, you’re happy.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
568,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/sponsored_sections/saluting-the-frontlines/2020/04/24/send-in-the-clowns.html,Send in the clowns,"['Briony Smith', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Min. Read', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-24,"While medical staff continue to provide care to the children and youth of Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital in East York, Doc Hopper and Nurse Flutter are practising another kind of medicine: laughter. At a time when a little levity is needed more than ever, Holland Bloorview’s in-house therapeutic clown practitioners Doc Hopper (a.k.a. Phil Koole) and Nurse Flutter (a.k.a. Suzette Araujo), use music, slapstick and improvisation to boost the mental health of those staying at the hospital, which serves more than 7,500 families each year. Ridiculous fake deliveries cause chuckles in reserved teens, and a ukelele lures even the shyest clients out of their rooms. “It’s our hope that through humour, passion and emotional expression, we can connect with each other” says Araujo.

A Cirque du Soleil alum, Araujo has been with the hospital for more than four years; Koole joined a year and a half ago after stints on the stage. Koole was drawn to working in a hospital because, “the clown is the ultimate servant, and I wanted to put that into practice with those most vulnerable and see if the connections I made might alter their outlook on life.”

Koole remembers an immense feeling of heaviness in the wards when the pandemic shutdowns began. But once he and Araujo scrubbed in, masked up and started to perform, “we noticed a shift in the mood,” says Koole. One of their regulars, a non-verbal teen girl, had been lying in bed, unusually reluctant to join in the fun, when she slowly sat up and started grooving to the music, smiling and clapping.

A parent, face usually contorted in sadness, started to laugh. The staff felt better, too. Later that day, the clowns received e-mails from fellow hospital employees, thanking the clowns for making their day a little more fun. “We knew then that our clown service was going to be essential during these times, and we continue to experience more and more of these moments,” Araujo says.

Performing during a pandemic has, however, required a few tweaks to the clowns’ normal routines. They can’t get up close and personal with the kids, and any interaction has to happen with social distance. “This really affects our play with children that need that physical connection, and has changed the way we approach each interaction,” Araujo says. Younger kids can sometimes be playfully impulsive—pre-pandemic, this was fun, but with physical distancing rules, “it requires more attention and direction, which can change the dynamic of the play” explains Koole. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is now even more important, adding extra prep time for the comedy duo ahead of their visits. Koole’s “very sweet” girlfriend sewed him some masks to wear during his TTC commute, so he could reserve the precious PPE for use inside the hospital.

As for the clowns’ own mental health, Koole says that the risk factor associated with simply leaving the house does lead to a heavier day. “Being a therapeutic clown is an emotional job, and the palpable anxiety surrounding COVID-19 adds weight to that, which has affected me.” Thankfully the comedy duo works three days a week, leaving some time to rebuild mentally. Araujo’s husband also works in essential service, making negotiating care and education for their child more difficult. “As a clown, being present with lightness and joy is essential. And during these perilous times, that has been challenging for both of us.”

Still, the show must go on—but it’s a little easier when there’s two people on the call-sheet. “Thankfully,” Araujo says, “we have each other as clown partners.” Working as a pair is the best practice in the world of therapeutic clown work. “Working as a duo [allows us] to better support each other and better serve the clients,” according to Koole. “During the pandemic, it’s been even more imperative as we lean on each other to make it through this difficult time.”

Plus, they have another ally they can count on as well: their audience. “They make us laugh during our clown play with them, and that brings our spirits up to help perform better,” says Koole.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-24,"Meet Tyler Watts, St. Stephen’s Community House

In 2019, St. Stephen’s Community House lost provincial funding for its overdose prevention services program. Then the pandemic happened. For drug users and people in life-threatening withdrawal, support services like ERs, detox beds, shelters, drop-ins, and doctors and psychiatrists have become hard to access, according to Tyler Watts, a coordinator of overdose prevention services at St. Stephen’s. Many services have also gone phone- or web-based, which is a barrier for people that are on a fixed income or homeless.

Social isolating is also often impossible for St. Stephen’s clients—and dangerous. Watts usually urges clients to never use drugs alone. “But how do you maintain that in a society that is now told to isolate?” he asks. “Plus, they’re being criminalized for being on the streets and not isolating because there is nowhere to go. They struggle to find a drug supply that isn’t toxic and deadly and it is increasingly hard to find spaces they can use and feel safe.”

Now, every morning, a larger-than-normal line of clients snakes around the building. Only two people are allowed in at a time. If someone overdoses, employees must get into full PPE before helping. “It can be quite distressing when you’re looking at someone turning blue and you’re trying to squeeze goggles onto your face before jumping in to save them,” says Watts.

Recently, Watts says, a woman arrived at the site in tears because she had been wandering around all night, looking for somewhere to use the washroom. “She told me she’d never felt so stripped of her dignity,” Watts remembers. “It makes me so sad that people can’t even get their most basic needs met.” Still, Watts soldiers on. “The reason I come to work now is the same as it’s always been: to save lives. The pandemic hasn’t changed that—only made it that much more important.”

Meet Kylie Beatty and Theresa Hirschberg, Sistering

On any given day, more than 9,000 Toronto citizens experience homelessness. Many of them are even further marginalized. “There weren’t—and still aren’t—many specialized services that focus on women, and trans and non-binary folks,” says Theresa Hirschberg, a team coordinator at Sistering, the multi-service agency’s Parkdale Pandemic Response Site. “Sistering provides a collaborative space to advocate for the most vulnerable folks in the city.”

Before the pandemic, an average day for Hirschberg involved building relationships with clients, crisis intervention and referring people out to collaborative agencies. While the pandemic rages on, their clients still need help. “Closing the drop-in and shifting to a respite program was that ‘whoa’ moment,” says Kylie Beatty, who is also a team coordinator at Sistering’s response site. “It was clear that access to services had changed significantly, and the way we were connecting would have to change.”

So what does an average day look like now? “No two days are alike,” Beatty says. “But we’re still checking in with folks and making sure we’re all supporting each other and staying safe.” Each day, the team coordinators read up on the ever-changing interaction guidelines, and they’re outfitted in personal protective equipment (PPE). They also must screen every client for potential COVID-19 exposure, along with adhering to the distancing requirements. “We had to redefine our service model but still keep that level of participant focus and care,” says Hirschberg. “The pandemic has highlighted the willingness and capacity to come together as a community. [Clients] reassure each other and show generosity to each other—and seeing the community that they have developed in the space has been heartwarming.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Briony Smith Special To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-24,"Andrew Wyatt was never much of a FaceTime guy—he hadn’t really video-chatted with anyone until his daughter was born. But, over the course of the past month, he and his colleagues at Progress Place—a community organization specializing in mental health support—have had to go pro. Wyatt is the mental health unit supervisor at Progress Place, which, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, has taken its support services virtual. Progress Place has extended the hours of their peer support chat service, the Warm Line. There are at least three virtual support activities per day, ranging from yoga to seminars on how to keep busy at home. “I’m also regularly taking phone calls from members to chat, and provide wellness checks, and support and case management as needed,” says Wyatt.

Clients are reveling in this new form of community. “It obviously doesn’t replace the face-to-face connections, but it’s so important to see people that you know, and for someone to be excited when they see your face pop up on a screen.”

Wyatt and his fellow staffers also brave the outside world daily to deliver free meals to members who live nearby, providing wellness checks. “Food security is incredibly important for our community,” Wyatt says. “For people who are low-income, it’s a huge challenge to access healthy food. This helps provide people with a sense of hope that we’re all going to get through this together.” Recently, Wyatt says, a community partner client cried when he got his food because he was so relieved to know that he didn’t have to brave the grocery stores.

The wellness checks are essential too. When a recent check revealed that a woman had become psychotic, she was taken to the hospital to receive mental health services. Another wellness check on a woman showed that she was consumed with fever. At the hospital, she tested positive for COVID-19. She’s now back at home, quarantined, receiving regular telephone support from staff. Both checks occurred in the past 10 days.

“For years, our goal has always been outreach and preventing people from isolating at home because it can make people more symptomatic and lead to hospitalizations,” says Wyatt. “Now we’re at a point where people don’t really have a choice—they’re being told to distance and isolate. It’s critical to remember that, for a lot of people in our program, a sense of community has been taken away from them because of their illness, whether it’s because of a schizophrenia diagnosis that has left them without a job, friends or sometimes even family, or whether it’s from an anxiety or depression diagnosis that stems from bullying. So being able to facilitate virtual activities or hand out meals to our members has ensured they continue to have that same sense of community that a lot of us take for granted.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read']",2020-05-14,"In 2019, the median price of a house in Canada rose to just over $500,000, pricing many Canadians out of the market. Lachlan MacLean believes his company can help provide a solution.

“MHCs, also known as land lease communities, are the ‘missing middle’ in the housing market,” says MacLean, Vice-President Property Operations for Parkbridge Lifestyle Communities. “It’s increasingly hard for Canadians to make the jump from renting to ownership. Our model of home ownership can provide a middle step.”

Land lease is a well-established ownership model, points out MacLean, but it isn’t well-known in Canada. It allows you to purchase a home without buying the land on which it sits. The land itself is owned and maintained by the owner-operator – and the result is significant savings for buyers looking to break into the housing market.

In Edmonton, for example, you’d pay $380,000 for the average freehold home, compared to approximately $100,000 to buy a home in one of Parkbridge’s communities, located within the city. Let’s assume you put a 10 per cent down payment on a MHC home and take on a high-ratio mortgage for the remainder (manufactured homes are eligible for CMHC mortgage insurance). You would pay approximately $500 per month for your mortgage and $680 for monthly site rental on the lot where the home is situated. The grand total: about $1,200 in monthly costs.

In contrast, the carrying cost of a mortgage on a single-family freehold home of a similar size in Edmonton would be about $1,900 per month. Although you could buy a condo for less (about $225,000), you would still pay about $1,600 per month: $500 condo fee +$1100 mortgage. And renting a condo or apartment would cost about $1,700 per month — far more than the monthly payments for an MHC home.

Apart from affordability, the main draw of MHCs or land lease communities for buyers is the chance to have a yard of one’s own and to become part of a cohesive neighbourhood, according to MacLean. If you’re picturing stereotyped trailer parks, you would probably be pleasantly surprised by the tidy homes, well-kept yards and neighbourhood feel that characterize Parkbridge’s communities.

“We have communities in Canada where, if you drove in, you’d have no idea this was a manufactured home community,” MacLean says. “Manufactured homes aren’t meant to be moved. They’re not on wheels, and people build decks and landscaped gardens around them.”

Homeowners in land lease communities commit to keep up the maintenance of their homes and yards when they move in. And because they are able to build equity in their homes, they have a vested interest in making sure their properties are well-kept and attractive.

As the owner-operator of land lease communities, Parkbridge acts much like a small municipality, managing and maintaining infrastructure and services. Site rental fees in land lease communities go towards maintenance and repairs of water and sewer systems, sidewalks and roadways, common amenities such as parks and playgrounds, collection and remittance of property taxes and fees, as well as professional management and maintenance of the community. Snow removal, grass-cutting and amenities upkeep are also traditionally covered. “We’re in it for the long haul,” says MacLean. “We care about our homeowners’ enjoyment and investment in their home and community”.

To enhance the sense of community, almost all of Parkbridge’s communities offer recreation centres to hold events, such as crafts for kids, shuffleboard games and community dinners. Many also feature playgrounds and other amenities. That makes the communities particularly popular with both retirees and young families.

For retirees or empty nesters, points out MacLean, buying into a Parkbridge community can offer a chance to free up equity from the sale of their previous home and still have a yard of their own and a sense of belonging. At the other end of the spectrum, young families often purchase land lease homes as an affordable stepping stone into home ownership. “These are cohesive, supportive neighbourhoods with a strong sense of community pride,” MacLean says. “And they offer a chance to fill a very real gap in the housing market.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read'],2020-03-31,"Land lease is an affordable home ownership model that allows people to own a home without buying the land. While land lease is a well-established home ownership model in many countries, it is less well-known in Canada.

Parkbridge’s land lease communities are particularly attractive for young families looking to buy their first home and for retirees looking to free up money for life’s other priorities while still continuing to maintain and build equity. Parkbridge is a leading Canadian developer and owner-operator of land lease communities, with 55+ communities in Canada.

As Parkbridge continues to grow, it’s helping Canadians better understand how land lease works and why the option can be beneficial. Here are some frequently asked questions about land lease. To learn more, visit parkbridge.com.

Q: Is buying a home in a land lease community like buying a traditional home?

Yes! Buyers work with a real estate agent and lawyer and obtain financing as required before closing the purchase and sale agreement. Those wishing to buy a home in a Parkbridge community must make an application with the community management team and then sign a site lease. Parkbridge recommends you complete this application and have it approved before finalizing any home purchase.

Q: How do I get a mortgage on a home in a land lease community?

Homeowners in Parkbridge communities work with mortgage brokers and financial institutions to obtain financing with Canada’s major banks and credit unions. Thanks to industry awareness efforts in recent years, financing on land lease homes is now broadly available at many financial institutions and credit unions across Canada.

Q: Do homes in land lease communities increase in value?

As with other forms of home ownership, appreciation value depends on a number of factors, like location and the state of the economy. At one Parkbridge community, homes purchased between 2007 to 2017 rose in price an average of seven per cent per year. Some homes more than doubled in just six years.

Q: What legislation supports homeowners in land lease communities?

Land lease communities across Canada are governed by provincial legislation and regulations that differ slightly across jurisdictions but in all cases enforce the rights and responsibilities of both residents and land lease owners.

Q: What happens when a resident’s lease expires? Are they able to renew?

Yes, residents are able to renew their lease. The homeowner works with the land lease operator on renewing the lease agreement.

Q: Is the lease transferable upon sale of a home?

Yes. This is called an Assignment of Lease and is covered under provincial legislation.

Q: How does the new owner enter into a lease agreement with the land lease owner?

The seller informs the community management team of their intention to sell. Before finalizing the home purchase, the buyer completes a lease application.

Q: How much is rent?

Rent varies from community to community and is regulated by the respective provincial governments. Rent depends on the local market as well as the services and amenities that are provided in that community.

Q: Are land lease communities different than Manufactured Home Communities?

Manufactured Home Communities (MHCs) are the earliest example of land lease. Today, Parkbridge has modular, manufactured and traditional-build homes.

Q: Why do homeowners choose to live in a Parkbridge land lease community?

On average, the purchase price of a home in a land lease community is up to 30-per-cent less than a traditional freehold home in the same area. Parkbridge’s land lease communities are also professionally managed, often with quality amenities, which helps create a sense of community where residents feel supported and connected. Amenities can include community centres, pools, playgrounds and fitness centres. Services can include snow removal and maintenance of common areas. Amenities and services vary by community, depending on the needs and wants of the owners.

And a final advantage is that unlike other developers, Parkbridge maintains a presence in the community, investing alongside homeowners to ensure there is ongoing, thoughtful attention to community infrastructure, standards and amenities.

573,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/sponsored_sections/alternative-homeownership/2020/03/31/manufactured-homes--5-myths-exposed.html,Manufactured homes: 5 myths exposed,"['Tue.', 'March', 'Min. Read']",2020-03-31,"“The Trailer Park Boys was the worst thing that ever hit our industry,” says Al Kemp, Executive Director of the Manufactured Home Park Owners Alliance of BC. With its images of rusting trailers and chronically under-employed bad boys, the show reinforced negative stereotypes about ‘trailer parks.’ And the bad press spread to take in land lease communities and Manufactured Homes too.

Here’s the thing: such communities are as different from trailer parks as chalk and cheese. Read on for some facts that correct some common myths and misconceptions.

Fact # 1: Manufactured home ownership is a valuable option for middle income families and retirees

Mark Bourree, Senior Regional Manager, Property Operations for Parkbridge (the largest land lease owner-operator and developer in Canada says the option is increasingly popular with people of all ages and stages, but particularly with seniors and young people starting out in life. For young families, manufactured homes provide an option that costs up to 30 per cent less than a conventional home. This is because you’re paying for the house, but not the land underneath it; hence the term ‘land lease community’. And unlike apartments, they offer a yard where kids can play.

As for seniors: “A lot of people downsize from their empty nest home and move into a community of manufactured homes,” Kemp says. The two main advantages: the reasonable price ensures seniors can easily live on their pension while freeing up money for life’s other priorities. And “if you are away for a period of time, your house is absolutely secure because neighbours watch over it.”

Fact #2: Manufactured Homes are a good investment

“The law of supply and demand works in this industry as well,” says Kemp. “Let’s say you bought your home for $40,000 about 20 years ago and you’ve taken really good care of it. Now you’re ready to sell.” Depending on the location and condition, the same home might well sell for more than a new home today (in the range of $200,000), he says.

Fact # 3: A Manufactured Home is not a mobile home

The vast majority of manufactured homes are moved once and remain in place throughout their lifetime – they don’t have a hitch or wheels. As well, manufactured home communities are becoming increasingly known as ‘land lease communities.’ Canada’s largest land lease owner-operator and developer, Parkbridge, has modular, manufactured and new traditional build homes to choose from, depending on the location and community.

Fact # 4: Manufactured Homes are well-built and follow the same building codes as freehold homes

For the last 30 years, manufactured homes have been required to meet a code called Z240, similar to the requirements in Canada’s National Building Code. “They have the exact same criteria as any freehold home built in Canada,” says Bouree. Expect a solid frame, full insulation, energy saving features, gyproc walls, and a roof meant to last 25 years.

Bourree says that manufactured homes are manufactured in the tightly controlled environment of an indoor factory, then moved into place on the back of a semi trailer truck. “They’re well-designed and engineered,” he says. “And they have to be able to withstand the winds going down the highway at 100 kilometres an hour.”

Fact # 5: There is an incredible sense of community among neighbours

Many Manufactured Home Communities offer enviable locations close to major cities, as well as the kinds of amenities that draw people together, from playgrounds to community centres and hiking and walking trails. Because the communities are professionally managed, owners commit to maintaining their homes to the standards of the community as part of their lease. “It’s like having a condo board, only without the drama,” says Bourree. “Most of our residents stay for a very long time.”

What’s more, points out Kemp, unlike an apartment building, where you might be acquainted with the neighbours across the hall but not those above or below you, people in manufactured home communities tend to know each other well. “Often they organize barbecues and bingo games and garage sales,” he says. “Plus knowing your neighbours creates security – residents will question a stranger in the park.”

Read', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Starmon.']",2020-03-09,"Oh, studying: A tedious rite of passage for all college and university students, and one that conjures up images of late nights, deep yawns and endless procrastination. Between the distractions and inevitable boredom, effective studying can feel like something you wing rather than something you master.

But – like any activity – learning to study well just requires a little practice, and some useful tips from the experts.

Chris McGrath, vice president of student success at George Brown College, says it comes down to understanding your study style, and the setting you need to optimize self-learning,

Many people have an expectation “that there’s only one way to study, or one magic approach,” says McGrath. “The reality is that everyone’s brain works differently, and we are all very diverse learners.”

“Students who are struggling to get into a pattern of effective study … should reach out to one of the academic support centres on their campus. They can provide resources to help a student orient their thinking into the type of learner they are, and they can then cascade down and contemplate some really effective behaviours that will help make study time more practical.”

That might mean adjusting the way you revise depending on the topic you’re studying, and the tools you’re using.

“If I’m reading content, I can sit on my sofa (to study),” says McGrath. “If I have to write, it has to be at a desk … and I need background noise, because it stimulates my brain activity.”

There are also other variables to consider, says McGrath, including where a student tends to study: At home, in a dorm, or – for commuter students – shared spaces like libraries or cafes.

“Campuses have abundant spaces where students can really hunker down and focus with minimal distraction,” he says. “On commuter campuses I encourage (students) to think about finding a good spot on campus and accessing that space part of their regular schedule, and I encourage them to leverage their commute time (to study).”

For these students, accessing study materials in audio format may be an ideal way to review lectures or readings on the go.

Scheduling dedicated, uninterrupted study time is also an ideal strategy for those who are looking to become more efficient with reviewing course material and preparing for exams.

“The phone gets turned off, (you’re) free from distraction, in a physical environment where (you) feel comfortable and not overstimulated, and where (you) can maintain focus,” he says. “And don’t schedule anything for longer stretches than 30-minute chunks.”

That’s because our brains tend to wander after 30 minutes of intense focus, and we need to take a minute break to re-set.

“Make studying a regular habit,” adds McGrath. “Many students assume the only time they need to study is when they have a deadline but engaging in on-going review will help optimize their learning, so when deadlines approach, they don’t have to cram.”

“It’s really a test of give-and-take, and trying different techniques, but it starts with having an honest awareness of what someone’s particular approach to learning is.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Starmon.']",2020-03-09,"New students usually have a list of must-know spots on their college or university campus: the library, coffee shop, bus loop and bookstore. But campuses are full of equally important resource spaces that all first-years should familiarize themselves with if they want to make the most of their experience. And this can begin before classes even start

“Everybody’s got a Twitter feed, everybody’s got an Instagram page, says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. ""As soon as students know what university they are going to, they should follow some of those (accounts).”

Signing up to participate in your school’s orientation program is another great first step in learning not only where the arts or sciences buildings are, but also health and wellness services, writing centres, financial aid, learning support, counselling, career centres, LGBTQ+ or Indigenous groups, and other on-campus resources.

And don’t discount the value of connecting with older students. Humber College, for example, has a first-year experience program that matches new students with upper-year mentors, and runs events informed by student needs.

“It is important for students to be connected to the campus community, because often that connection leads to … a greater opportunity for success academically and personally,” says Ian Crookshank, Humber’s dean of students.

“Through connecting with the campus community, students are not only more informed in terms of what support is available, but also better able to recognize when things aren’t going quite right. During a student’s journey, bumps in the road are inevitable. Challenges can arise academically, emotionally, financially and personally. There are some students who have a support system that can help them through the bumps. For other students, that support system may need a little bolstering.

“The campus community can help to normalize what a student is going through, let them know that for every valley there will be a peak, and provide them with several ways to help find what they need to (do to) overcome. This is done by accessing resources, but also having … an open door to a space where they can be themselves, or a connection to an opportunity to grow.”

Crookshank points out that while there is a fair amount of well-intentioned discussion about the need to increase the resilience of today’s youth, that mentality also misses the point that for many of our students, life to this point has not been easy.

“The thing that is sometimes in need of development for those in first year is an understanding of how to access that resilience and resourcefulness in a post-secondary context, how to remain positive and ask for help. That’s where connection to the campus, learning about the resources, understanding the culture, etc. can be incredibly helpful. And when they feel overwhelmed or challenged, they know that there is an incredible group of people who want to see them succeed and are there to help.”

Ultimately, students should remind themselves that university and college life is about more than just academia: It’s about feeling whole and at home.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Starmon.']",2020-03-09,"Transitioning into college or university can be a lot to take on for any student, especially for those who’ve moved to a new city, or into dorms. Leaving friends, family and familiarity behind is tough, but a new community can be found on your campus – you just need to know where (and how) to look.

“It is absolutely true that our antidote to all the stress that life throws at us is our social connections,” says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. “So, when you pick somebody up and transplant them somewhere else, they lose that connection.”

Not only is it normal, but actually expected for first-year students to have bouts of loneliness, and in turn feel more stressed than normal, he says. The best way to overcome those feelings of loneliness and stress is to create a new social network where you are.

“Connect with others who share some interests that you share,” Joordens suggests. Look into clubs, teams or organizations on campus that are devoted to one of your areas of interest, and join in. Making friends with people who share your hobbies – and allowing you to discuss familiar topics – can really help students make new social connections.

If walking into a room full of strangers seems overwhelming, Joordens suggests connecting with one of the organizers or members online, first.

“A lot of students, especially with phones and social networks being so powerful, (find it) low-risk to reach out to somebody in a chat,” he says. “Find that first friend, have chats on social media, and get comfortable with that person on that platform. … It’s a less risky, more controlled way to get to know somebody, but don’t let it become a crutch or a hard chasm to cross.”

Ultimately, says Joordens, connecting in-person is the goal. A simple strategy to tackle that first get-to-know-you conversation is to ask the other person questions about themselves, which often makes the conversation go smoother.

“The reason we all find it hard (to make new friends) is we all have a mild form of social anxiety, (or fear) we will do something that makes a fool of ourselves,” says Joordens. “That’s a threat, and that threat makes our sympathetic nervous system act up. So, when we’re about to walk into a room full of strangers, that’s what makes us feel nervous.”

The trick is learning to control that fear. “Go on YouTube and look for guided relaxation videos. Rather than telling yourself to stop being nervous, you can learn to tell yourself to relax,” Joordens says.

Ultimately, being able to connect human-to-human and walk into a room full of strangers is an important skill for future success, and students will have to continue facing that fear long into adulthood.

“Yes, it will be uncomfortable, but you’ve got to do it,” Joordens says. You never know, you may make life-long friends in the process.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Canada in 2018, there has been high demand for skilled workers in all areas of the industry.

The majority of job opportunities focus on cannabis cultivation, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, and administration. Educational programs to train or certify students in these areas have been few and far between, however. Those that do exist are located far outside of the GTA.

Meeting industry demands

Centennial College is set to launch a new cannabis cultivation and processing certificate program this fall that will bridge this gap and cultivate much-needed workers in Toronto.

The entry-level part-time program will offer both theoretical and hands-on education in the cultivation of cannabis, from seed to sale.

“Most of the existing cannabis cultivation programs in Ontario are in Niagara, or Guelph, or the hinterland, and there’s a dearth of talent for us here in Toronto,” says Joe Goldfarb, curriculum developer and instructor for the new program. “We saw a gap here in the city that needed to be filled.”

Joe Goldfarb - Curriculum Developer & Instructor, Cannabis Cultivation Program, Centennial College

Cultivating the best

Students in Centennial’s new cannabis cultivation and processing program will take courses in a blended format, with practical experience at a licensed cannabis production facility. “Our program is split into two parts,” says Goldfarb, who is also the head of operations at local cannabis company Medz Cannabis and so has an insider’s understanding of the industry.

“There’s an online component and an on-site component. We’ve paired the theoretical learning with on-site learning here at our facility. Students will get hands-on experience working with cannabis plants. They’ll be helping with every single facet of the industry.”

The hands-on learning will cover working with nutrients, pest control management, different stages in the growth cycle of a cannabis plant, pruning and trimming, sanitization, documentation, and compliance with government policy, laws and regulations. It’s a well-rounded, comprehensive education. “This isn’t happening anywhere else in terms of cannabis industry education,” says Goldfarb.

The program’s courses include introduction to cannabis studies, cannabis law, cannabis cultivation theory, cannabis cultivation systems, cannabis processing theory, and formulation of cannabis products.

A reputation of excellence

Over the past 50 years, Centennial College has transformed itself from a local community college into a worldly institution, with a presence in countries like China, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

Centennial has a record of exemplary teaching, innovative programming, and extensive partnership building. This new program fits the bill in terms of the college’s reputation as a forward-thinking school.

There’s a present and growing need for well-trained staff in cultivation facilities across Canada. Centennial’s new program will prepare graduates for job opportunities in cultivation operations, quality assurance and quality control, processing, consumer education, and more.

Centennial’s cannabis cultivation and processing program is the first of its kind and is open to anyone (aged 19+) who wants to explore a career in the cannabis industry. For more information, visit centennialcollege.ca.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s because evidence suggests that artificial intelligence — or AI — will be one of the leading economic drivers of our time, with an estimated worldwide business value of $3.9 trillion USD by the year 2022.

Canada has quickly become a leader in the AI space, with research strength and transformative startups. In fact, Montreal has the highest concentration of researchers and students of deep learning (a subgroup of machine learning in AI) in the world, and Toronto has the highest concentration of AI startups in the world. As AI and machine learning are increasingly changing and improving how we do business, companies don’t want to be left behind. And with more companies adopting these technologies, the demand for high-quality talent is on the rise.



The university recognized the demand for data scientists within organizations, and the small talent pool, and decided to bridge the gap. The program aims to help put students on the right path toward a career as a data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, or AI practitioner.

Students in the program have the opportunity to work in cross-functional teams to translate learnings into business insights and help guide business decisions. “The majority of our students are mature students who have some work experience and are looking to reskill or upskill within their careers,” says Beitinjaneh, “and what they learn can be applied directly to their work.”

Jean-Olivier Pitre, a data engineer with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal’s municipal transport service, enrolled in the program to advance his skills in turning data into insight, and it paid off. “Because of the advanced analytics work that I produced with my team on how to optimize service on the Montréal metro's orange line, I received the Coup de Coeur STM award, an award given to STM employees who did astounding work for the customer experience and/or directly contributed to our 2025 organizational plan,” he says. “This wouldn’t have been possible without this program.

The School of Continuing Studies at McGill prepares individuals for jobs in the present and future, regardless of whether they’re launching their career, growing their career, or newcomers to Canada who need to rebuild their career. Launched in 2018, the undergraduate-level certificate in public administration and governance was so successful that inquiring students had to be put on a waiting list. To follow up on that success and meet the demand, McGill has launched a graduate-level diploma in the subject which has already began accepting applications and will launch this fall.

“The certificate and diploma in public administration and governance aim to help learners prepare for a career in the public sector or advance their current career positions,” says Sicilia. “The curriculum aims to strengthen students’ managerial and leadership competencies and equip them with the knowledge, analytical skills, and problem-solving strategies that are critical for success in public service organizations.”

The new programs are both completely online and follow a blended approach, meaning classes are live, allowing students to connect and interact with the course lecturer and classmates, alongside parts that are self-directed and can be done online from anywhere the student wishes to do classwork.

“Individuals don’t have to leave their jobs, their families, or their communities,” says Sicilia. “What’s so fascinating is the sharing that goes on in the classroom. Because individuals are working in various communities, learning doesn’t just come from the lecturers, but from the learners themselves.”

“The jobs are there,” says Sicilia, adding that programs in public administration and governance, like the one at McGill, give people the opportunity to get access to these careers. “We listened to what the needs are from the organizations and we asked them specifically, ‘What competencies and skills do you want individuals to come out with? Don’t give us course names. What tools or knowledge do they need to have?’”

Debbie Verduga, crime analyst

Verduga has spent more than 10 years working in GIS (geographic information systems), analyzing data spacially. Four years ago, she went to work for the Toronto Police doing crime analysis. She was recently promoted to senior data visualization and open data specialist, overseeing data and building solutions for crime analysts. Recently, Verduga decided to go back to school part time to complete her crime analytic certificate through The Chang School at Ryerson, which she expects to finish this spring. “The big advantage is that the program helps you analyze crime using state-of-the-art technology and specifically tailored techniques. The technology is always changing, so ongoing education is important. This kind of training is also great for those working in crime analysis for banks, insurance and consulting companies.”

Sherry O’Connor, critical care nurse

O’Connor finished nursing school in May 2018 and applied to Scarborough General Hospital to work in critical care, partially due to a unique opportunity to work on the unit while doing a critical care nursing program at Humber. “I wanted to be a critical care nurse and because I believe so strongly that lifelong learning is essential to my profession, this seemed like a great opportunity.” The course ran for 12 weeks; O’Connor was paid her full-time wage to do clinical hours on her unit and spend time in the classroom. “It was an intense 12 weeks but, in the end, I was fully oriented and ready with the skills I needed to work on the unit.”

Ian Hollingbery, landscape designer

Hollingbery left his corporate financial career in 2013 to pursue his passion for gardening. He worked towards his garden design certificate at George Brown while starting up his landscape design business, the Artful Gardener. “It was perfect timing because everything I learned in class, I was able to apply and use in my business.” He has continued to take advantage of the benefits of lifelong learning since finishing his certificate in 2015. Hollingbery is currently working on a certificate in horticultural therapy and hopes to develop a therapy program for teenagers with autism. He also plans to take construction courses through George Brown to help him work more knowledgably with contractors.

Charmaine Pelletier, retirement residence general manager

Pelletier had worked in the retirement field as a culinary services manager and executive chef, but in order to move ahead in her career, she decided to take the retirement communities management course through Centennial College. “With encouragement from my employer, Delmanor, I studied while I worked as interim general manager, an assistant manager, and eventually general manager.” Pelletier took one module at a time, completing all 10 modules online while she worked. “The modules gave me the full spectrum of what happens in every department. It makes you a well-rounded manager.” Pelletier’s corporate management team has seen the benefits and they have since encouraged others who are interested in management to register for the program.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Michelle Williamsspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-03-10,"Ten or 20 years ago, the lines were very distinct between full-time post-secondary education, which was primarily daytime classroom study, and continuing education, or “night school”.

In today’s world, nothing is quite as distinct. “The lines are blurring. If you ask students in full-time programs or those in continuing education, they’re all looking for flexible learning opportunities: experiential learning, learning on the job, in a lab, online,” explains Emily Milic, public relations and communications manager for Humber College. “These days, flexible learning is embedded in the DNA of most curriculums. Full-time and continuing education students have families and commitments and flexibility is key to a successful program.”

Continuing education has also changed in recent years. “It continues to provide opportunities for individuals to learn new skills or improve their existing skills, but employers are now working with the continuing education colleges on planning curriculums and ensuring their employees get what they need from the continuing education experience,” explains Milic.

Humber, for example, has an education training solutions department to directly work with individual companies. “The group works with individual companies directly to work out their needs and help them devise curriculums to reach those goals, whether that means single-day training sessions or a long-term course series,” says Milic. Most continuing education providers have relationships with corporate partners, and the arrangements are variable, but the goal is that these programs will provide educational options that work for both the learner and the corporate organization.

Why are corporations so involved in the structure of continuing education? One term used to describe today’s continuing education is open-loop learning. “It used to be that you went to school to get your credentials, then you went on to work at your career. Typically these days, though, you’re in and out of continuing education throughout your career. We are facilitating that by creating programs that meet the needs of those individuals and their employers,” says Milic.

This certainly suits the way people want to learn and the way industry wants and needs them to learn. And while industry is involved in curriculum across the board, the relationships vary. In some cases, institutions of learning are working with companies to develop very specific programs for employees, to help them develop professionally and personally. In other cases, employers help support employee advancement by offering educational assistance programs to employees.

One such relationship is between Walmart Canada and Humber as lead education partner. Walmart offers financial assistance to associates and their families, providing opportunities for tuition reimbursement and demonstrating their commitment to their employees.

Humber’s Barrett Centre for Technology and Innovation has partnership agreements with several sector companies who are working together to develop education geared to employment pathways and recruitment opportunities for Humber students and graduates. Initiatives include STEM outreach activities, robotic equipment and audio-visual systems.

Ultimately, this new role of continuing education schools partnering with corporations is working for all parties, providing win-win situations for employers and their employees.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Buick Encore, Envision, Enclave.

Maybe GM has run out of e-names, because here’s the Buick Encore GX.

Just a gussied-up Encore?

Nope.

They’re both built in South Korea, but don’t share a single nut.

Just the name.

Marketing people get paid way more to make these decisions than I do to question them...

GM calls the non-GX Encore a “subcompact” crossover, so the Encore GX, my tester, I guess becomes a “subcompact-plus” crossover.

It’s a millimetre-by-millimetre wheelbase difference business out there...

Encore GX starts at $26,098 for a front-drive “Preferred” trim level. My tester, a range-topping “Essence” which only comes with part-time selectable four-wheel drive, checked just about every option box and listed at $38,373.

It is built on a new platform, shared with Chevy’s recently launched Blazer.

It’s a handsome little thing, with a bit more character than the two-box concept of most in this class.

My tester sported a lovely “Dark Moon Blue Metallic” paint job with sparklies in it.

It’s equally handsome inside, with perforated leather seating surfaces, matte-black dash top to reduce reflections into the windshield, and also matte-finished metallic door handles and HVAC vents.

The photos here show what the dash looks like — well-designed, with clear gauges and a ton of choices for information displays.

As usual with modern cars, you’ll be months into ownership and still be discovering stuff.

My tester had all the nanny systems, but they’re easy to shut off if you don’t want them. I don’t.

Same for the head-up display.

Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and a Wi-Fi hot spot for up to seven devices highlight the high-techery.

Amazon’s Alexa is available if you’ve got a weekend to spend learning how to use it.

It isn’t quite “natural speech,” but it’s getting there.

Most minor controls are by the dreaded push buttons. At least radio volume and the HVAC system have proper round knobs so you can work them without taking your eyes off the road.

You’ll have lots of places to store stuff, with cup holders and cubby bins galore.

Allergy sufferers will rejoice over the air ionizer system which helps remove pollen and dust from the car.

The front seats are really short in cushion length, so if you like lots of thigh support, this might not be your car. I found it acceptable (I’m five-foot-10), but I didn’t take any long trips.

The main dimensional difference between Encore and Encore GX is wheelbase. This translates into decent rear seat legroom for two (three is a bit of a squeeze).

The rear seat-back split-folds one-third/two-thirds, and the front passenger seat can fold flat for added luggage-carrying flexibility.

The two-level trunk also has decent capacity.

A button on the driver’s door lets you open the power liftgate all the way, halfway (for those low apartment garage ceilings) or to shut it off altogether. Not sure why you’d want that.

The 1.3-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine produces a modest 155 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m., but a healthy 174 lb.-ft. of torque, which peaks at a low 1,600 r.p.m. and stays pretty much at that level until 4,000.

It scores 9.0 l/100 km city, 8.0 l/100 km highway.

The lowest number I recorded was 8.1; interesting that this was a bit worse than the bigger Jeep Cherokee I tested immediately beforehand.

As they say, “your mileage may differ.”

Sometimes you get into a car, and it just feels right. Both Lady Leadfoot and myself felt this way about the Encore GX.

The engine feels surprisingly peppy with no marked turbo lag. That low peak torque peak r.p.m. number helps here.

It is also surprisingly quiet, not as raspy as most three-bangers.

It cruises at common (if not technically legal) highway speeds with ease.

The nine-speed autobox has a ratio for every purpose; drive gently and you might never see three grand...

You can switch to manual shift mode, but in a car like this, I’m not sure why you’d want to.

The ride is on the firm side by historical Buick standards, but I’ll take that every time.

The steering is light and precise, and the car’s small size makes it feel nimble.

The “AWD” button on the console locks the car into four-wheel drive mode; otherwise, it’s an on-demand deal.

Good weather during my test didn’t give me much chance to test this, but quick acceleration runs on a gravel road with and without the system engaged showed it can make a difference.

So, how does one choose from what must be a dozen smallish crossovers currently available?

They’ve all been market-researched to death, so all offer roughly the same features at similar prices.

Let me make that decision a bit tougher by recalling an old Buick ad slogan: “Wouldn’t you really rather have a Buick?”

In the case of the Encore GX, you just might.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Former Star Editor Who Is A Current Freelance Columnist. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-03,"I was driving out of my neighbourhood one day recently and, as I pulled onto a main road, a car followed me. I didn’t recognize it, or the driver. He seemed to be in a hurry and was right on my tail.

The main road passes a school. Although school’s been out for three months, there are still yellow flashing lights and a sign saying the speed limit had dropped from 50 km/h to 40 and, as I always (usually) follow the rules, I didn’t go faster than 40. Although there was room to pass, the guy behind me didn’t but hung right on my back bumper.

We passed through several traffic lights and finally pulled onto a ramp leading to Highway 403. Every step of the way, he was right there. And I mean right there. One false move and he’d have hit me. Even my wife noticed: “What’s his problem?” she wondered aloud.

Now, two paragraphs ago, I stated that I always follow the rules. I must admit that I sometimes take liberties. In this instance, while driving down the ramp to the 403, instead of accelerating slowly so that I’d be going the posted speed limit of 100 km/h when I reached the merge lane, I had the accelerator pedal down a little further so I was going — ahem — 120 when I pulled onto the highway.

And Mario Andretti behind me, obviously agitated that I hadn’t pulled completely off the road to let him past and was even closer than he’d been previously, just floored it and rocketed past me and across two more lanes of highway till he reached the HOV lane and by then he was going at least 140 and still had the hammer down.

“That boy’s got problems,” I thought, as I eased back to 100-110, like the goody two-shoes I am every time I’m on the highway.

Now, we’ve all had bad thoughts about other drivers. “What a jerk,” we think, or worse. But this time I thought I’d get a learned opinion about what’s really going on in the heads of people who almost seem out of control, or close to it, when it comes to driving.

So I called an old chum, a guy I went to university with way back when, who retired recently as a senior mental health professional with one of the 10 provinces. He requested anonymity, as he’s no longer on the job and doesn’t need the aggravation that controversy can sometimes bring, like: “Why did you put my name in the paper? Have you seen Twitter?”

So I asked him: “What is with these people, anyway?” And this is what he said:

“Your personality is formed in one of two ways, some of which is learned and some of which is hard-wired. It goes back to how you came into the world and how you react to certain stimuli.

“For instance, you can look at some children — line them up in the nursery — and there will be a flash of light or a loud noise. Some will be cool; they won’t react. Others will hear the same noise and they’ll be startled. They’ll start crying because their nervous system gets overloaded more easily.

“So, if you’re hard-wired like that and you’re in an environment that is unpredictable, that could intensify anger. In some cases, you can’t tolerate a lot of tension, which shows itself in different ways: impatience, hostility and aggression, which make people more vulnerable to losing control. Most of us have this in us but we have the self-control to put a stop to it.

“Learned behaviour, on the other hand, is something you’ve seen very early in your life. You see your dad do something and it makes an impression. Those early kinds of experiences are the ones that, unless there’s some sort of positive change, can really get set in.

“We know that during this whole COVID thing, there’s been a lot of stress. People’s tolerances are worn down. The personality vulnerabilities start to come to the fore a bit more. I’m thinking of a former client who was telling me he had to really watch himself and gauge where his anxiety levels were in order to not get into trouble with other people on the road and getting really angry and doing something that would put his family in risk. He wasn’t a road rager but he was able to realize that this was not the better part of who he was.”

I told him I wished more drivers had such insight. In fact, every morning when I listen to the accident reports on 680 News or CP24, I become convinced that most of them are caused by people who don’t have complete control of their emotions, like the guy who tailgated me for blocks and then just missed hitting the back of my truck when he blasted past and onto the 403.

Being on a roll, I continued by saying that I thought it was ludicrous that people are given a licence to drive when they are in their mid-teens and then never have to take another driving examination in their whole life. In fact, I said, people should have to be retested every five years and something should be added: much like people over 80 have to take a dementia test, that every-five-years driver’s exam should include a psychological test and those found to be a ticking time bomb should lose their licence until they go through counselling.

My friend paused, then said that a test makes sense theoretically but he’s not sure if it’s practical. “But it’s a perfectly reasonable question to ask,” he said. “It’s worth talking about and certainly would provoke a lot of thinking, a lot of discussion.”

To many people, that’s all they want to know about tires.

But both Michelin and Pirelli have used the same marketing slogan at various points in time:

“Your tires are the only parts of your car that actually touch the road.”

In other words, tires are not where you should compromise.

A chat last week with Chris Gelinas of OK Tire in Essex, Ont., brought up an issue I had not thought of.

“In these difficult COVID-19 times, when some people are afraid to even leave their homes,” he says, “many people have not got around to switching out their winter tires.”

Winter tires have a more pliable tread compound, designed to conform to varying road surfaces when the temperature dips below about 7 C. They’re not just “snow” tires anymore.

Gelinas points out that running winters all summer, especially in hot weather like we have experienced these past two weeks, could reduce their life by as much as 60 per cent.

By next winter, they’ll probably only be good to nail to your dock to keep your boat from getting scratched, so you’ll have to get new winters anyway.

Make the switch now, and save yourself money in the long run.

Like many businesses, Gelinas’s OK Tire store — officially, “Beau’s All Everything” — has adapted during the pandemic.

Service is by appointment only.

They allow fewer people in the store at any one time.

Each car is thoroughly disinfected before and after servicing.

Each technician wears a new pair of rubber gloves for each car.

They have also gone to an entirely no-touch, paperless billing system. Everything is done using laptops. They take photos of your tires to show you how they look.

“So,” Gelinas says, “don’t be afraid to call for an appointment!”

While these procedures were instituted due to COVID-19, they will likely be permanent because it’s just a better way of doing business.

One thing Gelinas is adamant about — you should check your tire pressures no less than once a month.

Not only might this save you from a calamity if a tire blows, it will improve your gas mileage.

“If the pressures are down by just 2 psi, it can cost you about four per cent in fuel consumption,” he says.

You should also keep an eye on tread depth. If you don’t have a proper tread gauge, a toonie makes a good option.

“Stick it between the tread blocks,” he says. “If the tread comes up to the bear’s paws on the ‘tails’ side of the coin, you’re good.

“If it only covers the silver part of the coin, you’re at about half tread depth, and performance will start to diminish.”

Our conversation went on to include a number of other tire-related issues which we don’t have space to cover here, including “all-season” tires (which I call “no-seasons” because they’re no good in summer and no good in winter either); the newer “all-weather” tires which earn the “green mountain” label and therefore qualify for a premium discount with some insurance companies; tire pressure monitoring systems; and which brands of tires are best (I like Michelins, he likes Toyos, but he will sell you almost any brand, because there is strong brand loyalty in tires).

But we agree on this — a little bit of preventive tire maintenance can make a huge difference.

Not only will it save you money, it will also reduce your chances of being involved in a serious crash.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-26,"Ford is bringing back the Mach 1 model designation on a Mustang after a 17-year hiatus.

First, this is a genuine “Mach” version of a genuine Mustang.

I still can’t believe Ford is using both of those fabled nameplates on a four-door electric truck.

Shame, shame, shame.

Don Frey, chief engineer on the original Mustang, would turn in his grave if he knew what to turn in it for.

The newest Mustang will be a real Mustang. It will be a 2021 model year car and goes on sale that spring.

Prices? Way too soon, but the car will be positioned between the Mustang GT (2020 price, $34,790) and the Shelby GT350 ($76,425).

Obviously a huge gap.

The Mustang Bullitt with which the Mach 1 shares some bits currently lists at $52,500, so my guess for the Mach 1 is somewhere north of that, probably high-50s.

By the way, no confirmation that the Bullitt edition will survive into 2021.

If you want one, it may already be too late.

During an online press conference, Tom Barnes, vehicle engineering manager for Mustang, and Jim Owens, Mustang and Shelby marketing manager, gave a group of Canadian journos some technical details of the new Mach 1.

A revised front end provides extra cooling for both engine and transmission. Some styling tricks like “go-faster” stripes bridge the gap to earlier generations.

As Owens noted, “Anything that bears this badge has to look right, it has to look to its heritage.”

Barnes added, “People who know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a Mach 1.’

“People who don’t know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a really cool car.’”

Revised trim inside includes a numbered serial plate.

Ford won’t say how many Mach 1s it’ll build, only that it is a “limited edition.”

I couldn’t even get them to say how many digits that serial number would contain...

Those planning to track the car will probably want to opt for the Recaro seats.

Barnes and Owens suggested “balance” is the key to the new Mach 1.

Their mantra is that Mach 1 will be “the pinnacle of Mustang 5.0-litre performance,” the “5.0-litre” caveat necessary because the 5.2-litre flat-plane-crankshaft Shelby GT350 and the supercharged 5.2-litre GT500 will outrun it.

That’s because Mach 1 gets essentially the same 5.0-litre V-8 engine as the Bullitt, providing 480 horsepower at 7,000 r.p.m. and and 420 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,600 r.p.m. Should be good for 0-100 km/h in the low- to mid-five-second range.

It will be mated to a six-speed Tremec manual gearbox, with rev-matching for smooth downshifting.

It also features the cool cue-ball shift knob.

Shiftless types can opt for a 10-speed automatic, which has been massaged for sportier on-road and on-track performance.

Suspension includes MagneRide dampers, still the best in the game in my view, and stiffer steering shaft, sway bars and front springs.

Bigger and better brakes are part of the deal.

19x9.5-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels are shod with Michelin PS4 tires.

A Handling Package, available only with the stick shift, brings even fatter wheels and tires, and a host of aerodynamic features which generate 150 per cent more downforce than Mustang GT when equipped with its comparable performance pack.

A rear subframe with stiffer bushings and a rear toe link lifted from the Shelby GT350 will further improve grip.

Underneath, a longer belly pan again aids aerodynamics.

The objective was to make the car fast on the track, but still ultimately “street-able.”

I’d love to tell you if they succeeded, but obviously, a virtual car launch can only tell us so much.

The Ford folks think this car is amazing. But then, they would, wouldn’t they?

I really liked the Bullitt, the GT350 and the GT500, so I imagine the Mach 1 won’t disappoint.

Can hardly wait to confirm that for you.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to tell my friends that instead of a summer cottage, I had a standing reservation for Room 326 at the Best Western Captain’s Quarters in Oswego.

But because of COVID-19, CTMP has had to cancel all its spectator racing programs so far this year and, as of this moment, there will not be a Grand Prix du Canada.

I was thinking about this the other day and I thought that my wife and I could drive down east to visit my sister in Nova Scotia, but then it struck me: Upper Canadians (and everybody else in the country, it seems) are persona non grata these days in the Maritimes.

Out west, I won’t find police at the borders telling me to get lost, but Canada is a huge place and if you meander, it will take you half your holiday to get to Vancouver and then you would have to beat it home to either go back to work or be ready if your employer should call.

Which leaves Ontario, and according to my good friend Bob Verwey, is there any place you’d rather be? “The great thing about the border being closed,” he was telling me the other day, “is that people can get to experience what Ontario has to offer.”

Now, as well as travelling to races during the summer, I have been on the road frequently the past two years to cover the unveilings of new cars. Anybody who’s spent as much time on planes and unfamiliar hotels as I have (and that includes the world-famous Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo) knows that you always pack hand wipes to give the TV remote a good cleaning, as well as the telephone receiver and the toilet seat.

Now, with all due respect to the hotels and motels in the cities and towns of Ontario, if I don’t trust places like the Hôtel de Paris to sanitize TV remotes when times are good, I’m not sure I would be too happy booking into any hotel in the midst of a pandemic.

But my pal Mr. Verwey reminded me that there is an alternative: people can take a motorhome holiday.

Full disclosure: Bob Verwey sells motorhomes and travel trailers, and rents them out, at Owasco RV Centre, east of Oshawa. He’s a former president of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, which is how I know him.

“You get a motorhome or trailer, it’s disinfected and you can keep it that way,” said Verwey, who also owns three car dealerships and a collision repair centre. “Nobody has to go in there except you and your family. You go into a motel and you think about the virus and who was in the room before you. Not with your motorhome.”

The RV salesman was quickly in full flight. “Some people worry that motorhomes are hard to drive. They’re not. Just get in and drive. All your stuff is in there. You have your plates, forks and knives — everything. You have your stove and fridge. You have your water on board, generators are on board. It’s like your cottage on wheels.

“I was in Florida, at an airport, taking a three-day course (Verwey has a plane and has to take a three-day refresher every year to satisfy insurance and other requirements). We took a motorhome and stayed right in the parking lot. We felt better doing that rather than booking into a motel.”

He said there are plenty of places to park a motorhome or trailer. “Walmart lets you stay in their parking lots because you’re probably going to do your food shopping there and buy other supplies. Truck stops are also free because you‘re going to fuel up. And there are rest stops on the sides of highways all over the province, so you just pull off the road and they all have a place for RVs.”

If you buy, prices for a new trailer that’s perfect for a family of four start at around $20,000. Class A motorhomes (the Taj Mahals of the motorhome set) can run from $140,000 to much higher — but remember: it’s like buying that cottage. If you want to rent, ask Owasco or dozens of other motorhome retailers around the province for a price list.

I’m stuck at home these days, but I’ve always wanted a motorhome. My wife? Not so much. Guess who’s still dreaming?",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-26,"A couple of years ago, I was having dinner with Bill Ford, executive chairman of his family business (name dropper...).

He said Ford could build a year’s run of F-Series pickup trucks — over a million units — and not build exactly the same truck twice.

They don’t, but it just shows the variation in this product line.

Wheelbase. Length. Box size and configuration. Rear- or four-wheel drive. Trim levels. A host of powertrain configurations. A pages-long option list.

My “King Ranch” tester is the pinnacle of the range, named after a huge ranch in Texas, where, not coincidentally, some 40 per cent of this model is sold.

It starts at $71,949; my tester was optioned to a whopping $83,769. The six-figure pickup truck is not far off...

Given that the base F-150 starts at $30,339 (and discounting is rampant among pickups), this is equivalent to the most expensive house in an inexpensive neighbourhood.

King Ranch comes only in the SuperCrew configuration, with a full rear seat, four big doors, the six-and-a-half-foot box and four-wheel drive.

Concerns were raised when this 13th-generation F-Series launched for the 2015 model year because of its aluminum body. Would it stand up? Could any body shop repair it?

But it’s still the bestselling vehicle in the game. Body shops have to adapt.

My tester had the FX4 off-road package, with electronic locking rear differential, hill descent control, skid plates, off-road front dampers and badging to let your neighbours know you paid more for your truck than they did for theirs.

It was painted a lovely sparkly blue, with King Ranch decals and logos all over the place, inside and out.

You might not think that tan leather upholstery would go with a blue exterior, but it seems to work.

The interior is well-executed, and the matte finish on top of the dash reduces reflections.

An eight-inch screen in front of the driver offers bright, clear tachometer and speedo, with smaller gauges for such as fuel level, coolant temperature and oil pressure in between.

Ford’s SYNC3 control system for SatNav et al. has a vastly faster-reacting touchscreen than earlier iterations, and voice recognition which will take some time to get used to, as these always do.

Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hot spot, USB outlets front and rear, and 110-volt outlets in the dash and in the pickup bed rank among the high-tech features.

Nice round knobs look after the lovely Bang & Olufsen sound system and the dual zone auto AirCon with its four massive dash vents.

The comfy front seats are 10-way power adjustable.

The three-seat rear bench features a fold-down centre console when just two are aboard.

The rear seat cushion lifts to create a floor-to-ceiling cargo area and reveal hidden under-seat storage.

Cup holders and cubby bins galore, and a massive multi-level centre console bin configurable to your personal taste.

Now, when a truck offers power deployable running boards, that’s a sign the truck is too big. But they did make it easier to clamber in and out.

You must stand back when these deploy to ensure they don’t “ankle” you (adapting the term “kneecap” for a lower portion of your leg).

My tester also had side steps behind the rear doors. Kick a lever and these pop out to ease climbing up to see what’s in the box. Unlike the running boards, these do not automatically retract, so make sure you do so before pulling away or you risk “ankling” pedestrians.

The tailgate has a fold-out step ladder to ease access into the bed, which features hooks and tie-down points everywhere. A wide range of accessories is available to aid hauling bikes, canoes, all sorts of kit.

My tester had the 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6, producing 375 horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque. To it was bolted Ford’s 10-speed automatic, which can be set to Normal, Tow/Haul, Snow/Wet, Eco and Sport modes, to optimize performance for each of those aptly-named settings.

The combination gives good performance, and with 10 ratios, you might never see 3,000 r.p.m. if you don’t push it too hard. This should result in decent real-world fuel consumption.

I left the truck in “4x2” mode because I didn’t do any off-roading, and enjoyed nice weather during my test.

In Canada, you will not be so lucky, so a knob on the dash lets you select “4x4 automatic,” which engages the front wheels as it deems necessary; “4x4 high,” which keeps you in “four-by” mode; and “4x4 low” for the really tough going.

My main complaint with the powertrain is the shifter. You must depress a button in the shift knob to release it from Park, but it’s much too easy to pull the lever all the way back to the “M” (for “manual”) position. Then you’ll stay in first gear until you manually select second. Or until you shove the lever one notch back into Drive, where it should have been in the first place. A stronger detent is needed.

Ride quality with the off-road suspension is a bit firm. Unless you’re planning some serious boonie bashing, I’d leave this box on the order form unchecked.

The steering is light, direct and communicative, and the truck is easy to manoeuvre.

But wow, is it big. The large turning circle makes it a handful in the Canadian Tire lot or a parking garage.

A lot of people have difficulty backing up with a trailer attached because you have to steer right to turn the trailer left. With Ford’s system, turn a knob on the dash left if you want to steer the trailer to the left.

Experienced trailer towers will be confused; newbies will love it.

The F-Series passes my side-view mirror adjustment test — you can crank them out far enough to eliminate the no-longer-blind-spots.

But this truck’s blind-spot warning system is actually somewhat relevant because it extends coverage to beside a trailer which might otherwise be hiding an approaching vehicle.

Sadly, like all Fords, it fails the ignition-off/lights-automatically-off test. Come on, people.

My tester included the “Technology” package, which brings the handy overhead 360-degree camera system, a pop-out washer to keep the front grille camera lens clean, and “active park assist” to guide you into a parking spot.

Normally I hate these things — didn’t you have to learn to park to get your licence?

But with a truck this big, you may need all the help you can get.

Oh, did I mention this truck is big?

The pickup truck market is the most brand-loyal in the industry. If you’re a Ford person, you won’t likely consider a Chevy or GMC, and vice versa.

My daughter Dr. Laura (the veterinarian) has always wanted a Ram 4x4. Diesel engine, of course.

Even she was impressed with the F-150 King Ranch.

I can hardly imagine higher praise.

“All-new” Ford F-150 reveal

In an online presentation earlier this week, Ford introduced what it is calling the “all-new” 2021 F-Series pickup truck, which will go on sale somewhere around the end of this year.

“All-new”?

Well, the 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid engine is new. The 10-speed automatic is now standard across the board. The infotainment system is now SYNC4 and is an in-house Ford product, replacing the BlackBerry QNX platform used previously.

The console-mounted shift lever can be folded down to allow deployment of a huge working surface for laptops and other gear.

Presumably not when you are driving.

Seats that fold flat into makeshift beds so you never have to go home.

More self-driving technologies — just what we need in a huge truck on our crowded highways.

A bunch of upgrades to the pickup box and to in-cab storage systems.

On-board electric power availability for work site or campsite equipment.

Oh yes, the available deployable running boards now go all the way to the back of the truck, eliminating the need for the side step-up assist thing I mention in the review of the 2020 F-Series elsewhere today.

Wow. Call the Nobel Prize committee.

Ford researches the daylights out of its truck customers. No doubt these will be useful modifications to this vehicle.

But, “all-new”?

More than a bit of a stretch.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-19,"Normally, a new vehicle launch involves presentations by the designers, engineers and/or marketers, followed by a ride-and-drive so we can report our findings about what it’s like to our audiences.

In today’s COVID-19-ravaged environment, a group ride-and-drive is pretty much out of the question. So the product presentations have become virtual, using apps like Skype or Zoom. These allow us to learn about, hence report on, what the manufacturers think about their new babies.

But we can’t draw much in the way of our own conclusions because we can’t drive them.

Better than nothing?

Let’s see.

One such event was the recent virtual launch of the 2021 Nissan Rogue.

We were joined by Nissan executives Steve Milette (president), Scott Pak (senior manager, product planning), Marcel Guay (senior manager, marketing) and Adam Paterson (director, marketing).

The compact Rogue has been the MVP on Nissan’s team, leading the company’s sales since 2012.

The third generation will arrive in showrooms this fall.

Prices have not been announced, but given the ultracompetitive nature of this huge segment, they aren’t expected to be much different from the current range, which is $27,498 to $37,998.

Nissan is confident in the styling of the new truck. The “V-motion” grille, a motif seen on other recent Nissans, is perhaps the main differentiator in a field where, frankly, most people would have trouble telling one from another if you took the badges off.

Rogue is pretty much all-new. Increased use of ultra-high-strength steel (from 19 per cent of the body to 35 per cent), aluminum (hood, front fenders, door skins) and composites (tailgate) yield a body that’s 27 per cent stiffer. Yet the finished product weighs around 40 kilograms less, which is even more impressive when you consider the extra equipment on the new model.

The 2.5-litre four-cylinder engine, while the same size as before, is in fact a new engine, shared with Altima. It provides 181 horsepower and 181 lb.-ft. of torque.

The continuously variable transmission has been re-engineered to reduce internal friction by 29 per cent, which should improve fuel consumption.

A multi-link rear suspension should benefit both ride and handling.

Rogue offers front-drive models in the two lower trim levels (S and SV). Four-wheel drive is standard in Platinum, and available on the other two grades. It runs mainly as a front-driver, but can quickly send torque to the rear wheels as deemed necessary.

Classier-looking interiors offer more room. Nissan’s justly praised NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” seats are now fitted front and rear.

Loads of storage spaces everywhere, and one-litre water bottles will even fit in the door pockets.

Although some in this class offer three rows of seating, Rogue remains a five-seater. Each of the rear seats has child safety seat attachment points.

The rear doors open 85 degrees, making the loading of stuff, kiddies and notably those child safety seats much easier.

Privacy shades are available for those rear seats, too — unheard of in this class.

The “divide and hide” trunk allows hiding your valuables. There’s even a spot back there for a 3.7-litre bottle of windshield washer fluid, apparently a Canada-only thing.

Nissan seems particularly proud of the 31.2 inches of total screen in the Platinum trim level in this car.

That’s 12.3 for the digital dashboard, nine for the central display and 10.8 for the head-up display, which of course doesn’t count for me because I always switch them off.

Three-zone AirCon (front left, front right, rear seat) helps everyone stay comfy.

Also available is a magic Bose 10-speaker sound system.

Nissan claims the focus in the inside was on quietness. Wind, road and engine noise have been handled with such as acoustic laminated glass, the stiffer body shell and a thicker insulation pad on the firewall.

Nissan’s nanny systems include emergency braking forward and backward, something called “cut-in” protection (somebody must drive on the 401).

With the PROPILOT Assist with Navi-Link in the Premium trim, an auto-resume in the cruise control system will re-accelerate the car even if it has been sitting for up to 30 seconds.

If you drive a lot in heavy traffic, you’re gonna love this.

Nissan pioneered the simulated overhead camera view, which makes parking in tight spots much easier.

Rogue has “tech” covered with a wireless phone charger, a Wi-Fi hot spot, four USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, standard on all trim levels.

Nissan will continue to aim Rogue at Toyota RAV-4 and Honda CR-V, which remain two of the bestselling vehicles in our market.

On paper, it looks like it will make a good case for itself.

He Reviews The Weekend S Auto Racing Every Monday At Wheels.Ca.']",2020-06-19,"This column today is about customer service. Nothing more.

When I was a teen in Niagara Falls, I sold men’s and boys’ clothing in summer at the long-gone Rosberg’s Dept. Store. The pay was good for a high school kid and I learned a lot of life lessons in that place.

I’ve mentioned him before, but a man who had a profound influence on my life was my manager, Morris (Mo) Feinberg. He’s the guy who said to me: “Remember, the customer comes first, even before your mother. And the customer is always right.”

I never forgot that.

When the pandemic struck, my local Ford store called and cancelled an appointment I’d made to have them give my truck the once-over and to change my tires from winter to summer. “We’ll be in touch when we’re open again,” the woman who’d called me said.

Two or three weeks ago, while driving past, I’d noticed they’d reopened. “They’ll call me and book an appointment,” I thought. “That’s what they’d said they’d do.”

About a week after that, I got a text: “Hey Norris, if you haven’t booked your vehicle in for service yet, this is just a friendly reminder to get in touch with us.”

“Gee,” I thought, “they called me to cancel and said they’d be in touch when they were back in business. They opened up and didn’t call me and now I have to call them.”

I called and made an appointment.

Now, pre-pandemic, if you took your vehicle in for servicing, you had a choice: you could wait or they would shuttle you home and pick you up when the job was done. Good customer service. But it’s a different world now. Nobody wants to get sick with COVID-19. When I arrived at my dealer’s, I had to park the truck, lock it and put the keys in an envelope that went through a slot. That was it. I was then on my own.

I don’t live dozens of kilometres away from that Ford store, but it’s a long walk. It’s a pain to take public transit because I would have to wait for a bus and then change to another to get to the street where I live. So I called a cab. (I always carry a mask, rubber gloves and sanitizer with me when I go out, so I felt safe.) And I had to call a cab to go back. And the tab for servicing, plus tire storage, an alignment and some brake work, plus labour and tax, came to just under $900.

When I saw the bill, I said to myself that for $900, they should have provided me with transportation, at the very least.

By coincidence, the very next day I got a call from a friend of mine who owns several auto dealerships in the GTA. He is suffering from serious Formula One withdrawal and wanted to talk about his addiction. Without telling him about my personal experience, I asked him what he did for customers coming in for service.

“We’ve cleared out our showrooms and put up some cubicles because social distancing is very important,” he said. “If someone can wait for their car, they can sit in there and read a book, or something. When they leave, we disinfect for the next guest. Meantime, if the work is going to take longer than a couple of hours, we call an Uber and send them home and then we Uber them back when their car is ready.”

“Ah, the difference in customer service,” I thought. “My friend owns dealerships and has concern; my Ford store is owned by a corporation, which doesn’t.”

If Mo Feinberg was still around, he’d have words with them.

There is another way, of course. What if you could have your car serviced at home? In your driveway, or parking place at your apartment or condo? The service people could come to you. And that’s where LubeVan Mobile Auto Services Inc. (lubevan.ca) came in. I had a fascinating chat this week with Ryan Dach, who founded the business, and Matthew Bingley, the president of the company that services vehicles in the GTA and Hamilton.

They — and there are other similar services out there, although not many — do everything that dealerships do so far as servicing your vehicle is concerned — oil, filters, latch lubrication, check all fluids, rotate your tires and so on. They will change your summer tires to winter and back again and will store the tires for you.

The big jobs — brakes, milky coolant that has to be drained — they don’t touch but will refer you to a proper shop if you don’t know of one. “Nobody should be doing anything surrounding coolant or antifreeze out in the street; it’s a very dangerous thing for the environment,” Dach said. “We want to be responsible in everything we do.”

And while their prices are slightly higher (example: oil and filter = $65 plus tax), they are not out of line and are worth it for the extra convenience.

Just like my engineering class’s quarterly lunch meeting last week.

Why do I mention that?

Simply because it showed the advantages of using the internet to cyber-connect with like-minded people.

In our class meeting’s case, it allowed more of us to communicate with more of our classmates than a physical meeting would.

First, it enabled those who live far from Toronto to participate. Also, at a “physical” lunch, you’re pretty much chatting only with the three or four people seated closest to you. With the virtual setup, you have more flexibility and can cover more ground.

Likewise with the virtual Yorkville Exotic Car Show, which we have planned for Sunday, starting at 1 p.m. EDT.

You don’t have to be in the GTA to enjoy it, because you can view it live using Instagram.

Just search for the account @yorkvilleecs (for “Yorkville Exotic Car Show”) on Instagram. You can then pick up the live video, which will appear in the upper left-hand corner of the page. At least, that’s what I’ve been told! If you have any issues, find a teenager...

On this virtual show, we will have sessions with a wide variety of automotive experts.

Ron Fellows, one of Canada’s best-ever race car drivers, a member of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a recipient of the Order of Canada, will be showing you the new Corvette C8 from the fabulous Mosport circuit. (OK, it is officially “Canadian Tire Motorsports Park,” but it will always be “Mosport” to me.)

At press time, we were not sure whether Ron would be able to drive the car on the track on Sunday. He and I share at least one thing — we both have driven it, on a racetrack (the Spring Mountain circuit in Nevada where Ron runs his racing school). And we agree — it is beyond brilliant.

Speaking of brilliant, a Porsche 935, the twin-turbo purpose-built race car version of the 911, will be displayed by Steve Bortolotti, manager for Pfaff Motorsports. The 935 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race overall in 1979, and Steve will tell you how it did it.

Yours truly will be on the show, live from Legendary Motorcar Company in my hometown of Milton.

Among the vast array of fantastic cars that Legendary’s owner Peter Klutt has assembled is an extremely rare Ferrari F50 — one of just 399 ever built. I’ll give you a walk-around of this wonderful carbon-fibre-chassis car, the likes of which few car freaks will ever see in person.

Is it red? Does a bear ... well, never mind. Yes, it is “rosso corsa” — “racing red.”

I’m trying to figure out how to jump into it and drive it away. The fact that it’s on the second floor of Legendary poses a bit of an issue.

Vajid Khan is chair of Cars & Chai, a car club whose members apply their passion for fine cars to do good works in the community, such as delivering meals to front-line workers during this pandemic. He will feature his Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, a car you’re not likely to see often in the streets of — well, anywhere, actually.

Over the years, the Yorkville Exotic Car Show has raised money for Prostate Cancer Canada (PCC). Guys like cars. So do many women. But only guys get prostate cancer.

Phil Downe, the founder and chair of the show, notes that to date, the event has raised over $300,000 towards fighting this scourge. PCC is now a part of the Canadian Cancer Society, so the show’s beneficiary is now the CCC.

In these current times, it’s difficult to get much traction about any disease that isn’t COVID-19. But the fact remains that prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among Canadian men. And one of the most frustrating aspects of it is that to a considerable extent, it is treatable, often curable.

The key to either is early detection.

Adding to the frustration is that there is a test that helps determine if you are afflicted. The PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) test is a simple procedure that can give you that critical early warning sign.

The Yorkville Exotic Car Show on Father’s Day has particular significance for me.

First, I am a father — four kids, who are wonderful, thanks mainly to their mom.

Second, I obviously love cars. They are my passion, my livelihood.

Third, I’ve been with the Star for a while now, and the Star is the official media sponsor of the event.

And, I am in that age range, over the age of 60 (yes, I know, hard to believe...), which has to be most concerned about this disease.

Personally, I am on what my doctor calls “active surveillance” — no symptoms or other issues to worry about so far, but it’s a way of circumventing the ridiculous situation in Ontario that prostate cancer tests are otherwise not covered by OHIP.

All other provinces except British Columbia’s Medical Services Plan (MSP) cover them.

Why not Ontario and B.C.?

You will have to ask your MPP.

I mean, berate your MPP.

So especially if you are over the age of 40, doubly especially if there’s a history of prostate cancer in your family — get tested.

Women, encourage the men in your life — husbands, fathers, sons, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, just plain friends — to get tested.

Younger people, tell the older men in your lives — get tested.

It sometimes isn’t an easy subject to bring up. But it’s a lot easier than writing something nice to say at their funeral.

Did I mention — get tested?

True, there have been some issues raised about the efficacy of testing. False positives can sometimes lead to unnecessary treatment.

But it’s still the best weapon we have.

Also, depending on how old you are, the sad fact is that something else might get you before prostate cancer does; despite the advances of modern medical science, the death rate is still 100 per cent.

But there’s no point in checking out before your time is due.

So — get tested. And also be sure to join us Sunday at 1 p.m. on Instagram.

It might cost money, but it will be worth it. The insurance companies will love it, because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the vultures out there. And Ford would likely win re-election in a walk because anybody (and there are many) who’s ever been taken to the cleaners by those outlaws will thank him with their votes.

I was driving down a ramp leading to the eastbound 401 the other day when a grey tow truck just blew past me. It was as if I was standing still. I knew immediately where he was going.

There had been a call for a tow truck further along the 401. And this guy was racing to get to the scene before other tow-truck drivers arrived.

To the winner would go the spoils.

Be assured, there are hundreds of tow-truck companies in Ontario that are honest. You can count among them those connected with the CAA. But there are still way too many crooks and unscrupulous people out there.

The “racing to the scene” I talked about two paragraphs ago is just the beginning. Those thieves are masters at taking advantage of emotionally upset motorists who’ve just been in a crash by hooking up the car (or cars) in question and taking them to the shop of a person with whom they’re in cahoots.

Although, because of legislation, the tow truck is required to post its rates, what unsuspecting motorists often aren’t ready for are hidden charges, like fees to hook up, to unhook and storage while they, or their insurance company, make arrangements to have the vehicle repaired. Which could mean another tow and a whole new set of charges.

Want to pay for the repairs yourself, so that your insurance doesn’t go up? Some body shops will give you an itemized bill, but not the one you’d been expecting. The damage and repair costs are often much higher than originally estimated.

These might seem like exaggerations, but they happen all the time.

The legislation I mentioned was set in motion in 2014 and finally became law in 2018. The laws are fine, so far as they go, but if you’re a crook, they don’t mean a lot. Those guys are professional liars (“I just called CAA on your behalf, sir, and they want you to know that, so as not to hold up traffic, it is OK for me to tow you. I will take you to a really good repair shop I know and they will look after reporting the collision for you”).

And you, as upset as you are, will probably say, “Yes, of course,” because if you said, “No,” they wouldn’t be in business long.

It never fails to amaze me that when there’s an accident on the highway you have the police, an ambulance service, a fire department and several tow trucks on scene. Three are public and the fourth is private. Why is that? Particularly when the evidence of skulduggery frequently committed by the fourth is so overwhelming.

That organized crime is involved is no longer in doubt. York Regional Police recently arrested 20 people and laid charges dealing with, among other things, murder, arson and threats in relation to a turf war and staging serious, multi-car crashes in order to file phoney insurance claims.

Rules and regulations rarely work. It’s up to municipalities to police the industry, but according to the CAA, fewer than 20 of more than 400 municipalities actually have laws clear enough to be enforced. Which means everywhere else is ripe for corruption. For instance, several Ottawa police officers were recently charged for receiving kickbacks from tow-truck drivers; Star investigations have found GTA officers to be involved in the same way.

The only way to clean up this mess is to eliminate the problem. Make tow trucks a division of policing, or EMS, or fire departments. The premier himself was quoted as saying after those 20 charges were laid that, “We’re coming for you and we’re going to catch you. The party’s over.”

This has been building for years and the time is now ripe to do something. Don’t just catch them, premier. Put them out of business. Make the industry a public service and be done with it.

Pros: Stunning interior; excellent ride/handling balance; strong, serene performance.

Cons: Shift lever must be fixed; may not have parking lot attendant cred; not much else.

If you are considering a luxury sedan and don’t give the Genesis G90 a look, you are either prejudiced, misled or uninformed.

The G90 at $89,750 can hold its own against anything.

Yes, Genesis is the upscale division of Hyundai.

Yes, it’s built in Korea.

But it has no shortage of international credentials. The head of the entire company and its design chief (Peter Schreyer) and chief engineer (Albert Biermann) are German. The four-wheel drive system is Canadian (Magna).

It would look as good in front of Monaco’s Hotel de Paris as it would in a Canadian Tire parking lot.

The G90 has been extensively upgraded for 2020. Virtually all the sheet metal except the doors has been changed.

The major visual differences are the massive new grille and unique 1.5-foot “G-Matrix” aluminum wheels.

This interior is swathed in top-quality quilted Nappa leather.

Gorgeous open-pore wood trim and matte-finished metal controls and accents are other highlights.

The front seat occupants get plush yet supportive thrones, 22-way adjustable for the driver, 16 for shotgun. If you can’t get comfy, you haven’t tried hard enough.

There’s plenty of space for four NBA stars, with room for a mascot in the middle rear seat. Unless the other two occupants fold the centre arm rest to gain access to their own HVAC and radio controls.

Rear-side and back window shades give added privacy.

The Thin Film Transistor LCD instrument cluster features tachometer and coolant temperature on the left, speedo and fuel level on the right.

In between, you can select from a wide range of displays.

The mid-dash 12.3-inch touchscreen is bright and clear.

The commands for the voice-activated control system for features such as SatNav seem more intuitive than most in my experience.

A set of push buttons and a rotating knob in the centre console allow access to even more functions. The most commonly used ones like sound system and HVAC are replicated with dedicated buttons so you don’t have to page through a dozen screens to find what you’re looking for.

It may take a while to learn all the touching, swiping, scrolling, pinching and zooming gestures, but I found it easier than many of this ilk.

A lovely analog clock sits proudly in the centre of the dash, and provides an educational opportunity for parents to teach their children what “clockwise” means.

The G90 has connectivity covered, with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and USB outlets all over the place.

The 5.0-litre naturally aspirated V-8 provides 520 horses and 383 lb.-ft. of torque. That latter value comes in at a high 5,000 r.p.m., but the eight-speed automatic provides enough flexibility that the car never feels undergunned.

Steering wheel shift paddles give G90 owners the opportunity to be a more active participant in the festivities.

Or not; it shifts fine by itself.

Magna’s contribution is the full-time four-wheel drive system that directs torque to whichever wheels can best utilize it.

It is rear-axle biased to provide what most customers perceive to be sportier handling.

Four drive modes tailor things like throttle response, transmission shift speed, suspension, steering effort and four-wheel drive traction distribution to suit.

“Eco,” “Comfort” and “Sport” settings are self-explanatory; “Custom” lets you select the combination that best suits your driving style.

The five-link front and rear suspensions deliver excellent ride, and a level of handling you might not expect from a large luxury sedan.

The car has all the so-called “safety” systems that customers seem to want.

Personally, I think people should learn how to drive so they can enjoy driving as much as we enthusiasts do.

The no-such-thing-as-a-blind-spot warning system is as usual pointless, although market research says people like it.

The G90 adds a camera view in the instrument cluster showing you what’s already visible in the side-view mirror, and adds a redundant level of complexity to that screen.

If you have to rely on the “lane following” system that automatically steers for you, you really should let someone else take the wheel.

It’s not that I hate technology. The overhead camera view makes parking in tight quarters much easier. Rear cross-traffic assist can see things you may not be able to see. The forward collision warning system can spot cyclists and pedestrians, which might not otherwise be visible.

Lead/follow cruise control can be a boon in heavy traffic.

The “Safe Exit Assist” system uses sensors to take a peek behind the car when someone opens a rear door, and sounds a chime if something is approaching.

The “Smart Trunk” enables hands-free operation to ease loading of bulky objects.

But the in-windshield head-up display is, as always, just distracting, and draws your eyes away from looking down the road.

I shut this off.

So should you.

On the road, a wide variety of sound deadening and isolating techniques and a rigid body structure contribute to a driving experience that can best be described as “serene.”

Crank up the terrific 900-watt 17-speaker Lexicon sound system and waft away.

The dual personality of the G90 is revealed when you select “Sport” mode. Every control responds more adroitly, the exhaust note is more aggressive and the big car turns into quite the athlete.

Again, the idea of an NBA star comes to mind. How do those giants move so fluidly?

Complaints?

Obviously, not many.

The most obvious (and it’s frankly inexcusable) is a shift lever that somebody thinks is better than PRNDL.

It isn’t.

To select Park in the G90, you have to push a separate button.

My question, as always, is — why?

Sorry; it’s just stupid, and there aren’t many stupid things in this car.

The bottom line is that this car performs, rides and handles as well as more famous luxury-branded cars, which can cost 50 to 100 per cent more.

You must ask yourself: Am I buying a performance car, or am I buying a badge?",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-05,"Like a lot of kids, Frank Stephenson started sketching when he was about five, growing up in his birthplace, Casablanca, Morocco.

“I remember my mother shoving me out of the house to get some fresh air, but all I wanted to do was draw,” he reminisced during an hour-long phone chat we shared, socially distanced by the several thousand kilometres between his office in London, England, and mine in Milton.

When he was 11 and living in Istanbul, he was walking through town with his dad. They came across a Ferrari Dino. “I stood there for 15 minutes, staring at that car. Dad finally had to lead me away, tears in my eyes.”

That’s when he decided he wanted to sketch only cars.

He’s been doing it ever since, in the process becoming one of the giants of the car design world.

Following high school and six years travelling around the world racing motorcycles (he still takes his bike out, but only on nice days), he decided to give car design a shot.

He applied and was accepted into the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.

“Just getting in there is tough,” he says. “If you graduate, you’re pretty much set for life. The school prepares you very well for the rigours of product design.”

Thirty students started the four-year program with him. Only six graduated.

His fellow alumni included Grant Larson, who designed the first Porsche Boxster, and Ken Okuyama, who did the Ferrari Enzo.

Heady company.

“When I was halfway through the program, Ford offered to pay for my schooling, which I was happy to accept. When I graduated, I started with them in their European design studio in Cologne, Germany.”

One of his first projects was the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The development of the three-level rear spoiler on the car, subsequently reduced to two, is the subject of one of his YouTube videos. Don’t miss it.

He subsequently worked for a number of companies, including BMW (where he did the X5 SUV, for which I guess I have to forgive him), Ferrari (FXX), Maserati (MC12) and McLaren (P1).

Unlike a lot of car-star designers, Frank also worked on “people’s cars.” The new MINI and the Fiat 500, the reimagining of two of the most iconic cars of the 20th century, both came about under his direction.

I first met Frank at the Paris Auto Show in 2000, where the featured unveiling was that new MINI.

He still bristles about how some commentators at the time viewed this car.

“I was really peed off ...” — about as close to swearing as he gets — “when people said it was a ‘retro’ design.

“Of the 15 designs that were proposed for the car,” he recalls, “some looked nothing at all like the original.

“I didn’t want to copy the old one, but didn’t want to throw away all aspects of it either. You need some sort of a family feeling, a link to the heritage, like the way we relate to our parents and grandparents.”

He talks about the “Golden Ratio,” the number 1.618, also known as “Phi.” This ratio is found in nature and in classic architecture such as the Parthenon in Athens.

He points out that great music also follows that ratio. Beethoven figured it out, and he was so deaf he thought he was a painter.

Not surprisingly then, this number is also found in the length-to-height ratio of the Minis, both old and new.

At last year’s “MINI Invasion,” a celebration of the original’s 60th anniversary, I had the rare opportunity to see both cars side by side. Not until then did I really notice how tiny the original was.

But I also could see certain features — wheels at the corners, short overhangs, “floating” roof and, most of all, those “golden ratio” proportions, which show the family resemblance Frank was seeking.

I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler, so I am always amazed how designers can toss a few lines on a piece of paper and BAM — there’s a car.

He has an idea for a book called “The Three Lines,” where he would take some of the iconic car designs of history and show how you can express them with just three strokes of a pencil.

“If you can draw a car in three lines, you pretty much have a good design,” he says. “The cars that don’t last have lines going all over the place. There’s too much going on.

“Some modern designs seem intended to shock, and they will age badly,” he believes.

One common concern about car design these days is that cars are all designed in a wind tunnel in search of better aerodynamics, hence, better fuel consumption. Won’t they all start looking even more alike than they already do?

Frank points out that what looks “aero” isn’t necessarily “aero.”

“We actually have more freedom now w/r/t aerodynamics than we did before,” he says. “Advances in computational fluid dynamics give us the opportunity to prove that a car that looks aerodynamic might not necessarily be so.

“New approaches to air flow give stylists more freedom than we thought we had.”

He also looks towards the animal kingdom for inspiration.

“Form doesn’t follow function,” he says, turning a design cliche on its head.

“Form IS function. I strive for natural shapes that don’t shock you, but are timeless.”

He likes the term “bio-mimicry.” Millions of years of evolution must have taught us something.

“The cheetah’s design has evolved to let it run fast. That’s how it survives. That’s the true test.”

He makes what sounds like quite a leap when he starts talking about warplanes.

“They are designed for one thing. They do it well.”

To him, that’s successful design.

Aviation is clearly another of this polymath’s interests. He has been working with a company which is developing a battery-powered aircraft that features VTOL — Vertical Takeoff and Landing.

Not much grass grows under Frank Stephenson’s feet.

He thinks a lot about how to stimulate creativity in children. Proportion seems to be innate in creative people, and everybody seems to have it when they are young. Does formal schooling turn that tap off?

“Kids are curious!” he marvels. “Somehow, we switch it off.”

Educators, take heed.

Frank Stephenson’s influence on car design is perhaps best reflected in a current web-based voting scheme, organized by whom, I have no idea. It purports to name the top car designer of all time.

From a list of 64 nominees which includes such as Harley Earl of General Motors who pretty much invented car design as a profession, Nuccio Bertone of the styling house that bears his name, and Peter Schreyer who brought European design ethic to Korea, Stephenson has reached “The Final Four.”

And, he is the only non-Italian in that quartet, the others being Giorgetto Giugiaro, Battista (Pinin) Farina and Leonardo Fioravanti.

Again, heady company.

I have no idea when or how the ultimate winner will be chosen.

If it were Frank Stephenson, I for one would not argue.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He Reports On The Weekend S Motor Racing Each Monday At Wheels.Ca.']",2020-06-05,"There is a coronavirus threatening civilization, so the city of Toronto decided to fast-track the building of 40 more kilometres of bicycle lanes.

First things first, I guess.

This is, apparently, historic in that it is the biggest one-year expansion of the bike network in Toronto’s history. Just the sort of thing you slide through when people aren’t paying attention.

In any event, I wanted to double-check the facts for this column so I googled “bike lanes Toronto” and a local news site called Toronto.com popped up.

The main story was about the bike-lane expansion, but that wasn’t what caught my eye. Right across the top of Toronto.com was an ad for a 2020 Kia Sorento. Even better, in the shoulder of the story, was another ad for the same car. There wasn’t an ad for a bicycle anywhere on that page. Just car ads (there was another one at the bottom). Now we know which of these two modes of transportation pays the freight around here.

In any event, the story said — and I quote — that the bike lanes will make it easier for commuters to get to and from work during the COVID-19 crisis. Somebody should tell council that nobody is at work during the crisis, including them. They did this while holding a virtual meeting.

I imagine they got these brainwaves after reading stories that were in the Star recently. There was one that caught my eye in which urban designers imagine a car-free road network in post-pandemic Toronto.

This Freedom Ring Road would encircle the city and allow people in wheelchairs, or pushing baby carriages, or walking and cycling to visit the Brickworks on Bayview or attend an open-air yoga class in the middle of Queens Quay. All without fear of being hit by a car.

Will somebody please tell these people that this is not California. We live in Canada. Even in a good winter, it is either too cold to ride a bike or there is snow on the ground five months of the year. Sometimes six.

Yes, some people cycle 12 months a year. Not many, but some. At the Star, there are two that I know of; at the Globe, one guy not only cycled to work each and every day but he and his family always took a January vacation in a noninsulated cabin north of Kenora that didn’t have electricity. (They sure didn’t have to worry about black flies, did they? But the outdoor privy must have been something else.)

Downtown, in the old city of Toronto, is where the cyclists live. And there, within reason, is where there should be bike lanes everywhere. I say within reason because University Avenue south of Bloor is not a good reason. It will prove to be dangerous because it’s a major thoroughfare for traffic coming into and going out of Toronto.

It reminds me of one of the most famous thoroughfares in Europe, the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The Ontario legislature at Queen’s Park is about where the Arche de Triomphe would be. You can get over to Queen’s Park on crosswalks or at intersections; it’s virtually impossible to get to the Arch because it’s in the middle of a traffic circle.

Which reminds me: would the bicycle lobby quit saying things like, “We should be reducing or eliminating cars and car parking on our main boulevards, as is the case throughout Europe.” They say this knowing that not all that many GTA residents have been to Europe. I have. Many times, particularly in the last two years. Cars are everywhere. See my reference to the Champs-Élysées as just one example. And they park on those streets, too.

My take: Most on council forget that Toronto is a megacity. It is more than the Lake up to Bloor and Parliament in the east over to Bathurst. It’s the Rouge River to the 427 and north to the 407 (approx.) and if you’re living out there and working downtown you are not going to ride your bike. Nor are the people commuting in from Oakville and Whitby, or Kitchener and Peterborough. Those people are not Lance Armstrong; they ride the GO and the bus and subway and most of all they drive. That’s right. They drive.

When the pandemic wanes, and it will sooner or later, and the people who can’t work from home go back to the office, they will not be crazy about riding transit. Not for awhile, anyway. Which means they are going to be driving their cars. In fact, dealers are reporting that people are buying again. May sales were way up over April’s. And once they get used to driving those cars downtown again, it will be a long time before they give them up.

City Council has been living in a dream world for years. Times have been good and Toronto’s on top. It might not be, after the pandemic. Those folks would be wise to pay a little less attention to the bike lobby, which isn’t all that big, and a lot more to the car crowd, which is huge.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-29,"Before our civilization became threatened by the coronavirus, automakers liked to do new vehicle launches up big.

They would take guys like me, sometimes as many as 20 men and women, and fly us out to Newfoundland (Porsche) or Yukon (Subaru) or Utah (Mercedes) or New Mexico (Infiniti) and they would pull back the curtain and then have company experts explain what was new and exciting about whatever.

Then we would drive the new product around for a day or so before flying home.

That was then and this is now. Now is when the unveiling is virtual and, if we’re lucky, we later get to examine a car that’s sitting quietly in a display space in a company showroom. What’s missing, of course, is the drive, which is the really important part.

But giving the product the once-over is better than nothing and that was the case in recent days when I was invited to Toyota Canada headquarters to take a closer look at the new for 2021 Toyota Venza two-row crossover SUV, which will be at dealerships in August.

Right off the bat, let me say this is a fine-looking car and, although the one I sat in was a prototype, feels functional and comfortable.

There is room for five and the company says it will deliver sedan-style driving comfort along with SUV versatility. I spent much of my time the day I was there with Philippe Crowe, a Toyota product consultant, who showed me around the car and emphasized that the Venza is equivalent to the bestselling RAV4, but will be more upscale.

I came away convinced that the automaker is particularly pleased with five offerings: the hybrid powertrain, the car’s electronic all-wheel drive, the safety package, the entertainment and connectivity package and the coup de grâce: a panoramic glass roof.

The hybrid powertrain system (Hybrid System II) matches a 2.5-litre, four-cylinder engine with three electric motors that deliver 219 horsepower and a manufacturer-estimated 5.9 L/100 km in LE trim. (XLE and Limited are the other trims available in Canada.)

There are four driving modes: EV (which means the vehicle can be driven at low speed for a short distance using just the electric motors), ECO (which allows the driver to maximize mileage), Sport (arguably more fun to drive, but making that 5.9L/100 km fuel economy challenging) and Normal (for everyday driving).

Toyota is particularly proud of its Electronic On-Demand, All-Wheel Drive. Two front motors drive the front wheels and a rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels. Torque distribution varies with road conditions.

Toyota Safety Sense (TSS 2.0) is a suite of safety systems that includes a pre-collision program with pedestrian detection and daytime bicycle detection.

Toyota’s cutting-edge entertainment and connectivity is an industry leader. Premium Audio with Remote is standard on XLE and Limited trims and features a 12.3-inch multimedia touchscreen that is almost at eye level and can be operated by either the driver or the front-seat passenger.

Audio Plus with Remote is standard on LE and includes an eight-inch touchscreen.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, as is Bluetooth. The six-speaker audio with four-channel amplifier is standard. The JBL Premium Audio System is optional, but has nine speakers, a rear subwoofer and 12-channel, 1,200-watt amp. Wow. The Star Gaze (which is trademarked) panoramic glass roof, a Toyota original, is sure not your average sunroof. It brightens the interior while reducing direct sunlight. The electrochromic glass technology lets drivers switch from transparent to frosted modes in, literally, a second.

Other features: 18-inch and 19-inch wheels are available, depending on trims; creature comforts include cupholders that can hold large drinks and door bottle holders that can handle 700 ml bottles. There’s 1,027 litres of cargo space behind the rear seat. There are eight airbags, including side-curtain airbags for both rows of seats. Traction control, an anti-lock braking system and Smart Stop Technology add to the vehicle’s safety. There are LED lights fore and aft. Side mirrors are attached to the door rather than the pillar to better match your line of sight. The rear-view mirror can be, well, a mirror or a screen fed by a rear-mounted camera.

The big selling point for Crowe, though, is the hybrid. “I really like the torque you get from the electric motors when all four wheels are empowered,” he said.

“And I enjoy the hybrid because I don’t have to stop for an hour to charge it like I would with a full electric. I can stop for five minutes and fill up the gas tank.”

Vinh Pham, manager of product planning for Toyota, agreed. “The intermediate SUV segment is growing,” he said. “The hybrid powertrain with the phenomenal fuel economy that it gets is exactly what the segment is looking for.”

Stephen Beatty, vice-president of sales and marketing, didn’t want to talk about pricing. “I won’t even put a number on it,” he said. “As always, we negotiate the price with Japan right up until the final minute.” But then he added: “This is RAV4-sized, the hybrid powertrain is from the RAV4, and there are more features ... ”

So go to Toyota.ca and click on “Build & Price” for the RAV4, which has an MSRP of around $32,000 on the low end up to $42,000. That should give you some idea of what the Venza will go for come August.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-29,"The first thing you have to do with respect to Kia’s Sportage is decide how to pronounce it.

Americans say “SPOR-tidge.”

Up here, it’s more likely to be “spor-TAHGE,” with the em-PHA-sis on the second syl-LAB-ble.

Also gives a distinctly French slant to it. Not surprising, given how well Kia does in Quebec.

The fourth-generation Sportage debuted three years ago. Fresh styling and added equipment highlight the changes for 2020.

Prices start at $25,795 for the front-wheel drive LX.

Even at that level, you get useful stuff like heated power side-view mirrors, heated front seats, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, 12-volt outlets front and rear, two-level trunk with hidden storage and a backup camera with guidelines to ease those tricky reverses.

Another two grand gets you “Dynamax,” among the most clever four-wheel drive systems available.

A product of Canada’s own Magna International, Dynamax uses a series of sensors to automatically engage four-wheel drive when it can be helpful; otherwise, it stays in front-wheel drive to save fuel.

For that nasty cottage access road, you can lock the system into 4x4 mode.

The mid-range EX (4x4 only) at $31,695 brings a bunch of typically useless “driving aids” like “lane-keeping assist.”

(Um, how did you get your driver’s licence?)

And, of course, the “dumb key” fob system, which sadly is almost universal now.

More useful are the 10-way power seats and the heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. (Um again, when is our government going to make this mandatory?)

My EX tester listed at $37,995, which included the “Premium” package (the dreaded leather upholstery, pointless blind-spot warning system, the more useful dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and rear cross-traffic alert), and the “Tech” package (heated rear seats and cooled front ones, a lovely Harman/Kardon sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, and Kia’s UVO telematics system).

Add $200 for the “Modern Bronze” paint job, plus taxes, freight and A/C charge, and this vehicle will run you $40,080. If you think that’s a lot for a compact SUV, you haven’t been following the market.

The range-topper is the SX Turbo 4x4, which starts at $39,995, but I’ll focus on the one I drove.

Sportage is a handsome thing, given that the two-boxes-on-wheels concept doesn’t give designers much leeway.

One knock: the rear turn signals are way too low in the bumper. Given how many people are driving taller vehicles now, these really must be positioned higher.

That bronze paint gives a luxurious look, which continues inside, with good design executed in high-quality materials. The exception would be the matte black plastic panel for radio and HVAC controls, which looks decidedly low-rent.

The main instrument cluster is a paragon of design and legibility. Big round speedo and tach, with smaller gauges for fuel and coolant temperature nestled within.

The “UVO” touchscreen system is integrated cleanly into the dash, rather than appearing to have been glued on as an afterthought.

Many functions are controlled by buttons on the steering column spokes, some of which can only be changed when the car is in “Park.” Occasionally inconvenient; undoubtedly safer.

It will take some time to find out where all the functions are, but that’s true of any modern car. Lots of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel (reach and rake) to find a good driving position.

Lots of room, too, and real adults can fit in the back seat.

The rear seat-back release levers are down on the floor, rather than on the seat backs themselves, as is more common. The seat split-folds in one-third/two-thirds ratio.

As I do in my VW Golf wagon, I removed the rear-seat headrests when no one was riding back there, to improve rearward visibility.

Lots of cubby bins and cupholders throughout, for real-world driving. An open bin ahead of the shift lever handles miscellaneous debris and includes a USB outlet.

A touch of a button gives you the choice of three drive modes. “ECO” dampens throttle response and isn’t as quick to downshift on light throttle application to maximize economy.

“Sport” gives you the most spirited drive, and the seat side bolsters tighten up a little to give you added lateral support, rare indeed at this price point.

“Normal” splits the difference.

I’d need a month with this vehicle to determine if there is any measurable difference in fuel consumption using these different modes.

My guess: probably not.

The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine (181 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m.; 175 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 r.p.m.) gives decent performance. But its most remarkable characteristic is how quiet it is — not something you’d usually say about a large-displacement four-banger.

Some credit must go to the sound-deadening “acoustic” glass in the windshield.

The six-speed automatic transmission is properly transparent in operation, shifting seamlessly as needed.

The manual shift feature is backwards, as it is in so many cars. It must be back to upshift, forward to downshift. If I have to tell you why again, you shouldn’t be using it anyway.

Hard to know how much of the Sportage’s nimble handling is down to the trick four-wheel drive system, but it’s a delight, simply going where you point it. Some credit must also go to the Michelin Primacy tires, same ones I have on our Golf.

The steering is accurate and confidence-inspiring.

In sum, the Kia Sportage is a very capable vehicle, and seems to have all the stuff this market wants.

The challenge for Kia is getting people to consider it. This is one of the biggest segments in the Canadian marketplace, with maybe a dozen worthy contenders.

If sprightly handling and high-end features are at the top of your shopping list, Kia’s Sportage is worth a look, no matter how you pronounce it.

Pros: Sharp looks, inside and out; nimble handling; sophisticated four-wheel drive system.

Cons: Rear-turn signal lamps must be repositioned; one measly trim bit on the dashboard takes away from the high-class ambience; manual shift pattern just plain wrong.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-05-22,"Sir Stirling Moss, who went to that Big Pit Stop in the Sky a few weeks ago, was, in most people’s estimation — certainly mine — the best driver never to win a Formula One World Championship.

Actually in my view, he was the best driver ever. His record on the basis of wins versus starts is exceptional.

He came close to winning the F1 title a couple of times, notably in 1958.

During the Portuguese Grand Prix, Mike Hawthorn had spun and was facing the wrong way. He coasted downhill, bump-started the car, turned around and continued to finish second behind Moss.

After the race, the stewards disqualified Hawthorn because he had technically violated a rule about driving backwards on a track. Moss intervened on Hawthorn’s behalf, and the decision was reversed.

The extra points Hawthorn accumulated were enough at the end of the season to beat Moss for the championship.

I had the honour of meeting Sir Stirling a couple of times.

On the track, he was a “first is first, second is nowhere” type of guy; off the track, a nicer man you would never meet.

I witnessed another example of this duality at a vintage sports car event in Freeport Bahamas, back in 1986.

In the “Unlimited” sports car class, Moss was driving a late-1950s Aston Martin. It might have been the very car in which he had won races in Nassau during the Bahamas Speed Weeks back in the day; if not, it was a contemporary of those cars.

Not surprisingly, he was on pole for the first of two races for this class.

Qualifying second was a young man from Minneapolis named Steve Kline. He was in a 1957 “Echidna,” one of three Minnesota-built sports-racing cars constructed from various late-’50s Chevrolet bits, a “Devin” body, and a Chevy small-block V-8 engine.

After qualifying, the drivers were getting in some extra practice. Kline’s engine blew. He was going to miss the chance to race against the great (not-yet-Sir) Stirling Moss!

He roamed the paddock Friday evening, looking for someone who might have a spare Chevy V-8 for sale.

Lucky for him, he found one.

Not so lucky for him, the guy wanted $10,000.

“That’s a $2,000 engine!” Kline screamed.

“In Minneapolis on Monday morning, it’s a $2,000 engine,” came the reply.

“In Freeport, Bahamas, the Friday night before your race, it’s a $10,000 engine.”

Kline’s father was a Chevrolet dealer in Minneapolis. Those were halcyon days for Chevy dealers. Ten grand wasn’t exactly pocket change, but it wasn’t enough to keep Kline from his date with destiny.

His mechanics were up all night installing it.

Kline had no idea how good the engine was, but at least he’d see the green flag.

He even had a video camera — rare in those days — mounted to his roll bar so he would have a souvenir of the time he raced against Moss. Figuring he had no chance against this legend, the camera was pointed straight ahead.

The course in Freeport was a street circuit, tight and twisty, with a few long straights.

The last corner was a 90-degree left-hander, leading to the start/finish line.

The front row — Moss and Kline, with Moss on the inside — took that corner and headed toward the starter’s flag.

Kline heard Moss start to accelerate. He figured, “I better get on this.”

So he floored it.

Turns out, this engine had way more power than his own. His Echidna surged forward, and was at least 20 metres ahead of Moss as they took the start.

Normally in a situation like this, the starter would wave off the start and require another pace lap.

But what the heck — it’s vintage racing, a preliminary heat, we’re already behind schedule, Moss was surely going to pass him soon anyway.

Throw the flag — let’s go racing.

So Kline led into the first corner.

And every other one.

Moss did everything he could to pass Kline. Every corner, he’d feint one way, then the other.

But Kline was smooth, and had way more power.

Stirling Moss had been beaten by Steve Kline.

Hollywood would never dare write that script.

Of course, his video camera had caught none of this, since Moss was behind him.

I wasn’t at this event to cover the races per se, but I recognize a story when one smacks me in the face.

So I scrambled down to the paddock and met Kline as he climbed out of his car, his crew mobbing him.

He was higher than the proverbial kite.

I asked if he’d like to meet Mr. Moss.

“Um, ah, like, what, er ...” he stammered.

I took that as a “yes.”

So I walked him over to meet Stirling, who wouldn’t have known me from Adam.

But when I introduced him to Kline, he was very gracious.

As tough as he was on a race track, Stirling was always a gentleman off it.

Within moments, they were standing beside each other, the arms of their racing suits tied around their respective waists, just two drivers having a cold one after a hard race.

Somewhere I have photos of this moment. But that was back in the days of “prints.” (Readers under 20 years old, ask your grandparents ...).

I can’t find them anywhere.

At the post-race party that evening, Kline and Moss were chatting with the other drivers and fans. Moss was his usual gallant self, telling everyone that he had done everything he could to pass Kline, but the young man never put a wheel wrong, and he just couldn’t get past him.

“He drove a great race,” Moss said. “But tomorrow, I’m going to teach him lesson No. 2.”

Poor Kline lay awake all night staring at the ceiling, thinking, “I don’t even know what lesson No. 1 was ...”

In the feature race on Sunday, the grid positioning was the same — Moss on the inside of Row 1, Kline on the outside. But as they completed the left turn onto the straightaway towards the start line, Moss moved to his right, cutting Kline off and forcing him to lift.

Moss knew from the previous day’s race that the starter was going to throw the flag no matter what. He grabbed the lead, and Kline never had a chance from that point.

Lesson No. 2.

As it happened, Kline’s Echidna broke a U-joint on the last lap and had to limp home on the limited slip differential.

But what racer wouldn’t give his eye teeth to be 1-for-2 against Stirling Moss on any given weekend?

It was the best 10 grand he ever spent.

And just one of a thousand stories about Sir Stirling Moss.

We will not see his like again.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-05-22,"I have pretty much stayed in my house since the first week of March. We got back from 10 days in Florida on March 4 and I turned on the TV to hear Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, suggest that anyone over 70 (check) with an underlying medical condition (check) should plan to stay inside and out of the line of COVID-19 fire for a minimum of four months.

Uh-oh, I thought.

The following Monday, I had to go to the Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga for a followup on my wrist that I’d managed to break in California last December (“How’s it feeling?” Fine. “You’re good to go.”) and the next day I had to meet my good friend Tim Miller of the Hamilton Spectator at a Denny’s in Oakville for breakfast.

That was the last time I ate out. By March 12, two days later, Canada had started to catch on. The prime minister went on television to tell people to “go home and stay home.” Friday, the country was hitting its stride with the health minister and the medical officer of health adding their voices and suddenly we were in lockdown.

So what do you do when you can’t go anywhere? How do you pass the time? I do a lot of writing for the Star and my own website, but there is still down time. I like to read and I have eclectic tastes: autobiographies of Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, George W. Bush and Punch Imlach, for instance, and videos/DVDs on everything from the Second World War to the third season of Hill Street Blues.

But my primary focus is on all things automotive, with an emphasis on motorsport.

To start, there are DVDs: fact (“Indianapolis 500: the Sixties — a Decade of Change”) and fiction (“To Please A Lady,” starring Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck, about an Indianapolis driver who loses the big race on purpose to prove to his sweetheart that he’s learned there are more important things in life than winning).

There are several F1 documentaries (“Grand Prix: The Killer Years” is one; there are others) that you might watch once but are so grisly that once is enough. And then there is the acclaimed Netflix series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” and it really is stupendous. But I’ll tell you this: if I hear the Hass F1 team principal, Guenther Steiner, use the F-word one more time, I am going to scream. He is equivalent to the CEO of a multibillion-dollar corporation and he should show more discipline. I was going to use the word “class,” but I’m afraid he’s incapable of that. Prediction: as long as he’s around, that team is going nowhere.

Anyway, while I watch the occasional DVD, I prefer to crack a book. Here are eight that I’ve been reading since my self-imposed exile began. I’ve read them all previously, of course, so these are rereads. But they are so good I am enjoying every word.

WHEELS, by Arthur Hailey. Hailey was a prolific Canadian novelist whose shtick was researching a subject to death and then writing a story around it. His three most famous books were Hotel, Airport and Wheels. I must admit that of the three, Hotel was the most shocking because Hailey had no problem unveiling some rather unsavoury practices that were commonplace (at the time) in an industry that just about all of us, at one time or another, have utilized.

For Wheels, he spent months at a Detroit auto factory (thought to be the Ford Motor Co.) and while the story is pedestrian, the “reporting” was wonderful. This all took place before automation and the industry has been turned upside down since, but it was hot stuff at the time. He wrote that the worst cars to buy were the ones manufactured on Mondays and Fridays (because of assembly line absenteeism), and for several years afterward, every dealer in North America swore the cars in their showrooms were all built on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Fun stuff.

MON AMI MATE (the friendship of 1950s British racers Mike Hawthorne and Peter Collins), by Chris Nixon. In some circles (I emphasize: some circles), Formula One Grand Prix drivers are seen as being more cultured and sophisticated than their American counterparts. Stirling Moss vis-à-vis A.J. Foyt, for example. Read this incredible book by Nixon, though, and you quickly come to the conclusion that regardless of nationality or social standing, boys will be boys.

Collins, who married a Broadway actress, once exploded with rage when he learned that a South American woman with whom he’d had a brief affair (a.k.a. one-night stand) was pregnant, suggesting she should have taken precautions. (The #MeToo movement would have loved this guy.) Hawthorne was world champion (think about that: world champion) when he was killed in a street race with Rob Walker, an F1 team owner and a one-time columnist for Road and Track magazine.

Boyhood chums, both drove for Ferrari and then died violently within five months of each other, Collins in a Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Hawthorne on a four-lane highway in England. An impressive read.

BLACK NOON, by Art Garner. May 30, 1964, was one of the worst days in the history of the Indianapolis 500. A California sports car champion named Dave MacDonald, who was a rookie at Indy, was driving an experimental car entered by off-road racer Mickey Thompson, when he lost control during the second lap and the ensuing carnage killed him, veteran Eddie Sachs and injured three other drivers, Johnny Rutherford, Ronnie Duman and Bobby Unser. Everything — and I mean everything — you would want to know about that day and those men is in this book.

WINNERS ARE DRIVEN, by Bobby Unser. Talking about Unser and “boys-will-be-boys,” he was one of the great practical jokers of all time. To this day, Foyt starts giggling when recalling some of Unser’s stunts. Lloyd Ruby tells this story.

“Bobby loved playing with M80s (a firecracker with the oomph of about a fifth of a stick of dynamite). Once we were at a Boy Scout banquet and he put one in a giant bowl of salad. The salad went everywhere. One time we checked into a motel and he was dropping M80s in the toilets, which didn’t help the plumbing. Then he’d start playing with the fire extinguishers out in the hall. Needless to say, we didn’t get invited back.”

At some point, Unser matured and wrote a great book on how to succeed in business and in life by applying the principles and strategies he used on the speedway. Globe and Mail columnist Harvey Schachter gave it a positive review. It’s worth reading because at some point we’ll all be able to leave the house and there might have to be a reset. This book could help.

IACOCCA: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, by Lee Iacocca. Never mind the pandemic. The worst thing that has happened to business, government and publishing has been the “executive committee,” or “inner cabinet.” Why? Because everybody insists on having their say and, as a result, it takes forever to get anything done.

Iacocca, either through force of personality or physical intimidation (yes, that existed in his time and, to an extent, still does) got things done. Ford and Chrysler Corp., particularly the latter, owe much of their success to his skill, expertise and chutzpah. What he said, went. We could use more like him.

THE AMERICAN MOTEL and THE AMERICAN DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT, both by Michael Karl Witzel. If you like “The Road,” you will love both of these books. No, they are not about Holiday Inns and McDonald’s drive-ins (although, did you know the early McDonald’s had carhops?), but how tents, trailers, cabins and eventually motels changed the face of travel in America.

And when the car was king, who had time to go home for dinner when all you had to do was pull into a hot dog-or-hamburger-to-go joint for nourishment? A good number of these places are found along the old Mother Road, Route 66. While we’re in lockdown, both those books are a great way to go on vacation without leaving your living room.

EVEL, by Leigh Montville. A great read about the rags-to-riches-to-rags-again daredevil Evel Knievel, who, over the course of his career, really did break every bone in his body — at least once. I was at Snake River Canyon for the Star in 1974, when Evel went into the river instead of over/across it and will never forget going to the airport in Twin Falls, Idaho (only the late Christie Blatchford and I thought to go out there), where he boarded his Learjet to fly over the jump site and vowed to “dip his wings in salute” to the canyon that had beaten him.

Little-known fact: the last jump before Snake River was over 15 Mack trucks in front of the Grandstand at that year’s 1974 Canadian National Exhibition. Great stuff.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-15,"“Power corrupts,” said Lord Acton allegedly, and “absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

640 horsepower?

Colour me corrupted.

I just got out of the first 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S in the country. It was a German-spec car brought over for press demos.

Danke schön, Porsche.

Base list is $231,700 for the Coupé, $246,300 for the Cabriolet.

My coupé tester totalled $241,540, bolstered by a few options that included Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM — it wouldn’t be a Porsche feature without a three- or four-character acronym), a $1,720 hit which lowers the car by 10 mm and brings faster-reacting dampers for improved handling with less compromise in ride comfort.

Together with Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (sure, PDCC), which changes the antisway bar stiffness to reduce body roll in cornering, they further reduce the ride/handling tradeoff that has plagued suspension designers forever.

If you have to choose things like adaptive cruise control ($2,280), lane change assist ($1,200) and lane-keep assist ($1,390) as in my tester, maybe you’re not really ready for a car like this.

You are supposed to drive this car; it shouldn’t be driving you.

Visually, the car is hardly a stealth-mobile. The wider fenders, the unique front and rear fascias, the deployable rear spoiler, and most notably the massive wheels and tires (Pirelli P ZERO, 255/35ZR20 front, 315/30ZR21 rear) with huge brakes (420 mm rotors with no fewer than 10-piston calipers up front, 390 mm four-pots at the rear, painted bright yellow) tell you this is a serious car.

Still, compared to the GT3 RS, it’s relatively unadorned. It illustrates the simple beauty of the 911 shape, which has been remarkably unchanged over its nearly six decades of history.

The excellent fit and finish, the minor controls, the comfy and supportive front seats, the rear seats designed for circus acrobats, the trunk up front like an elephant, and the fact that you cannot see the engine at all, are similar to other 911s.

I’ll focus here on what makes the Turbo S version so different, so special.

The 3.8 litre twin-turbo flat six engine pumps those 640 horses and 590 lb.-ft. of torque through an updated PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe) double-clutch gearbox.

Fire it up, and the familiar flat-six exhaust growl greets you.

Pull away, and the first thing to strike you — it’s quick. Bloody quick.

Throttle response is RIGHT NOW.

I attempted some 0-100 km/h runs on a deserted stretch of dead-end road using the car’s built-in timer.

But I was so busy holding on, I couldn’t work the buttons fast enough.

These sprints looked drama-free from outside, because thanks to the various control systems there’s no wheel spin, just the bellow of the car as it disappears over the horizon.

Trust me: the factory-supplied time of 2.7 seconds is no lie.

Of course, at 100 km/h the car is just catching its breath, on its way to a theoretical top end of 330 km/h.

This makes the Turbo S one of the very fastest cars you can legally operate on Canadian roads.

OK, the “330 km/h” part is not so legal ...

What is most impressive is the continual improvement Porsche has made in reducing turbo lag. In this car there’s a continuous surge of power to the red line, upshift, and do it again.

As always, that PDK shifts seamlessly and immediately.

Sure, you can play with the shift paddles, but you won’t be able to beat the machine.

The shift lever is the same as in other new-generation 911s — forward for Reverse, back for Drive, push a button for Park. In other words, they should throw it out and go back to PRNDL — Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Low. That design ain’t broke; stop trying to fix it.

The steering is as precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, and offers what seems to be perfect weight.

The full-time four-wheel drive system is rear-axle biased, but can deliver up to 62 per cent of the torque to the front wheels if it deems it necessary to do so.

The torque vectoring system directs drive force to whichever wheel or wheels can best use it. Along with the electronically controlled limited slip rear differential, it will do its level best to keep you from becoming part of the scenery.

You have a choice of five drive modes via a round knob at the 5 o’clock position on the steering wheel, each of which tailors things like throttle response and transmission reaction to suit.

“Normal” is — you guessed it — for normal driving conditions.

“Sport” and “Sport Plus” up the performance ante in successive, predictable steps.

“Individual” allows you to choose various settings to your own taste. For example, I set everything to be as “sporty” as possible, but backed the suspension off to “Normal” to reduce harshness.

“Wet” actually measures how damp the road is via sensors in the front wheel wells, and adjusts the settings accordingly. I have tested this on other 911s, and it really works.

In “Sport” or “Sport Plus” modes, the PDK will let the engine rev until it hits the red line, but will not automatically upshift. It just chatters away on the red line. You after all are in the driver’s seat.

As you slow down, the PDK will stay in whichever gear you’ve selected until the revs drop too low, in which case it downshifts for you.

But as you re-accelerate to the max, it will again stay on that red line until you hit that right-side paddle.

The uprated suspension in the Turbo S does the business. Ride quality was actually not as harsh as I feared, although those ultralow aspect ratio tires set up a bit of bump-thump on sharp road irregularities, of which there is no shortage here in early spring.

A separate button on the dash allows you to firm up the dampers for even more control. It did make the suspension react more sharply, but frankly, it was difficult to evaluate their handling benefit under these less-than-perfectly-controlled test conditions.

Say, Porsche — when you and Mosport are ready, so am I ...

Porsches, especially the more powerful 911s, have a somewhat sinister reputation for tricky on-the-limit handling, what with all that engine weight hanging out aft of the rear axle.

That is pretty much a thing of the past.

Sure, if you shut off all the nanny systems and really ham-fist it, it might get a bit tail-happy.

But as hard as I dared drive this car on public roads, it remained resolutely stable.

Wish your way around that corner; it follows your bidding.

The car is equally adept at just cruising around, comfortable and tractable. Not the least bit fussy.

The satellite radio was not functioning in my car, and apparently there is no AM radio in Germany because all I could get was FM. Still, the Bose sound system was its usual excellent self.

Every advance in the 911’s development has expanded its bandwidth, with more performance at the sharp end, and more comfort at the other.

The Turbo S continues this tradition.

Unlike a lot of exotics, the Turbo S is a car you could live with, day to day, season to season.

Now, you have no doubt heard the old real estate adage that buying the cheapest house in a good neighbourhood is the best investment.

You can get a 911 that looks almost the same as the Turbo S for less than half its price.

But if you want the ultimate 911, you’ll just have to pony up.

One test drive and you will be making another call to your bank manager.

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-15,"In the late 1980s, Bernie Ecclestone, the little firebrand who was in the process of turning Formula One racing from a lucrative hobby into a multibillion-dollar business, had run out of patience with the Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs (CASC), which sanctioned all motor racing in the land, professional as well as amateur.

In Ecclestone’s mind, the CASC — an arm of the international motoring authority FIA — had botched negotiations with the country’s top two brewers, Labatt and Molson, over rights to sponsor the F1 Grand Prix of Canada, which — among other things — had resulted in the cancellation of the race in 1987.

Ecclestone had the ear of Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the FIA at the time, mainly because of the clout he carried as president of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA). Without FOCA, there would be no Formula One.

He convinced Balestre (which wasn’t hard) that the amateur CASC had to go, to be replaced by a professional National Sporting Authority (ASN). Shortly after, the CASC was expelled from the FIA. Ecclestone then had Balestre put his pal, Benoit Mailloux, who was president of the FAQ (Federation de l’Automobile Quebec), in charge of all Canadian motorsport.

This did not go over well in many quarters, with critics suggesting the move was only good for the Grand Prix and not much else. In fact, rally drivers and teams were sufficiently concerned that they broke away to create the Canadian Association of Rallysport that would govern rallying.

In 1990, a company incorporated as ASN Canada FIA, took over from Mailloux, who was only too happy to hand over the keys to Roger Peart, president, and vice-president Paul B. Cooke. Peart and Cooke, through their ASN, then sanctioned road course and street racing for 30 years.

Late last year, they resigned from the FIA, a move that was unexpected. Yes, Peart was in his 80s and in ill health but Cooke, also in his 80s, had assumed the presidency and had not even hinted that he was going to throw in the towel. There was no succession plan either, so the resignation, which became official Dec. 31, left a void and a number of constituencies — 10, in total — rushed to fill it.

Several weeks ago, Jean Todt, president of the FIA, announced that Francois Dumontier, president and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Ron Fellows, retired racer and co-owner of what is now known as Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, operating as GDS (Groupe de Development Sportif), would head up the new ASN. This week, Fellows announced that the retired CEO of Canadian Tire, Stephen Wetmore, had agreed to be part of the executive team.

As was the case in the late 1980s and 1990, and which explains the previous eight paragraphs of background, this has not gone over well with many in the racing community, with some suggesting that, in the end, only the Grand Prix and perhaps CTMP will benefit.

As they say, its déjà vu all over again.

As was the case that led to the creation of CARS in 1990, the five racing regions in the country are currently split over these developments, with the presidents of two regions going so far as to write the FIA suggesting it not pay any attention to an application put forward by someone from a third region. Which is exactly the sort of behaviour that had Ecclestone rolling his eyes in the first place.

You’d think people would have learned.

The difficulty with volunteers, whether it’s a service club or a fundraising campaign or people administering motorsport in Canada, is that, often, competing agendas are at work and more than one person wants to be the boss. Professional organizations operate differently. You are on the team, or not. There are few grey areas.

At last count, there are nearly 250 ASNs in the world. Jean Todt, president of the FIA, has lots on the go at the moment, starting with the pandemic that has brought the world to its knees and including 70th anniversary celebrations of F1. I suggest he does not have a lot of time to worry about who is going to run racing in Canada and even after accepting recommendations from his vice-presidents and other advisers, he went with the guys he knew, which is pretty much how the real world works.

But in so doing, Todt went against the FIA’s Code of Conduct, which can be interpreted as saying that promoters can’t be part of ASNs. This is particularly bothersome to two of the people I talked to before sitting down to write this situational. They are Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a pioneer in motorsports medicine, and Michael Kaerne, national steward for the Grand Prix and a past president of the Canadian Association of Car Clubs (CACC), which governs motorsports in British Columbia.

Said Kaerne: “If you look at the FIA statutes, the ethics and the Code of Conduct statues, under 2.2, it specifically says that promoters may not be part of an ASN. They’ve gone against their own statutes. That in itself should be a red flag.”

Scully was not as forthcoming in his criticism but agreed there was a problem.

But according to vice-president Fellows, that shouldn’t be a concern because the regions will continue to run amateur racing as they always have while the commercial side will concentrate on attracting money — “Right now, there is no money. None” — in order to create a structure to build a ladder system for young Canadian racers to advance in the sport beyond karting.

So far as money is concerned, the previous ASN had no such problems when it set up shop in 1990.

“It was the best of times for racing in this country,” Fellows said. “You had three major homegrown series sponsoring three different categories of racing and one of the sponsors of one of those series (Imperial Tobacco) was also building a driver development program. There was plenty of money flowing and it was a much easier time for revenue for the sanctioning body.

“The issue with the new sanctioning body is that we’re at a low point and our ability to attract some commercial interest is part of the plan. That’s the way we can grow this. Having the sporting authority supported by licensing and a couple of sanctioning deals is not financially viable. There aren’t enough people in this country with racing licences to support that.”

For his part, Dumontier said it became apparent a year or two ago that the previous ASN would not be able to carry on much longer and so he contacted Fellows.

“It was clear that we were the two biggest in the sport and it was natural for us to be involved,” he said. “At some point we decided to put in our own application. I met Jean (Todt) at our event in Montreal in June (the Grand Prix) and then again in January in Paris. The FIA World Motorsport Council met in April and our application for a new ASN was accepted.”

Dumontier said, like Fellows, that they plan to let the regions administer amateur motorsports in their jurisdictions while the new ASN will concentrate on the commercial side. This, in turn, will let them work with the regions, “to go back to the grassroots.”

“As you know,” he said, “since we lost Player’s (Imperial Tobacco), it was never replaced so we have to try to create a ladder series to bring the young kids to perform on the larger stage. We are lucky enough to have two Canadian drivers in the F1 championship (Lance Stroll and Nicholas Latifi) and we know why that is (family money), so we have to create something for the young people who don’t have that level of support. It’s part of the vision that Ron and I have to grow the sport.”

To that end, Dumontier said he, Fellows and others on the executive board want to promote more international events in the country.

“There is nothing specific at the moment, but in my discussions with Jean Todt, Canada is seen as a country with a great racing tradition. The Grand Prix has been here for more than 50 years and Jean would like to see more international events in the country. I’m on the same page. We are going to work with the FIA to see what we can bring and where.”

Dumontier said that right from the beginning, “we said in our application to start an ASN that the regions have to be involved and we wanted to work with the regions. They had an application of their own (to start an ASN) but they had disagreements, primarily from one guy, from the western side of the country.”

That, of course, would be Michael Kaerne, who freely admits to being “a s- disturber. I had to ask the hard questions (of the previous ASN) because somebody had to do that.”

Kaerne, a former driver, mechanic, president of CACC and national steward for the Grand Prix, acknowledges that he undoubtedly browned off some of his counterparts across the country when he unilaterally incorporated a not-for-profit federal corporation, Motorsport Canada ASN, in order to apply for a new Canadian ASN.

But he is well connected with senior FIA officials and suggests the process — despite that letter of objection sent to the FIA by the leaders of two of the five regions — eventually came down to three applications: his, one from the U.K. (Gary O’Hare, who operates a racing school in the U.K and Quebec) and the Dumontier-Fellows bid. The one from the U.K. was subsequently rejected and Kaerne says that the World Motorsport Council “wanted Francois and I to try to work together.”

“So I got hold of Francois and he said that he’d have to talk to Ron and that he’d get back to me but he never did. So I tailored my proposal to include Francois as representative of all the motorsport promoters in Canada and sent that in. It turned out that Francois’ proposal was the only one put up for a vote.”

Kaerne thinks he knows what happened.

“Francois had been agitating for a new ASN for at least two years,” he said. “At Montreal last year, he made a deal with Jean Todt, who’s a friend of his, and so things kind of went from there.”

But there is a bad taste in some mouths.

“I don’t think WCMA (Manitoba and the Prairies), CACC (British Columbia) and, the last time I talked to them, Ontario (CASC-OR) are planning to join Francois’ ASN. ASQ (Quebec) will, because there is a connection there; we don’t know about ARMS (Atlantic Region Motor Sports, which was asked to comment for this story but declined after initially saying it would).

In the end, Kaerne doesn’t think amateur racing needs the new ASN.

“The thing about the regions,” he said, “is that we only need the FIA for international licenses, or to put on listed events (international races) and because we’re not the promoters of listed events, it’s not a real requirement. We have the same insurance policy as we got through (the previous) ASN Canada and we’ve done that individually.

“We haven’t heard anything from Francois in regards to his plans. He’s said previously that he would have a representative of the regions on his board but nothing’s been brought forward. The regions could keep things going; whether it would be as healthy or healthier is another question,” adding that despite the difficulties, there are advantages to being affiliated with the governing ASN, such as a financial payment for including FIA rules in regional regulations.

So there you have it. There’s more — much more — but I’m sure you get the picture. Scully, the doctor who got into motorsport in the 1960s when he went to Mosport Park for a race and was appalled at the lack of medical facilities (“There were none”) and subsequently founded the Ontario Race Physicians organization that, to this day, staffs motorsport events, said in an interview that he stands ready to chair a meeting in an effort to solve the impasse.

“I’ve been around Canadian racing a long time,” said the chairman of the Hall of Fame, “and served on medical commissions at the international level, and I can converse in both official languages. I have the skills to bring people together to reach a consensus (he’s a former president of the Ontario and Canadian Medical Associations) and I’m ready to answer an invitation to do that if one should be forthcoming.”

My take: Despite the hurt feelings, and the evidence of politics at play (as in, the fix might have been in), Francois Dumontier and Ron Fellows are the people who should run motorsport in Canada. The world has changed (no, I’m not talking about the pandemic) and a professional ASN is preferable to one composed of amateurs.

In order for motorsport in Canada to grow, not just in Ontario and Quebec but everywhere, a ladder system of both open and closed-wheel racing must be established and for that to happen you need money. Dumontier and Fellows, with the help of new member Wetmore, have a better chance of getting into boardrooms to pitch for it than just about anybody else involved in Canadian racing, Once upon a time the tobacco companies poured millions into the sport but that’s gone and has never been replaced. If anybody can raise it, these men can.

The proof will be in the pudding, of course. Everybody will be watching.

The reopening of dealerships is welcome news to employees and customers across the province.

At the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association (TADA) introduced sweeping health and safety guidelines aimed at protecting service staff and customers.

The TADA released a comprehensive set of guidelines for the safe reopening of sales and other areas within a dealership. These guidelines were created in consultation with the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association and other provincial auto associations.

Each dealership will follow strict health and safety protocols for each department.

For sales departments, the following guidelines have been issued to all registered new-car dealerships in Ontario to ensure maximum safety for dealership employees and customers (these are highlights of the guidelines only):

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during a demo or test drive, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, accessories and trunk handle, will be disinfected. When cleaning is complete, the vehicle will be locked and recorded as disinfected.

A stringent appointment system to control customer flow will be implemented.

Each dealership will install signage indicating where customers are to proceed upon arrival.

When confirming appointments by phone, customers will be advised to not visit the dealership if they are exhibiting any symptoms associated with COVID-19. Upon arrival at the dealership, customers will also be advised of the safety measures in place to protect them, as well as staff. These may include restricted access to the showroom floor, the presence of hand-sanitizer stations, limited washroom access, etc.

Dealership staff at reception will be safely distanced from customers and have access to appropriate personal protective equipment.

Customers will be directed to sanitize their hands upon arrival, prior to meeting with any dealership staff.

A staff member will unlock a vehicle and keep the key on their person at all times.

Digital records will be kept of each vehicle presented to customers, including name, contact information, date, duration of entry and staff-member name.

All vehicles will be locked after each presentation and the key to the staff member responsible for cleaning and disinfecting keys.

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during the presentation will be disinfected, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories and trunk handle.

Any employee(s) carrying out the evaluation of vehicles for potential trade will wear protective gloves throughout the process and observe proper handwashing protocols immediately upon completion of the evaluation.

For test drives, a series of protocols have been suggested for all salespeople which include, among other things, washing his/her hands prior to departing, advising the customer to do the same, taking a photo of the customer’s driver’s licence without touching the physical licence and choosing a disinfected vehicle OR ensuring the customer’s selected vehicle is properly disinfected prior to departing. Dealers will be following provincial social-distancing guidelines while they remain in place

Delivery of purchased vehicles will be done at the physical dealership, preferably in an outdoor location designated for this specific purpose. Dealership staff will ensure full sanitization of the vehicle interior, including steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories, as well as all door and trunk handles, prior to providing the customer with the keys. Keys will also be fully disinfected before presentation.

Dealership staff will maintain the recommended two-metre distance from the customer during the delivery process and must not enter the vehicle with the customer. A full demonstration of the vehicle’s features can be provided virtually, i.e. through online video, FaceTime, etc.

He Reviews Weekend Auto Racing Every Monday At Wheels.Ca.']",2020-05-08,"We’ve all heard, or read about, people who restore old cars as a hobby. In fact, we used to publish a popular feature here in Wheels called Eye Candy, in which people who’d either purchased an already-restored car or taken a few years to polish up a clunker got to show them off in the paper.

The ones who bought their restored automobiles might have received accolades, but they missed out on a lot: the challenge, the frustration, the expense and the time required to take on a restoration project. Most important, they also missed out on the fun of acquiring something that had seen better days and that they’d brought back to life and made sparkle.

The ones who opted to do the restorations themselves often admit to working in their spare time for five or 10 years to do a car. I want to introduce you today to a neighbour of mine in Mississauga who’s taken — wait for it — 35 years to return a 1968 Plymouth Barracuda fastback to its former, brand-new glory.

That’s three and a half decades.

His name is Todd Murray, he's 53 and the car he’s nuts about, and has devoted so much of his life to, is a two-door passenger car that was based initially on the 1959 Plymouth Valiant compact car but had evolved to boast Barracuda-specific sheet-metal styling and have its own range of models, including convertibles.

Murray bought his baby the year he turned 18 — 1985 — and finally finished it, literally, the other day. It’s licensed and insured and rarin’ to go. He planned to spend the summer this year going on cruises and to car shows in towns all over Ontario, but the coronavirus crisis has more or less put a damper on that.

But taking 35 years to do what he’s done shows he’s a man of patience, so the cruises and car shows can wait. A pretty laid-back guy, he’s OK with that.

Murray is single, has a 10-year-old daughter and works as a heating, air-conditioning and ventilation mechanic. He lives up the street from me in a two-storey, three-bedroom house with a one-car garage where he’s done much of the work on this car.

Read that again. He’s done much of the work on that car in a one-car garage. The ’Cuda is about six feet wide and the garage is nine feet, giving him about 18 inches on either side of his pride and joy to do much of the restoration work.

(Actually, it just hit me that maybe the reason it took him 35 years to do this is because he didn’t have a lot of room to manoeuvre inside that garage.)

Murray and two pals from his Oakville high school days, Paul Bouchard and Blake Dryden, are crazy about Barracudas and have all worked on each other’s cars at one time or another.

“In our spare time, we’ve gone to car shows over the years,” Murray said. “Pretty much every night of the week, there’s a car show you can go to. It’s a good night out.”

He said he doesn’t belong to a car club: “The three of us are kind of our own little club.”

Bouchard, who was visiting his friend the day I’d wandered over, owns a 1970 ’Cuda that’s blue, but if painted canary yellow would have fit right into the 1996-2001 TV series “Nash Bridges.”

“I remember the first episode I saw of that show,” Bouchard joked. “A woman committed suicide by jumping out of a highrise window and she landed right on the hood of the ’Cuda. I said, ‘Oh, no!’”

Murray said he inherited his love for cars from his father, the late Keith Murray. “My father was always a Mopar guy, and he had a bunch of old cars as I was growing up and he kind of piqued my interest,” he said. “I would always help him out, fixing his cars. He would do most of the timing and oil changes and everything right in our driveway, so I kinda got into it through him.”

Todd Murray said he actually owned two 1968 Barracudas before buying the one that’s in his garage now, but neither of the early cars was a keeper.

“I took parts off them to use on this one,” he said. “I stripped (the cars) down and saved all the parts and then Paul and Blake helped me when I started this project, which has really been an ongoing hobby.

“I bought this car in the spring when I was 18, and I’ve been working on it ever since. When we started, I was so meticulous that in order to do it right, the guys and I decided on what’s called a rotisserie restoration.”

(Which is when the car is totally disassembled. The frame is then placed on a car rotisserie so it can be turned and every nook and cranny on the car can be examined.)

“The whole car was stripped right down,” Murray said. “Every nut and bolt was taken out and either replaced or machined to be as good as new. We sandblasted the frame because the underside was in really bad shape. I had full quarter panels put on it.

“The fenders came from Portland, Ore. I have a friend who lives in Vancouver and he was into Barracudas, too, and he found me a set of fenders out there that were in, like, mint condition, original paint, so he bought them and shipped them to me. I went over to the train station and picked them up.”

Parts, as well as coming from his two previous ’Cudas and Oregon, were sourced at a huge midsummer car show held each year in Carlisle, Pa.

“That car show can take you three full days to go through,” he said. “We usually left Wednesday night or Thursday morning and the car show would start Friday morning and go to Sunday night, so we would camp out at the show. We would rough it — we slept in tents — but we had a lot of fun. We had to do a lot of searching for what we needed and then we’d bargain, which was always fun. We found tons of stuff for my car as well as Paul’s and Blake’s cars.”

He also bought a road sign, “Barracuda Blvd.,” that hangs in his garage. But back to the restoration.

“I did most of the mechanical work,” he said. “All of the chrome, which is brand new, and the reassembling was done in the garage, but I had a guy who did all the metal work for me — Paul’s car, too — and his name is Keith Sims, who’s probably one of the best metal guys around.

“Then I had to get the body done after that, to straighten it all back out, and painted (lime green), inside and out, and then I had to piece it all back together.”

This is where working in the small garage got tricky.

“There’s not a lot of room to move around in there,” he said. “It was a very tight fit, especially when I was trying not to scratch a new paint job. That’s why I wear track pants when I’m working around the car. No metal, like on jeans. Putting all the chrome back on it was definitely time-consuming. It’s been a labour of love, that’s for sure.”

I told him that I’d seen him zipping around a corner in our neighbourhood a few weeks ago and was wondering whether he was just out taking a quick spin and hoping not to run into the police. Turns out, as mentioned, the car is finished, licensed and insured, and this was to be the first summer he would drive it.

“There are still a couple of bugs to get out of it,” he said. “Steering-wise, it pulls a little to the right, so I have a guy that’s going to align the whole front end. All the parts up front are brand new, including the hub caps, which I will put on after the alignment, so it’s just a matter of setting it up properly. Other than that, it drives and rides real good.”

Murray said he’s restored the car to 1968 “factory spec,” so that means the seatbelts are just that: lap belts. There is no three-point harness in it like there is in 2020-model vehicles.

Murray doesn’t think that, after 35 years of tender, loving care, he would ever sell his ’Cuda. But would he restore another one?

“It would be pretty tough to do, money-wise,” he said. “I have between $65,000 and $70,000 invested in this one and that doesn’t count all of my labour. It’s an expensive hobby. Parts are expensive nowadays, too. You can probably buy just about anything for this car, unlike the scrounging around I had to do, but you would have to pay top price.

“Having said that, I think I’d like to buy one for my daughter Alyssa. I could fix it up for her; I have a lot of spare parts. I’m actually going to pick her up later today and take her for her first ride in it. She’s watched me work on it, so it will be a thrill for both of us.”

OK, the question I really wanted to ask was how fast this car could go. Murray sensed this and answered before I could ask it.

“This car has a 340-cubic-inch (5.6 L) small-block V-8 in it,” he said. “It has a four-barrel carburetor and it’s pretty quick. Lots of get up and go. Depending on the gear ratio you would run in the back, this one, factory, probably would do the quarter in around 14 seconds, That’s pretty good for a stock 340 car.

“When I first bought this car, it was painted white, and I took it to Cayuga (now Toronto Motorsports Park) a few times. I ran it down the strip. We went to the drag races there when we were younger. We had a lot of fun.”

Before I go, one other thing about this guy. Everything about this car is immaculate — just like his lawn and his flower beds. “Yes,” he said, “I really enjoy gardening. Maybe not as much as I do working on my car, but it’s close.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What’s best: Fabulous looks; fabulous performance; room for more than one friend.

What’s worst: That stupid shift lever, obviously; a couple of missteps in trim bits, inside and out; ride on the harsh side.

What’s interesting: Mercedes leaves no “model stone’’ unturned.

First thing you have to know about the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ sedan is it bears little structural relationship to the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupé we tested a while back.

Gosh; you don’t think the similarity in the names is a deliberate attempt to fool the customer, do you?

Or the inattentive journalist?

Naw...

Second thing you have to know is this is a brilliant car, which in my view successfully bridges the gap between the all-out performance of its GT Coupé cousin and the E-Class family cars with which it shares some bones.

Third thing: I call this vehicle a sedan for one simple reason — it is a sedan.

What else would you call a car with four doors and four (optionally, five) seats?

Like other German manufacturers, Mercedes thinks that just because it has a sloping roofline and frameless side windows, although it does have a middle roof pillar, they can call this a coupé.

Not in my column. I write in English.

Labels be damned, this is a true AMG product, built at AMG’s facility in Affalterbach, and this body style is not available as a “normal” Mercedes.

My tester was actually a 2019 model, whose base list price was $177,500, and it topped out at $189,500. The 2020 model with a few extra bits of equipment starts at $182,600.

Chances are, your dealer won’t have many (any?) in stock. But you’d probably want to spec yours out anyway — the option list is endless.

The engine is the hottest locally available version of the corporate 4.0-litre twin-turbo V-8, producing 630 horsepower between 5,500 and 6,600 r.p.m., and 664 lb.-ft. of torque between 2,500 and 4,500 r.p.m. The signature of the sole engine assembler is on a plaque on the engine itself.

Interesting to note, this is actually more power than its allegedly more sporting cousin the AMG GT. Tobias Moers, head of AMG, told me at that car’s launch its dual-clutch transmission had a torque limitation the more powerful engine would exceed.

The GT S therefore uses Mercedes’ nine-speed automatic with the multi-plate clutch pack eliminating the sloppy starts that even the best torque-converter automatics can occasionally deliver, mounted up front behind the engine.

Suspension is the “AIRMATIC’’ system, with multi-chamber air springs and AMG’s adaptive dampers.

The “4MATIC+” part of the name means Mercedes’ full-time four-wheel-drive system, which automatically directs torque to whichever wheel can best use it.

The car is gorgeous, from the aggressive grille, slim LED headlights and subtle power bulges on the hood; through the smooth flanks with a subtle character line running the length of the car; to the slim tail lights and massive quad tailpipes and rear diffuser in the tail.

One harsh false note: the “vents” above the car’s nameplates on the sides just ahead of the front doors are fake. Shame.

At least the vents behind the rear wheels are real to allow air under the wheel arches to escape.

I was not initially a fan of matte paint finishes. The paint industry spent a century figuring out how to make cars shiny; now for an extra few grand you can make it look like someone painted it with a broom.

I’m starting to come around, because the “Designo Brilliant Blue Magno” looks terrific on this car. Another $2,500 from your piggy bank.

The interior is equally gorgeous, with real tree-wood (open-pore grey ash; $500), saddle-brown/black Nappa leather upholstery ($1,800) and top-quality materials everywhere, with the exception of the cover of the centre console in the rear seat, which is a cheap-looking bit of plastic. An odd oversight.

There are all sorts of features you will be discovering months after you take delivery.

Such as an interior colour lighting scheme that lets you choose the shade to suit your mood or taste.

And, the dash vents glow red or blue depending on whether warm or cool air is flowing through them.

The seats strike an excellent balance between the comfort required of a Grand Touring car and the lateral support needed for a car that handles this well.

The rear seat (two buckets or the optional three-seat bench) is actually habitable, provided occupants aren’t much taller than six feet. Your view of the outside world will be limited, however; the massive front-seat headrests take up most of the forward aspect, and the rear side windows are small triangles through which you must peek.

The dash and minor controls are a mix of the latest in Mercedes’ interior technology, with a couple of touches from the older-parts bin.

The twin screens on the dash provide a wide range of layouts depending on the selected driving mode. They are bright and readable, although it will take some time to know where every tidbit of information is located.

One of the “throwback” bits is the round knob on the centre console allowing selection of various functions. In some newer Mercedes models, this has been replaced with a touch pad hard enough to figure out when you’re standing still; when you are taking advantage of this car’s prodigious performance, it would be impossible, bordering on hazardous.

Some carmakers, with Mazda taking the lead, are starting to agree with me about this “just-touch-this” concept for the simple reason it is wrong.

Maybe when cars are driving themselves, you’ll have time to figure these things out. But then, why buy a car this much fun to drive yourself?

No Mercedes road test would be complete without my usual beef about the shift knob. Despite the German penchant for intelligence and logic, they continue to have Park selected by pushing a button instead of just shoving the shift lever full-forward.

Not only does this contravene 70-odd years of accepted practice for zero additional functionality, but it might be dangerous because it’s hard to get your finger on the button hidden under the shift knob itself.

Sorry; it’s just stupid.

That said, driving is what this car is all about, and it delivers.

Slam-you-back-into-the-seat levels of acceleration are a mere stab of the loud pedal away. Zero-100 km/h takes a tick over three seconds, at which point the car is barely clearing its throat.

A seamless upshift, and off you go to the red line again.

This auto-box is one of the most clever in the business, seemingly predicting what gear you’re going to need and selecting it for you. If you think you can do a better job (hint: you can’t), you can play with the steering column paddles, or that damnable shift knob.

Throttle response is about as quick as turbocharged engines get, a benefit of those turbos being nestled between the cylinder banks, close to the intake manifolds.

Even when you’re going about 70 or 80 km/h and hammer on the gas on a dry road, you can still get the traction control light to flash.

Fuel crisis? What fuel crisis? Gas is currently 80 cents a litre at my local self-serve...

Handling is outstanding, belying the car’s massive 2,000-kg-plus weight.

The steering is precise and perfectly weighted.

This car has Mercedes’ four-wheel steering — in-phase at higher speeds for more stability, counter-phase at low speeds for more agility. The fact that you absolutely cannot feel it working shows how well worked out it is.

As I mentioned in my review of the AMG GT coupé, Mercedes’ test drivers had the ability to shut this feature off (again, you can’t) and the car handled much better with it activated.

The optional Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires — same as on my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke although these are much bigger — provide astonishing levels of grip. From my personal Targa experience with this tire, they don’t abandon you if it starts to rain.

Several drive mode settings are available via a rotary knob on the steering wheel at about the four-o’clock position. Throttle response, transmission shift speed, ride height, suspension firmness, even the exhaust note, are all altered in fairly predictable ways for the “Comfort,” “Sport” and “Sport+” modes.

“Drift” mode lets you play full-on hooligan if you have an unlimited tire budget.

“Race” mode converts it into a rear-drive car. AMG suggests you limit this setting to track use.

Killjoys; it was not so long ago AMG didn’t build any four-wheel-drive cars because they were deemed insufficiently sporty to bear this hallowed nameplate.

You can also program and store your own preferred settings.

Even with the suspension set to Comfort, ride quality is definitely on the firm side. It’s a small price to pay for the grip.

So, is the Mercedes AMG GT S 4MATIC+ a luxury car? Is it a very fast GT car? Is it a thinly disguised race car?

I’d say yes, yes and yes.

Its closest competitor would be the Porsche Panamera Turbo. One advantage the Porsche offers is the station wagon (Sport Turismo) body style, which is even more capacious than the AMG’s.

But the AMG GT S is more hard-edged, more of a pure driver’s car.

This customer is surely going to own more than one car.

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-05-01,"During the Second World War, many Canadian businesses retooled their operations to manufacture war materials for the Allied countries.

Canada (and the world) is now fighting a much different type of war, and Canadian businesses have stepped up to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and necessary supplies for health-care professionals and other front-line workers.

Major auto manufacturers, in particular, are among the many industries that have made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. Auto manufacturers have leveraged their assembly plants, supply chain networks and expertise to provide face shields, ventilators and other items.

Although major auto manufacturers in North American have shut down production of automobiles, it is inspiring to see how quickly Ford and other manufacturers have pivoted from making vehicles to making medical supplies and equipment, and how our industry has rallied together during this difficult time.

The Ford Motor Company (the brand I represent), with support of Unifor Local 200, is producing face shields at its Windsor, Ont., engine plant and making them available to Ford dealers across Canada. Dealers are distributing the face shields to hospitals in their communities.

My dealership will receive a shipment of 100 face shields on May 4, which we will donate to Kirkland and District Hospital. We have requested more of these protective devices for a later date, which we plan to distribute locally.

In the U.S., Ford engineers are using their ingenuity and expertise to convert F-150 seat fans to manufacture much-needed respirators and ventilators. The company has teamed up with GE Healthcare and 3M to increase production of medical equipment and supplies.

Ford has a proud history of giving back to people and communities in need across Canada, and I am enormously proud to be a part of this company. (Other automakers have proud histories of providing support for communities at home and abroad as well.)

In 2016, the Ford Motor Company of Canada and Canadian Ford dealers donated more than $500,000 to the Red Cross for relief and recovery efforts related to the wildfires that impacted Fort McMurray and surrounding areas.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada has donated approximately 1,000 N95 ventilator masks, gloves, protective eyewear and sanitary boot protectors to four local hospitals. The company has used its production system expertise to streamline the design of the masks.

Toyota Canada is also working with InkSmith, a Canadian 3D printing company that is manufacturing face shields for medical workers.

GM Canada is preparing parts of the Oshawa, Ont., plant to produce face masks based on the GM production model already working in Michigan. The company plans to manufacture approximately one million masks per month, at cost, for the Canadian government with an estimated 50 employees supporting two shifts of production.

Some automakers have introduced relief programs and special financing arrangements to help customers affected by COVID-19.

For instance, Hyundai is offering existing finance and lease customers payment deferral options, and new customers have the option of a six-month deferral program on all new vehicles financed at a Hyundai dealership.

For Mazda customers whose leases are coming due but who are not “in a position to replace their vehicle at this time,” the automaker is offering lease extensions. Nissan Canada Finance will work with customers to discuss payment arrangements or deferments.

If you have a finance or lease concern about your vehicle, contact the finance arm of your respective auto brand. There is no common financial aid program in place in Canada; each automaker is handling financial concerns of customers on a case-by-case basis.

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Former Toronto Star Editor Who Continues To Write For Wheels Under Contract. He Is An Inductee Of The Canadian Motorsport Hall Of Fame', 'A Member Of Its Board Of Directors.']",2020-05-01,"I have been inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame twice.

Not really — but allow me to explain.

Early in 1993, I received a press release from two guys I knew from racing, Gary Magwood and Lee Abrahamson, announcing the creation of the CMHF. As well, the release announced that the first gala induction dinner would be held at the Four Seasons Yorkville and feature John Surtees as guest speaker. It also announced the first group of inductees, headed by the late Gilles Villeneuve.

Now, I have always been very sensitive when it comes to the subject of auto racing. I’ve always felt there was a bias against oval-track racing and oval-track racers. This feeling might be misguided, but I’ve always felt that way. So, although I wasn’t surprised when I saw the rest of the names on the list of first-year inductees, all of whom are legends, I was bummed out because, as I expected, there was nary an oval-track racer on the list.

Never one to back down from a fight, I fired off a fax to Magwood. “Congratulations on the Hall of Fame and your first group of inductees,” I wrote. “But there is racing in this country other than road racing,” I continued, “and I consider the omission of the late Billy Foster, the first Canadian to qualify to race in the Indianapolis 500, to be a mistake.”

Magwood was, and remains, a very intuitive person. Fifteen minutes later, he faxed me back. “His name was just added to the list,” he said. (Editor’s note: Foster, of course, was not the first Canadian; he was the sixth, as the CMHF has since discovered.)

I attended that first induction gala — I sat at a table in the back with Jean Gauthier, former owner of Shannonville Motorsport Park — and moments before grace, Magwood approached me. “We couldn’t find anyone from the Foster family to be here,” he said, “so you’ll have to represent him,” which I was happy to do.

I accepted the induction honour on behalf of Foster, his family and “all oval racing drivers in Canada.” As luck would have it, I was able to make contact with Foster’s son, Billy Foster Jr., who was a police officer in Victoria, and presented him with the Hall of Fame medallion when we were both at the 1995 Molson Indy Vancouver.

So that was induction No. 1.

Induction No. 2 came in 2013 when I was welcomed into the Hall as the first journalist to be inducted. I was in a class with Diana Carter, John Magill, Nigel Mansell, Scott Maxwell and Paul Tracy. Pretty good company, if I do say so myself.

The reason I am writing about this today is because nominations are now open for the next induction ceremony, which will be held in downtown Toronto at the Canadian International AutoShow next February. And this is where everybody reading this comes in.

People frequently come up to me and say, “How come so-and-so isn’t in the Hall of Fame?” And I reply, “Probably because he/she hasn’t been nominated.” Let me explain.

It is not the job of the Motorsport Hall of Fame, or any other hall of fame, for that matter, to cherry pick who will be inducted. These are not “old boys’ clubs,” or shouldn’t be. Inductees are selected from people nominated by the public. In a media release this week, the CMHF said this:

“The CMHF honours and recognizes the achievements of individuals and institutions who have made outstanding contributions to Canadian motorsport as drivers, owners, team members, motorsport builders and significant contributors, as well as those who have distinguished themselves in a new media category.

“‘I look forward to seeing the nominations for this year. I do not envy the selection committee, which always has difficult choices to make,’ said the chairman of the board of directors, Dr. Hugh Scully.

“‘I urge everyone involved in motorsport — from team owners to drivers to fans — to nominate anyone who you feel has made a major contribution to motorsport in Canada, whether behind the wheel, from the owner’s box, on a timing stand, turning a wrench or holding a microphone.’

“As a general rule, inductees must be retired from competition for at least three years or, if still active, involved in motorsport for at least 25 years. Information about the nomination process, including the form, and submission requirements are available at CMHF.ca.”

OK, let me emphasize what Scully is saying about nominating someone. Road and street racing, for instance, could not happen without marshals. I know marshals who have flagged at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, the Molson/Honda Indy, the Grand Prix du Canada, the Grand Prix du Monaco and so on. Several could qualify for induction, but somebody has to nominate them.

I know a fellow who owns a speedway, who races sprint cars internationally, has won championships, has been named World of Outlaws promoter of the year not once but twice and is not in the Hall of Fame. Somebody has got to nominate that guy.

Now, two words of caution:

1) You can’t just send in the form and say something like, “Ronnie’s a really great guy and should be in the Hall of Fame,” or “Jeff’s been racing for 40 years and while he hasn’t been very successful, he should be in the Hall because everybody knows him.” Nominators (this means you) have to do the work of listing the contributions and the racing record of the person being nominated. You have to make the case. This is a Hall of Fame (emphasis on the fame).

2) Don’t get discouraged. Just because the person you nominated doesn’t make the cut this year, doesn’t mean he/she won’t be selected next year. Just keep sending in their nomination form, with documentation, and sooner or later, if worthy, they will probably make it.

I mean, how many years did it take for Dougie Gilmour to finally be named to the Hockey Hall of Fame?

Please think about this, and if you know of someone who merits consideration, please nominate them.

Two members of the Hall of Fame, François Dumontier and Ron Fellows, are now the two most powerful men in Canadian motorsport. The FIA announced this week that Dumontier is now the president of the National Sporting Authority in Canada (ASN) and Fellows is vice-president. They replace Paul Cooke and Roger Peart, who have retired. Dumontier is the owner and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Fellows is co-owner of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. More about all this at a later date.

BMW Andretti Motorsport’s Maximilian Guenther won the race Saturday in “Hong Kong,” with Envision Virgin Racing’s Nick Cassidy second and Pascal Wehrlein of Mahindra Racing third.

Now, gaming technology, which lends itself to auto racing better than any other sport, allows everyone involved in Formula Electric — teams, manufacturers, sponsors, drivers and fans — to take part in the live online races while raising funds for UNICEF, which will help keep children around the world safe, healthy and attending school online during the coronavirus crisis.

And that technology has also allowed the electric racing series to introduce a Pro-Am element to this promotion. Each race will have two separate grids, one made up of professional race drivers from the Formula E Championship and the other one filled by some of the fastest gamers in the world.

The carrot on the stick for the gamer champion will be a drive on a race weekend in a real Formula E car, once racing gets going again.

To keep this series as even as possible, drivers and gamers are competing using rFactor 2 software. The pro drivers all got simulators provided by Playseat, steering wheels and pedals from Fanatec and the latest gaming PCs, monitors, headphones and other peripherals from Asus.

The usual race points system is in play, but additional points are being awarded for pole position and fastest lap. Double points will also be on offer at the final race on June 13.

Now leading the championship as the result of his win on Saturday, Guenther punched the air as he got the checkered flag. “It wasn’t an easy race,” the German driver said moments after the event. “Even though it’s not the real world, we’re all competitive and we want to be at the front.”

Joshua Rogers, an Australian who earned $43,000 (U.S.) in 2019 competing in six gaming tournaments, won the Challenge Grid race.

You can watch the Race at Home Challenge every Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT on FIAFormulaE.com. Play-by-play announcer Jack Nicholls is calling the action, Nicki Shields will be covering the pits and Dario Franchitti is doing colour and analysis.

Now, as luck would have it, I did an interview a week ago Thursday with Nissan drivers Sébastien Buemi and Oliver Rowland. Nissan is in the series to promote its Leaf electric car and its Nissan Intelligent Mobility, which is integrated technology designed to increase safety, comfort and control while driving.

And I say “as luck would have it” because I really didn’t know all that much about virtual racing, or this particular series, and those two drivers were only too happy to fill me in.

Buemi, of course, is a name most race fans would recognize. He is a former Formula One driver (Scuderia Toro Rosso — and he once did a commercial for the sponsoring energy drink Red Bull by driving his F1 car across a frozen lake in northern Quebec) who won the Formula E championship in 2015-16 (Formula Electric starts its season in the late fall and finishes in the spring) and holds most of the records in that series — poles, fastest laps and so on. He was driving when Nissan won its first race in the series, last year in New York. Rowland was rookie of the year last season.

One of the surprising things they both said was that it’s harder to drive a simulator than a real race car. For instance, Rowland said that he’s new to this and, “Instead of cues, like what you can feel and what you can see, all you’ve got is a screen. You have a feeling that you’re driving a very good lap and then you find that you’re not. Some of the more experienced guys (driving simulators) have a bit of a head start.”

Added Buemi: “You don’t get the same feedback; it’s not the same. Simulators have improved massively over the years, but they are still not the same as the real car.”

Buemi said he’s tried to make the best out of being quarantined. “I exercise in the mornings and afternoons, but I am enjoying spending time with my family, which I can’t do because I’m away a lot. My children are four and two, so it’s nice to be with them.”

Returning to the Race at Home Challenge, he said: “It’s not like real racing, but it’s better than nothing. Everybody is stuck at home, so clearly, you have something to watch and I’m very happy that Formula E has launched this.”

Rowland had one suggestion: “You practise all week and then qualifying is one lap, which is kind of nerve-wracking because you don’t want to make a mistake. Instead of practising for five days, I think it would be better if they didn’t give us the circuit until Saturday morning. Then we could practise for an hour and then qualify.”

Formula E donated 10,000 pounds sterling ($17,400 Canadian) to UNICEF and will do so at the conclusion of every race up to a total of 100,000 pounds ($174,000). Fans are encouraged to donate by clicking on the prompts at the official Formula E YouTube channel, Facebook page and Facebook Gaming site, Twitch channel and via @FIAFormulaE on Twitter.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the “if life hands you lemons” file, if you are stuck at home, here’s something that will help you pass the time and also do your car some good:

Clean it properly.

“Even with ‘shelter-at-home’ orders and physical distancing, many people rely on their vehicle to go to work or run errands. You might be surprised at the number of places your car can harbour germs and bacteria,” says Andrew Harkness, director of after-sales for Nissan Canada.

And you thought theft, crashes, flat tires, rust and mechanical breakdowns were the only car-related things you had to worry about!

I would start with a thorough exterior cleaning, probably at a coin-op, hand-held spray-wash facility. I never trust those rotating-bristle-brush systems, although they claim they do not harm the finish. Your call.

Perhaps needless to say, when using anything that might have been touched by anyone else, like the “wands” at the car wash, put new rubber gloves on before you get out of your car.

On your way home, stop at a drugstore to get some isopropyl alcohol (70 per cent alcohol) if you don’t already have some . The Public Health Agency of Canada says it is effective against COVID-19 .

Start with a general cleanup of the interior using a soft cloth — better still, a microfibre cloth — dampened with soap and water.

Next, use another clean cloth dampened with that isopropyl alcohol to disinfect anything you would touch.

Door handles inside and out, trunk/hatch/liftgate handles, key or key fob, steering wheel, seatbelt buckles, starter button if your car is plagued with one (small editorial comment there), gearshift lever or buttons, HVAC controls, radio/sound-system controls, lights, wipers, turn signals, cruise-control lever or buttons, four-way-flasher switch, rear-view mirror (make sure to get the back and sides of it, too), side-view mirrors or the controls thereof, centre stack, glove box and centre-console lid, parking-brake lever or control ...

Geez, when you think of all the bits in your car that you touch.

And anything else I might have missed.

Take particular care with the seatbelts themselves. Harsh cleaners can degrade the fibres in the belt fabric and affect the belts’ strength.

Another caveat applies to the infotainment screen if your vehicle is so-equipped. It is obviously a commonly touched surface, but again, avoid harsh cleaners. Screen wipes like you might use for your computer screens or camera lenses, or again, a soft cloth with soap and water, would be better.

If your car’s system has voice commands, you might consider learning how to use them.

Harkness also warns against using bleach, hydrogen peroxide, benzene, paint thinners or abrasive cleaners, which can damage interior surfaces and fabrics.

Ammonia-based cleaners can also damage the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings on infotainment system screens.

Also be careful with leather upholstery. Many leather or leather-like fabrics have a protective coating, which may be damaged by frequent cleaning with alcohol.

An alternative is, again, good old soap and water, followed by a leather conditioner.

Hey, didn’t I warn you about leather? Cloth upholstery is always better!

In addition to wearing gloves during all this, you should do it in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.

“Using the right product and the right material will not only help you properly clean your vehicle, but also avoid damaging it,” Harkness says.

You should also make sure your car stays in top mechanical condition. Just like you, your car needs regular exercise. I’m even taking the 1977 AMC Hornet out for the occasional spin.

Ryan Fulkerson, director of new model engineering for Nissan North America, suggests keeping the battery charged, either by a short drive or with a trickle charger.

I would add to this suggestion that you make that “short” drive long enough for the car to get up to full working temperature. This will also make sure all the car’s fluids get to wherever they need to go, so keep those levels topped up.

And don’t just let it idle — that’s worse than letting it sit unused.

Fulkerson also notes that tires that aren’t driven on frequently can develop flat spots which can lead to premature and uneven wear.

You should also check your tire pressures weekly. You should do this virus or no virus, but I know most of you don’t. It’s particularly important in these times when you might not be driving your car as regularly.

We know this virus will eventually peter out. Performing these maintenance and cosmetic tasks will help ensure your car is ready to go when the world is once again ready for it.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-04-25,"So, the other day, I’m talking to a guy named Bob Flotkoetter, who’s director of technology planning and research at Nissan North America’s Technical Centre in Farmington Hills, Mich. Like many people these days, predominantly white-collar people, he’s working at home.

And he’s not alone. That research and development tech centre employs roughly 1,200 people supporting the design and evolution of all Nissan and Infiniti vehicles produced in North America. To continue product development during this pandemic, 80 per cent of them are working, as they say, remotely.

Which is a subject near and dear to my heart and led to me asking questions.

I don’t know why, for instance, it took a pandemic to kick-start the movement to work from home. Yes, there are some people who will always have to go to “the office,” but many others can do what they do in a home office or in their dining room.

It can save them money on clothing, dry-cleaning (they can work in their jeans instead of a suit or dress), parking/transit expenses and lunch, and it would be great for the environment because less greenhouse gases would be produced by fewer cars on the roads.

If a company has to rent space, it could save money by cutting down on the amount needed. And rents could come down because landlords would want to fill that space.

I became aware of the potential back in 1994 when I was chair of the United Way campaign in Kingston and the Islands. We had a great year, a lot of fun, and we raised a lot of money. I’d go to, say, Novelis, or DuPont, or Goodyear over in Napanee, which were manufacturing facilities, and there’d be a good turnout and I’d do my shtick and the pledges would roll in.

But when I went to the OHIP building (the Ontario government of the day was big on decentralization), I received a shock. Not that many people had turned out for the kickoff breakfast.

“What’s going on?” I said to the person who was chair of the OHIP campaign. “Don’t worry,” she said. “We’ll reach our goal.” But I wanted to know more. “Where is everybody?” I asked. And this is what she said.

“Except for management, most of the employees are doing clerical work, processing claims. They can come to work here in the office, or they can work at home. About half like the discipline of the office, so they come here to work 8:30 till 4:30 and they are with us today.

“The other half are at home. As long as they maintain the average (of claims processed per hour), they can continue doing that. We work a 35-hour week. We have one woman who starts at midnight Sunday and she works straight through. Her ‘week’ is done at 11 o’clock Tuesday morning. I couldn’t do it, but it works for her.”

Remember, that was 1994. Things might have changed. But I thought that was terrific. It could work in any office setting, I thought. So I was delighted to hear Flotkoetter say that it’s working for the Nissan tech centre — he gave examples, which I’ll get to in a second — and might lead to a sea change as far as how workplaces in general are defined going forward.

Meantime, Nissan — like other automakers — is in business to build and sell cars and trucks and is not sitting idle.

“It’s the same mission for Nissan,” Flotkoetter said. “It’s just a different approach. We’re trying to push forward with product development and we’re trying to focus on the new models we’ll have coming out in the future. In order to do that, we all can’t just stop because we’re unable to be in the same place.”

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, Flotkoetter said, the company decided to shut down its operations and start to work remotely on March 13, beating the governor of Michigan to the punch by two days.

“For many engineers, that just meant bringing home their laptops. But for many on our team, the technicians working on the vehicles, working on wire harnesses, that sort of thing, they had to think about things from a different standpoint.”

He said there was one technician who was working on a wire-harness build. (A wire harness, or wiring harness, is made up of wire, terminals and connectors that relay electric power and other information from one end of the vehicle to the other.) “We needed to get these wire harnesses built so we could continue with our testing, so he pulled together the connectors, the pins, the crimping tools and all the documentation. He took it all with him on that Friday.

“The following Monday, when the ordinance from the state came to stay home, that technician was already prepared to do work. He went down into his basement, got an old dining room table that had wheels on it so he could move it around, and created his own workspace down there. He would check in with the engineers to make sure everything was on track, they would have periodic discussions and he could share videos of what he was working on.

“Those are things that are happening all over the organization; we’re just finding new ways to achieve the same mission.”

Another example: “You may have an engineer who took a test car home with him and he’s running into a problem. Now he can have a live Zoom meeting with another engineer who could be on the other side of the country. In real time, they are diagnosing and debugging together. This all came about because of this social distancing thing, but now it’s becoming more mainstream.

“This could be the wave of the future. I won’t always have to go down to the garage (in the Farmington Hills facility) or out to our facility in Arizona to investigate an issue and debug it. We can do it in real time using the technology that we have at our fingertips.”

Flotkoetter talked passionately about creativity, and how this pandemic might result in some innovative new products. For instance, he said Nissan’s rear-door alert came about after one of the engineers left a lasagna in the back seat. And “because of a plague, Sir Isaac Newton had to go back to his family’s farm. It was there that he developed his theories of gravity and motion.”

“When you have the opportunity to go outside your normal environment, you think of things differently. I think interesting innovations will come out of this.”

But the conversation kept returning to the challenges that working from home might bring.

“We’ve found that there’s a blurred line between home life and work life,” he said. “I’ve heard, ‘Dad, you’re working more hours,’ and I have been working more hours because there’s no shutting down, per se. When I’m at the office and my day ends, I can shut off my computer and go out to my car and drive home. Now, my work is here at home with me, so if there’s work to be done, I do it. I’ve heard that many of the engineers are working more hours as a result of that.”

Hmmm. Maybe. Perhaps they’re on the job, but I’m not sure they’d always be working.

Years ago, when I was writing a column, I decided I could write it from home; there was no reason to go into the office, except maybe to pick up my mail. If I applied discipline, I could be at my computer by 9, rattle off a masterpiece by noon and have the rest of the day to myself. Or so I thought.

So I would get up in the morning and get dressed. So far so good. Because I didn’t have to be anywhere, I would then have breakfast and read the morning paper. Sometimes I would dawdle. I would then sit down at the computer at 10, ready to go. But then — this being summer and the doors would be open with just the screen doors keeping out the bugs — I would hear the letter carrier come.

Naturally, I had to check the mail. And, also naturally, that would be the day Maclean’s magazine would arrive. So I would make a coffee and read Maclean’s. Then it would be noon and time for lunch and reruns of “I Love Lucy” and “Leave It To Beaver.” At 1 p.m., I would sit down at my computer and think that I would have an award winner done by 4.

Then I would hear a big truck squeak to a stop in front of my house. Two minutes later, there would be a knock at the door and my friend Fred, who worked for the city, would invite himself in for tea. At 3, after I got rid of him, I would sit down and start typing and then my pet cat Nigel, who I hadn’t seen all day, would be scratching at the door to be let in and naturally we’d have to have a reunion (he was the king of the forest, by the way, and frequently needed patching up) and by that time it would be 4 and people would start arriving home after working all day at their offices and getting lots done.

My deadline was 11 p.m. I would sit down at my computer at 9 and rattle off something run-of-the-mill and then swear to exert some self-discipline the next day when I would have to write another column, but I rarely did. My point is that my days started fairly early in the morning, but I often didn’t send in my column till late at night. And that is the danger, for some people, of working at home.

To get around that, Flotkoetter said, Nissan North America already has a virtual office policy in place and he thinks this shutdown might lead to some enhancements. “It’s a good opportunity for us to step back and reflect on how we’re doing our jobs, which could lead to some changes to that policy. I think we’re learning now what works, what are the major challenges, how we can improve the home office environment (he said Zoom has turned out to be a godsend to hold staff meetings) and I think we’ll take a hard look at that once we all get back together.”

Meantime, as he had throughout our conversation, Flotkoetter kept returning to the challenges presented by working remotely. “For instance, I don’t think that anybody would ever wish that we had more traffic in the Detroit area — which is plenty — but a lot of the testing we do depends on normal traffic flows. Right now, the roads are fairly empty, as you would expect, and this actually impacts our testing. Some of our features depend on traffic for us to evaluate how the features are performing.”

Flotkoetter said some of the engineers who work on radio and audio systems haven’t had any trouble taking their work home with them. “Usually, we do that in a lab environment, but now we have them doing it in their driveways,” he said.

“So, if you come across somebody sitting in their driveway with the sound turned up, it might not be that they’re listening to a last, favourite song before calling it a day. They are likely evaluating the audio system on that vehicle.”

He said this experience is going to be a good learning opportunity for all industries across the board.

“When you think how we’re using remote offices and virtual situations, I think this will provide us with a lot of learning that will help guide us in the future. This might ultimately change the way in which we do our business, going forward.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was thinking about that expression and how it applies to the COVID-19 crisis, as rumours have been flying about police stopping and ticketing people just for driving.

As our understanding of COVID-19 to evolves, the internet has been a great source of information and connecting with others, but it is also a breeding ground for misinformation.

To help set the record straight, I asked Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the highway safety division of the Ontario Provincial Police to provide clarity on these rumours.

Schmidt says that although road traffic volume has been greatly reduced in the past month, far too many drivers are taking advantage of the open roads to drive recklessly, which puts themselves, other motorists and the police at risk.

Reckless driving leads to more collisions and injuries and puts additional strain on hospitals that are already managing an influx of patients related to COVID-19.

Last weekend alone, 30 drivers in the GTA were stopped and their vehicles impounded and licences suspended for street racing and/or stunt driving. On average, 10 vehicles per day in Ontario are taken off the roads for speeding or stunt driving.

In Toronto, from March 15 to 30, police issued 35 per cent more speeding tickets than during the same two-week period last year. In York Region, tickets issued for stunt driving were up 60 per cent in March, compared to March 2019.

The message that Schmidt wants to share with the public is that drivers need to obey all traffic laws and public health guidelines. That means “slowing down and driving responsibly.” Schmidt stressed that the OPP will not take a break from enforcing public safety and traffic laws.

During this COVID-19 crisis, police (like everyone else) are trying to limit close contact with the public, which explains why police stations in Ontario are closed indefinitely (stations are accessible through phone and website). Police do not want to be a source of transmission of this disease or to be in contact with someone who may have COVID-19.

One of the most persistent rumours is that police are stopping drivers randomly and asking them where they live and to explain where they are going, and why, and ticketing vehicles that are carrying too many people.

According to Schmidt, that’s not true. At this time, there are no travel restrictions in place anywhere in the province, and no checkpoints. Nor are police ticketing cars with multiple passengers under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

However, Schmidt suggests that drivers listen to the recommendations of Public Health. but ignoring their recommendations is not an offence. He reiterated that Public Health has specific recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Drivers should understand that not only speeding and stunt driving are dangerous on the roads, but all types of reckless driving, including driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and distracted driving.

If there is a central message that Schmidt needs the public to understand, it is this: please slow down and use common sense. He says Ontario is still under a state of emergency and all citizens need to do their part to help flatten the curve.

“The job of the highway traffic division is to ensure the safety, security and protection of all Ontario citizens who are using the roadways,” Schmidt says. “It’s everyone’s job to obey the rules of the road and to follow the guidelines of health officials.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, it’s understated.

Civilized.

Friendly people.

Gorgeous scenery.

And some fabulous roads on which to test a car, which Lady Leadfoot and I recently did.

Last week, we told you about the Kiwi Nissan Qashqai we drove.

Today, more about the roads and the driving culture here.

Each of the North and South Islands is worth more than the two weeks we had in total, so a brief summary will have to suffice.

We did the South Island by train.

But this is a car column, so North Island it is.

We started in Auckland, the country’s largest city. It must be beautiful beneath all the hoarding; it’s being torn to shreds in preparation for next year’s defence of the country’s America’s Cup yachting victory in 2017.

Lots of detours and road closures, so rather than drive, we walked everywhere.

New Zealand is basically a bunch of mostly dormant volcanoes, so it is very hilly. My “thunder thighs” soon turned to jelly.

Time to hit the road.

We spent much of our trip following the country’s main north-south highway, Highway 1.

Our Qashqai had SatNav — “Doris of the Dashboard” to use my Motoring TV cohort Graeme Fletcher’s classic phrase.

Back home, our SatNav would say, “Make a left turn, and follow 401.”

Here, they put the definite article in front of the road number, so it would say “Make a left turn left, and follow the 401.”

This SatNav added a twist. “Doris” would phrase an instruction in her charming accent, but with a slight hesitation: “Make a left ‘turn’ and follow ... The One ...”

Made it sound like a religious experience.

If you know anything about New Zealand at all, you might guess that its No. 1 industry is raising sheep.

No shortage of them, although recently, raising cattle has become increasingly important.

Based on our trip, my guess would be: manufacturing orange plastic traffic pylons, “30 km/h” speed limit signs for the construction zones, and the “TEMPORARY” signs that invariably accompany them.

To their credit, New Zealand drivers generally follow these strictures.

It is late summer here, so the old Canadian joke applies — there are two seasons, “winter” and “road construction” — so we saw lots of those signs.

New Zealand keeps its roads in pretty good condition, although given its latitude (Auckland’s is about the same “south” as San Francisco’s is “north”) they don’t have a lot of snow or frost heaves to worry about.

As noted last week, even their newly paved roads aren’t baby-bum smooth. As in England, they put some texture into the surface, presumably to provide more grip when the road is wet.

Given that you’re never much farther than 100 kilometres from the ocean, the weather can be changeable.

Instead of “If you don’t like the weather, wait 20 minutes,” they say, “If you don’t like the weather, look behind you.”

On most days, the forecast indicated a chance of rain. But weather people everywhere always say that, because if they’re wrong, everybody’s still happy.

Except farmers and forest firefighters.

Whatever, we had excellent weather for most of our stay.

Police presence on the roads wasn’t oppressive, although we did see a couple of cars pulled over, presumably for speeding.

There are occasional yahoos, usually in pickup trucks, driving with no concern for fellow road users.

But overall, their driving culture is like the rest of the country — again, civilized.

“Utes” are quite popular here. The car/pickup truck hybrids originated in Australia when a woman wrote to the head of Ford Australia in the early 1930s, saying their family needed something to take the pigs to market on Saturday and the family to church on Sunday, but could only afford one vehicle.

Some of you may remember such vehicles as the Chevrolet El Camino and Ford Ranchero? They’d be “utes.”

From Auckland, we headed north in the direction of “Ninety Mile Beach.”

Yes, New Zealand does use the metric system. So what’s with the “Mile” in that name?

The beach in fact is about 90 kilometres long. Sorry, I don’t have an answer for that ...

At first, we had planned to drive all the way to the top, to Mile 1. Then we figured, each mile of beach is pretty much the same as every other mile. Or kilometre.

It was still summer, but too chilly for a swim, so we turned back south, yes, following (dramatic pause ...) “ ... The One ...”

At Kaitaia, we veered west toward the Tasman Sea, then south on Highway 12 (Doris: “follow ... The Twelve ...”) so we could see the “Tane Mahuta,” which is a giant kauri tree, an endangered species in its native land.

It is some 45 metres tall, and is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,500 years old. Breathtaking to be in the presence of a living thing that old.

The tree was “discovered” (meaning, “stumbled upon by people of European descent”) in 1928 while “ ... The Twelve ...” was being built.

This road had the most optimistic speed limit I can recall. Extremely twisty two-laner, narrow to non-existent shoulders, tough sight lines.

100 km/h? Yikes.

Maybe this is why New Zealand has produced on a per capita basis a surprisingly large number of remarkable race car drivers over the years, such as Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme, Chris Amon and, more recently, Brendon Hartley.

We don’t have many three-lane roads in Canada anymore, but they’re popular here. Two lanes uphill, one lane downhill. Plenty of warning when they’re coming up, to discourage dicey passing.

But they make the same mistake most Canadian provinces do. They add a lane on the right for passing (they drive on the left, remember), which is as it should be.

However, when they shrink the road back to a single lane, they take away the driving lane forcing people to merge right.

That’s just stupid.

How can the “driving” lane ever disappear?

They should just swap their warning signs for ours and we’d both be correct.

Continuing southeast to Rotorua, the centre of both Maori culture and volcanic activity, with geysers spouting regularly.

We were tourists, so excuse us for taking in the tourist sights, such as a traditional Maori cultural performance and dinner, and the glow worm caves — millions of the little creatures, winking away at us.

They also have an exhibit for the kiwi, the universal symbol of New Zealand. These nocturnal flightless birds are extremely shy and hard to see even in captivity. Some patience on our part led to eventual success, but photography is not allowed, so you’ll have to take my word for it.

Down to Wellington, our detour to the South Island, then back north to Napier on the Atlantic (eastern) coast.

By this time, the effects of the “corona” virus, as it was still being called, were starting to take effect.

New Zealand’s rate of infection is still one of the lowest in the world, but hotel rooms and dinner reservations became easier to get as people were cancelling travel plans.

Our final touristy stop was Coromandel, which again was much quieter than usual.

The road to this town looks fine on the map. But the last 40 kilometres took about an hour and a half to cover.

Lady Leadfoot did her best not to gasp every time we came to a corner.

We were heading north and her seat was on the “ocean” side.

The road is narrow.

It was dark.

There were big trucks.

No guard rails for most of it.

The fact that I am writing this means we survived.

And we are still married.

The return trip the next day was even scarier. Not just because I was now on the “ocean” side, but because in broad daylight, I could see how narrow the road was.

And how big those trucks were.

By the time we got to Auckland, the airport was restricted to just passengers. Ours turned out to be the second-last Air Canada flight to leave the country.

Darn. Another month or two here could have worked.

So “Kia Ore,” a Maori expression which seems to cover everything from “HI!” to “Have a nice day.”

If you ever get the chance to go to New Zealand, take it.

I’m already counting my next three million Aeroplan miles.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-04-17,"In recent weeks, the media has hailed the efforts of front-line workers who are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic — the doctors, the nurses, the first responders, the retail employees, among others.

What is like to work on the front lines of this health crisis?

I recently asked Natalia Kusendova that very question. Kusendova is the MPP for the riding of Mississauga Centre, and the youngest female member of provincial Parliament.

Several weeks ago, she added the extra duties of her previous career and has taken up a role as a registered nurse in the emergency department at Etobicoke General Hospital, while continuing her duties as an MPP.

As Kusendova explains, returning to nursing at this time is no different than her reasoning for getting into politics: “I wanted to impact my community in a positive way,” she says.

Working in an emergency room during this health crisis does not strike fear into Kusendova’s heart. On the contrary, she is motivated and energized by the high level of professionalism and organization at her hospital, by the levels of co-operation among various levels of government, and by the support from individuals and businesses.

Hospitals like Etobicoke General have introduced safety measures and protocols to ensure that doctors, nurses, staff members and patients are protected and safeguarded at all times. The stream of COVID-19 patients (as opposed to potential surges) has not overtaxed the system and led to panic situations.

Kusendova realizes that people might be fearful about going to a hospital during the COVID-19 crisis, and she wants to reassure the public that hospitals are safe environments. There is currently an adequate supply of intensive-care beds and ventilators to accommodate the health-care needs of the public.

Kusendova believes that the province’s state of emergency (declared on March 16) has been a significant factor in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases. It bans people from gathering in public spaces and it outlaws events with gatherings of more than five people.

She reiterates that if you are having mild symptoms and suspect COVID-19, please call Telehealth first at 1-866-797-0000. If you are having moderate to severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or chest pain, please visit to an emergency room right away. People are urged not to visit an assessment centre unless they have been referred by a health-care professional.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the actions of citizens to self-isolate at home and obey the guidelines from public health officials. “These preventative actions by Ontarians have helped to thwart a surge in COVID-19 cases,” she says. “We are apart, but we are all in this together.”

She understands that people are anxious, stressed and fearful, but says it’s important to keep going and not give up. She advises people at home to utilize online tools and platforms to communicate with friends and loved ones.

Indeed, many Ontarians may be experiencing mental health issues in dealing with the isolation and uncertainties of their personal circumstances, in which case Kusendova recommends contacting health-care professionals for help (visit 211Ontario.ca).

Kusendova commends the province in providing emergency funding of up to $12 million to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports, and $2.6 million to hire new psychologists and other mental health workers to support Ontario Provincial Police personnel.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the level of support from businesses and individuals across the province. The provincial government recently launched the $50-million Ontario Together Fund, to help willing businesses provide essential medical supplies and equipment.

614,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/autos/opinion/2020/04/17/sir-stirling-moss-and-the-canadian-connection.html,Sir Stirling Moss and the Canadian Connection,"['Norris Mcdonald', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Starfri.', 'April', 'Min. Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-17,"Sir Stirling Moss, who died last weekend at 90 following a long illness, was no stranger to Canada.

The man who was, arguably, the most famous racing driver of all time, married his first wife, Katharine (Katie) Stuart Molson, of the Molson beer family of Montreal, in October 1957.

And he was instrumental in the design of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, née Mosport, when he suggested that a turn at the south end of the circuit not be a hairpin but a sweeping turn with two corners. As a result, turns 5A and 5B were named Moss Corner.

We know the first to be true; marriages are a matter of public record. But the second? Might it be a myth? Let’s examine the evidence.

In two official Mosport histories, one by Chuck McLaren and the second by the late Bob Brockington, it is written that Moss, in 1960, was visiting Toronto and saw plans for the track. While he liked the layout, which had been designed by Alan Bunting, with input from Ray Liddle, he did suggest that the single-radius carousel hairpin at the track’s south end be changed to a 90-degree right followed by another right leading to the back straight — 5A and 5B.

This information is also included in the history of the circuit that’s on the CTMP website. And none of the Canadian racing historians — John Wright, Bob Harrington — or retired racing drivers — Walt MacKay, Jim Bray, Ludwig Heimrath — I talked to, or heard from, this week said anything that would discount this.

But the late Len Coates, in a book he published in 1973, “Challenge: the story of Canadian road racing,” told a different story. A reception was held two days before the first Player’s 200 sports car race in 1961 and Moss and two other world-class drivers of the day, Olivier Gendebien and Jo Bonnier, were featured guests.

“When they were pressed to discuss Mosport’s weak points,” Coates wrote in his book, “Gendebien and Bonnier said Moss Corner was too slow and offered little challenge to car or driver. Said Gendebien: ‘You brake, go around and accelerate. It’s too slow.’

“Bonnier nodded in agreement and looked dubious when he was told that Moss himself had designed the corner. ‘It must have been a misunderstanding,’ he said. ‘Moss likes to go fast. It’s not his type of corner.’

“This sent the reporters scurrying to Moss and he denied that he ever made any suggestions about the corner.”

Which comes as a bit of a surprise. But who really knows? Most, if not all, of the original committee members are dead and everybody I talked to about this seemed quite surprised.

To further muddy the waters, Heimrath said that Moss was in Canada earlier, in 1959, and “working on the track then.” How could that be? Well, Moss was a member of the Molson family at that time and it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that the original group, who were looking for financing to build Mosport, might have pitched Molson’s. It’s part of the history of Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant that Labatt came through with the last chunk of cash needed to build that place, so why wouldn’t Molson have been approached to fund Mosport, in whole or in part?

Whatever, Heimrath, who won three Canadian driving championships, including his first in 1961, raced against Moss on several occasions and said he was the best. “If he decided he was going to do something, like pass you, there was nothing you could do about it,” he said. “And he was the nicest guy to talk to; I never heard him say a bad thing about another driver. He was a true gentleman,” said the Canadian legend, who’s mellowed in recent years.

MacKay, of Caledon, didn’t race against Moss in that first Player’s 200, but he did drive in a 40-lap Formula Jr. race that was on the same program and he won it in a Lotus 18. That evening, during an awards ceremony at the Flying Dutchman Motor Hotel in Bowmanville, Moss gave him a trophy and a cheque for $400, “which kept me going for the rest of the season — mostly to keep my ’55 Chevy tow car running.” MacKay was surprised that Moss might not have been involved in the Moss Corner design. “I never heard that,” he said.

Jim Bray of Brantford, who raced in the production sports car race that was held just before the main event, was lapped by Moss (who drove in several races that day), “and he gave me his customary wave as he drove past.” Bray said he met Moss years later at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England and Moss said, “You drove a Sprite in that race, didn’t you? I remember — you were a hooligan!” Bray said he didn’t mind the name that Moss had called him, he was just delighted that the legend remembered him. He also was — and remains — convinced that Sir Stirling had a hand in the redesign of his corner.

Other reminiscences:

Sid Priddle, who was handling media relations for one of the Player’s races at Mosport, was rushing to get Moss to CFTO-TV in then-Agincourt for an interview when he was pulled over on Ellesmere Road for speeding. “Who do you think you are?” the cop said. “Stirling Moss?” Priddle said he had to close the car window quickly before Sir Stirling started to give lip to the officer.

Nelson Hudes, a marketing assistant at Mosport, recalls being taken for a ride around the track by Moss in 1985 when Sir Stirling had come to Mosport to race a Cooper Formula Jr. in a Vintage Auto Racing Association of Canada (VARAC) support race during a Can-Am Series weekend. “Sir Stirling was driving, F. David Stone (marketing manager) was beside him in the front seat, F. David’s wife Janice was beside me in the back. We got to Moss Corner and — I’m not making this up — Stirling Moss spun the car. It was drizzling slightly but the track wasn’t wet. He just lost it. He was quick to say that he hadn’t done it on purpose, but we knew.”

John Wright, of Kitchener, who sent me the photo of Ed Leavens, Moss and Zsa Zsa Gabor in Las Vegas, said few Canadians knew that Leavens, a London, Ont., auto dealer who raced the sports cars he sold, was a frequent co-driver of Sir Stirling’s. Wrote Wright, in an email: “Ed and Moss were teammates in the late 1950s or early 1960s at a Bonneville Speed Event with the BMC team. Ed was to drive the Sprite streamliner and Moss the “Roaring Raindrop.” I can’t remember the details, but the team took some respite at Las Vegas and it was there that someone took this photo of Ed, Sir Stirling and Ms. Gabor. Ed told me that Zsa Zsa wasn’t much interested in him, but that she was really interested in Moss ... And that photo that Bob Harrington sent of Phil Hill and Moss has to be treasured. We are losing too many of our heroes these days — a reminder that life has a 100 per cent death rate!”

Stirling Moss was knighted by Prince Charles for Service to the Empire in March 2000. He won 212 of the 529 races he entered while driving 84 makes of cars, including Mercedes, Lotus, Vanwall, Porsches, Maseratis, Jaguars, Ferraris, Aston Martins, Listers and Coopers. Although he won 16 Grand Prix, he never won the world championship, but finished second four times in seven years of F1 competition and third place the other three times. His greatest victory, however, took place in Italy in the 1955 1,000-mile Mille Miglia for sports cars. With journalist Dennis Jenkinson navigating, they finished the race in 10 hours and seven minutes, which was described by Motor Trend magazine as the “most epic drive, ever.” Moss was in such a rhythm that he took his girlfriend for an all-night drive, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.

He was involved in two massive accidents, the first at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix in 1960 and the second at Goodwood in England in 1962, which left him in a coma for a month. He retired following a private test session the following year in which he determined his skills were too diminished for him to compete for victories.

He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. Being very patriotic, he was once quoted as saying, “Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one.”

In the words of Bill Warner, of the Amelia Island Councours d’Elegance, “he was witty, charming, warm and accommodating.”

And a helluva race driver, too.

Now, a personal note.

When I got on the Globe and Mail in 1965, I was assigned to edit copy on what was called “the rim.” I worked alongside geniuses, men and women who had heads full of facts and figures that would come in handy when they’d be on deadline and have to insert something into a story to give it context and they’d be able to write it in because they didn’t have to look it up, they just knew.

One of those brilliant people was Jim Shuttleworth. We’d been kids in Kapuskasing back in the late 1940s, early ’50s. Jim had flaming red hair when he was young, earning him the schoolyard nickname “Woodpecker” after Woody, which was eventually shortened to “Pecker.”

So I’m on my second shift and they’re bringing me along slowly, which means I got to report for work early, and at 6 p.m., the late shift arrives. As they start to work, I look at these new (to me) faces and there, three chairs over, is none other than Jim Shuttleworth. “Hi Pecker,” I say, and Jim turns slowly toward me and his eyes widen behind the round glasses he’s wearing and he says these exact words: “Well, if I live and breath, if it’s not that scrawny, snotty, asthmatic kid from Kapuskasing, Norris McDonald. Does security know you’re in here? And put out that cigarette.”

Jim had graduated in journalism from Ryerson and although he was working in news at that time, his first love was sports and he was eventually able to live his dream when he was appointed assistant sports editor (at a time when the assistant ran the section, the editor being the manager).

He was with that paper for 31 years and he was one of the best. In a business that — at least, in those days — attracted a lot of people who really didn’t know what they wanted to do when they grew up, Jim knew who he was — and that was someone you could count on. The Globe benefited greatly from his presence.

James Robert Shuttleworth passed on March 21 at Nanaimo General Hospital in British Columbia, where he’d moved — with the Star’s Wendy Darroch, who died in 2009 — following his retirement as production editor of the Report on Business. He was in his 84th year and leaves his sons, Fraser and Geoffrey, and his sister, Mary Anne.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-17,"AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND—Three million Aeroplan miles, accumulated bringing the Automotive Truth to you from around the world.

My reward? Two freebie business-class tickets anywhere Air Canada flies.

You’re not going to use them for a weekend in Montreal.

So Auckland, New Zealand, it was, about as far away from Toronto as Air Canada goes, for myself and the ever-patient Lady Leadfoot.

A fortuitous reunion at last fall’s Los Angeles Auto Show with Stephen Lester, formerly managing director for INFINITI Canada and currently in that same position for Nissan Australia, led to him putting me in touch with John Manley, his counterpart for Nissan New Zealand.

John graciously offered a brand-new Nissan Qashqai for a two-week road test.

I’ll tell you about the car this week.

Next week, I’ll tell you a bit about driving Down Under.

The Qashqai they get in New Zealand is pretty much the same as ours — a compact crossover/SUV/station wagon.

Theirs are built in England, while ours come from Kyushu, Japan.

Our tester listed at $45,490 NZD, which would work out to about $38,670 Canadian.

Equalizing equipment levels and specs as best as I could figure, model for model, New Zealand Qashqais are about $3,000 more expensive than ours.

Our tester was their range-topping Ti model, roughly equivalent to our Platinum trim. It’s fully belled and whistled, including SatNav, leather and all the safety goodies, about which more later.

“Kiwi-qais” get essentially the same powertrain we do — a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine pushing out 106 kW (141 horsepower) at 6,000 r.p.m. and 200 Newton-metres (147 lb.-ft.) of torque at 4,400 r.p.m., working through a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

Qashqai is offered here only with front-wheel drive, which is available back home, but only in the lowest trim level, and very few are sold.

In Canada, Qashqai also offers a six-speed manual transmission, which is not available here.

Our tester was equipped with the same Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires as my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke NISMO RS Turbo. They were predictably brilliant.

Our car was painted a bright blue. “Vivid” is the paint name, and it’s appropriate. We saw a few other new Qashqais in this shade, and it works very well with the car’s shape.

The biggest difference between their Qashqais and ours is, obviously, theirs are right-hand drive.

I’ve driven RHD cars fairly frequently, so it was no biggie once I got reacclimated to looking up and to the left for the rear-view mirror instead of up and to the right.

You also must be careful making right-hand turns, especially in town, to ensure you don’t “wrong-slot.”

But it was new for Lady Leadfoot to be sitting “over there” without a steering wheel in her hands. Both of us sometimes started to open the wrong door when we got into the car.

Some right-hand-drive cars use the same steering column as left-hookers, and just move it over.

Others mirror-image the control stalks, keeping the turn-signal lever closest to the driver’s-side door — hence, backwards to ours, and so operated with the right hand.

Qashqai is one of the latter, so I occasionally would switch on the turn signal when it started to rain, or turn on the wipers to indicate a lane change. Fortunately, New Zealand drivers are generally very patient.

Also, all the minor controls you are used to working with your right hand — HVAC, SatNav, sound system, etc. — you have to work with your left. Unless you’re part of about 10 per cent of the population that’s left-handed, this is a bit of an issue.

Again, Lady Leadfoot to the rescue. She worked all those functions for us.

Targa New Zealand took place just the week before we got there; I wonder how Messieurs Lester and Manley would have reacted if I had arrived a week earlier and put the Qashqai through that? For sure, I would have needed to find a different navigator. And possibly another wife.

Driven sanely, the Qashqai felt big enough to be comfortable, and small enough to be easy to handle on New Zealand’s narrow roads and dense downtown traffic.

Nissan’s “zero gravity” seats were really put to the test, given we were covering several hundred klicks on some of our driving days. Never a problem — these are among the most comfortable and supportive seats you will find at any price.

Yes, as usual, I would have preferred they not be covered in leather, but I get that I’m in the tiny minority here.

Gasoline, like everything else down here, is expensive, typically around $2 NZD a litre ($1.67 CDN). One more reason, in addition to the topography and climate, that British Columbians would feel right at home here.

We got around 7.5 L/100 km in mixed city/highway driving, which I didn’t think was too bad, given the hilly country we were in most of the time. New Zealand is basically a bunch of volcanoes, most of which are thankfully dormant.

The engine is reasonably quiet and unobtrusive. It motivates the car well, keeping up with traffic and easily handling the aforementioned topography.

I’ve never had a problem with CVTs, although I know some people do. They just give you the optimum gear ratio for any driving situation, so what’s the big deal?

True, the exhaust note doesn’t rise and fall in step with road speed, and that takes a bit of getting used to. But think of the fuel you are saving.

Ride quality was fine — New Zealand roads aren’t always glass-smooth, so this was appreciated.

One thing I liked about our Qashqai that all too many cars get wrong — once you turn the headlights on (and, of course, all your lights should be on all the time), you can just leave the switch in that position. When you turn the car off, the lights go off, although you can set them to stay on for a short time to light your way to your front door.

Once again, I ask the question — why is there even a headlight switch in a car?

A note about Nissan’s safety kit. As always, I shut off most of the buzzers and beepers because I’d rather it be me paying attention, not just the car.

But one safety feature does do something I can’t do — provide a bird’s-eye view when I’m trying to navigate in tight quarters.

Nissan pioneered this technology, and it has evolved in the upper trim levels of Qashqai into the “Intelligent Around View Monitor.” This consists of a series of cameras, the views from which are somehow integrated to show the front, rear and both sides of the car, in addition to that “overhead” view, as you back into your parking space. (Of course you back in, don’t you?)

As I apparently never tire of telling you, whatever is beside you is always revealed in properly adjusted side-view mirrors, making those so-called blind-spot-warning systems completely irrelevant.

But unless you have a giraffe as a navigator — and for all of Lady Leadfoot’s many fine attributes, “giraffe-like” is not one of therm — this overhead view is very useful, and should save you many chipped alloy wheels, scratched fenders and dinged bumpers.

It appears real station wagons aren’t coming back any time soon, although you do see more of them here than you do back home.

Now, we didn’t really have to come to New Zealand to discover this fact. But Nissan’s Qashqai provides a roomy, comfortable, well-equipped and handy-to-drive alternative.

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-04-10,"In seeking to better understand the challenges that we are all facing, and looking for wisdom to cope with a strange new reality, I turned to someone who has lived through difficult times before.

Who better to proffer words of wisdom than Norris McDonald, editor emeritus of the Toronto Star’s Wheels section, and the first journalist ever to be inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame?

I spoke with Norris recently about the COVID-19 crisis and asked him to share any stories or wisdom that might be a benefit to readers.

If you know Norris at all, you know that he’s a great storyteller who is rarely at a loss for words. He is also an award-winning journalist who shows no signs of slowing down.

Norris recounted a story from his days working at the Kingston Whig-Standard.

It was the early 1980s, and Canada was in a deep recession. The owner/publisher of the Whig-Standard, Michael Davies, faced a crisis at the paper. Many newspapers and media companies were laying off staff left, right and centre.

Davies wanted to avoid layoffs, and so he called a meeting with his entire staff from all departments (sales, circulation, reporters, editors, pressmen).

More than 100 staff gathered at the Grand Theatre in Kingston. There, Davies told his staff that the paper needed to boost circulation by 1,000 in order to avoid layoffs. He asked everyone to pitch in.

It was an audacious goal.

The Whig-Standard was ridiculed by staff on some of the larger newspapers. Imagine asking reporters and pressman to knock on doors to sell subscriptions? Unheard of!

When staff finished their shifts at the paper, they would go home, change, and go out canvassing for subscriptions. They did what they had to do and, within two months, the Whig-Standard had reached its goal of 1,000 new subscribers. Layoffs were avoided.

This story sent a chill down my spine. An entire company understood the dire predicament the paper was in, and knew what was at stake. As Norris said, “We had to work together back then to save jobs; now we have to work together to save lives.”

A global pandemic is a far cry from an economic recession, but there is a lesson to be learned in Norris’s story of yesteryear that applies to the COVID-19 crisis today.

We all need to do our part to get through these difficult and stressful times.

The “stay home” message has been broadcast on every media platform for weeks now, and yet some people are still playing fast and loose with the laws. They are congregating in groups, visiting parks and shopping in person for non-essential items. In doing so, they are putting themselves and others at risk.

I am the first to admit that self-isolation is tough. Being alone, at home, is a huge imposition, and many people are struggling with it. But please — do your part to minimize the risk of spreading this awful disease. Just stay home.

On behalf of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, I would like to acknowledge the recent passing of Rod Campbell, a legend in the automotive world.

Norris wrote a moving tribute to Campbell in last week’s Toronto Star.

Early in his career, Campbell covered racing events and sold advertising for radio before launching his own motorsports marketing and event planning company. He sold his company in 1999.

Throughout his career, Campbell befriended many motorsports drivers and industry giants, including Jackie Stewart, Roger Penske and Walter Hayes.

He was known for his tireless work ethic, his infection enthusiasm and his boundless confidence.

Campbell was also a champion of auto shows around the world, especially the Canadian International AutoShow (Campbell’s nephew, Jason, is the general manager of the CIAS.)

Campbell left an impressive mark on the automotive world and on those who knew him personally or professionally. He will be missed by many.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-04-10,"The Formula One Canadian Grand Prix was postponed this week because of the pandemic. Can the cancellation of the 2020 Honda Indy Toronto be far behind?

And what about racing at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Shannonville, Jukasa Motor Speedway and other small speedways in southern Ontario?

The outlook is not good. I talked to a number of people in the industry in recent days and, while they all expressed optimism, the likelihood of racing wheels turning in front of large crowds this summer and fall is practically nil.

Barring a miracle — and I repeat: a miracle — there is no way the IndyCar race at Exhibition Place, the IMSA SportsCar weekend at CTMP, the NASCAR weekend at the same place in September and the Canadian Short Track Nationals at Jukasa (a.k.a. the Bubba Pollard benefit) can take place for the following reasons:

There is no indication the COVID-19 epidemic is slowing. The number of sick, dying and dead is increasing daily. All big events in Montreal and Toronto (which means the rest of Ontario and Quebec, too) are cancelled or postponed through June, which means the earliest racing could get going is July.

But don’t think for a second that everything would suddenly be back to normal. We wouldn’t want to think we’ve beaten this thing, only to have it come back because we got careless. We will be taking baby steps. In fact, the prime minister said as much Wednesday.

Ontario would have to rescind, or modify, the five-person limit on gatherings. And there could be other conditions. Speedways might have to restrict attendance and separate people in grandstands.

The Canada-U.S. border is closed to all but essential traffic. The IndyCar circus, the NASCAR trucks and IMSA sports cars are not essential. This border has never been closed before and it will take some time before it’s wide open again. Particularly with this particular president.

Let’s take a close look at the Honda Indy. It’s scheduled to be held July 10-12. It’s run on a temporary track, so the facility has to be built. City hall, which is closed at the moment, has to reopen and be up and running in order to issue the necessary permits. The border has to be open again. The province has to lift the restrictions on gatherings. If the all-clear is sounded on July 1 (which it won’t be, but we can dream), all of the above would have to be done in 10 days for the race to happen. I suggest that is impossible.

Then, you have to wonder if racers will be able to afford to go racing. I know of two well-known Canadian racers, one who competes in the NASCAR Pinty’s Series and the other is a Canadian motorcycle champion, who have lost their lucrative personal sponsorships. They got phone calls to say their deals were cancelled.

Not reduced. Nullified.

And then there are all the small-time stock car racers, or club-level road racers, who might have been promised $2,500 if they put “Bob Smith’s Garage,” or “Avenue Road Computer Repair” on the side of their cars. They won’t be getting anything now. (Can you imagine the uproar if it was discovered that people were using business bailout money to sponsor a race car?)

Racers have been known to beg and borrow (no, racers never steal ...) to get enough money to go racing, but that’s not even an option this time because just about everybody’s broke.

In the bigs, starting with Formula One and going down the line through IndyCar, NASCAR and the rest, the racing sanctioning bodies have all laid off staff, as have most teams. Drivers and team managers have all taken pay cuts — but will that be enough? Zak Brown, who runs McLaren, said the other day that as many as four F1 teams could go out of business if this calamity continues for any length of time.

And then there are the spectators. Millions of Canadians are surviving because the federal government is giving them money. And those who are lucky enough to still be employed are watching their pennies. There is not a lot of disposable income around, no matter how you look at the situation.

As a result, you can split racing fans into three groups: Group A, who will go to the races no matter what; Group B, who won’t be able to afford to go, and Group C, who won’t want to have anything to do with crowds. So right off, whether it’s the IndyCar race, or the NASCAR trucks at CTMP (assuming they are able to be held), two-thirds of the customer base won’t attend. In the words of one speedway manager I talked to this week, this would be like having a rainout a month in advance.

(Although we’re talking about racing here, this model could be applied to hockey and baseball and all the other big-league professional sports. There will be a huge financial reckoning and adjustment when this is over, that’s for sure.)

The one race that could happen would be the Grand Prix. Everybody in the circus comes from Europe, so there wouldn’t be a problem with the U.S. border. The Montreal Grand Prix circuit and infrastructure is in place year-round, so they could hold the race as late as Thanksgiving weekend in October. And Montreal could lean on the Quebec government to ease the gathering limit so that the city could receive an injection of much-needed economic activity. Like the Honda Indy in Toronto, the Grand Prix means hotel rooms and that industry in both cities desperately needs customers.

John Bondar, the new proprietor, with a partner, of Shannonville Motorsports Park, is one track operator who’s sounding seriously optimistic. That doesn’t mean CTMP is standing still. Following the cancellation of the traditional Victoria Day SpeedFest long weekend in May, they’ve been “planning backwards,” starting with the Chevy Silverado 250 NASCAR trucks race in September and coming back to the motorcycle weekend in August and the IMSA SportsCar Grand Prix in July, figuring the trucks might — might — have a chance of racing. And they have other contingency plans in the works, like invitational races or club racers mixed in with the professionals. If they can open for business, that is.

“We’re all suddenly experts on this thing,” Bondar said, talking about the pandemic. “Nobody can say for sure, but I think — hope — that July might be reasonable to plan for some on-track action (where he could run motorcycle races or club car events over, say, three days with the entry split into three groups of 40 max and no mothers or girlfriends or other crew allowed if — if — the gathering limits went back up to 50).

“I think the (COVID-19) numbers will start to come down at the end of April,” he said. “We then spend all of May watching them roll down further and then, to be on the safe side, we don’t do anything in June. We could go in July and I think if the province returns to a 50-person limit, I’ll be OK.

“The U.S. is a disaster. They are way behind us in getting a handle on this thing. So we want to keep the border closed till they’re out of the woods. That’s not good news for CTMP, whose headliners are Americans, or some of the speedways that have big races and need Americans to deepen the field. But the country can’t afford to take any chances.”

I have a friend who works in the automotive industry. I think he’s a genius.

We were talking about COVID-19 (what else?) and Pete says: “I see quite a few people walking around now with masks on. Good for them. But then I got thinking ... if you want many more people to wear a mask, put a sports logo on it. The Raptors, or TFC. Winner teams.

“If you’re an IndyCar fan, you could wear a mask with the IndyCar logo on it (see illustration). Or NASCAR or F1. Perhaps even the individual teams, or drivers.

“Look, one way or the other, they will run the Indy 500 this year. They moved it from May to August; I figure it will be held in late September or early October. Whenever, can you visualize a couple of hundred thousand people at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway wearing masks that have IndyCar on them? Or Penske Corp? Or the Indianapolis Speedway logo?

“By then the NFL will be going, too. People will want to get out to the games. They will go if they wear a mask with the Patriots or the Bears or the Colts logo. The Bills and so on.

“Wearing a mask is not cool. Wearing a mask with your favourite sports team on it would make it cool. It will get more people to wear masks and help flatten the curve.

“People are at home with time on their hands. They can sew their own. Some have 3D printers and can make them that way. With the internet and social media, people will pick up on this within hours.”

As I said, I think he’s a genius.

BMW 750Li xDrive. 4 doors, 4/5 passengers, full-size luxury sedan. Part-time automatic four-wheel drive.

Price: Base list — $126,900. As tested — $156,300.

Engine: 4.4-litre V-8, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, twin turbocharged, direct injection.

Power/torque, horsepower / lb.-ft.: 523 @ 5,500 — 6,000 r.p.m. / 553 @ 1,600 — 4,600 r.p.m.

Fuel consumption, NRCan City/Highway, l/100 km: 14.5 / 9.9. Premium unleaded fuel.

Competition: Audi A8, Jaguar XJ, Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

What’s best: Excellent dynamics for such a large car; opulent interior; strong image.

What’s worst: As always, the digital dashboard borders on hopeless; shift pattern just plain wrong; run-flat tires still not ready for prime time.

What’s interesting: Under all the gloss, it’s still a BMW.

I had driven about 20 kilometres from BMW’s head office in Richmond Hill down the 404 to 401 westbound, heading home in a brand-new 750Li sedan.

Flipping the metaphorical coin, I chose the express lanes.

Almost immediately, I hit a massive pothole, which I think may have already collected a Volkswagen and a couple of motorcycles.

The loud “BANG” from the right front corner told me I had blown a tire — a fact almost immediately corroborated by a warning light on the dashboard.

I hate run-flat tires, because I don’t trust them to “run flat,” the ride quality is usually awful all the time and they don’t provide a spare I could change myself.

Not that there was any place to change the tire, because the 401’s shoulders there are about half a car wide.

I personally know people who have been killed in just such a situation. I was not about to join their ranks.

So I put on the four-ways and trundled along at 45 km/h until I could find a safe spot to pull off near the Avenue Road exit.

The owners manual suggested I contact the nearest BMW dealer or roadside assistance. I thought, what if I had been driving through Kapuskasing at 4 a.m.?

By sheer good luck, a CAA tow truck happened along. The driver stopped to see if I needed help and within minutes, the car was on his flatbed and we were headed back to BMW.

Triple YAY! for CAA.

I retrieved the car the next day, and so the story can continue.

This car starts at $126,900. My tester had a boatload of options, which brought the total to $156,300.

The updated 7 Series continues with several traditional BMW styling cues such as the twin-kidney grille and the “Hofmeister kink” — the forward kickback of the rear roof pillars.

Speaking over the years with BMW stylists, they always say such things are helpful in that they provide a guide as to how to start styling the car. But these things are also somewhat restrictive, limiting their creativity.

Still, it’s a handsome beast, and everyone will know which brand you chose.

Power is provided by a 4.4-litre, twin-turbocharged V-8 — the last two digits of BMW’s model designations stopped having any relationship to the engine’s displacement long ago.

It generates 523 horsepower from 5,500 to 6,000 r.p.m., and a flat torque “plateau” of 553 lb.-ft. from 1,800 to 4,600 r.p.m.

The turbos are nestled between the banks of the engine’s “vee” to minimize the path the compressed air must take to reach those hungry cylinders.

A hard stomp on the throttle is followed by a brief pause while the car decides it wants to go. Once it does, it really goes — 0 to 100 km/h takes a shade over four seconds, which is quick by any standard.

The stop-start function that saves a few droplets of fuel isn’t as smooth in operation as some such systems, causing a noticeable shake and grumble as the engine coughs back to life.

The eight-speed automatic transmission provides power to all four wheels as is deemed necessary to maintain traction, although it is primarily a rear-drive car, consistent with BMW’s hallowed traditions.

Sadly, the transmission is controlled by a shift lever that can only be described as stupid.

It looks like the normal PRNDL (Park Reverse Neutral Drive Low) setup that has governed autoboxes since approximately the dawn of time.

But it’s not.

To get Park, instead of shoving the lever full-forward, you have to hit a button on the lever itself.

To avoid the obvious issue — people not hitting this correctly, the car rolling away, the concomitant lawsuits — the car seems to automatically select Park when you open a door.

Great — more technology to go wrong in 10 years.

BMW is not alone on this — Mercedes and others do it, too. “Why?” remains the question.

Frankly, the best way to handle this is what Lincoln, GM, Honda and others have done. Nobody shifts gears any more, so just dispense with the shift lever altogether and use push buttons on the dashboard somewhere.

The centre console is the most expensive real estate in the world — use it for stuff that needs it.

The standard air suspension on the 7 provides an excellent ride — they have obviously addressed the ride-quality issues that used to plague run-flat-tire-equipped cars.

You can also raise the car about 50 millimetres to help negotiate steep parking lot ramps or rough roads. It only works for a short time and at low speeds, then automatically returns to normal.

“Comfort” or “Sport” driving programs provide predetermined settings for a variety of functions such as ride firmness, handling and transmission response.

A third option, “Individual,” allows you to set your own preferred combination of choices.

My tester had the optional four-wheel steering, which turns the rear wheels counter-phase at low speeds to make the car more manoeuvrable, and in-phase at higher speeds to improve response and stability. I found it impossible to feel the transition, so it must do its job well.

Handling has long been a BMW hallmark, and this car’s agility belies its size and weight.

The interior is lovely, beautifully finished from obviously high-quality materials that all appear to be authentic — if it looks like wood, metal or ceramic, it probably is.

There is loads of room everywhere, and about a million seat adjustments, so anyone should be able to find a comfortable and supportive seating position.

Included in that option list were a couple of “Executive” packages, bringing features such as ventilated seats with massage function for the fronts, window shades and a bunch of so-called “driving aids” like self-steering, which I find massively annoying.

It also included the damnable “Driving Assistant,” who kept asking what I wanted her to do.

“SHUT UP!” apparently is not in her vocabulary.

I eventually found her off button.

If this is the “Ultimate Driving Machine,” why would I not want to drive it myself?

I also shut off the heads-up display, which I always find more distracting than helpful.

As with any new car, it will take you some time to get used to the minor controls.

BMW was one of the first to “digitize” the driving experience, and those early attempts at the so-called “iDrive” system were beyond hopeless. We spent half an hour with a German engineer on an early 7 Series program some years ago. It took him that long to show us how to change a radio station, and it still took about seven steps.

Either we are getting used to these things or they are much better designed, or possibly both, because this one is easier to use.

Actually, it reminded me a bit of Audi’s MMI system. Touching one of several buttons arrayed around the central controller takes you to a submenu — rotate that central knob to select a function, then push that knob to activate your choice.

This all requires you to take your attention off the driving task — a theme I have pounded on regularly — as the entire concept is inherently flawed.

But we aren’t going back to proper knobs and levers any time soon. At least there has been progress in making these things less dangerous.

Apparently, in the real world, most people only use a handful of the available functions. Once you get used to whichever you want, it becomes second nature.

While I’m whining about the minor controls, I’ll toss in another of my pet peeves. When I tell a car I want the doors unlocked, I want them to stay unlocked. This car relocks them every time the car dips below about 15 km/h, then re-accelerates.

There may be some way to disable this feature, but I couldn’t find it. My own VW did this until my genius mechanic broke the code.

Hey, it’s my car — I want it to react the way I want it to react.

The back seat is huge, and you have the option of a pair of buckets or a three-seat bench.

The rear seat head rests restrict rearward visibility as they typically do, but you can and should fold them down when nobody is sitting back there.

I have owned — and raced — BMWs over the years. Even in their luxury cars, the handling prowess I came to love is still there in the big 7 Series.

It may be buried under a ton of high-techery the market seems to want, but if you can dig below that and/or learn to ignore it, you’ll discover a fine-driving car that honours the company’s long traditions.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-03,"Rod Campbell, the man at the centre of what has to be one of our country’s most spectacular rags-to-riches stories, died with dignity this week in Los Angeles, Calif. He was in his 89th year and leaves behind his wife, Sandra; two daughters, Heather and Alison; and two grandchildren.

Born dirt-poor on the Saskatchewan Prairie to a Methodist preacher father and a stay-at-home mother of five, Campbell built a financial fortune through ambition, determination, self-promotion, talent and an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time.

From volunteering, initially, to promote races at Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant north of Montreal, to announcing at the first Formula One race held in Canada at Mosport Park in Ontario, Campbell parlayed friendships with important people he’d met along the way to land public-relations and marketing contracts with Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, the Can-Am Series, Formula One drivers George Eaton and Brett Lunger and F1 team owners Walter Wolf and Mo Nunn.

His personal Mount Everest moment of success came when he launched Campbell and Co. to handle motorsport program promotion and event planning for the Ford Motor Co. He sold it in 1999, making him, as he would say, wealthy.

“We were very poor when I was a boy,” he said. “As a result, I was extraordinarily ambitious. I was determined to succeed.”

This ambition and determination gave him the good life, which he loved. Sure, there were failures, but in the end, the good outcomes far outweighed the bad. He travelled the world, staying in the best hotels. He played on the best golf courses, hobnobbed with the captains of industry — Roger Penske, Edsel Ford, et al — ate the finest food and drank the finest wines. In short, he thoroughly enjoyed his success.

He had two marriages — one not so good, the second the best, which gave him the family he adored.

One time, with Sandra, the love of his life, they were driving along the Pacific coast and she casually mentioned she’d like to live in Malibu one day. So, he bought a six-acre lot and built her a mansion, complete with a three-hole golf course (which got him into trouble with environmentalists, who demanded he rip up the greens).

He was respected far and wide and liked by one and all (except maybe those California environmentalists). When word got around that he was ill and would die, the phone started ringing. Bernie Ecclestone was among the first to call. Bernie thanked him for what he’d done for Formula One. There were many others.

He knew everybody — Penske, Walter Hayes, Michael Kranefuss, Pat Patrick, Jack Roush. Former Ford CEO and president Jacques Nasser once told him that if he ever had an idea — and he had a million — all he had to do was call his secretary and he’d have him in his office in an hour.

He was respected for his integrity — people trusted him implicitly — and his internal optimism. It didn’t matter if it was trying to recover money from his F1 friend Wolf or organizing the Santa Claus parade in London, Ont., he was convinced everything would turn out all right.

Er, the Santa parade in London? Yup, it was a great success, that parade in 1959, particularly because Campbell convinced an old roommate, the singer Robert Goulet, to drive over from Toronto to be a celebrity guest.

It was in London that Campbell discovered what would be the secret to his success. “If you agree to do a job, and then do more than expected, you add value,” he once told me. “Added value has worked wonders for me.” And then he told me how it all came about.

He’d been in Europe, serving in the U.S. army (he’d gone to New York to study broadcasting, applied for a green card and, as a result, got drafted) and, once discharged, had gone looking for a job, which was easier said than done. He finally landed one selling ads for a radio station in London, for which he had zero experience. But one of his clients, Ed Leavens, sold sports cars.

“When I was in the service, I’d gone to the German Grand Prix. I was captivated by the sights, the sounds, the bravery of the drivers — I loved everything about it. So when I started selling radio ads to Ed Leavens, I found out he raced the cars he sold. I asked if I could go to the races with him.

“So we were at Harewood Acres and Ed won his race. I had a brainwave. I called the radio station and asked the sports guy if I could do a live hit and I reported that Ed Leavens of Leavens Motors had won the race. So I sold him ads and reported on his races and that was added value. I always tried to do that.”

From London, it was on to Montreal, where he continued to sell ads for radio and immersed himself in the local motorsport community. Once, he chartered an Air Canada plane (then Trans-Canada Airlines) to take 50 people to the Indianapolis 500. He asked Dick Irvin Jr., son of the legendary coach of the Canadiens who was doing sports on the CTV station there, to plug the trip so he could sell the last couple of tickets. Irvin said sure, but asked Campbell to appear on his late-night sportscast to do a report after the plane got back.

It was 1964, the year Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs were killed in a second-lap inferno following a crash that involved seven cars. Irvin was so impressed with Campbell’s reporting and on-camera demeanour that, soon after, he offered him a job reading sports on weekends.

In a short period, Campbell had learned the advertising business and was an on-air radio and TV sports personality. He finished his on-the-job journalism training by writing about racing and later editing Canada Track & Traffic magazine. It all stood him in good stead when he went into PR.

Now, I could write a book about Campbell — but that’s already been done. In 2015, Campbell financed his limited-circulation autobiography, “I’m Rod — An Incorrigible Optimist: My life in auto racing and public relations.” He hired award-winning motorsport reporter Pete Lyons to write it and I think it’s terrific. In fact, I thought a good editor could turn his story into a bestseller. I still do. Few people in this world have led the fascinating life that Campbell led, or enjoyed the successes.

Here are some of Campbell’s observations and conclusions about people and business, garnered either from conversations we had (we met for lunch during the Los Angeles Auto Show for years, as well as in Toronto) or from his book:

“Respect was the central focus of my life. I wanted the respect of my family and my peers. As we grow older, we all realize there isn’t a lot to hold (onto) in our senior years except for memories and relationships nurtured in a lifetime of chasing dreams.”

Campbell was thrilled when he was hired to promote Jackie Stewart and his sponsor, L&M cigarettes. It came about after the company was told to “get that Canadian guy to do it.”

“I had made sure he knew my work!” Campbell said of the fellow who’d recommended him. “That’s just part of being ambitious and making sure the right people know. And it still works today.”

His nephew, Jason Campbell, general manager of the Canadian International AutoShow, wrote a letter to his uncle in recent weeks:

“In Grade 11, when I was 16, I had a creative-writing assignment in school, and I remember one of my tasks was to write a short biography on someone of my choosing. Of course, I chose my uncle Rod. I remember sitting down for this formal interview with you. By then, you had built up Campbell and Co. and seemed to be going from strength to strength. I remember asking you the question, ‘What has been the key to your success?’ And I remember very clearly your answer — ‘Confidence! Confidence is critical.’ You’ve always been one to instil that confidence in others — to push the boundaries, to do things not done before and to do them better than anyone else. That lesson in life is one of the greatest you’ve passed on.”

On Eaton, the Canadian department-store heir — the family name is still on the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto — who raced in the Can-Am Series and Formula One: “George had a lot of natural talent, but he didn’t want to work to develop it. I used to nag him, but he’d say, ‘Nah, I don’t need to test; I can drive fine.’ He really liked the idea of being in the spotlight in a dangerous sport. He liked the badge it gave him. But he really wasn’t serious about racing in itself.”

On Stewart: “I don’t remember races so much as I remember incidents. One big one blew up at the Mid-Ohio track. Jackie was on a safety crusade in those days. I’ll never forget when we got to Mid-Ohio (for a Can-Am race), there was this one giant tree sitting out 50 yards off the first turn. No barricades, no protection, just a big tree sitting there. Jackie starts, ‘What? What is this? It’s got to go.’”

On Wolf: “I have to say, much as I liked Walter, and enjoyed working for him, he was a little loosey-goosey about business. He agreed to pay me pretty well for the time, $120,000 for the year, but getting him to actually pay was another thing. I always had to chase him to collect it and finally he’d wire me something or hand me cash.”

That was in the book — but there was more to it than that. I have copies of several collection notices sent to Wolf on behalf of Campbell (part of the research for a book I’m working on) and I once asked Campbell about them. “It would take awhile,” he said, “but Walter would always come through. Those (collection notices) were more to get his attention. He’s still a good friend.”

On Campbell and Co., and his great friend Len Coates: “Len was a wonderful Canadian writer I’d gotten to know from my reporting and publishing days (Canada Track & Traffic). I wanted him to be an integral part of Campbell and Co., but he wasn’t as disciplined as I’d wanted him to be. He liked to work all night and I wanted him in the office during business hours. He wanted to go back to Toronto (Campbell and Co. was headquartered in Michigan) and I gave him 15 per cent of the company in stock in an effort to get him to stay. But he gave that up and left.”

Campbell and his wife remained personal friends of Coates’s up to his death several years ago. In co-operation with the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, they then established the Len Coates Awards, three bursaries for young journalists studying at Toronto’s Ryerson University, Coates’s alma mater.

Campbell attended the bursary luncheon at Ryerson last fall and took a moment to talk about his friend, but to also tell those in attendance that the bursaries would be funded in perpetuity but that because of his age, it would likely be his last trip to Toronto.

Ever since I learned he was ill and would die, I’ve wondered whether he had a premonition.

As expected, the tributes have poured in.

Mario Andretti sent out a tweet in answer to one by Campbell’s son-in-law, Townsend Bell, the Indianapolis 500 and sports-car driver: “I’m one of the fortunate to have known him well enough to call him a friend. I’ll miss him.”

Bell himself wrote: “Rod had an amazing 88 years and we are proud that he passed with so much universal love and respect. He died a very happy man. What more can any of us ask for?”

Said Kevin Kennedy, executive vice-president of what is now called Campbell Marketing and Communications: “He taught me so much about the business, including a philosophy of always going above and beyond for the clients and the people we work with.”

Coates’s brother, Bert, wrote: “Rod was a true gentleman and friend throughout the motorsports and automotive worlds. And he shared his abundant energy and intellect in support of many worthy causes.”

And Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, wrote: “Rod would call me personally on a regular basis to offer wise counsel as the Hall’s board of directors was restructured and we broadened our scope of inductions to include international and media contributors to motorsport in Canada. As time passes, we will all treasure and share happy memories about Rod as a man, a friend and a genuine builder of motorsport.”

On March 19, less than two weeks ago, Campbell sent me an email with his phone number and asked me to call. I knew he was ill and so I was expecting the worst. But after explaining what his death would entail — essentially an explanation of California law — we settled in to enjoy some reminiscences and we had a few laughs. He told me Stewart had called, as had Sir Jackie’s son, Paul. And others. And we gossiped about our mutual pal, Coates. And then it was over.

Said Campbell to me, Norris McDonald, around 12:30 p.m. Pacific time in Santa Monica, 3:30 p.m. my time in Mississauga:

“OK, I’m outta here. See ya on the other side.”

The eternal optimist was already making plans for his next adventure.

For Information About Automotive Trends', 'Careers']",2020-04-03,"At the time of this writing, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten Canadians from coast to coast.

Despite the increase in the number of cases, it is reassuring to see that citizens and businesses are complying with the rules of law and heeding the advice from doctors and health-care professionals.

Amidst this uncertain and fearful time, I am encouraged by the actions that some people and companies are taking to provide additional assistance to those in need.

Most new-car dealerships have reduced their hours of operation and are offering essential service and virtual sales. Some dealers have closed their doors altogether until it is safe to open them again. If you want to know your dealership’s policies and procedures with regard to COVID-19, and how to address your automotive needs, visit their website.

Automotive manufacturers have also posted messages on their websites for their dealer networks and for the public. The message from Pierre Boutin, president and CEO of Volkswagen Canada, I found particularly inspiring in light of all the daily updates.

Boutin writes: “Please follow the recommendations of our health authorities, and do what you can to minimize risk. And remember, finding the time to smile is a powerful tool in moments like these.”

Boutin’s message underscores the importance of everyone doing his/her part in fighting this pandemic, and also remembering that we are all human and need to connect with our families, friends, colleagues and neighbours.

This is a defining time for Canadians. We are all in this crisis together, and together, we will fight it and emerge stronger as a country when it’s over.

Across the province, new-car dealerships are helping their communities by providing vehicles, health supplies and other resources.

The Owasco Group generously offered up to 70 RVs and trailers to the Oshawa and Ajax hospitals to support first responders who need ways to get to home and work. The group has a volunteer team to come in and help with this as soon as the call comes in.

The Drive Muskoka dealerships in Huntsville provided much-needed medical supplies to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation.

During this health crisis, many people may feel that their life has spun out of control, which could lead to anxiety and depression. This could be the result of a lack of structure in their lives — the normal, day-to-day activities that we need to feel fulfilled — as people are wondering what to do with their time.

Here are some suggestions for making the most of your spare time:

If you have health-related questions or are looking for health services, contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.

If you have a friend or family member who is feeling down, call them up and try to buoy their spirits. You could put a smile on someone’s face who really needs it. Make use of free online conferencing services, such as Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or Google Hangouts. (It’s the next best thing to being with a person.)

Enrol in a free online course. Khan Academy (khanacademy.org) offers free videos on math, economics, computer programming and other topics, for all levels. Coursera (coursera.org) is an online learning platform that is offering a selection of free courses for a limited time.

Read', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Pressmon.']",2020-07-13,"LOS ANGELES - “Glee” star Naya Rivera ’s four-year-old son told investigators that his mother, whose body was found in a Southern California lake Monday, boosted him back on to the deck of their rented boat before he looked back and saw her disappearing under the water, authorities said.

“She must have mustered enough energy to get her son back on the boat, but not enough to save herself,” Ventura County Sheriff Bill Ayub said at a news conference.

The boy, Josey Hollis Dorsey, was found asleep and alone in a life vest on the drifting pontoon boat about three hours after they launched on Lake Piru northwest of Los Angeles, setting off a five-day search that ended with the discovery of the body of the 33-year-old floating near the surface early Monday, authorities said.

The mother and son had gone swimming, which was permitted in that part of the lake, Ayub said. She was not wearing a life vest.

Authorities believe that Rivera drowned accidentally, and that her body was most likely trapped in the vegetation under the lake for several days before floating to the top, Ayub said.

Divers had already thoroughly searched the area where she was eventually found, but shrubbery that had grown wildly in the area, which was recently dry, must have kept her hidden in the murky water.

Family members chatted with Rivera via FaceTime when she was on the boat, and search crews watched those videos for clues to where she might have gone down, Ayub said.

“It has been an extremely difficult time for her family throughout this ordeal,” Ayub said “We share in their grief.”

Rivera played singing cheerleader Santana Lopez for six seasons from 2009 to 2015 on the Fox musical-comedy “Glee.”

She is the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

The announcement of her death comes seven years to the day after co-star Cory Monteith died at 31 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin, with the series losing one of its leads while it was still on the air.

Another co-star, Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Rivera’s body was flown by helicopter 64 kilometres to the coroner’s office in Ventura, where an autopsy would be conducted and an official identification made, authorities said.

Ayub said the circumstances from the location of the body to the fact that no one else has been reported missing in the lake makes the department “confident that the body we found is Naya Rivera.”

Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest an hour’s drive from Los Angeles.

It was closed down and searched by dozens of divers with help from sonar and robotic devices combing the bottom and helicopters and drones searching above.

Surveillance video showed the mother and son parking and renting the boat at about 1 p.m. on July 8.

The vendor who rented it to them went looking for them when they failed to return on time, and found the boat drifting in the northern end of the lake with the boy aboard.

The boy, Rivera’s son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and quickly reunited with family members after he was found, authorities said.

His parents divorced in 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

The day before her death, Rivera tweeted a photo of herself and Josey that read, “just the two of us.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Star Wire Services', 'The Associated Press', 'Star Staff']",2020-07-13,"Johnny Depp accused Amber Heard of hitting him with a “haymaker” punch during an altercation near the end of their volatile marriage, as the star wrapped up testimony in his libel suit against a British tabloid newspaper that accused him of domestic abuse.

Depp said the fight came after Heard’s 30th birthday party, and hours after he had learned that his former business managers had absconded with hundreds of millions of dollars.

The Hollywood star is suing News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the paper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, over an April 2018 article that called him a “wife-beater.” He strongly denies abusing Heard.

Depp, 57, and Heard, 34, met on the set of the 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in 2015. Heard, a model and actress, filed for divorce the following year.

Depp said the couple separated after an argument that followed Heard’s 30th birthday party in April 2016. The actor said that just before the party he had attended a meeting and been told that his former business managers had “stolen my money.”

Asked how much was stolen, Depp said “this is a ludicrous amount to have to state, it’s quite embarrassing — apparently I had made $650 million,” much of it through his involvement with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Depp added that in addition to losing the $650 million (US) he was “$100 million in the hole because they had not paid the government my taxes for 17 years.” Depp and his former business managers settled a legal dispute over the alleged fraud in 2018.

Depp alleges that after the party he went to bed to read, and that Heard began accusing him of ruining her birthday dinner before throwing a “haymaker” at him.

Depp’s lawyer, David Sherborne, asked him to explain the American slang term for the judge, Andrew Nicol.

“A haymaker is a type of a wild swing, a roundhouse punch … effective if it reaches the target,” Depp said.

Heard is attending the three-week trial and is scheduled to give her own version of events later.

Grandson of Elvis Presley has died at age 27, agent says

The son of Lisa Marie Presley, Benjamin Keough — brother to “Mad Max: Fury Road” actress Riley Keough — has died. He was 27.

Presley’s representative Roger Widynowski said in a statement Sunday to The Associated Press that she was “heartbroken” after learning about the death of her son Benjamin Keough. He is the grandson of the late Elvis Presley.

TMZ reports that Keough died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday in Calabasas, California.

“She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley,” Widynowski said in the statement. “She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”

Presley had Keough and actress Riley Keough, 31, with her former husband Danny Keough. She also had twins from another marriage.

Rapper Lil Marlo dead; police see targeted shooting

The Atlanta-based rap artist known as Lil Marlo has died, his record label said Sunday.

Quality Control Music announced the death of Rudolph “Marlo” Johnson in a social media post, saying he will be remembered as “a man of great talent who feared nothing.” A statement from the Atlanta Police Department says a man named Rudolph Johnson was killed late Saturday in what investigators believe was a targeted shooting.

Officers responded to a single-car wreck on Interstate 285 in Atlanta at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday night and found the driver, later identified as Johnson, dead inside his vehicle, the statement said. Investigators believe Johnson was shot while driving and was the intended target.

Police identified Johnson as 30 years old, while the social media post from Quality Control Music says he was born in 1993, which would make him around 27.

Johnson emerged in 2017 collaborating with rapper and friend Lil Baby on “2 The Hard Way.” Earlier this year, the up-and-coming rapper released his project “1st & 3rd” featuring Future, Gucci Mane and Lil Baby.

Rapper Lil Yachty, Johnson’s label mate, said on social media that he and Johnson had worked on four songs the morning of his death.

Library of Congress to honour author Colson Whitehead

Colson Whitehead keeps winning awards.

Already this year’s recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the Orwell Prize for political fiction, Whitehead is now being honoured by the Library of Congress. On Monday, it announced that he had won the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.

Whitehead, 50, is the youngest winner of the lifetime achievement prize, which the library has previously given to Toni Morrison, Philip Roth and Denis Johnson, among others. He is the first author to win Pulitzers for consecutive works of fiction — “The Underground Railroad” and “The Nickel Boys,” for which he won in April.

“As a kid, I’d walk into great New York City libraries like the Schomburg and the Mid-Manhattan, on a field trip or for a school assignment, and feel this deep sense of awe, as if I’d stumbled into a sacred pocket in the city,” Whitehead said in a statement. “I hope that right now there’s a young kid who looks like me, who sees the Library of Congress recognize Black artists and feels encouraged to pursue their own vision and find their own sacred spaces of inspiration.”

The producer-distributor Audible announced Monday that Jones’ “Half Light” and Aciman’s “The Gentleman from Peru” will be among five original stories going on sale in August. The others are “The Getaway,” by Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen; Courtney Maum’s “This is Not Your Fault,” which tells of a couple divorcing during the current pandemic; and Thorpe’s “Everyone’s Happy.”

Narrators include Bahni Turpin, who has performed the audio editions of “The Hate U Give” and “The Underground Railroad,” for “Half Light,” and “House of Cards” star Kate Mara for “The Getaway.”

Michael Lewis, Jeffery Deaver and Robert Caro are among the many other writers who in recent years have released works exclusively for audio, one of publishing’s fastest growing markets.

Read', 'The Associated Press']",2020-07-13,"LOS ANGELES - Actress Kelly Preston, whose credits included the films “Twins” and “Jerry Maguire,” died Sunday, her husband John Travolta said. She was 57.

Travolta confirmed his wife’s death in an Instagram post late Sunday. He said she died after a two-year battle with breast cancer.

“It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer,” Travolta said of his wife of 28 years. “She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many.”

Preston had a lengthy career on film and television and at times appearing in films with her husband. They had three children together.

Preston and Travolta were married at a midnight ceremony in Paris in 1991 while the couple were expecting their first son, Jett.

In January 2009, Jett Travolta, 16, died after a seizure at the family’s vacation home in the Bahamas. The death touched off a court case after an ambulance driver and his attorney were accused of trying to extort $25 million from the actors otherwise they would release sensitive information about their son’s death.

Travolta testified during a criminal trial that ended in a mistrial and was prepared to testify a second time, but decided to stop pursuing the case. He cited the severe strain the case and his son’s death had caused the family.

Both Preston and Travolta returned to acting, with Preston’s first role back in the Nicholas Sparks adaptation, “The Last Song,” which starred Miley Cyrus and her future husband, Liam Hemsworth.

They had two other children, daughter Ella Bleu in 2000 and son Benjamin in 2010.

Travolta and Preston met while filming 1988’s “The Experts.”

They last starred together in the 2018 film “Gotti,” with Travolta playing John Gotti and Preston playing the crime boss’s wife, Victoria.

“Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered,” Travolta wrote on Instagram. “I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.”

Preston’s death was first reported by People magazine.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Jake Sheridanalejandra Reyes-Velarde', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Alejandra Reyes-Velarde']",2020-07-12,"LOS ANGELES—Search teams on Saturday were unable to locate the body of “Glee” star Naya Rivera, who authorities believe drowned Wednesday afternoon while boating with her young son on Lake Piru in Ventura County.

The search will resume Sunday morning, according to a Twitter post Saturday evening by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department.

Divers, helicopters, drone aircraft and cadaver dogs have been trying to locate Rivera for four days. Officials said Saturday they have also used sonar equipment but said visibility in the lake has been poor. The depths of Lake Piru range from 10 to 90 feet, creating other challenges.

“Our goal is to bring the family closure,” Ventura County Sheriff Sgt. Marta Bugarin told reporters. “It’s a traumatic time for them. They’re devastated, obviously.”

The 33-year-old Rivera was reported missing Wednesday afternoon after her four-year-old son was found in a rental boat on the lake by himself.

The Santa Clarita native gained praise for her performance as a gay cheerleader in the high school musical drama.

Security video footage released by the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office showed the actress and her son boarding the rental boat by themselves and heading out onto the lake about 1 p.m. Wednesday.

The pontoon boat soon became a spot on the lake’s horizon.

Hours later, after she hadn’t returned to the boat on time, staff of the rental business went out to search for her. At 4:47 p.m., 911 dispatchers received a call from a woman who said, “We have a missing person. We found a little girl in one of the boats by herself and her mom is nowhere to be found.” The girl the woman spoke of was in fact Rivera’s little boy.

Sheriff’s officials said the boy was found asleep on the boat, wearing his life vest. They later learned that Rivera and her son were swimming together in the lake and that he was able to get back on the boat, but she was not.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Lynn Elberthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Lynn Elberthe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"LOS ANGELES—With their marriage under social-media scrutiny, Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith reaffirmed their commitment to each other as Pinkett Smith admitted to having a relationship with musician August Alsina when she and Smith were separated.

In a one-on-one conversation Friday on Pinkett Smith’s series “Red Table Talk,” she said she was reluctantly discussing Alsina’s reported comments because of the public speculation they provoked.

What started as a friendship and a family effort to help Alsina with his health about four years ago became a “different kind of entanglement” at a time when she and Smith thought their marriage was over, Pinkett Smith said.

“An entanglement? A relationship,” Smith said, prodding his wife to be more specific, alluding to the Facebook Watch show’s dedication to candid discussion.

“Yes, it was a relationship. Absolutely. I was in a lot of pain. I was very broken,” she replied. “Now, in the process of that relationship, I definitely realize that you can’t find happiness outside of yourself. ... I would definitely say we did everything that we could to get away from each other, only to realize that that wasn’t possible.”

At one point in the conversation they echoed each other, saying: “We ride together. We die together. Bad marriage for life,” an allusion to a catchphrase in Smith’s “Bad Boys” franchise.

The two have been married since 1997 and have two children, Jaden and Willow. Each appeared uncomfortable at times during their exchanges on the talk show.

A representative for Alsina didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinkett Smith, who starred in two “Matrix” films, questioned why Alsina would bring the episode up again, saying he had broken off communication with her. She also pushed back at the idea that Smith had given her permission for the affair. Alsina was quoted in an interview as saying the actor had given his “blessing.”

“The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,” Pinkett Smith said, then cut Alsina slack for his remarks.

“I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably. And I think he also wanted to make it clear that he is not a homewrecker, because he’s not,” she said.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'David Friendthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'David Friendthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"Independent concert venue owner Jeff Cohen simply wants his famed Horseshoe Tavern to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that’s hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip’s “Bobcaygeon” left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

“The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,” Cohen said.

“We’re not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year ... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It’s a bad scene.”

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada’s live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada’s arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who’s granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that’s supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues “a good start” that needs to be built upon in short order.

“It’s better than nothing,” she said.

“It’ll help some companies for a very short amount of time ... but we’re not done here. We can’t be done.”

While Cohen doesn’t know if he’ll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he’s skeptical about how much it’ll actually help the Horseshoe.

“I’ll be able to pay two weeks of rent,” Cohen said, pointing out it’s roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

“It’ll be something, and we’ll be grateful for it ... but I’m skeptical until I actually see the payments.”

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

“Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don’t think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren’t. I don’t think we even know,” Cohen said.

“The eligibility makes no sense.”

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal’s music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

“It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it’s acoustic shows only,” she said.

“Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.”

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding’s attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she’s concerned for her business, she’s also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That’s motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she’s been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She’s also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would “put more money in the artists’ pockets” over the coming months.

“I’m going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,” she said.

“We’re huge believers in live music.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after.

Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer.

These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation.

“As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.”

“Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada.

In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.”

Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Olivia Hornthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Olivia Hornthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"When Ellie Goulding finally finished promoting her 2015 album, “Delirium,” the exhausted British pop singer and songwriter took a step back to enjoy time at home. The break, tacked onto the long tail of “Delirium,” amounted to a five-year gap between LPs — an eternity for an in-demand artist, particularly one who delivered her first three records in roughly the same span.

She began preparing to re-enter the spotlight after getting married last fall. “I was super fit, I had a good routine and I thought, now is really the right time for me, mentally, to take this on again,” she said. The pandemic, of course, foiled her plans.

Goulding, 33, has spent the past few months sequestered in a cottage just outside Oxford with her husband, art dealer Caspar Jopling. Preparing to release her new album, “Brightest Blue,” on July 17 has consisted largely of nerve-racking livestreams with shoddy Wi-Fi and existential questions about the future of her industry. “I’m worried that people are going to get used to seeing their favourite artists at home and they’re not going to want to go back to music venues,” she said.

She’s still eager to bring fans “Brightest Blue,” an album that shows Goulding’s range, bouncing between feature-laden pop-radio fodder and softer, more inward-facing ballads. Even more varied is her list of 10 cultural must-haves, which brings together mementos from her grunge days with recent film festival darlings and, of course, Kate Bush.

Goulding broke from her routines of practising yoga, writing and honing her air-guitar skills to chat about her picks over Zoom. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

1. “Kalimankou Denkou,” by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir

Someone played it in a studio session and I was immediately transfixed. It was a cathartic thing where it kind of took over my body. I’m inspired by so many different singers, but this felt much deeper than that — like the first time I heard Björk, or Lisa Gerrard in Dead Can Dance, or Cocteau Twins. I thought I knew how a choir was supposed to sound, traditionally. And then this is a whole other technique of singing. It’s just otherworldly and I like anything that makes me feel like I’m not on this planet.

2. “Kate Bush Radio” on Spotify

I’ve always been a fan of Kate Bush, since I was a teenager. I think she was doing something that no one else was doing at the time, when she was making songs like “Running Up That Hill” and even earlier than that: writing these weird ballads that might not have made much sense.

I said “Kate Bush Radio” because I can’t deny that I’m an avid user of music streaming platforms. Why wouldn’t I be? It’s just the most incredible playlist of female artists: Caroline Polachek from Chairlift, Roísín Murphy, Cocteau Twins, Weyes Blood. I love Weyes Blood so much. “Seven Words” is one of my favourite songs of all time. Joni Mitchell, PJ Harvey, Björk. I don’t think you can get better than that.

3. “Two Thousand and Seventeen,” by Four Tet

Four Tet’s been the vibe for quarantine. We put this song on a couple of weeks ago when we went for our first long drive, once we were allowed to go to beauty spots. There was something kind of strange and apocalyptic about driving through the mountains on the first day that we were allowed to go beyond our house and our village. The song just has this sense of unknowing and mysteriousness to it.

4. “Rage Against the Machine,” from Rage Against the Machine

I first heard Rage when I went to my sister’s boyfriend’s house. He was in a band and his brother was in a band, and I fell madly in love with his brother. That was the first time I wanted to play guitar, when I heard Tom Morello playing on “Know Your Enemy.” All my friends had gotten into a grunge phase of Nirvana and Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, and I went a bit further. I got called a goth quite a lot because I had this long black hair and I had my lip pierced. And, no, Nirvana wasn’t enough for me; I needed something more political.

I could win in an air-guitar competition if it was Rage Against the Machine. I promise you. I can’t play them, but I can air guitar the (expletive) out of them.

5. “Capernaum”

This is one of those films where you have to confront every single reality of it — as opposed to last night, when I was watching “Sleepless in Seattle” by myself, drinking Prosecco. This one I watched on a recommendation that I saw online; I think maybe it was Cate Blanchett talking about it. All I knew was that it was based in Lebanon, that it was a female director and that it was about a kid that wanted to sue his parents for giving him life. That’s all I needed to want to watch it.

God, it’s a beautiful film. It makes you forget every single tiny inconvenience in your life. It makes you sad, but it puts a fire in you, makes you want to be a bit more of an activist — and I think it’s really important to watch those things.

6. “Pain and Glory”

I’ve always loved (Pedro) Almodovar’s films. There’s always such an honesty to the characters and you really get to know them in quite an intimate way. But also they’re kind of quirky and dark-humoured, and entertaining enough for you to not be put off by how dark the themes can be. I pick up so many ideas from them.

7. Yung Pueblo

I am careful about who I follow (on social media). That’s not to say I only follow things that I know I will like, because I think that can be quite dangerous, but I do try to follow things that keep my brain in the right place for songwriting. So, for example, (poet and author) Yung Pueblo: he always just bloody knows what to say. He’s preoccupied with the idea that you find love in yourself first before you find love with someone else. “True power is living the realization that you are your own healer, hero and leader.” I very much believe in that.

8. “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys,” by Viv Albertine

She just has such an interesting life. She was one of the first punk rockers and had to endure so many other egotistical male-fronted punk bands. She was around them all: Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious, and members of the Clash like Paul Simonon — who, weirdly, is my next-door neighbour. She talks about how sexy he is and so, any time he walks out of his door, I start blushing because I think about her describing him in the book.

I love the idea of ’70s London. My dad was in a punk band and my mom was a bit of a punk, so I’m fascinated by that era. But also, “music, music, music; boys, boys, boys; clothes, clothes, clothes” — that is me, really.

9. “Climate Justice,” by Mary Robinson

I work for the UN as an environmental goodwill ambassador. I talk a lot about climate change to my fans. A lot of people say, “What can I read? How can I learn about this? I want to know more.” I would say this is a really great book to start.

It talks about how she went around the world to understand the people at the forefront of climate change. Basically, the poorest people in the world are the ones that are affected the most and those communities are the ones doing the most about it, which is just very ironic to me.

10. “Untitled” by Julie Mehretu

This is one of the first serious pieces of art I bought. I have a small kitchen and it’s kind of the focal point of the room. She uses graphic techniques and layers parts of maps. It ends up being this mystical, magical map of somewhere.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Ashley Spencerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Ashley Spencerthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Two years ago, Michele Morrone was working as a gardener in a tiny northern Italian village. Newly divorced, broke and severely depressed, he had given up on his TV acting career after being repeatedly told that he was too attractive for the roles on offer.

“In Italy, if you’re a good-looking guy you’re not an actor,” he said matter-of-factly. “You’re just someone good-looking.”

But after five months toiling alongside cows and chickens, he got a call from his agent that a team of Polish filmmakers wanted to offer him the role of a Mafia boss in the erotic thriller “365 Days,” a part that required someone Italian and very good-looking.

“I woke up, called my gardening boss and said: ‘I’m not coming in today. My stomach doesn’t feel good,’” the 29-year-old father of two recalled. He boarded a plane to Poland and his life hasn’t been the same since.

Despite a zero per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “365 Days,” directed by Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes, quickly became a viral sensation when it arrived on Netflix worldwide June 7, following a successful theatrical run in Poland and a limited British release earlier this year.

Scripted in English with occasional subtitled Polish and Italian, the dicey plot clearly didn’t deter viewers: the Sicilian Mafia boss Massimo (Morrone) kidnaps the unsuspecting Laura (Polish newcomer Anna-Maria Sieklucka) and gives her one year to fall in love with him before he’ll free her from his palatial lair.

Amid a growing backlash, critics say it glorifies rape culture and Stockholm syndrome. Fans say it’s been unfairly maligned. What isn’t in dispute is that nearly a month after its streaming debut and with seemingly no promotion, the film remains among Netflix’s Top 10 most watched titles in the United States and other countries, including Australia, Britain, Brazil, France, Spain and India.

Based on the first in a bestselling trilogy of Polish novels by Blanka Lipinska, “365 Days” leans heavily into travel porn, wealth porn and soft-core actual porn, apparently an appealing combination in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis when many viewers have been at home for months on end.

“In a way, it was almost custom-made for pandemic viewing: beautiful people having exotic sex in opulent settings,” said Caetlin Benson-Allott, an associate professor at Georgetown University and an expert on movie viewing habits.

There’s plenty of (simulated) carnality to ogle in the film’s 114 minutes. And since Netflix defines a view as watching a mere two minutes of a title, it’s impossible to know if a majority of viewers watched the full movie or skipped to the more tantalizing scenes.

Teenagers on TikTok were some of the first to spread word of “365 Days” by filming themselves reacting to the sex scenes with a mix of shock and admiration. “I did not expect this kind of movie to be on Netflix; maybe, like, late-night HBO,” Noah Holifield, an 18-year-old Chicagoan whose reaction video has more than 2.6 million views, said in an interview.

Some joke that they too would like to be kidnapped by Massimo, and his catchphrase “Are you lost, baby girl?” is now a meme set to music in which the users eagerly respond, “Yes, daddy!”

Some of the criticism of “365 Days” echoes that of the “50 Shades of Grey” trilogy, another campy book-to-movie slice of erotica featuring a wealthy, powerful man and BDSM. Benson-Allott said the outright dismissal of both franchises was the byproduct of the United States being “still a very puritanical country in a lot of ways.”

“We frown on pornography and judge people for enjoying erotic fiction,” she added.

But it’s hard to ignore that the entire premise of “365 Days” is problematic. Variety’s review blasted the film’s “two flavours of misogyny” and its suggestion “that consent can be obtained retroactively,” while the feminist website Jezebel lamented “how quickly depraved abduction turns to cookie-cutter fairy tale.”

In an open letter to Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings, made public July 2, Welsh singer Duffy — who earlier this year opened up about her own experience being drugged, kidnapped and raped — asked the platform to remove the title, writing, “This should not be anyone’s idea of entertainment, nor should it be described as such, or be commercialized in this manner.”

The streaming service wouldn’t comment for this article, while Morrone emphasized that the story was pure fantasy and that he “would never encourage or want anyone to fall in love with their captor in real life.”

But Goali Saedi Bocci, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Psychology Today, warned against dismissing the issues on the basis of fiction.

“There is clearly quite a bit of misunderstanding about sexual consent and assault” in real life, Bocci said, “and such films only continue to muddy the waters.” The danger is that men and women “can be victims of sexual assault, rape, molestation and not even recognize it as such.

“We have to be extra cautious of the media we consume because, like it or not, these things get into our subconscious,” she said.

Still, the film has racked up fans, as evidenced by Morrone’s Instagram account, which has skyrocketed from fewer than 200,000 followers in January to more than seven million at the end of June. On a night out while visiting Berlin, he was mobbed by German teenagers clamouring for selfies. It’s an unexpected turn for the son of a construction worker and housekeeper who paints, dances (he was a runner-up on the 2016 season of Italy’s “Dancing With the Stars”), plays guitar, sings and writes his own extremely personal music, like a song about his 2018 divorce from Lebanese fashion designer Rouba Saadeh.

After four of his tracks were featured in “365 Days,” Universal Music Group signed him to a global record deal and he’s working on a second album while fielding scripts from Hollywood and Europe. But first, with “365 Days” ending on a cliffhanger and two books still to go in the series, he’ll soon reprise his career-making role in a sequel that will film when pandemic restrictions are lifted.

He teased, “The story is going to be very, very interesting.”

Peter Morgan, the writer and creator of “The Crown,” said that the possibility of a reversal was raised during the show’s planning process.

“As we started to discuss the story lines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said in a statement. “To be clear, Series 6 will not bring us any closer to present day — it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail.”

In January, Morgan said that the show’s fifth season was the “perfect time and place to stop” and that Netflix and Sony supported him in the decision.

The show debuted in 2016, with Claire Foy playing a young, newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II in the first two seasons, and focused on the early years of the monarch’s reign and her family’s drama during those years.

In November, Netflix released the third season, starring Olivia Colman as the queen in the 1960s and ’70s. The season follows the queen as she navigates Britain’s political and economic issues, as well as numerous problems with family members, including her two eldest children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

A release date has not yet been announced for the fourth season, which will again feature Colman as the queen, and revisit her reign through Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and Prince Charles’ relationship with Princess Diana. Colman will then pass the crown to Imelda Staunton for the fifth season.

The streaming service announced last week that in the fifth instalment Lesley Manville would take over the role of Princess Margaret, who was played in the first two seasons by Vanessa Kirby, and by Helena Bonham Carter in the third and fourth.

“We can’t wait for audiences to see the upcoming fourth season,” said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix, “and we’re proud to support Peter’s vision and the phenomenal cast and crew for a sixth and final season.”

She said in a statement that the show was “raising the bar” for each new season.

With its high-profile cast, precise period detail and gilded settings, “The Crown” has also drawn steep bills. It has cost Netflix nearly $150 million (U.S.), about twice as much as the royal family costs British tax payers each year.

Morgan compared the production process to making a movie, as opposed to a serialized drama. Before the pandemic, a team of researchers convened at Morgan’s home once a week, helping weave together story lines for script meetings with documents, transcripts and press clippings they had collected.

There is an expectation to “deliver TV on an annual basis,” he said. “But what we’re making now is feature-film-quality stuff, and no one ever expected you to make 10 feature films a year — because you’d die.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Travolta’s front yard has an airstrip suitable for Boeing. Lady Gaga has a bowling alley. Michael Jordan has an infinity pool with floating grass island. Paris Hilton’s $300,000 doghouse is bigger than my semi. Celine Dion once had a water park with twin slides. Kim Kardashian has a walk-in fridge.

Imagine getting lost while searching for mayo.

But there are exceptions to every rule. Some celebrities are so down to earth, they do not covet a spire in the sky. Some are so comfortable in their own skin, they do not yearn for a petting zoo. Some are free spirits who feel no urge to flaunt the trappings of material excess, especially during a pandemic.

Why, some have no problem using a bathroom that would make a hobo gag.

Demi Moore has a new podcast, “Dirty Diana.” The six-part scripted drama is described as a “show for all of us who are craving connection and searching for a new kind of erotica.” If that’s your thing, you weirdo, the podcast starts Monday.

To plug the project, Moore recently shared two photos on Instagram. And now I’m finding it hard to care about this fictional Diana. I’m too distracted by the real Dirty Demi.

In the snaps, Moore is wearing headphones and army boots. She is plopped on a shabby, floral-print sofa unfit for the Queen’s servants. Based on the MacBook and tablet script display, this is her podcasting studio. But hang on. A few feet away, in the background, is that a toilet? Does this lavatory have wall-to-wall shag carpeting, circa 1976, in the shade of excrement? Is the faucet cabinet cluttered with products and creepy dolls and what appears to be a plastic severed hand holding a sun hat?

Or is that a mushroom lamp? All I know is the serial killer vibe is strong.

But not as strong as the gross energy.

Broadloom in the restroom? That’s not retro decor — it’s a germ factory. A life-sized Joan of Arc statue staring down as you soak in the tub? That’s just spooky. Why does this bathroom have a door to the outside? Why is there a toy monkey squished into the tacky bricks? And when Bruce Willis was in lockdown with his ex a few months back, did he sit on that toilet and talk to that plush simian?

The train is leaving the station. Yippee-ki-yay, little monkey.

This is not a place to do your business — it’s the stuff of nightmares and cognitive dissonance.

Live and let live, that’s my motto. But today I’m changing it to: MAKE A DECISION. Dirty Demi? Make a decision: living room or bathroom? It can’t be both because that’s disgusting. Look at yourself. You’re wearing cropped overalls and podcasting with a beaming smile a few feet away from where someone just did No. 2. Do you think Bill Gates built Microsoft with his elbow on a urinal? How are we supposed to listen to “Dirty Diana” when we know it rumbled to life inside a biohazard lab?

Did Ashton Kutcher get all of the interior design books and ceramic tile in the divorce? Are your dining chairs bidets? Are your bookshelves lined with Charmin? Do you sleep in a shower stall? Does the family room have a beach towel nailed to the wall instead of a flat-screen TV?

Now that Netflix has rebooted “Unsolved Mysteries,” it should investigate these photos.

Dirty Demi is podcasting from a carpeted washroom. That’s like woodworking in the kitchen or doing jumping jacks on the roof. Am I overreacting? Probably! But I’m a germaphobe smack dab in the middle of a pandemic and seeing dated upholstery hug the base of a crapper is giving me the heebie-jeebies. You know what else? On the sink, I see a tube of moisturizer. I see a bottle of alkaline artesian water imported from New Zealand. BUT I DON’T SEE ANY SOAP!

I swear to God, if I knew Moore’s address in Idaho, I’d board a plane in my haz-mat suit and go rescue that MacBook, perched on a makeshift basket stand atop a rustic coffee table in the haze of a million filthy microbes. Poor laptop. Then I’d line Moore and her daughters against the garage and hose them down with Purell. Then I’d board up that podcasting loo and put a Porta Potty in the driveway.

Read', 'Star Staff']",2020-04-22,"When we find ourselves in times of trouble music is a solace we turn to. It can uplift, relax, transport or energize us. Live music, in particular, is exciting because anything can happen: it’s intimate; it’s urgent, and everyone in the room experiences and shares it together. United.

But what does a musician do when they don’t have an audience? And audiences when they can’t access live music? Here in our coronavirus self-isolation being able to share music is a gift.

The Toronto Symphony Orchestra has teamed up with the Toronto Star to offer an exclusive weekly Musical Moment — a new performance by one of the TSO’s musicians every week — a respite from the hard headlines and tough news we hear every day.

“Like the Toronto Star, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is here to serve Torontonians throughout the GTA,” said its CEO, Matthew Loden. “We hope that this exclusive Toronto Star performance series serves as a hopeful musical tonic as readers review challenging but important headlines.”

Here’s how it works: the musician records themselves playing their instrument live at home, then sends their recording to TSO producers; as in the first performance by concertmaster Jonathan Crow, to be paired with the piano of Philip Chiu.

Pieces will be no longer than three minutes. And because they’re recorded at home, you’ll get new insight into each musician; a glimpse into their lives beyond the stage. Each week will offer up a new experience — as you would at a live performance, you never know what might happen. There’s an energy and an intimacy.

There are many couples at the TSO — maybe they’ll play together. Other family members, children perhaps, might join in somehow. Ensembles might record separately with each musician in their own home and then be joined together in production.

The new video will be posted each Thursday at thestar.com/musicalmoments; check in every week for music to unite the city.

When the isolation rules loosened, Thompson immediately thought of playing the tune “Ashokan Farewell” with her friend.

Widely known as the theme from the Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary, “Ashokan Farewell” was written in 1982 by American folk musician Jay Ungar as a goodnight/farewell waltz, played at the end of the annual Ashokan Fiddle & Dance Camps run by Ungar and his wife. The tune, which Ungar describes as a “song of longing and loss,” felt very apt for these times.

Thompson and Chun thank him for allowing them to share this performance of his tune.

After Monday, when they officially bade adieu to royal life, it’s time for champagne, caviar and a three-tier cake scrawled with, “Freedom!” The bash with their closest pals should also include a few symbolic nods to their new homeland, Canada. (Actually, scratch that because now I’m picturing Heather Dorak browbeating guests into doing Pilates on an itchy Hudson’s Bay blanket as George Clooney gets wasted on Molson Canadian and Oprah, already stinking of ketchup chips, demands the terrified chefs whip up a batch of Nanaimo bars for her flight home.)

The point is, Harry and Meghan are now liberated. Congratulations!

Your royal nightmare is over. Let the real dreaming begin.

Anyone who believes the young couple made a grave mistake by ditching the charmed life of his birth — and one she married into — need only watch a nine-second clip from Monday. It was Commonwealth Day, Harry and Meghan’s last pony show as departing senior royals. The narcoleptic event went down inside Westminster Abbey, though given the frostiness on display, it should’ve unfolded in the North Pole.

Harry and Meghan, looking resplendent, were already seated in the second row. But when Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ambled toward their spots in the first row, months of reported feuds twisted into high-def focus. Meghan waved at Kate, sweetly, but was ignored like a dirty panhandler.

William and Kate then took their seats. And Meghan turned toward her husband to whisper.

What she said, I have no clue.

But I would not blame Meghan had she asked in a hush, “Harry, what is wrong with those two?”

After months in which a “falling out” between the brothers was widely reported, this was a chance for the couples to at least feign congeniality for the global cameras. You know? Pretend everything is A-OK. Hug it out. Fake laugh and make small talk. Do something to disabuse the world of the notion there is now bad blood between two blood brothers.

But that’s not what happened. And the blame goes to William and Kate, who telegraphed petulance.

My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. It really does. Tired of the absolute garbage they’ve endured from the British tabloids — and determined to animate their own philanthropic and career goals without the controlling shackles of Buckingham Palace — they reasonably asked to become part-time royals.

Instead, they were stripped of their Sussex brand and banished from the Queendom.

Whether it was the awkward, chilly interaction with William and Kate on Monday or getting booed by a heckler at the Endeavour Fund Awards a couple of days earlier, Harry and Meghan’s final weekend as royals was not cause for any second-guessing — it was proof #Megxit was one of the greatest decisions ever made.

The royal family does not deserve Harry and Meghan. The world does.

The royal family wanted to hold them down. They are now free.

On Saturday, during an interview on MSNBC Live, British journalist Victoria Mather revealed the extent of the classist-slash-racist forces aligned against Markle when she blurted out, “I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the Queen. And the Queen is the most respected person — most respected woman — in the world.”

Now, if I were to be similarly nasty, I might point out Mather looks like Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncle in drag who works the overnight shift at a Twinings factory. Five clicks up from trailer trash? Mather looks and sounds three clicks below a stolen bangers-and-mash breakfast along the banks of the River Thames, in the company of Piccadilly Circus freaks.

But if you watch the rest of the interview, the narrative is clear: Kate Middleton came from a great family worthy of royalty. Meghan Markle, by contrast, was spawned from a biracial hillbilly clan, and has no right to yank Harry from his relationship with his king-in-waiting brother and preternaturally uptight sister-in-law.

So Meghan is basically the Yoko Ono of this century: blamed for the breakup of another “Fab Four.”

Give me a break. From the moment Markle was linked to Prince Harry, she has coped with vicious attacks on her character and motivation. And yet, at every turn, she has bravely smiled, put on her hiking boots and taken the high road. Her steely resolve, her focus on the big picture, reminds me of someone else: Princess Diana.

So Harry and Meghan’s final march through royal duty this weekend is no longer cause for debate: it is irrefutable evidence they made the right decision by getting the hell away. What they want for themselves, compared to what was expected of them, could never be reconciled. There was no middle ground here.

Harry and Meghan, after the birth of their son, realized royal life was a prison in the making.

Now they are free. Now there is no looking back.

Read', 'Shinan Govanicontributing Columnist', 'Contributing Columnist', 'Shinan Govani Is A Toronto-Based Freelance Contributing Columnist Covering Culture', 'Society. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-03-11,"It only took 14 years.

When the Dixie Chicks triumphantly returned earlier this month, dropping a fist-up emoji of a song called “Gaslighter” — also the name of a long-awaited album, coming soon — my thoughts darted to a few places. One, I remembered how much I bloody love the Dixie Chicks.

Two, a reminder of the fuss that engulfed the game-changing country trio, back in the early aughts, when frontwoman Natalie Maines publicly denounced both the Iraq War and the then-president George W. Bush (and how quaint all of that sounds now).

Three, a fixation on the idea that while “Gaslighter’ has the ire and the tang of songs on their 2006 comeback album — think “Not Ready To Make Nice” — and that it, additionally, makes pulp of a term that is ubiquitous these days — “gaslighting” is an in-vogue word, employed everywhere from politics to reality TV — I was not entirely sure that what this song was about was actually … well … “gaslighting.” Maybe it’s just a bummer?

Indeed, visions of Alanis cascaded upon me, as I wondered if gaslight might just be the next “Ironic”? You remember, dontcha, that ’90s anthem which describes any number of things — “a traffic jam when you’re already late,” for one; “ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,” for another — few of which were especially ironic?

Some background: “gaslighting” has become a more popular expression, in this Trump-era zeitgeist of “alternative facts” but in its purest essence, in the personal realm, it refers to a form of sustained emotional abuse that involves manipulating the truth to make someone doubt their grip on reality — and the term actually goes back decades. To a 1938 play “Gaslight,” in fact — one that later became a classic movie with Ingrid Bergman. In that plot, a husband wrecks havoc on his wife by subtly altering things, including playing with the gaslights in the house.

What do you think?

Lying. Manipulation. Keeping your victim foggy-eyed and off-balance. The toolbox of the classic gaslighter in that original incarnation. And one that has become a staple in psychology, and has now morphed into a go-to bit of invective in this era, it reaching its own sort of pop-political apotheosis when, in an interview last year, none other than Taylor Swift accused Trump of “gaslighting the American public.” Lately, I have heard everyone from Real Housewives to contestants on “Love Island” throw around the term.

The term has also been enjoying a good run on bookshelves, too, especially in a form of domestic noir as practised by authors like Gillian Flynn. There is, for instance, Tara Isabella Burton’s pretty great, gender-bending Talented Mr. Ripley redux from a couple of years ago, “Social Creature,” in which the anti-heroine uses gaslighting via the very 21st-century modes of social media. And also, even crazier, the meta-ness of A.J. Finn’s bestseller “The Woman in the Window” (soon to be a movie with Amy Adams), which was sold as a gaslight novel but then got even more curiouser, when the author was unveiled as a serial liar himself in a long profile done of him in “The New Yorker,” with his past deceptions including claiming to have had cancer, among other things (cue the allegations of Finn as a gaslighter by colleagues).

A Guardian columnist echoed some of my own reservations, though, when she warned against cheapening the term. “Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter,” Barbara Ellen wrote. Meaning: it is not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious behaviour, nor is it “gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses.”

When it occurs, “it is a systematic dissolving another person’s sense of self, until they’re questioning every move and instinct.” And not just a phenomenon that pops up on a show like “Love Island,” where male contestants are tagged as gaslighters, when — girl, please — many of them are just himbos who’d say anything to get laid.

So, what say you, Dixie Chicks? In their album — which the group has called “the most personal and autobiographical” — the just-out song clearly traces Maines’ very public divorce from a liar-face. And the full-blast lyrics? Well, they speak for themselves. Exhibit A: “Give you all my money, you’ll gladly walk away … Gaslighter, denier, doing anything to get your ass farther …”

It is an earworm, all right, but is, actually … gaslighting? Let the debates begin.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Karen Frickertheatre Critic', 'Theatre Critic', 'Summer', 'The Donna Summer Musical', 'Plays At The Princess Of Wales Theatre', 'King St. W']",2020-03-10,"Disco is back, according to some experts. Others would say that it’s never gone away: disco has been an enduring influence on music — and pop culture more broadly — ever since producers and artists first integrated synthesizers and four on the floor beats into pop sounds in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

Wherever you fall in these debates about disco’s evergreen status, what cannot be disputed is the central place of the late American singer and songwriter Donna Summer in the history of the genre.

Performer and frequent co-writer of 14 Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits — including “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Macarthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Last Dance,” “Dim all the Lights” and more — Summer’s musical legacy is huge. And yet for many years Summer resisted her status as the so-called Queen of Disco, says theatre director Des McAnuff, “because she was so many other things.”

McAnuff is the director and co-writer of the Broadway musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which is playing at the Princess of Wales Theatre through March 22. The premise of the show is that it takes place at a concert celebrating Summer’s music and then flashes back to retell the story of her life.

Three actors play Summer, as the senior Diva Donna (Dan’yelle Williamson), the career-prime Disco Donna (Alex Hairston) and the fledgling Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy).

“One of the themes is that she was many people,” says McAnuff. “She lived a number of different lives, some even contradictory.”

The show revisits Summer’s early professional years in Germany, where she met up with the producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and put out the groundbreaking singles “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love.” In its survey of Summer’s career, it demonstrates the wide range of musical genres that influenced her and to which she contributed, including pop, funk, R&B, gospel and inspirational rock.

It also touches on some of the more controversial aspects of Summer’s life and career: a born-again Christian, she was quoted in the 1980s as saying that AIDS was divine retribution for immoral lifestyles, statements she denied but which caused great distress among her massive gay following.

The show reunites McAnuff, the Tony and Olivier Award winner and former artistic director of the Stratford Festival, with choreographer Sergio Trujillo. The pair have created several highly successful musicals built around the back catalogues of musical groups and artists, including “Jersey Boys,” about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and “Ain’t Too Proud,” about The Temptations.

Both McAnuff and Trujillo, who live in the U.S., spent formative years in Canada and still identify partly as Canadian. Trujillo’s memories of the disco era are directly tied to Toronto.

“My family arrived in Canada in 1976 from Colombia,” says Trujillo. “I had never heard disco music before. I’d only heard salsa in Colombia. This whole new sound and style of music was electrifying to me. My cousins are older than me by five or six years and they were all really immersed in the disco craze. They would take me to various clubs around Toronto — I was 14 or 15 — and I watched them dance. I saw the music and the decadence of that world.”

The challenge that Trujillo gave himself with “Summer” was to do more than “dust off those old disco moves” (just to set expectations: no one does the Hustle in this show).

“I lived through this period,” says Trujillo. “I decided that I was going to take the opportunity to create some storytelling” through the way the musical numbers are staged.

A priority for Trujillo and McAnuff was to make the production a showcase for female performers, particularly female performers of colour. Besides the three Donnas, there is a chorus of 12 female dancers (and one male) who, in addition to performing Trujillo’s choreography, play various roles in the story, female and male.

This “creates a kind of androgyny that captures the time,” says McAnuff, “and uses extraordinary talents that have been relatively sidelined in our business … Sergio and I spend a lot of time in auditions and one of the thing that becomes clear is that there are many, many women who don’t get the opportunities they deserve in terms of roles.”

While he spent his high school years in Scarborough and launched his theatre career in Toronto, McAnuff’s memories of the disco era are firmly set in New York. “I was working at the Public Theater in those days. The disco beat permeated all kinds of genres of music,” recalls McAnuff. “I was very aware of it. I play music; you couldn’t play music without being influenced by it.”

While he was at the time the sort of artsy rebel “who considered anything north of 14th Street as uptown,” says McAnuff, he does remember going to Studio 54 in its heyday and hearing Summer’s “Macarthur Park” for the first time.

“That song was of course a big discovery,” he says, “and this is in the show. Before that people thought of Donna as a sort of Black Marilyn Monroe, but the fact that she could sing that way was something of a shock. She hadn’t really had the chance to show off those extraordinary pipes.”

“Summer” played on Broadway from April to December 2019 and earned two Tony nominations (for LaChanze as Diva Donna and Ariana DeBose as Disco Donna). This North American tour has been on the road since September 2019, and both McAnuff and Trujillo say they’re coming to Toronto to see the show here.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-03-11,"When even the mother of “The Bachelor” doesn’t believe he has a chance in hell of finding love you know it’s over: romance, or whatever passed for romance on the long-running reality franchise, is dead.

Viewers who endured a train wreck of a “Bachelor” season had to put up with a fiasco of a finale, spread over four hours and two nights Monday and Tuesday, as pilot Peter Weber’s bid to find a wife crashed and burned.

To summarize: Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with one woman who said she loved him but that they were too different to make things work. Two days after she walked out on him, Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with another woman and proposed marriage to her. But the engagement ended because he still had feelings for the first woman, who confessed she still had feelings for him and agreed to give him a second chance.

Despite the optimistic presence of jeweller Neil Lane in Tuesday’s live studio audience in Los Angeles, briefcase of diamond rings in hand, there was no engagement.

A couple of clear villains emerged from the shambles: Weber himself and a tired series that prizes made-for-TV manipulation over the human connections it claims to value above all else.

There was also a clear hero: Hannah Ann Sluss, the 23-year-old we were all making fun of a couple of weeks ago for dotting her i’s with hearts, but who boldly and confidently stood up for herself and rejected Peter’s weaselly rationalizations after he sabotaged their engagement.

The third person involved in this mess, Madison Prewett, also 23, was coaxed back into Peter’s arms after “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison personally delivered the news of Peter’s broken engagement. This strikes me less as altruism than a desperate attempt to get Peter paired off and stave off criticism that the entire season was a colossal waste of time.

But Peter’s mother Barb very bluntly told Peter and Madison on Tuesday that their relationship is doomed to fail. While I think it was impolitic of her to sabotage her own son on live TV like that, I also think she’s probably right given her disdain for Madison (evidenced by the rude faces she made on camera every time Madison opened her mouth) and that of the rest of Peter’s family. How does a relationship that’s already on shakey ground withstand that kind of familial disapproval?

But let’s back up and retrace how we got to this sorry point.

Weber was never a popular choice as star of this “Bachelor” season, one that was marked by tedious sniping among the contestants and Peter’s seeming inability to form more than shallow connections with any of his would-be mates.

Madison, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala., was an early front-runner, but just before she, Peter and two other women jetted off to Australia for “fantasy suite” week, she told him she’d be hard pressed to continue dating him if he had sex with the other two on their overnight dates. Deeply religious, she was saving herself for marriage.

Peter, on the other hand, was renowned for his sexual prowess. His claim to fame, and likely the reason he was chosen as Bachelor, was that he had sex four times with “The Bachelorette” in a windmill fantasy suite. So to no one’s surprise, except maybe Madison’s, Peter confessed he’d been “intimate” (whether with one or both of the other women was never specified) and Madison bolted.

She did come back, but his indiscretion hung like a cloud over their relationship and she left him in the Australian outback, seemingly forever.

This is where Peter could have used his powers for good instead of evil.

Hannah Ann, a model from Knoxville, Tenn., adored Peter; his family adored Hannah Ann. (That clip we saw ad nauseam of Barb wailing at Peter, “Bring her home to us”? The “her” was Hannah Ann.) But Peter was obviously gaga for Madison. The day after the breakup he told Hannah Ann that despite her obvious devotion to him his heart was “being pulled in two different directions.”

The honourable thing to do would have been to send Hannah Ann home then and there. Instead he claimed the very next day that he’d found “true love” with her. “My heart chooses you forever,” he told a very surprised Hannah Ann before pulling out a pear-shaped diamond ring.

It’s the same ring Hannah Ann put back in his hand weeks later after Peter confessed he couldn’t give her his entire heart.

Onstage in the studio, Hannah Ann lambasted Peter for downplaying his feelings for Madison. “I had no idea what I was saying yes to. That’s called being blindsided,” she said. “If you would have sat me down and had an honest conversation you know that my instinct would have picked up on that you were not ready for a commitment with me …

“And that’s the most hurtful part is that you didn’t respect me enough just to have that open conversation with me.”

She left him with this zinger: “If you want to be with a woman you’ve got to become a real man.”

Peter apologized a lot but never really explained why he did what he did. Was it pride? FOMO? A desire to please his family? A sense of pressure not to leave the show still single?

Whatever the reason, his actions did nothing to endear him to viewers who were already very displeased with him. And it’s hard to feel unreserved enthusiasm for his and Madison’s relationship given his shoddy treatment of Hannah Ann.

This is the third season in a row of “The Bachelor” to finish without a so-called happy ending. Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped his fiancée for his runner-up; Colton Underwood got jilted by his favourite but got her to agree to continue dating him; and now this.

But maybe the issue isn’t the show’s failure rate but the whole premise that a man getting down on one knee to propose to a woman he’s known for barely two months is the pinnacle of romantic love.

Warner Bros. and ABC remain unbowed. They’re debuting yet another “Bachelor” spinoff on April 13, “Listen to Your Heart,” in which the contestants are all musicians, to be followed by a new season of “The Bachelorette” on May 18 starring Clare Crawley, the oldest franchise star at 38.

Read', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"For years, Godfred Addai-Nyamekye felt like he was alone in his trauma after being a victim of police violence in Calgary.

“Three years ago, four years ago, I was in the wilderness, screaming by myself,” Addai-Nyamekye says in a phone interview.

As Addai-Nyamekye explains in the documentary “Above the Law,” debuting Saturday on “CBC Docs POV” and CBC Gem, police officers in the city unlawfully detained him when his car got stuck in the snow in December 2013.

He says they drove him to a remote location and abandoned him in minus 28 Celsius weather in the middle of the night.

After calling 911 for help, Addai-Nyamekye says he was Tasered and assaulted by a constable who chided him for calling the emergency line.

He was left in so much pain he could barely stand and with post-traumatic stress disorder that continues to this day.

Addai-Nyamekye was charged with assaulting a police officer in the incident but was later acquitted after a judge saw video, taken from a police helicopter, showing him being beaten and dragged while handcuffed through the snow by an officer.

He got no compensation, but amid the release of the documentary and a global movement against systemic racism and police brutality, he says he’s happy to finally see some attention on cases like his.

“It’s about time that we let Canadians know that these kind of issues are out here, police brutality is out here, injustice is out here, discrimination: everything is out here,” says Addai-Nyamekye, who was born in Ghana.

“Whatever issues are in the States are out here. And it’s about time that we sit back and look at all these issues, and we address them.”

“Above the Law” explores three cases of excessive force involving the Calgary Police Service, including that of Anthony Heffernan, who was Tasered and shot to death by an officer during a wellness check in a hotel room in March 2015.

The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) initially found there were grounds to charge the officer with a criminal offence, but the Crown later determined a conviction was unlikely and no charges would be laid.

Also featured is the May 2015 arrest of the late Daniel Haworth, whose family says he suffered brain damage from being punched and thrown to the ground while handcuffed. Haworth died of a drug overdose several months later.

Const. Trevor Lindsay, the same officer involved in Addai-Nyamekye’s case, was convicted of aggravated assault on Haworth in June 2019.

According to the filmmakers, Lindsay spent two and a half years on relief from duty with pay while he was awaiting trial. He is now relieved from duty without pay and remains free while he awaits sentencing. He’s expected to appeal his conviction.

“I think in Canada, for a very long time we’ve been acting under the presumption that these are American problems,” says Marc Serpa Francoeur, who co-directed the documentary with Robinder Uppal.

“We’re so inundated with American media and films, and we watch American court cases, all this stuff, but I don’t think we look internally enough.”

Serpa Francoeur says they embarked on the film five years ago and looked into systemic policing issues and accountability mechanisms on the force and on a provincial level.

But he notes: “These problems are not endemic to Calgary.”

“We need to have confidence that officers are being held to account by what is required of them on a legislative level by the Police Act, what is required of them by criminal law,” Serpa Francoeur says.

“There are too many instances where you’re looking at a lot of double standard.”

Addai-Nyamekye has launched several formal complaints about his case, and a lawsuit against Lindsay, the other officers and the Crown prosecutors — none of which have been resolved.

He wonders what his fate would have been if the helicopter had not been around to shoot video that exonerated him.

Addai-Nyamekye wants to see police including Lindsay be held accountable for their actions, and members of the force to undergo more training than the current period of six months.

“I want to see more transparency in that police force,” he says. “I want to see a more multicultural police force, not just white.”

Before the incident, Addai-Nyamekye was a “go-getter” with no health issues, he says.

But after, he faced hefty legal and therapy bills, and was unable to work. He wound up homeless, sleeping on friends’ couches, for six months.

“It’s been a terrible journey, in terms of going back to the scene and having all these bad memories come back, flashbacks and PTSD,” Addai-Nyamekye says.

But he’s hopeful the documentary will shed some light on police brutality and injustices.

And he feels a duty to talk publicly about his experience.

“I’m a victim and I’m a living testimony,” Addai-Nyamekye says. “If I don’t speak up, who else is going to speak up?”

Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March.

Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.”

There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities.

The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury.

Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said.

“Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said.

The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months.

The Venice Film Festival runs from Sept. 2-12.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
644,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2020/07/spaghetti-western-movie-composer-ennio-morricone-dead-at-91.html,Spaghetti Western movie composer Ennio Morricone dead at 91,"[""Frances D'Emilio"", ""Fdfrances D'Emiliothe Associated Pressmon."", 'July', 'Min. Read', ""Frances D'Emiliothe Associated Press"", 'The Associated Press', ""Frances D'Emiliothe Associated Pressmon.""]",2020-07-06,"ROME - Ennio Morricone, the Oscar-winning Italian composer who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic Spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as “The Untouchables” and the epic “Once Upon A Time In America,” died Monday. He was 91.

Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

“I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.”

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore.

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.”

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate.

Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif.

That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

“Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.”

In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said.

“A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

“When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said.

Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.”

Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.”

Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions.

His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?”

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won.

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

“I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.”

But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.”

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.

Read', 'Robert Lloydlos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Robert Lloydlos Angeles Timesmon.']",2020-07-06,"June was Pride month, commemorating the 1969 Stonewall riots that birthed the gay liberation movement. As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go.

June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party.

‘Pose-a-Thon’

Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.”

‘Visible: Out on Television’

TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama.

A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending.

‘Disclosure’

“Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify.

‘Welcome to Chechnya’

HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope.

‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’

Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length.

The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures.

Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59.

‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’

A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out.

‘A Secret Love’

For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus.

He was 67.

The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.”

The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.”

Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.”

In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips.

In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards.

“A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.”

Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by AFI in 2013 and most recently produced the documentary “Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics” for Netflix.

He is survived by his ex-wife, Johanna Went, and sisters Lois and Ellen.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scottthe New York Timesfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'A.O. Scottthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'A.O. Scottthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"The opening scenes of the filmed version of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” which started streaming on Disney Plus on Friday, pull you back in time to two distinct periods.

The people onstage, in their breeches and brass-buttoned coats, belong to the New York of 1776. That is when a 19-year-old freshly arrived from the Caribbean — the “bastard, immigrant, son of a whore” who shares his name with the show — makes his move and takes his shot, joining up with a squad of anti-British revolutionaries and eventually finding his way to George Washington’s right hand and the front of the $10 bill.

But this Hamilton, played with relentless energy and sly charm by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, also belongs to the New York of 2016. Filmed (by the show’s director, Thomas Kail, and cinematographer Declan Quinn) in front of a live audience at the Richard Rodgers Theater in June of that year, the movie, while not strictly speaking a documentary, is nonetheless a document of its moment. It evokes a swirl of ideas, debates, dreams and assumptions that can feel, in the present moment, as elusive as the intrigue and ideological sparring of the late 1700s.

“Hamilton” may be the supreme artistic expression of an Obama-era ideal of progressive, multicultural patriotism.

Casting Black and Latino actors as the Founding Fathers and their allies was much more than a gesture of inclusiveness. The show’s argument, woven through songs that brilliantly synthesized hip hop, show tunes and every flavour of pop, was that American history is an open book. Any of us should be able to write ourselves into it.

Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and an architect of the U.S. banking system, was Miranda’s chosen embodiment of this belief: an outsider with no money and scant connections who propelled himself into the centre of the national narrative through sheer brains, talent and drive. Miranda shares some of his hero’s ambition and intelligence, and turns Hamilton into an avatar of modern American aspiration.

“Hamilton” is a brilliant feat of historical imagination, which isn’t the same as a history lesson. Miranda used Ron Chernow’s dad-lit doorstop the way Shakespeare drew on Holinshed’s Chronicles — as a treasure trove of character, anecdote and dramatic raw material. One of the marvels of the show is the way it brings long-dead, legend-shrouded people to vivid and sympathetic life. The close-ups and camera movements in this version enhance the charisma of the performers, adding a dimension of intimacy that compensates for the lost electricity of the live theatrical experience.

The glib, dandyish Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) is a perfect foil for Hamilton: his rival, his intellectual equal and his sometimes reluctant partner in the construction of a new political order. The duplicitous Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) may be the most Shakespearean figure in the pageant, a gifted man tormented and ultimately undone by his failure to make himself matter.

Not that public affairs are the only forces that move “Hamilton.” I haven’t forgotten the Schuyler sisters, who have some of the best numbers and who somewhat undermine the patriarchal, great-man tendencies inherent in this kind of undertaking. Angelica Schuyler (the magnificent Renée Elise Goldsberry), the oldest of the three sisters, is a freethinker and a feminist constrained by the narrowness of the options available to women of her time and class. Her sister Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries Alexander, is saved from being reduced to a passive, suffering figure by the emotional richness of her songs.

Still, the personal and the political don’t entirely balance. The biographical details are necessary to the structure and texture of the show, but it is fuelled by cabinet debates and pamphlet wars, by high rhetoric and backroom dealing, by the glory and complexity of self-government.

“Hamilton” is motivated, above all, by a faith in the self-correcting potential of the American experiment, by the old and noble idea that a usable past — and therefore a more perfect future — can be fashioned from a record that bristles with violence, injustice and contradiction. The optimism of this vision, filtered through a sensibility as generous as Miranda’s, is inspiring.

It is also heartbreaking. One lesson that the past few years should have taught — or reconfirmed — is that there aren’t any good old days. We can’t go back to 1789 or 2016 or any other year to escape from the failures that plague us now. This four-year-old performance of “Hamilton,” viewed without nostalgia, feels more vital, more challenging than ever.

Then again, you might say that the seeds of Victor Feldbrill’s career as a conductor were sown even earlier, at a rehearsal of the Harbord Collegiate Orchestra, when the teacher-conductor handed his baton to his youthful concertmaster so the instructor could walk out front and listen to the orchestra.

The native Torontonian was a violinist then, as he was when Sir Ernest MacMillan subsequently handed him a baton to conduct the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in Strauss’s “Artist’s Life Waltz.”

The year was 1943, he was soon to be stationed in London with the Royal Canadian Navy (still as a violinist) and — following part-time studies at the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music — to return to postwar Toronto and a long professional life facing orchestras.

It is never easy to explain what makes a real conductor. When I was in university a popular textbook was Max Rudolf’s “The Grammar of Conducting” (I still own a copy). I later had the opportunity to hear Rudolf himself conduct in Cincinnati, thanked him and was promptly told that following the conducting diagrams in his book was the barest beginning.

He was right, of course. Two conductors can use those same diagrams and produce greatly different results.

On another occasion I asked a member of the TSO what he considered to be the role of a conductor and, with the cynicism born of long experience, he replied, “to not get in the way.”

Feldbrill did not get in the way. He knew what it was like to play in orchestras and knew better than to treat them without respect for their knowledge.

His own knowledge was acquired more on the front lines than academically. Conducting is something you learn by doing, and he started doing it regularly while still in school.

Did he become a great conductor? No, he became a valuable conductor, championing the work of Canadian composers more than any of his contemporaries did.

He knew the composers on a personal level, worked with them on their premieres and during his decade as music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra starting in 1958, he set a precedent that has sadly not been followed of making Canadian music a regular feature of his programming.

He did conduct internationally, mostly in England and Japan. In the latter country he became the first Canadian guest conductor at Tokyo’s National University of Art and Music in 1979. Throughout the 1980s he conducted and taught regularly in the Land of the Rising Sun.

It was back home in the true north, strong and free, that he made his mark, teaching and conducting at the University of Toronto and appearing with orchestras, both youth and professional, across the country.

His association with the TSO was particularly close, not only as a frequent guest but as sometime director of youth programming and founding conductor of the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra.

Although he never became the orchestra’s music director — recognizing that he was too much the hometown boy to be considered for the job — he stepped up at a critical point in its history, following the 1973 death of Karel Ancerl, to act as resident conductor during the search for Ancerl’s successor.

I think it broke his heart when the then-manager of the orchestra finally terminated his annual appearances at Roy Thomson Hall. He last conducted a full concert at the age of 83.

Seven years later he was still conducting at an Arts and Letters Club celebration of his 90th birthday. I was one of the speakers at that occasion, remarking that critics and conductors have at least one thing in common: we tend to outlive everyone else. When he died in Toronto on June 17, Victor Feldbrill was 96.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here’s what it has promised.,"['Ben Sisario', 'Bsben Sisariothe New York Timessat.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Ben Sisariothe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Ben Sisariothe New York Timessat.']",2020-07-04,"What’s the fastest way to put music industry money into the hands of its Black creators? A small Swedish synthesizer manufacturer has a plan.

Teenage Engineering, which makes sleekly designed, retro-sounding machines adored by dance-music producers, will soon begin sharing sales revenue with a set of Black musicians and other artists of colour in the United States in recognition of their role in popularizing the company’s products.

“This is not charity,” Emmy Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, said in an interview. “Not only is it the right thing to do, it is also good for our business.”

The U.S.-wide soul-searching in the wake of George Floyd’s death has been felt with particular acuteness in the music industry, which owes much of its wealth to the work of Black artists but has just a handful of Black executives in the most senior jobs. Scrutiny has brought the business together in rare ways, with corporate rivals taking part in passionate discussions over Zoom and major companies promising to diversify their ranks.

Still, a thread of anger and impatience remains palpable behind the scenes.

“If history is any indicator, this blows over,” said Troy Carter, a longtime music and technology executive who is now an adviser to the Prince estate.

Despite some cynicism about the promises for change, the predominant mood is one of a momentum that must be seized. Almost as quickly as the major labels made big pledges in the past few weeks, an advocacy group, the Black Music Action Coalition, was formed to hold those companies to account.

“One of our main motivations is not to allow the record companies to get away with pledging money and not pledging systemic change,” said Prophet, a manager of Asian Doll, Layton Greene and other acts, who is part of the group. “Even though their foot was not on the neck of George Floyd, that same systemic racism that plagues society plagues the music business.”

Here’s where the industry’s responses currently stand.

Pledges from the major labels

On June 2, a campaign begun by two young Black women who work in music, Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, paused the industry for a day of reflection and grew into an internet phenomenon under the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.

Within days, a deluge of donation promises from major music companies followed. Warner — backed by a foundation connected to its parent company — and Sony each pledged $100 million (U.S.) to charity. Universal committed $25 million and established a task force to examine its operations. Spotify, Apple, YouTube and SiriusXM made further pledges.

In tacit acknowledgment of the industry’s poor record of hiring minorities for top positions, each of the big labels has undertaken employment inclusion efforts. Sony and Warner began searching for top diversity officers in recent weeks; Universal began its diversity push in 2017.

Universal is also a partner with the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, which two years ago rocked the music world with a study finding scant representation of women in pop. Last week, the initiative said it would study the diversity of record labels, publishers, talent agencies, digital platforms and other companies.

“I think the findings will be shocking,” said Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at USC who is the founder of the Annenberg initiative.

The term ‘urban’

One of the few concrete changes made so far has been contested. Three days after #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, a Universal label that is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, said it would stop using the word urban in department and job titles, calling it “outdated.”

That term, once used by radio stations to evoke sophistication, has come under fire as pigeonholing Black music and stunting the career growth of Black executives. Last month the Grammys renamed its urban contemporary album category “progressive R&B.”

Yet moves to retire “urban” have been called premature. Ethiopia Habtemariam, the president of Motown Records and a co-chair of Universal’s task force, said in an interview that addressing the word was not the task force’s first order of business. The greater goal, she said, was “to make sure we are creating a diverse environment at our company, making sure we have Black leadership across all of the industry. That’s the key.”

One complication: Many Black executives fully embrace the term, including Shawn Gee, the manager of the Roots, whose promotion company, Live Nation Urban, is a joint venture with the concert giant Live Nation Entertainment. The debate over “urban,” Gee said, is a distraction from the industry’s larger problem of a dearth of Black leaders.

“Who in these companies has been able to green light Black culture?” Gee said in an interview. “That’s where the real problem lies. The problem lies in the infrastructure, in the system — not in the word.”

Calls for Black leaders

One goal of the newly-formed Black Music Action Coalition — whose public letter was signed by artists including Pharrell Williams, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and Lady Gaga — was to address what it called “long-standing racial inequities in the music business.”

“There are not enough Black executives in the music business who have control of P&L,” said Binta Niambi Brown, a manager and executive who has worked with Chance the Rapper, referring to the profit and loss statements that measure a business’s finances. Brown, who is part of the coalition, added, “But they are required to explain Black culture to white executives who do run that.”

Carter, now of the Prince estate, became Spotify’s global head of creator services in 2016 — a high-ranking job covering all genres. But when he left two years later, Carter said, an Amazon executive offered him a job there as head of urban music.

“That is the bias that is automatically built into our business,” Carter said. “That if I am a Black executive, call me for the urban music job, which is completely unfair at the end of the day.”

An Amazon spokesperson denied Carter’s account, saying he “was never officially offered a role at Amazon.”

Looking back at old deals

Another question is the treatment of artist contracts from previous decades. Lisa A. Alter, a copyright lawyer who works on behalf of many older artists, said that in the past, Black artists routinely received poor contracts.

“Historically there was less robust representation of artists of colour from a legal point of view,” Alter said. “That resulted in an inability to get advice and negotiate strongly in certain areas — particularly the recoupment of advances and how royalties are calculated.”

Stories of poor contracts for older artists, particularly Black ones, are legion. Little Richard, for example, said that he waived his rights to many of his classic songs early in his career, though he regained them as part of a lawsuit settlement in the 1980s.

“I didn’t read my contracts right; I signed bad contracts,” he told the New York Times in a 1992 interview. “I paid dearly for it.”

One company, BMG Rights Management, a mid-size label and publishing group, has said it will review its past contracts to address “any inequities or anomalies.”

Yet the company’s pool of contracts is far shallower than that of any of the major labels, which have catalogues going back a century. BMG’s review also only covers its recording contracts, not those for music publishing, which are a majority of the company’s holdings.

In a statement, a Universal spokesperson said the company recognized “there is more work to be done” and is committed to looking into legacy contracts.

The Teenage Engineering plan

Compared to giant record companies and streaming platforms, Teenage Engineering is a tiny force. In 2018, it had about $11 million in net sales, according to its most recently disclosed financial statements.

But the company is positioning its revenue-sharing plan — which it is calling an artist fellowship — as a bold statement to recognize and quantify the contributions of artists of colour.

The program is set to begin Sept. 1, and Teenage Engineering’s contracts with artists are still being finalized. But Jesper Kouthoofd, its chief executive, said the company will pay at least 15 per cent of sales revenue to four acts when customers in the United States use special links to the company’s website. The four initial fellows are Underground Resistance, a long-running collective from Detroit; Suzi Analogue, from Miami; and VoltageCtrlR and Baseck, both of Los Angeles.

Other companies on music’s margins have drawn acclaim for their efforts to put more money in artists’ pockets. Bandcamp, an indie streaming and retail platform, has waived its fees on certain days during the pandemic. On Juneteenth, the site donated its share of sales to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, declined to give specific terms of Teenage Engineering’s deals for the new program, but said the artists’ share of company revenues “could be anywhere from $100,000 a year to, in some cases, close to $1 million a year.”

“This will allow us,” Parker said, “to make a shift in the economic model immediately.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Douglas Brinkleythe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Douglas Brinkleythe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"A few years ago, sitting beneath shade trees in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., I had a two-hour discussion with Bob Dylan that touched on Malcolm X, the French Revolution, Franklin Roosevelt and World War II. At one juncture, he asked me what I knew about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864. When I answered, “Not enough,” he got up from his folding chair, climbed into his tour bus, and came back five minutes later with photocopies describing how U.S. troops had butchered hundreds of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho in southeastern Colorado.

Given the nature of our relationship, I felt comfortable reaching out to him in April after, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, he unexpectedly released his epic, 17-minute song “Murder Most Foul,” about the Kennedy assassination. Even though he hadn’t done a major interview outside of his own website since winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, he agreed to a phone chat from his Malibu home, which turned out to be his only interview before next Friday’s release of “Rough and Rowdy Ways,” his first album of original songs since “Tempest” in 2012.

Like most conversations with Dylan, “Rough and Rowdy Ways” covers complex territory: trances and hymns, defiant blues, love longings, comic juxtapositions, prankster wordplay, patriotic ardour, maverick steadfastness, lyrical Cubism, twilight-age reflections and spiritual contentment.

In the high-octane showstopper “Goodbye Jimmy Reed,” Dylan honours the Mississippi bluesman with dragon-fierce harmonica riffs and bawdy lyrics. In the slow blues “Crossing the Rubicon,” he feels “the bones beneath my skin” and considers his options before death: “Three miles north of purgatory — one step from the great beyond/I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon.”

“Mother of Muses” is a hymn to the natural world, gospel choirs and military men like William Tecumseh Sherman and George Patton, “who cleared the path for Presley to sing/who cleared the path for Martin Luther King.” And “Key West (Philosopher’s Pirate),” is an ethereal meditation on immortality set on a drive down Route 1 to the Florida Keys, with Donnie Herron’s accordion channelling the Band’s Garth Hudson. In it he pays homage to, “Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac.”

Perhaps someday he’ll write a song or paint a picture to honour George Floyd. In the 1960s and 1970s, following the work of black leaders of the civil rights movement, Dylan also worked to expose the arrogance of white privilege and the viciousness of racial hatred in America through songs like “George Jackson,” “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.” One of his most fierce lines about policing and race came in his 1976 ballad “Hurricane”: “In Paterson that’s just the way things go/If you’re Black you might as well not show up on the street/Unless you want to draw the heat.”

I had a brief followup with Dylan, 79, one day after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Clearly shaken by the horror that had occurred in his home state, he sounded depressed. “It sickened me no end to see George tortured to death like that,” he said. “It was beyond ugly. Let’s hope that justice comes swift for the Floyd family and for the nation.”

These are edited excerpts from the two conversations.

Was “Murder Most Foul” written as a nostalgic eulogy for a long-lost time?

To me it’s not nostalgic. I don’t think of “Murder Most Foul” as a glorification of the past or some kind of send-off to a lost age. It speaks to me in the moment. It always did, especially when I was writing the lyrics out.

Somebody auctioned off a sheaf of unpublished transcripts in the 1990s that you wrote about J.F.K.’s murder. Were those prose notes for an essay or were you hoping to write a song like “Murder Most Foul” for a long time?

I’m not aware of ever wanting to write a song about J.F.K. A lot of those auctioned-off documents have been forged. The forgeries are easy to spot because somebody always signs my name on the bottom.

Were you surprised that this 17-minute-long song was your first No. 1 Billboard hit?

I was, yeah.

“I Contain Multitudes” has a powerful line: “I sleep with life and death in the same bed.” I suppose we all feel that way when we hit a certain age. Do you think about mortality often?

I think about the death of the human race. The long strange trip of the naked ape. Not to be light on it, but everybody’s life is so transient. Every human being, no matter how strong or mighty, is frail when it comes to death. I think about it in general terms, not in a personal way.

There is a lot of apocalyptic sentiment in “Murder Most Foul.” Are you worried that in 2020 we’re past the point of no return? That technology and hyper-industrialization are going to work against human life on Earth?

Sure, there’s a lot of reasons to be apprehensive about that. There’s definitely a lot more anxiety and nervousness around now than there used to be. But that only applies to people of a certain age like me and you, Doug. We have a tendency to live in the past, but that’s only us. Youngsters don’t have that tendency. They have no past, so all they know is what they see and hear, and they’ll believe anything. In 20 or 30 years from now, they’ll be at the forefront. When you see somebody that is 10 years old, he’s going to be in control in 20 or 30 years, and he won’t have a clue about the world we knew. Young people who are in their teens now have no memory lane to remember. So it’s probably best to get into that mindset as soon as we can, because that’s going to be the reality.

As far as technology goes, it makes everybody vulnerable. But young people don’t think like that. They could care less. Telecommunications and advanced technology is the world they were born into. Our world is already obsolete.

A line in “False Prophet” — “I’m the last of the best — you can bury the rest” — reminded me of the recent deaths of John Prine and Little Richard. Did you listen to their music after they passed as a kind of tribute?

Both of those guys were triumphant in their work. They don’t need anybody doing tributes. Everybody knows what they did and who they were. And they deserve all the respect and acclaim that they received. No doubt about it. But Little Richard I grew up with. And he was there before me. Lit a match under me. Tuned me into things I never would have known on my own. So I think of him differently. John came after me. So it’s not the same thing. I acknowledge them differently.

Why didn’t more people pay attention to Little Richard’s gospel music?

Probably because gospel music is the music of good news and in these days there just isn’t any. Good news in today’s world is like a fugitive, treated like a hoodlum and put on the run. Castigated. All we see is good-for-nothing news. And we have to thank the media industry for that. It stirs people up. Gossip and dirty laundry. Dark news that depresses and horrifies you.

On the other hand, gospel news is exemplary. It can give you courage. You can pace your life accordingly, or try to, anyway. And you can do it with honour and principles. There are theories of truth in gospel but to most people it’s unimportant. Their lives are lived out too fast. Too many bad influences. Sex and politics and murder is the way to go if you want to get people’s attention. It excites us, that’s our problem.

Little Richard was a great gospel singer. But I think he was looked at as an outsider or an interloper in the gospel world. They didn’t accept him there. And of course the rock ‘n’ roll world wanted to keep him singing “Good Golly, Miss Molly.” So his gospel music wasn’t accepted in either world. I think the same thing happened to Sister Rosetta Tharpe. I can’t imagine either of them being bothered too much about it. Both are what we used to call people of high character. Genuine, plenty talented and who knew themselves, weren’t swayed by anything from the outside. Little Richard, I know was like that.

But so was Robert Johnson, even more so. Robert was one of the most inventive geniuses of all time. But he probably had no audience to speak of. He was so far ahead of his time that we still haven’t caught up with him. His status today couldn’t be any higher. Yet in his day, his songs must have confused people. It just goes to show you that great people follow their own path.

On the album “Tempest” you perform “Roll on John” as a tribute to John Lennon. Is there another person you’d like to write a ballad for?

Those kinds of songs for me just come out of the blue, out of thin air. I never plan to write any of them. But in saying that, there are certain public figures that are just in your subconscious for one reason or another. None of those songs with designated names are intentionally written. They just fall down from space. I’m just as bewildered as anybody else as to why I write them. The folk tradition has a long history of songs about people, though. John Henry, Mr. Garfield, Roosevelt. I guess I’m just locked into that tradition.

You honour many great recording artists in your songs. Your mention of Don Henley and Glenn Frey on “Murder Most Foul” came off as a bit of a surprise to me. What Eagles songs do you enjoy the most?

“New Kid in Town,” “Life in the Fast Lane,” “Pretty Maids All in a Row.” That could be one of the best songs ever.

You also refer to Art Pepper, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz in “Murder Most Foul.” How has jazz inspired you as a songwriter and poet over your long career? Are there jazz artists you’ve been listening to lately?

Maybe Miles’s early stuff on Capitol Records. But what’s jazz? Dixieland, bebop, high-speed fusion? What do you call jazz? Is it Sonny Rollins? I like Sonny’s calypso stuff but is that jazz? Jo Stafford, Joni James, Kay Starr — I think they were all jazz singers. King Pleasure, that’s my idea of a jazz singer. I don’t know, you can put anything into that category. Jazz goes back to the Roaring Twenties. Paul Whiteman was called the king of jazz. I’m sure if you asked Lester Young he wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.

Has any of it ever inspired me? Well yeah. Probably a lot. Ella Fitzgerald as a singer inspires me. Oscar Peterson as a piano player, absolutely. Has any of it inspired me as a songwriter? Yeah, “Ruby, My Dear” by Monk. That song set me off in some direction to do something along those lines. I remember listening to that over and over.

What role does improvisation play in your music?

None at all. There’s no way you can change the nature of a song once you’ve invented it. You can set different guitar or piano patterns upon the structural lines and go from there, but that’s not improvisation. Improvisation leaves you open to good or bad performances and the idea is to stay consistent. You basically play the same thing time after time in the most perfect way you can.

“I Contain Multitudes” is surprisingly autobiographical in parts. The last two verses exude a take-no-prisoners stoicism while the rest of the song is a humorous confessional. Did you have fun grappling with contradictory impulses of yourself and human nature in general?

I didn’t really have to grapple much. It’s the kind of thing where you pile up stream-of-consciousness verses and then leave it alone and come pull things out. In that particular song, the last few verses came first. So that’s where the song was going all along. Obviously, the catalyst for the song is the title line. It’s one of those where you write it on instinct. Kind of in a trance state. Most of my recent songs are like that. The lyrics are the real thing, tangible, they’re not metaphors. The songs seem to know themselves and they know that I can sing them, vocally and rhythmically. They kind of write themselves and count on me to sing them.

Once again in this song you name a lot of people. What made you decide to mention Anne Frank next to Indiana Jones?

Her story means a lot. It’s profound. And hard to articulate or paraphrase, especially in modern culture. Everybody’s got such a short attention span. But you’re taking Anne’s name out of context, she’s part of a trilogy. You could just as well ask, “What made you decide to include Indiana Jones or the Rolling Stones?” The names themselves are not solitary. It’s the combination of them that adds up to something more than their singular parts. To go too much into detail is irrelevant. The song is like a painting, you can’t see it all at once if you’re standing too close. The individual pieces are just part of a whole.

“I Contain Multitudes” is more like trance writing. Well, it’s not more like trance writing, it is trance writing. It’s the way I actually feel about things. It is my identity and I’m not going to question it, I am in no position to. Every line has a particular purpose. Somewhere in the universe those three names must have paid a price for what they represent and they’re locked together. And I can hardly explain that. Why or where or how, but those are the facts.

But Indiana Jones was a fictional character?

Yeah, but the John Williams score brought him to life. Without that music it wouldn’t have been much of a movie. It’s the music which makes Indy come alive. So that maybe is one of the reasons he is in the song. I don’t know, all three names came at once.

A reference to the Rolling Stones makes it into “I Contain Multitudes.” Just as a lark, which Stones songs do you wish you could’ve written?

Oh, I don’t know, maybe “Angie,” “Ventilator Blues” and what else, let me see. Oh yeah, “Wild Horses.”

Charlie Sexton began playing with you for a few years in 1999, and returned to the fold in 2009. What makes him such a special player? It’s as if you can read each other’s minds.

As far as Charlie goes, he can read anybody’s mind. Charlie, though, creates songs and sings them as well, and he can play guitar to beat the band. There aren’t any of my songs that Charlie doesn’t feel part of and he’s always played great with me. “False Prophet” is only one of three 12-bar structural things on this record. Charlie is good on all the songs. He’s not a show-off guitar player, although he can do that if he wants. He’s very restrained in his playing but can be explosive when he wants to be. It’s a classic style of playing. Very old school. He inhabits a song rather than attacking it. He’s always done that with me.

How have you spent the last couple of months home-sheltered in Malibu? Have you been able to weld or paint?

Yeah, a little bit.

Are you able to be musically creative while at home? Do you play piano and tool around in your private studio?

I do that mostly in hotel rooms. A hotel room is the closest I get to a private studio.

Does having the Pacific Ocean in your backyard help you process the COVID-19 pandemic in a spiritual way? There is a theory called “blue mind” which believes that living near water is a health curative.

Yeah, I can believe that. “Cool Water,” “Many Rivers to Cross,” “How Deep Is the Ocean.” I hear any of those songs and it’s like some kind of cure. I don’t know what for, but a cure for something that I don’t even know I have. A fix of some kind. It’s like a spiritual thing. Water is a spiritual thing. I never heard of “blue mind” before. Sounds like it could be some kind of slow blues song. Something Van Morrison would write. Maybe he has, I don’t know.

It’s too bad that just when the play “Girl From the North Country,” which features your music, was getting rave reviews, production had to shutter because of COVID-19. Have you seen the play or watched the video of it?

Sure, I’ve seen it and it affected me. I saw it as an anonymous spectator, not as someone who had anything to do with it. I just let it happen. The play had me crying at the end. I can’t even say why. When the curtain came down, I was stunned. I really was. Too bad Broadway shut down because I wanted to see it again.

Do you think of this pandemic in almost biblical terms? A plague that has swept the land?

I think it’s a forerunner of something else to come. It’s an invasion for sure, and it’s widespread, but biblical? You mean like some kind of warning sign for people to repent of their wrongdoings? That would imply that the world is in line for some sort of divine punishment. Extreme arrogance can have some disastrous penalties. Maybe we are on the eve of destruction. There are numerous ways you can think about this virus. I think you just have to let it run its course.

Out of all your compositions, “When I Paint My Masterpiece” has grown on me over the years. What made you bring it back to the forefront of recent concerts?

It’s grown on me as well. I think this song has something to do with the classical world, something that’s out of reach. Someplace you’d like to be beyond your experience. Something that is so supreme and first rate that you could never come back down from the mountain. That you’ve achieved the unthinkable. That’s what the song tries to say, and you’d have to put it in that context. In saying that though, even if you do paint your masterpiece, what will you do then? Well, obviously you have to paint another masterpiece. So it could become some kind of never ending cycle, a trap of some kind. The song doesn’t say that though.

A few years ago I saw you play a bluegrass-sounding version of “Summer Days.” Have you ever thought about recording a bluegrass album?

I’ve never thought about that. Bluegrass music is mysterious and deep rooted and you almost have to be born playing it. Just because you are a great singer, or a great this or that doesn’t mean you can be in a bluegrass band. It’s almost like classical music. It’s harmonic and meditative, but it’s out for blood. If you ever heard the Osborne Brothers, then you know what I mean. It’s an unforgiving music and you can only it stretch so far. Beatles songs played in a bluegrass style don’t make any sense. It’s the wrong repertoire, and that’s been done. There are elements of bluegrass music for sure in what I play, especially the intensity and similar themes. But I don’t have the high tenor voice and we don’t have three-part harmony or consistent banjo. I listen to Bill Monroe a lot, but I more or less stick to what I can do best.

How is your health holding up? You seem to be fit as a fiddle. How do you keep mind and body working together in unison?

Oh, that’s the big question, isn’t it? How does anybody do it? Your mind and body go hand in hand. There has to be some kind of agreement. I like to think of the mind as spirit and the body as substance. How you integrate those two things, I have no idea. I just try to go on a straight line and stay on it, stay on the level.

Read', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"Authorities planned Friday to renew the search for “Glee” star Naya Rivera, who is believed to have drowned in a Southern California lake while boating with her four-year-old son.

Rivera, 33, disappeared after renting the pontoon boat for three hours Wednesday afternoon and taking it out on Lake Piru in Ventura County, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday.

The lake an hour’s drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of people, most of them divers, with help from helicopters, drones and all-terrain vehicles. The search to recover Rivera’s body continued into the night Thursday before ending for that day.

The area where the boat was found is about nine metres deep. Murky waters heavy with plants made it difficult for divers to see more than about a foot ahead of them, sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said Thursday.

“If the body is entangled on something beneath the water, it may never come back up,” Donoghue said.

Rivera played Santana Lopez, a singing cheerleader in 113 episodes of the musical-comedy “Glee,” which aired on Fox from 2009 until 2015. She also had recurring roles on “The Bernie Mac Show” and “The Royal Family.”

Rivera, a Los Angeles resident, had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, Donoghue said.

Surveillance video taken at about 1 p.m. Wednesday shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn’t, according to a sheriff’s office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest and another life-jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera’s purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera’s son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

She called the boy, her only child, “my greatest success, and I will never do any better than him” in her 2016 memoir “Sorry Not Sorry.”

The most recent tweet on Rivera’s account, from Tuesday, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

It appeared increasingly likely she would become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Read', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.']",2020-07-09,"Jean Smart, a veteran of “Designing Women,” “24” and “Fargo” among many other projects, has most recently added HBO’s “Watchmen” to her list of credits. The limited series, created by Damon Lindelof and based on a graphic novel, is set in an alternate history where masked vigilantes go after criminals decades after the actual Tulsa race massacre in 1921.

Smart plays Laurie Blake, a reformed vigilante turned no-nonsense FBI agent who has some internal conflicts of her own. “You’ve got to see so much of her public and totally private moments. It really was a gift as an actor,” Smart says of the series.

In this excerpt from the “Can’t Stop Watching” podcast, she also fills us in on a recent “Designing Women” reunion and shares some details about what she has coming up next.

Q: Laurie Blake is called in to Tulsa to investigate the death of Police Chief Jed Crawford. How much did you know about the story and the real-world massacre of Black citizens in Tulsa?

A: I knew nothing about that. It was shocking to me, shocking that I had never heard of it. And my father was a history teacher. It’s astonishing to think how prophetic the show was in a way, because first with the coronavirus and the idea that something happened that gave the entire world a common enemy and that that would help bring peace if we had something big to fight together. But then it was set against a historical event of unbelievable brutality against the Black community. It’s just incredible that Damon wrote that right before all of this happened, right before.

Q: What was your crash course into the world of “Watchmen?”

A: I went out for martinis with one of the writers and she gave me a lot of information about Laura’s background, her family and her relationships, because I knew nothing about it. “Watchmen” wasn’t something that my son had been into when he was growing up. I always feel like research is good. Just to a point, I mean, it was actually very valuable to know about her parents and her personal relationships. But research only goes so far. You have to base it really on the script.

Q: So much of what’s going on in the news right now is explored in the series: racism, cop culture, leadership. And fear — of fellow citizens or the use of fear to control.

A: We were doing the show in the time of our present administration, which is to say, that seems to be their tactic for everything. If you find out what people are afraid of, they have used that to get voters to come to their side. My character, she obviously has come to hate vigilantes. You know, she’s not a person necessarily to hold up as an example. She’s not the most ethical law enforcement person. She certainly doesn’t believe in people taking things into their own hands.

Q: Well, how is it to be part of art that takes on subject matter like this head-on?

A: Oh, it’s great. This is what actors crave. I mean, yes, sometimes you want to do stuff that’s just fun and just entertainment. But there was a quote from an actor a long time ago that said, “As an actor, if you want to believe that you can affect people in your audience in a good way, in a positive way, open their eyes to something.”

You also have to accept the fact that you can be a negative influence as well. You have to make your own personal wise choices about the kind of material you do. So you get to do something like “Watchmen,” it’s extremely rewarding. And it was nice that the audience responded the way it did. Of course, we had no idea what was coming. Like I said, it’s prophetic to an alarming degree. We had no idea about the pandemic. We had no idea how the race relations were going to come to a head in 2020.

Q: Your “Watchmen” character’s pining for somebody who’s been living on another planet for 30 years. How do you find the truth in that?

A: Good question! That says a lot about her. Then she finds out that he is living here with another woman. She thinks that she’s kind of got it all together, but she’s really kind of a mess. And she tells Angela (Regina King) that, you know, you don’t strike me as the kind of person who has friends. I’m thinking just look in the mirror! She’s living alone, in an apartment with an owl and has a closet full of black pantsuits and no social life whatsoever. She’s in love with a man who likes shoes. Like you said, she hasn’t seen in 30 years. And another guy who’s in prison. A shrink would have a field day with her.

Q: Sony has a YouTube channel called Throwback TV, and they have been getting together shows that are no longer on the air, like “Designing Women,” and having the actors do a remote table read of one of the scripts. How was that?

A: Delta (Burke) was not able to participate. She’s taking care of her mother. And unfortunately, we don’t have darling Dixie Carter. We read the pilot script. You would not have thought that 30 years have gone by for Annie (Potts). I mean, we just felt like we were right back there. It was just so much fun. It was weird not having an audience laughing, but it was really fun.

Q: What were you working on before stay-at-home orders from the pandemic?

A: I actually just got a deal producing a movie that I might also be in for Amblin. It is a combination of somewhat topical and also very uplifting and entertaining, hopefully a working title as “Miss Macy.” I hope it turns into something in the way that we envision it right now. I’m also in the middle of another one, a miniseries with Kate Winslet. And it’s been such an amazing time. I love Kate and I play her mother. They live together and they can’t stand each other. And they’re very blue-collar South Philly. I look forward to getting back to it. I’m not quite sure when we will.

Q: What are you watching while at home?

A: My guilty pleasure is HDTV. “Fixer Upper,” my relationship with my husband is sort of like their relationship. Also, I’ve recently discovered “Flea Market Flip.” I really desperately want to be on that show.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Gary Gerard Hamiltonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Gary Gerard Hamiltonthe Associated Presswed.']",2020-07-08,"NEW YORK—Though it shares a title with her major label debut album, Sara Bareilles isn’t exactly telling her own story in the new streaming series “Little Voice.”

The Grammy Award-winner says the Apple TV+ show incorporates experiences of many striving artists while reflecting the diversity of its New York City setting.

“There are moments that are more inspired by my life rather than it being any sort of recreation of my journey.” Bareilles said. “This is an amalgamation of so many of the struggles that I’ve seen.”

The show from Bareilles, producer J.J. Abrams and writer-director Jessie Nelson follows a young singer named Bess King (Brittany O’Grady) as she navigates life and love while attempting to pursue her musical dreams.

It’s the first foray into television for both Bareilles and Nelson, who worked together on the Broadway musical “Waitress.” Bareilles said both want to keep making “hopeful art.”

“I love that Jessie and I both are very committed to making hopeful art — art that has a lot of heart and a lot of kindness and a lot of hope sort of woven into what we create,” said Bareilles. “It’s nice to be able to get an opportunity to tell stories about characters who are messy and make mistakes and are flawed and certainly are not perfect people, but that, in essence, are good people and they try to be good.”

Bareilles relished the novel experience of working in TV.

“I got to learn so much from this,” she said. “I felt very much like a newbie stepping in. They had to tell me, ‘Don’t stand in front of the lights on the set.’ I was like, ’Oh, my bad, my bad!”

Bareilles wrote original music for “Little Voice” and helped direct musical performances from O’Grady, who previously appeared on the musical series “Star.” The first three of 10 episodes premiere Friday.

Nelson, who directed five episodes, said that while the series comes at a time when Hollywood is working to amplify under-represented voices, diversity came naturally to this production.

“We really wanted to write a love letter to the music of New York, and if you’re going to do that authentically, you’re just organically going to have a diverse cast,” she said.

O’Grady praised the “true diversity” she encountered on set.

“You have the scenes in the retirement home: we had actors in their 90s on the set. We have actors who are on the spectrum. We have actors who are Black, white, Hispanic,” she said. “I think that it’s just an honest portrayal of what the real world is. So that makes me happy.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Gregory Strongthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Gregory Strongthe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-07-02,"In the new season of the documentary/reality TV show “Queen of the Oil Patch,” two-spirit Indigenous entrepreneur Massey Whiteknife embarks on an introspective, healing journey.

Whiteknife is a businessman in the northern Alberta oilsands and also a glamorous female recording artist known as “Iceis Rain.”

In season 2, which airs Sundays on APTN, Whiteknife moves to Edmonton and works on his mental health, while Ices Rain is curbing the clubbing lifestyle to focus on her next album.

The Canadian Press recently spoke with Whiteknife by phone from Edmonton to discuss the show and current events.

CP: What are you most proud of when it comes to season 2?

Whiteknife: There’s so many amazing moments but I like the fact that I was able to be exactly who I am and I didn’t have to face any scrutiny or anybody that was very aggressive in the process of filming, which was actually quite shocking. The camera crew was worried for me to dress up as Iceis Rain and walk down the street in daylight. They were scared because they thought, ‘Oh my God, what if somebody comes and gay-bashes you or what if somebody throws something at you?’ I would tell them, ‘Do you see the way you guys are feeling right now because you’re with me? That’s how me and my people — the (LGBTQ) people and the Indigenous people — feel every single time we walk out our door.’ That to them was just like — what a wake-up call. For you guys to have to feel this fear every day. It’s stressful. So for me, I told them this is why I’m doing what I’m doing. This is why I tell you guys no holds barred. Show everything in the show because I want people to see the successes that I have been able to achieve but I also want you guys to show the failures and the struggles that I also have to face every day.

CP: Have you faced discrimination in the oil patch and have you noticed more acceptance in the region since the show started?

Whiteknife: The way I came out was I did an anti-bullying show in Fort McMurray. I asked the companies that I work for if they would sponsor the event. When they found out what kind of event I was actually doing — like dressing up in drag and I was going to have drag queens — they didn’t care that the money I was raising was going to non-profit organizations, they cared about the fact that their name was going to be associated with somebody that was not only gay, but dressed up as a female. And I lost 10 of my largest clients. They just flat out told me, they said, ‘We are not going to be associated with this. We’re sorry but we’re cutting your contract.’ That started the struggle for me and Iceis and my company. I just said, ‘OK, well you know what, I don’t want to work with people like that anyway.’ Then when I did do the anti-bullying show, the local newspaper had put a thing on it and I ended up getting like 25 new clients because of it.

CP: Can entertainment serve as a blueprint to help people, especially in marginalized communities, cope through times of hardship?

Whiteknife: I think so. A perfect example, take for instance, Hollywood. If you look back in the day, the big movie companies wouldn’t allow to have a Black screenwriter. They wouldn’t allow to have a Black actress in a leading role and it wasn’t until one person finally stood up and said, ‘I’m the executive of this production company and we are going to have a Black lead actress.’ And it ruffled a lot of feathers in Hollywood. Just like in the oil sands, they’re like, ‘We’re not going to allow a female business owner run the company. We’re not going to have a female tell the men, the union people, what to do.’

But it wasn’t until somebody actually does it that people will start to calm down and realize that it’s no big deal and that we’re just human beings. Life goes on and we all have to face the same challenges of bidding, contracts, negotiations and profit margin.

CP: How much has the conversation changed on the anti-Indigenous racism front in the wake of recent examples of police brutality around the world?

Whiteknife: What I’ve noticed just personally in being here in Alberta is that there was a lot of vocal haters. There was a lot of people that were saying, especially to my friend, Chief Allan Adam, there was a lot of people that were coming forward saying he deserved it or he provoked it or that wasn’t racism. It’s that sort of ignorance that to me, left me shaking my head. How could somebody, by tackling another person to the ground and bashing their face in like that, be justifiable in any circumstance? That’s the kind of conversations that go on over here that we have to face. It’s sad but it is real.

CP: In season 2, the show’s protagonist deals with a self-improvement journey. Given the challenges in the world right now and many people looking within to be better versions of themselves, is that a topic that more people can relate to?

Whiteknife: Yes, absolutely. 100 per cent. Because right now it’s a struggle for me. I am open about my addictions on the show. I suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction and gambling. A lot of that stems from the sexual abuse that I endured when I was a child. The bottle kind of helped me cope. It didn’t really help me though. It just made things worse. But right now with COVID, having to be isolated, there’s no resources available at all. I want to go to an AA meeting when I’m feeling like I’m going to fall off. Or that I’m feeling this stinking thinking where, ‘Right now a bottle of gin would be perfect.’ I don’t have the opportunity right now to go to an AA meeting because of social distancing and because they were all shut down. I pray every night for my people because there are a lot of people right now that have internet that could go online and that can take an AA meeting. But there’s people that depended on those meetings to go to that were in smaller communities that don’t know how to use the internet or don’t have access to the internet. So it is really hard.

The women of Netflix’s version totally get it,"['Yvonne Villarreal', 'Yvyvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.']",2020-07-02,"Countless women who came of age in the 1980s and ’90s have memories of “The Baby-Sitters Club” books that provoke a nostalgic, pastel-hued wave of heart-eyed emojis.

Rachel Shukert, a producer and writer known for her work on “GLOW” and “Supergirl,” received the first book as a birthday present. Scanning the description on the back cover, Shukert, then in elementary school, wasn’t all that intrigued. But one uneventful afternoon she finally cracked open “The Ghost at Dawn’s House,” book No. 9 in the series, clutching the ends of its warm, peach-toned cover with the same steady grip of a kid today clinging to a tablet. She was hooked.

An entire shelf inside her bubblegum-pink room at her family home in Omaha, Nebraska, was eventually jammed with the recognizable rainbow block of spines (“I kept them very separate and special from all the other books,” Shukert, now 40, says. “The shelf would get bigger and bigger since there were more and more books.”) During recess at Friedel Jewish Academy, on a knoll out of ear shot of the school, she and her friends would talk about the book series, trade copies and sometimes pretend to be the characters.

Growing up in a suburb of Springfield, Mass., Lucia Aniello, best known for her work on Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” vividly remembers how her insatiable appetite for the book series resulted in stacks of free pizza certificates as part of Pizza Hut’s Book It program, which rewarded kids for reading. (”My parents owned a pizza restaurant, so I couldn’t use them,” Aniello, 37, notes with a laugh. “I actually ended up kind of becoming popular and I would hand out free pizza slips because I had no use for them.”)

Still fresh is Aniello’s memory of lying in the family’s backyard hammock as a kid, reading book after book until the moon nudged the sun away.

Decades after those formative years reading about the plucky, ragtag group of middle-school babysitters in fictional Stoneybrook in the book series launched by author Ann M. Martin in 1986, Aniello and Shukert are now responsible for translating the franchise’s binge-reading power into a TV series for the streaming generation. (Shukert is the showrunner, while Aniello serves as a director and executive producer.)

Premiering Friday, the 10-episode reboot opens with a modern wink to an origin story as important to some as Spider-Man’s or Batman’s. Sporty seventh grader Kristy Thomas (Sophie Grace) watches as her single mom, Elizabeth (Alicia Silverstone), is in need of a sitter to watch her youngest son. Elizabeth huffs about young people these days being hard to get in touch with, as well as the high fees of internet-based babysitting services: “When I was a kid, my mother would just call some girl in the neighbourhood on a landline,” she says. “And she would answer, because it was part of the social contract.”

Kristy’s great idea is born: a babysitting club.

She enlists her shy bestie Mary Anne Spier (Malia Baker) as secretary, their artistic friend and neighbour Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada) as vice-president, fashionable new girl from New York City, Stacey McGill (Shay Rudolph) as treasurer and eventually, environmentally conscious California transplant Dawn Schafer (Xochitl Gomez) as an alternate officer. (Claudia also serves as the resident BSC host because she has a phone — one of those now-vintage transparent landlines with brightly-colored hardware — in her room.)

“When I saw them all together for the first time, that was one of the top five moments of my life,” Shukert says. “Maybe ahead of my wedding, but after having my son.” The way she speaks with reverence about the series, it’s easy to believe she isn’t joking.

That adoration, steeped in childhood memories untouched by the corrosion of time, made for a surreal adaptation process. Shukert says rereading the original book series, which ran until 2000 and has sold more than 180 million copies, she was struck by how she remembered very specific details — like Stacey painting her toenails with pink polish accented by a green dot or Claudia having white tights with plaits all over them or how Eleanor Marshall, one of the kids the girls babysit, was allergic to strawberries. But what came more sharply into focus was how the girls’ environment and experiences shaped how they navigated the world. She points to Kristy as an example.

“She is viewed as being bossy and controlling and has to have all the ideas, and she’s such a leader,” Shukert says. “And then you think about Kristy in a kind of emotional context and she’s this kid whose dad walked out on her when she was, like, six years old and never called her and had no contact with her family. Her mom has done this on her own. And you’re like, of course she’s controlling. She needs to control her environment because her early life lacks a lot of control. I think I sort of didn’t see that as a kid, because why would you?”

In her early 30s when tapped to write the original book series, Martin has watched the literary saga get a Hollywood filter before. HBO had a short-lived adaptation in 1990 and there was a 1995 feature film, which starred ’90s all-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Larisa Oleynik, that grossed less than $10 million (U.S.). Martin said it was important for her to be involved with the Netflix series, story-wise, from the beginning. She read scripts, offering the occasional note. (For example, in the sixth episode, Claudia’s grandmother Mimi mentions she doesn’t like peaches because she associates them with trauma in her childhood. Martin reminded Shukert that Claudia has an aunt named Peaches who is introduced in book No. 47.) She also visited the show’s set in Vancouver.

“I was just desperate for her approval,” says Shukert, who adds that she received a signed copy of her favourite book in the series, “Little Miss Stoneybrook ... and Dawn,” from Martin during production. “She’s such a huge figure in the lives of many women my age. It was kind of overwhelming.”

“I had a sort of ‘I’m not worthy,’ ‘Wayne’s World’-type response to her,” is how Aniello describes it.

The Netflix series manages to evoke a certain time-capsule quality — it’s infused with the books’ signature sherbet colour palette and the girls’ wardrobe seems yanked straight off the book covers — while also feeling current. Shukert and Aniello felt strongly that the girls should feel like an updated version of their literary counterparts, particularly when they’re using cellphones, without diluting their essence.

“It’s definitely for today’s viewers,” Martin, now 64, says over the phone from her home in upstate New York. “But I think it still retains all the parts of the (book) series that young kids fell in love with 35 years ago. Just listening to the things that the characters care about, looking at the way that they’re dressed, how they interact with each other. It’s my girls.”

That remains true even as the group became more diverse onscreen: Mary Anne is biracial, Claudia’s Japanese heritage comes more sharply into view and Dawn is Latinx.

“The series from the beginning has been about inclusivity,” Martin says. “We wanted to have a diverse cast of characters. So some of the characters have changed a little bit and I hope any kid who watches the show will find themselves when they see this Stoneybrook and the characters.”

A fundamental principal both Shukert and Aniello felt strongly about was infusing the young characters with as much dimension as they’ve given to the adult characters they’ve shaped on “GLOW” and “Broad City,” without sacrificing the angst of middle-school growing pains.

“I feel like ‘GLOW’ and ‘The Baby-Sitters Club’ share a lot of DNA, honestly,” says Shukert, while revealing that “GLOW’s” Dawn (Rebekka Johnson) and Stacey (Kimmy Gatewood) are named after “The Baby-Sitters Club” characters. “It’s this group of women, or girls, who are very different from one another, who come from different backgrounds, and they’re coming together with this shared vision of creating something larger than themselves and being something greater, and finding their power in each other.”

Adds Aniello: “We really wanted to make something for young girls that treated them like real people that weren’t glossy in any way. ‘Freaks and Geeks’ was a show we talked a lot about, how they felt as fully fleshed out as adult characters, they just happened to be younger.”

Simon & Schuster, 440 pages, $39.99

By this point in his career, Stephen King knows that the legions of loyal readers he addresses in his author’s notes will read anything he puts out. That he has continued to push his work into new territory only proves that he is a far more serious and “literary” author than his critics give him credit for. “If It Bleeds” is a kind of “odds and sods” of King’s latest shorter fictions, though the title piece, at just under 200 pages, could have been published as a novel. “If It Bleeds” features one of King’s favourite supporting characters, Holly Gibney, the tenacious private detective of the Mister Mercedes trilogy and “The Outsider,” here elevated to main-character status for the first time. The other novellas/long stories move nimbly between genres and tones, often in the same work, proving that King still has plenty of gas left in the tank — good news for us loyal readers.

From the Wreck by Jane Rawson

Picador, 272 pages, $19.99

In 1859, the passenger steamship “Admella” struck a submerged reef off the South Australia coast, a disaster that claimed the lives of most of those on board. Author Jane Rawson was researching the life of George Hills, an ancestor who survived the sinking, when she began to spin the incident into a fabulist story of a shape-shifting alien who saves Hills from drowning. “From the Wreck” follows Hills from the night before the sinking (he was a ship’s steward) to his troubled life as a disaster survivor haunted by his encounter with the otherworldly presence. A first-rate and deeply humane blend of historical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi and horror.

The Ghost in the House by Sara O’Leary

Doubleday, 190 pages, $22.95

This compact, eerie novel dives deep inside the metaphor of the ghost, a restless spirit bound to an earthbound location, by artfully employing a first-person ghost as narrator. Fay wakes up just before dawn lying on top of a piano, dressed in one of her husband’s shirts. Assuming she passed out drunk the night before, Fay wanders her dark Vancouver home trying to find her bedroom. Time seems to cut out and Fay is standing at the top of the stairs watching a girl she’s never seen before walking down the hallway. Thinking that she must be seeing a ghost, Fay soon realizes that she is the ghost. “The Ghost in the House” is short-story and children’s author Sara O’Leary’s debut novel. It may not satisfy some straight-up horror fans, but there is plenty here to haunt the imagination.

Home Before Dark by Riley Sager

Dutton, 400 pages, $36

In 2017, Riley Sager, the pseudonym for author and editor Todd Ritter, hit the bestseller lists with “Final Girls,” a fierce postmodern twist on the hoary horror trope (a “final girl” is the last woman standing in an ’80s slasher film). In “Home Before Dark,” Sager explores the dilemma of a different kind of survivor. Maggie Holt was only five when her family fled a haunted country manor house called Baneberry Hall after a mere 20 days of occupancy. Since then, Maggie’s life has been defined by the bestselling memoir her father wrote about the experience. When her father dies, she is shocked to discover that she has inherited Baneberry Hall and, despite her mother’s and father’s warnings, Maggie returns to the house to confront her past. Maggie is at times too much the Strong Female Protagonist, now a thriller/horror cliché in its own right, but “Home Before Dark” is a smart, page-turning work with special appeal for readers who, like me, love the haunted house sub-genre.

He has patkas for every occasion. When his mom gets a new job in a very snowy town, Harpreet starts wearing only white paktas because he is sad and wants to be invisible.

Not My Idea: A Book about Whiteness

By Anastasia Higginbotham

Dottir Press, 64 pages, $28.50

“Not My Idea: A Book about Whiteness” explores white privilege and racism in an age appropriate way. It emphasizes the need to have these conversations with children, highlights everyday examples of differential treatment many black and racialized people experience and calls for actions that support racial justice. It disrupts ideas of colour blindness and shows us how we can move beyond simply teaching children to be kind. Children learn that even though these are big systemic issues, they can have an impact and work to make things fair for all.

Going Up

By Sherry J. Lee, illus. by Charlene Chua

Kids Can Press, 40 pages, $19.99

“Going Up” is a fun and creative story. It takes place in an apartment building and readers meet residents of various identities, abilities and lived experiences as they “go up” to a birthday party on the 10th floor. At each floor the elevator becomes more crowded but the excitement and happiness connects everyone. The word choice and illustrations gently disrupt the many stereotypes associated with various identities. Readers learn about the importance of building a community where all people are respected for their differences and feel a sense of belonging.

You Matter

By Christian Robinson

Atheneum Books for Young Readers, 60 pages, $23.99

“You Matter” is a beautiful story that teaches us that, old or young, we matter and are connected. An important story because sometimes our identities can make us feel excluded, ignored and silenced. A great way to send the message that we “see” people in our communities, value them and acknowledge their different experiences. It is powerful to be “seen” completely for who we are and to know that we are respected and loved for all parts of ourselves. A very affirming story that reinforces our importance and self worth.

Read', 'Deirdre Baker Is The Author Of', 'Becca Fair', 'Foul.', 'Deirdre Baker Special To The Starfri.']",2020-06-26,"Summer is here and stories about the outdoors are apt, but under Covid-19, what do they mean?

Deborah Underwood’s “Outside In”, illustrated by Cindy Derby (Harcourt Houghton Mifflin, 32 pages, $24.99, ages 3-7), resonates even in the shadow of lockdown. “Once we were part of Outside and Outside was part of us,” begins this story aimed to tempt kids to explore nature. Instead, Underwood’s take on Outside shows ways nature reaches indoors — through sunlight, our clothes, even the water gushing from our taps. We might forget we’re part of nature, but Outside reminds us. A wonderfully perceptive mix of poetry, art, and environmental awareness.

Akiko Miyakoshi’s “I Dream of a Journey” (Kids Can, 32 pages, $18.99, ages 3-7) suits Covid-19 shut-in fatigue. “In my dreams I set off on a journey …” says a bear hotelier, and he dreams of travelling to places his guests have been, to beaches and windswept dunes. When he wakes from his colour-filled sleep, he’s back in his own hotel. There’s something eerie yet familiar in Miyakoshi’s muted art, the bear’s timid wanderlust, and travel that can happen only in dreams.

Deborah Hodge celebrates the real “Outside” in “West Coast Wild Babies,” with lose-yourself-in-them illustrations by Karen Reczuch (Groundwood, 32 pages, $19.95, ages 3-6). In simple language Hodge describes some of the Pacific coast’s many baby creatures — gray wolves, orcas, harbour seals, oystercatchers and more. Reczuch’s pellucid colours show the scene with idealized serenity (no “graveyard of the Pacific” tumult here), heightening natural beauty, baby life and security.

Ibram Kendi’s “Antiracist Baby,” illustrated by Ashley Lukashevsky (Kokila, 24 pages, $11.99, all ages), brings the vital issue of antiracism to babies and all readers in a jaunty, challenging board book. Here are nine clear steps to acting for and practicing racial equity. Kendi’s words are few but his content is deep: “open your eyes to all skin colours … use your words to talk about race …” With its acknowledgement that “Antiracist Baby is bred, not born,” this timely book can be a first step in discussing our own society.

Andrea Curtis explores nature in urban spaces in “A Forest in the City,” illustrated by Pierre Pratt (Groundwood, 40 pages, $19.95, ages 10 and up). In a direct, informative text, she tells us of urban trees and the perils posed by city soil, pollution, and neighbourly peccadilloes. Pratt’s illustrations balance the staid text with playfulness and humour, showing trees’ glorious greenery among and around humans’ busy ways. Pratt’s art conveys the joie-de-vivre trees bring; Curtis’s text provides the science.

In Rebecca Stead’s “The List of Things That Will Not Change” (Wendy Lamb, 224 pages, $22.99, ages 10-14), set in New York, Bea tells the story of her father’s wedding to his gay partner. To do it, she takes us back to the time of her parents’ divorce, her ensuing life in two homes, her bad spelling, and her efforts to befriend her step-sister. Stead is a marvel at ravelling up her tale through interlocking pieces, past and present, and here she’s at her best. Bea’s slow revelation of what’s in her heart happens with colourful, precise incident, each page deepening emotional intensity.

First Nations sleuths the “Mighty Muskrats” travel from their reservation to the city in Michael Hutchinson’s “The Case of the Missing Auntie” (Second Story, 181 pages, $10.95, ages 8-13). While they contend with city ways, they try to find out what happened to Grandpa’s sister, scooped by the government and adopted years ago. This quick, engaging mystery (indeed, the series) is a real gift to Canadian readers, most particularly for the Indigenous familial culture and social and historical realities it portrays.

A strong sense of place and down-to-earth narrator characterize Riel Nason’s “Waiting Under Water” (Scholastic, 216 pages, $8.99, ages 9-12). Loving her home on the Bay of Fundy, Hope is terrified when her family decides to move to Toronto. Her nervous tic worsens as departure day approaches, and in a refreshing plot twist, her parents change their plans.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s abundant, highly decorated, and unafraid of extravagance, of stylistic excess: “The Mairs, the Mairs — what were they and why on earth? I have been collecting eccentric trueborn Nova Scotians my entire life but none compare, pound for pound, person for person, with the Titus Mairs of Tower Road. The Maritime provinces of Canada are saturated generally with peculiars — drunks, pundits, misfits, masterminds — but the Mairs were the oddest on record, functioning in the years of my childhood on an almost mythopoeic level.”

That unrestrained nature extends to size itself: nearly 400 pages, “Aubrey McKee” ends with “End Book One”; another four volumes will complete the series.

A book composed of fourteen exuberant, freewheeling stories, each focused on a peculiar “peculiar,” “Aubrey McKee” has “the insanity of being human” as a general theme. More specifically, this coming of age story also operates as a love letter, of a sour-sweet sort, to home. That’s Halifax, “a shabby little city … worn stale and flat in detail,” in the view of one source mentioned by the narrator, and an “evil village” and a place “obsessed with itself,” in the words of narrator Aubrey McKee’s sisters.

Whether he’s recalling his phase as “an indiscriminate teenage joiner” or as a marijuana salesman in the mid-1970s, Alex Pugsley’s narrator writes from the point of a man well settled into middle age who’s seeking lost time, place, and meaning. He says as much: “I have done by my to recover those moments, to display them as best I could and to display the mysteries — and people — who were to me the city’s truths.”

While McKee (who, like Pugsley, seems to have been born in 1963) can evaluate an incident in literary terms — as “a fantasia on Maritime themes — brilliancy, loss, nostalgia decay,” for example — he also conjures with fantastic, captivating detail a youth where parents, siblings, friends, and school jostle alongside episodes of municipal history (itself teeming with bootleggers, drug dealers, suicides, sanatorium habitués, eccentric scions of formerly grand families, and brothel keepers).

From ordinary incidents — a childhood acquaintance, marital strife, a wedding — as well as a few extraordinary ones, “Aubrey McKee” builds a dazzling and complicated world, a childhood in Halifax as a vibrant universe in itself. While Pugsley’s literary performance is an immediate delight, the portrait of the early days of a “wayward oddity” lingers long after.

Brett Josef Grubisic’s latest novel is “Oldness; Or, the Last-Ditch Efforts of Marcus O.”

By Cara Black

Soho, 360 pages, $35.95

Fans of Cara Black’s nineteen novels featuring the plucky Parisian private eye, Aimee Leduc, should now make way for Kate Rees, likewise plucky and likewise serving the cause of justice in Paris. But unlike the French Aimee of the 2000s, Kate is an American-born Allied spy operating in German-occupied Paris in June 1940.

Kate, a sharp shooter extraordinaire, is assigned to assassinate the Fuhrer himself when he makes an appearance at the Sacre-Coeur Cathedral in Montmartre. Kate’s shot misses — the bullet takes out a German admiral standing behind Hitler — and she spends the following hair-raising day and a half slipping around Paris, avoiding Nazis on her trail, seeking the undercover route to safety in England.

The story packs in all the Second War spy story staples: nasty Germans and nastier French collaborationists; traitors to the Allied cause and infiltrators of its espionage apparatus; cameo appearances by Churchill and multiple off-stage rants from the Fuhrer. All of this, in Black’s familiar style, is relentless, honest and immaculately researched.

Sister Dear

By Hannah Mary McKinnon

Mira, 360 pages, $23.99

The narrator, 30 and an IT wizard in Portland, Maine, has been hard done by. Just before the man she has always thought to be her dad died, she learned her biological father was actually a rich man-about-Portland. When she approaches him with love in her heart, he slams her out of his life. At that low point, she sets out to win a little justice and fair play.

What follows is a plot heavily weighted in red herrings, much misdirection and several fake leads. There’s a murder, but it comes so close to the book’s end that it’s almost meaningless. All the rest is expertly dodgy and entertaining.

Hurry Home

By Roz Nay

Simon & Schuster, 260 pages, $24.99

Sibling rivalry has seldom been so fraught.

Alex, the youngest sister by five years, has a solid job and a hunky live-in boyfriend in a Colorado town. Ruth, who split from Alex and the rest of the family ten years earlier, unexpectedly shows up. She’s loaded with awkward baggage: a stretch in prison, a stash of cocaine and money belonging to a sinister drug dealer who’s on her trail. Ruth is also five months pregnant.

Both sisters spin contrasting but believable lines of narrative explaining their contrasting life histories. As the dark and creepy story grows more complex with every chapter, the question becomes: which sister is speaking the truth? The answer finally arrives not without huge surprises for all concerned, the reader conspicuously included.

The Last Trial

By Scott Turow

Grand Central, 455 pages, $37

It seems only yesterday — it was actually July 1987 — when Scott Turow introduced Sandy Stern, the absolute ace of criminal attorneys, to American crime fiction. That was in “Presumed Innocent,” and now, many novels later, here is Stern back again. Despite his age (he’s 85) and various frailties, he performs gloriously in what may be Turow’s most legally complex book.

Stern’s client is a man of medicine who conceived a cancer cure that won him a Nobel Prize and made him a zillionaire. Now patients on his regimen are dying. The government charges him with a slew of crimes, fraud and murder not excluded. Everybody goes to court where we all stay, vastly entertained, for almost the entire book.

If law schools offer doctorates in criminal law, “The Last Trial” would seem to make a definitive textbook. It is amazingly instructive, and amid all the heavy-duty learning, Turow treats us to one chapter that is as darkly comic as anything he has written. Check it out.

By Marie-Andrée Gill, translated by Kristen Renee Miller

Book*hug, 88 pages, $18

Spare and image-driven, the poems in “Spawn” chart a young woman’s coming of age with a captivating mix of lyricism and earthy candour. Marie-Andrée Gill is Pekuakamishkueu, and grew up on the Mashteuiatsh Reserve on the shores of Lake Piekuakami (Lac Saint-Jean) in Quebec. She uses the life cycle of freshwater salmon, which inhabit the lake (hence the book’s title), as a frame for her own growth. There’s teen sex and partying, but also a yearning to connect to her heritage, despite the stifling effects of colonialism, conveyed in the image of “four cement teepees/engraved:/…drab procession/the story drawn, lifeless.” Gill often returns to the idea of lacking words (the original book was written in French, not her Indigenous language), and her effort “to lick the skin of the water/with a tongue I don’t speak.” In the end, there’s a sense of affirmation, beautifully expressed: “I know we are blue plumage/the symmetry of spruce/the language of hailstones.”

Roguelike

By Mathew Henderson

Anansi, 80 pages, $19.95

If you know that “roguelike” refers to a type of video game, you have an advantage in appreciating the ingenuity of Mathew Henderson’s second poetry collection. But being a non-gamer (as I am) isn’t an obstacle, primarily because the emotions driving the poems are so resonant. Henderson applies the tropes of role-playing games — particularly the structure of quests, traps and perils— to make sense of a painful family history. The speaker looks back on a mother who was addicted to narcotics and a father he struggles to see as a man and not just in his paternal role. His figurative language is striking and evocative: “You already knew how a house could pile/upon your chest, could pin you as sure as a railway spike,” he writes, an image that viscerally conveys the crushing weight of memories. At the heart of this powerful book is a longing to gain perspective and move on from a difficult past.

The Dyzgraphxst

By Canisia Lubrin

McClelland & Stewart, 166 pages, $21

Complex and kaleidoscopic in range, Canisia Lubrin’s second collection is a sweeping meditation on Black identity, the meaning of home and the rupture caused by slavery (as she puts it, “how many ways can you disappear/a people, dignity by dignity”). The meditations address a character called Jejeune, and sift through a lyric collage of recollections and reflections. Lubrin’s turns of phrase crackle with evocative immediacy, whether she’s describing the past (“the twisted timbres of a ship/from some unknown century”) or the present (climate change is “the scorching heat of a moneyed world”). She returns often to the connection of language to being, and the agency in speaking. Dysgraphia is the inability to write coherently, and by replacing the “i” in dyzgraphist with an “x” in the book’s title, Lubrin signals her ambitious quest to understand identity in historical context in both an individual and communal sense (in her words, “the ballasts of who we/are”).

The Tower

By Paul Legault

Coach House, 80 pages, $21.95

I started off a somewhat resistant reader of Paul Legault’s revamping, in 21st century style and queer sensibility, of W. B. Yeats’s classic “The Tower.” But Legault won me over, in part because he’s thematically faithful to Yeats’s anguish over mortality and disenchantment with the world, but also because he’s so entertaining. In Legault’s poems, that world is absurd, fixated on pop culture, celebrity and the banal preoccupations of our digital age, all of which he blithely skewers. “This is no country for old men” (the opening line of Yeats’s iconic “Sailing to Byzantium.”) becomes “This country’s too young to think —/…dying’s gotten old.” Like Yeats, Legault draws on mythology and the occult, albeit while eschewing lofty language, and he rambles cheerfully through the minutiae of television shows and fashion trends. But there’s also an underlying uneasiness about the future in the face of climate change: as Legault puts it, “Everything’s a little Cormac-McCarthyish.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wiersemaspecial To The Starsat.']",2020-06-06,"“All I Ask,” the debut novel from award-winning St. John’s short story writer Eva Crocker, begins with a violation. Twenty-something Stacey is still in bed when she is awakened by “the doorbell ringing and a pounding that shook the house.” Her roommate isn’t home, and she’s confronted with members of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, waving a warrant and barging into her house. She returns, repeatedly, to the fact that she isn’t wearing a bra, that she’s not wearing her contacts, so she can barely see, as she struggles to keep her cats inside while the men — all men — search her apartment for “illegal digital material.”

The novel opens with the chilling lines “They took my computer and phone so they could copy the contents. They called it a mirror image. They said it was the fastest way to prove I wasn’t the suspect and also I didn’t have a choice.”

That opening chapter seems, initially, to be the set-up for a particular sort of novel; it isn’t. While the police raid and its effects run throughout the story, they’re not what the story is about. “All I Ask” is a powerful coming of age cri de couer, rather than a thriller or novel of wrongful prosecution.

With sly wit and sharp emotional acuity, Crocker explores the next few months in the lives of Stacey and her circle, including her best friend Viv; Holly, the mysterious and alluring recent transplant to St. John’s; and Kris, who repairs bikes and with whom Stacey shares an instant chemistry. The novel delves deeply into Stacey’s life and past, everything from early sexual experiences to the cyclical changes in her body, while at the same time encompassing a vital, passionate and often fraught community.

This intimate immediacy not only connects the reader to the central characters — it opens the novel up to a broader generational examination.

Stacey and her friends live in a post-binary world, where old constructs of gender identity and sexual attraction, along with external moral judgement, no longer seem to exist. But it’s also a world of disenfranchisement and insecurity. While they all have training and degrees, the members of Stacey’s community are struggling to get by; Stacey herself, despite a theatre degree, works in the box office rather than on the stage, picking up occasional work voicing radio ads.

It’s a world of uncertainty set against a historical backdrop of the environmental protests against the controversial Muskrat Falls hydro-electric project in Labrador, and the not guilty verdict against Doug Snelgrove, a police officer accused of sexual assault. “On the stand, he said he’d known she was drunk; he said that he had sex with her while he was on duty, while he was in uniform with a gun attached to his pants.”

“All I Ask” unfolds with a casual, almost aimless quality, a slow drift through a series of moments in these lives. It’s a wickedly funny, sexy, joyous novel, threaded through with sadness, uncertainty, and emotional risk.

More than anything, though, it’s a novel that is unafraid to show its heart, always broken, always healing, always open.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Debra Yeotoronto Star', 'Toronto Star']",2020-06-29,"A play about the Black experience in the American South and a dance-theatre hybrid about the legacy of a residential school in Brantford were the big winners at Monday night’s Dora Mavor Moore Awards, which honour the performing arts in Toronto.

Soulpepper Theatre’s “The Brothers Size” took five awards in the general theatre division while “The Mush Hole,” from Kaha:wi Dance Theatre and Young People’s Theatre, took an equal number in the young audiences division.

The next biggest winner was the Canadian Opera Company’s “Rusalka,” which took four prizes in the opera division.

The awards were handed out by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts in an online ceremony.

“The Brothers Size,” a play about two Black brothers in the Louisiana bayou by Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), won Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu and Outstanding Feature Performance for Daren A. Herbert. It also won for costume design and lighting.

The other winners in the general theatre division included Tarragon Theatre’s “Buffoon” by Anosh Irani, which took Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Lead Performance for Anand Rajaram. Soulpepper’s “Almighty Voice and His Wife” won for scenic design and “Julius Caesar,” from Groundling Theatre and Crow’s Theatre, for lighting design.

“The Mush Hole” is the nickname for the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, which operated as a boarding school for Indigenous children from 1829 to 1970.

The theatre production of that name, based on interviews and writings by survivors, won both Outstanding Production and Outstanding New Play as well as Outstanding Direction for Santee Smith, who also created it. It also took Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and projection design.

The award for individual performance in the young audiences division went to Malindi Ayienga for Young People’s Theatre’s “You and I.”

In the musical theatre division, the prizes were shared among six productions, with “Caroline, or Change,” from Musical Stage Company and Obsidian Theatre, and “Ghost Quartet,” from Crow’s Theatre and Eclipse Theatre Company, taking two each.

“Caroline” claimed both the performance awards, with Jully Black winning Outstanding Lead in her musical theatre debut and Vanessa Sears taking Outstanding Feature Performance.

“Ghost Quartet” won for direction for Marie Farsi and lighting design for Patrick Lavender.

Named Outstanding Production was David Mirvish’s “Piaf/Dietrich,” while Bad Hats Theatre’s “Life in a Box,” by Landon Doak and Matthew Finlan, took Outstanding New Musical.

Eclipse Theatre’s “Sunday in the Park With George” and Young People’s Theatre’s “The Adventures of Pinocchio” rounded out the category with awards for musical direction and choreography, respectively.

Coal Mine Theatre’s “Marjorie Prime” won the most awards in the independent theatre division, including Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Stewart Arnott and Outstanding Lighting Design for Nick Blais.

Native Earth Performing Arts’ “This Is How We Got Here,” by Keith Barker, took Outstanding New Play.

The prize for Outstanding Performance by an Individual went to Alexander Thomas for another Coal Mine production, “Between Riverside and Crazy.” And the ensemble performance award went to the cast of “Casimir and Caroline” from the Howland Company. That play also took the costume design award.

The award for sound design went to “Box 4901” from timeshare performance and scene design went to “Prophecy Fog,” co-produced by the Theatre Centre and Paper Canoe Projects with Nightswimming Theatre.

The Canadian Opera Company was the main winner in the opera division with “Rusalka” taking Outstanding Production, direction for David McVicar, musical direction for Johannes Debus and lighting design for David Finn.

Outstanding New Opera went to “Shanawdithit,” by Yvette Nolan and Dean Burry, co-produced by Tapestry Opera and Opera on the Avalon.

The individual performance award went to Marnie Breckenridge for Tapestry’s “Jacqueline,” and the cast of “Two Odysseys: Pimooteewin/Gallabartnit” took the ensemble prize. It was co-produced by Soundstreams, Signal Theatre and the Sami National Theatre Beaivvas.

In the dance division, “hollow mountain” by Rock Bottom Movement was named Outstanding Production. Outstanding Choreography went to Crystal Pite for the National Ballet of Canada’s “Angels’ Atlas,” which also won the design award for Jay Gower Taylor.

The individual performance award went to Josh Martin for “Mrozewski Series: Leftovers,” part of the “dance: made in canada” showcase from princess productions and Company 605.

Read', 'Mark Kennedythe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Mark Kennedythe Associated Pressmon.']",2020-06-29,"NEW YORK—The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again — until at least early January.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3.

“The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers.

“The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.”

Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6.

In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston.

Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely.

The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021.

Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow Him On Twitter""]",2020-06-22,"The Canadian Opera Company has cancelled all of its in-person performances and events slated for this fall, including “Parsifal” and “The Marriage of Figaro,” due to continued limits on travel and large gatherings in Toronto in the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.

The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.

The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.

Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.

“Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.”

The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others.

The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.”

A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format.

Options for affected ticket-holders range from tax receipts issued for ticket donation, converting ticket value to gift certificate credits that never expires, or full refunds; complete details are listed at coc.ca/FallTickets.

Both the COC’s home venue, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, and the company’s administrative office remain closed to the public until further notice, with full-time staff continuing to work off-site.

The COC has created a digital content hub at coc.ca/Hub, home to a “Virtual Choir,” a video chorus that received hundreds of submissions from all over the globe; “Songs of Hope,” an intimate online concert from the COC Ensemble Studio slated to premiere on July 9; and “Opera Makers,” a series of bite-sized video tutorials for young people.

Read', 'Jennifer Schuesslerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-06-19,"“The Phantom of the Opera” has garnered plenty of superlatives over the years, including the longest-running show in Broadway history. But in recent months, it has also laid claim to a more unlikely title: path-breaking musical of the COVID-19 era.

As theatres around the globe were abruptly shuttered by the pandemic, with no clear path to reopening in sight, the world tour of “Phantom” has been soldiering on in Seoul, South Korea, playing eight shows a week. And it has been drawing robust audiences to its 1600-seat theatre, even after an outbreak in the ensemble led to a mandatory three-week shutdown in April.

The musical, with its 126-member company and hundreds of costumes and props, is believed to be the only large-scale English-language production running anywhere in the world. And it has remained open not through social-distancing measures — a virtual impossibility in the theatre, either logistically or financially, many say — but an approach grounded in strict hygiene.

And it’s one that its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, is arguing can show the way for the rest of the industry, a point he is hoping to demonstrate to the world, as he prepares to turn the Palladium, one of seven theatres he owns in London, into a laboratory for lessons learned in Seoul.

“I don’t think we should just be sitting on our hands and saying, it’s all doom and gloom, we can’t do anything,” he said in an interview last week. “We have got to make the theatres as safe for everybody as we possibly can,” he said. And South Korea, he said, shows that it can work.

That the show, at the Blue Square cultural complex in central Seoul, has gone on is a testament not just to the protocols in the theatre, but to South Korea’s rigorous system of test, trace and quarantine, which has kept the virus largely under control.

It was also a matter of sheer timing and luck, though it didn’t seem that way at first.

When the tour’s previous stop in Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, wrapped up in mid-February, the country was emerging as the latest epicentre of the pandemic.

The company mostly went home for a break to Britain, Italy, North America, Australia and elsewhere. Serin Kasif, vice president of Lloyd Webber’s company, the Really Useful Group, and the producer of the tour, said she was fielding daily messages from company members anxious about whether to return.

On March 2, when Kasif flew to Seoul to begin preparations to open there, South Korea had the second-highest number of confirmed cases, and the pandemic had not yet fully hit Britain.

She contrasted the “overwhelming sense of fear” that developed in London with what she had experienced in Seoul, with its clear governmental directives and local partners who had lived through previous epidemics like SARS.

“When I was speaking to our Korean partners, in lead-up to the decision to continue, one said, ‘The word “unprecedented” keeps getting used, but it’s not unprecedented here,’ ” she explained.

“Amazingly,” Kasif said, the entire company returned to Seoul. Matt Leisy, a Northwestern University graduate who plays Raoul, said that when he went home to New York during the break, friends were “freaking out” at the idea that he might go back to Korea. But he said he was reassured by the producers’ constant communication about safety protocols, as well as their videos of daily life in Seoul.

“It was quite scary leading up to us coming back,” he said. “Who knew we’d end up being in the safest place in the world?”

The protocols, which are mandated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are strict, but they are not particularly space-age. Before entering the theatre, audience members are sprayed with a light mist of disinfectant. Thermal sensors take each person’s temperature, and everyone fills out a questionnaire about symptoms and recent places they’ve visited, so they can be notified of any exposures they may have had through the country’s contract-tracing app.

There are hand-sanitizing stations throughout, and ubiquitous signs and announcements reminding everyone that masks must be worn at all times. And in contrast to movie theatres, where alternating rows or seats are left empty, no seats are blocked off (though the first row was removed).

Backstage, there’s a similar drill: no embracing, no handshakes, no inessential physical contact. Reusable water bottles are forbidden, along with sharing food. Wigs, props and costumes are regularly sprayed or wiped with antibacterial cloths. Everyone must wear a mask, except for actors when they are being made up or go onstage, and some members of the orchestra.

Sharon Williams, the head of wardrobe, said that masks and “constant handwashing” aside, protocols for the 17-member costume department are not that different than they would be normally, beyond extra cycles of high-temperature washing with antibacterial soap.

The crucial element, she said, is the whole company’s rigorous co-operation. “No one is saying ‘I’m not going to do it,’” she said.

As for the onstage action, Kasif said there have been no modifications — and yes, Raoul and Christine still kiss.

Which isn’t to say the actors haven’t had nerve-racking moments. Leisy said initially he was “hyperaware” of all the saliva flying around the stage, especially in big numbers like the Act Two showstopper “Masquerade.”

“When I enunciate, the spit really flies out of my mouth,” he said. “At one point, we’re all dancing and singing our faces off and I look around and see all this saliva flying. I thought, ‘My goodness!’”

(The first row of seats is a seemingly safe 5.2 meters from the edge of the stage, according to a video issued by the show’s Korean producer in early May detailing the safety precautions.)

The run, which has been extended until August (after the touring production of “War Horse” set to follow in the same theatre cancelled), has not been without its bumps. In late March, about two weeks after the show opened, one of the show’s ballerinas said she wasn’t feeling well. She was tested, and the result — positive — was back by 9 a.m. the next morning.

Authorities moved swiftly to lock down the theatre and check if all guidelines were being followed. A mobile testing unit was installed on the roof of the apartment building where the cast and nonlocal crew live, and everyone was immediately tested both for active virus and antibodies. (A male ensemble member also tested positive but remained asymptomatic.)

All 76 members of the touring company were quarantined for 15 days in their apartments. The local employees were also tested, and quarantined at home. (A local production of “Dracula: The Musical” also decided to suspend performances in this period, in response to the outbreak at “Phantom,” according to local news reports.)

In keeping with local policies, the more than 8,000 people who had seen “Phantom” received text alerts informing them of the outbreak. Another announcement, which Kasif said was drafted in conjunction with authorities, was sent to patrons, describing the safety measures that had been in place.

Kasif suggested the fact that the virus had not spread more widely in the company was proof, at least “anecdotally,” as she put it, that the protocols work.

“The ballerinas are a very close ensemble,” she said. “They share a dressing room, warm up together, perform together, warm down together. They happen to be very good friends socially. So if the guidelines weren’t working, on paper they all should have had coronavirus.”

The show reopened on April 23, and ticket sales have been about 70 to 85 per cent full since, Kasif said. Even last Thursday, when a spike in cases in the country led authorities to close all public museums, galleries and entertainment venues across greater Seoul until June 15, the seats were mostly full, according to a reporter who attended. (Publicists for the show declined to provide box office information.)

Private venues, like the Blue Square, were allowed to remain open, and “Phantom” continues to operate “in accordance with KCDC guidelines and instructions,” Kasif said in a statement.

Several audience members expressed concern about the spike, but said they trusted the theatre’s measures and the country’s larger public health response.

Yi-seul Lee, 28, a graphic designer, had seen the musical in March and said she didn’t want to miss the chance to see it again. “Unless we shout very loudly while watching the show or take off our masks, I think we are more or less safe,” she said.

Still, some fans thought the uncertainties of the pandemic had dampened spirits a bit. In-hae Bae, 36, a human resources manager who was seeing “Phantom” for the sixth time, said that every time the actors embraced, the virus popped into her head. And the applause at the curtain call, she said, seemed “timid.”

“They were way too calm,” she said of the audience. “It made me think, ‘Coronavirus must have strangled our passion, too.’”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read', 'Karen Frickertheatre Critic', 'Theatre Critic', 'Carly Magatheatre Critic', 'Carly Maga Are Toronto-Based Theatre Critics', 'Freelance Contributors For The Star. Follow Them On Twitter']",2020-06-18,"The Stratford Festival is again in the spotlight as Canadian theatre contends with systemic racism in the wake of ongoing Black Lives Matter protests around the world.

Stratford will hand over its social media channels to Indigenous artists Friday and Saturday, June 19 and 20, in advance of National Indigenous Peoples Day on Sunday, June 21.

The initiative follows a similar move the weekend of June 6 when the festival turned its platforms over to Black actors and artists — sparking a wave of testimony and activism that has already led to policy and leadership changes in national theatre.

Over the next two days, past and present Stratford Festival artists and theatre workers with Indigenous heritage will run the company’s Twitter, Instagram and Facebook feeds using the hashtag #DecolonizingTheStage.

On June 20, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., a YouTube panel will take place, titled “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi — We Are Standing Strong: Stories of endurance, resilience and resistance from members of the Indigenous circle at Stratford.” It will include artists Jani Lauzon, Quelemia Sparrow, Lisa Nasson and Jessica Carmichael from this season’s postponed production of Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters”; actor Gordon Patrick White; director Cole Alvis; and former Stratford associate artistic director Dean Gabourie. They will be joined by elder Liz Stevens from Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.

“This is a group of artists that have these particular points of view and these particular experiences,” said Lauzon, who has taken the lead on organizing the takeover and will moderate the “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi” panel. “But we do not speak for the entire community because it’s so vast and different in the way that we work, who we work with and how we intersect with theatre.”

Lauzon said each social media feed will have its own purpose: Twitter and Instagram will amplify more activist-driven arguments and experiences, Stratford’s Facebook page will be devoted to individuals who worked with the festival in the past, and the YouTube panel will provide room for in-depth, complicated discussions of Indigeneity and colonial systems in Canadian arts and culture.

“We’re here to repeat the things that we have been saying, knowing that there is a deeper listening going on, which is the exciting part, as well as maybe disclosing things that we felt unsafe saying before,” she said.

Reneltta Arluk — the first Inuit person and the first Indigenous woman to direct a Stratford production with “The Breathing Hole” in 2017 — is among the artists participating in the social media takeover. Director of Indigenous arts at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Arluk was encouraged by the festival’s anti-Black racism venture, which resulted in an end to its “as cast” policy, which allows directors to cast actors in small roles without their consent.

“The way that Indigenous people have been treated for over 150 years by the Canadian government — they have been reminded that they need to assimilate, they need to move out of their home territories, their language is not recognized as official. Treaties and agreements are broken. These are the histories we carry in our bones and our veins,” said Arluk. “When we come to the table … we’re coming from that historical place of distrust.”

Lauzon echoed Arluk’s caution about Canada’s history of Indigenous oppression. The recent deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi during interactions with police in New Brunswick, and a video showing the violent arrest of chief Allan Adam in Alberta have renewed calls for change.

In Lauzon’s view, Canadians want to believe that “Canada is better somehow or that we’re not quite as bad as the circumstances are in the States. We’ve been very good at hiding things; we’ve been very good at not educating our youth,” she said. “It is an unfortunate residue of colonial thinking, which is an assumption of superiority.”

Stratford Festival artistic director Antoni Cimolino said the company has commissioned new works by Indigenous writers and began including more Indigenous voices in its programming over the past few years. “I feel strongly that, for the remainder of my tenure, I would like a play by an Indigenous writer in each season.

“I feel that we have a special responsibility to Indigenous people in Canada and that means we would really like to build a stronger relationship with this community of artists.”

But there has been greater learning for Cimolino in the way Indigenous theatre artists work. And it’s led to structural changes at Stratford, such as welcoming smudge ceremonies at the beginning of rehearsals, the inclusion of land acknowledgments before performances and modifying the pace of some creative processes.

“Usually in rehearsals, you’re rushing into a room, it’s last minute and you get right to it. There isn’t a sense of breath, of acknowledgment of who we are, where we are,” he said.

Observing the rehearsal process of “Pawâkan Macbeth” at the Banff Centre of Arts and Creativity in February was revelatory for Cimolino. It’s a Stratford-commissioned, Plains Cree retelling of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” written by Arluk and directed by Michael Greyeyes.

“For our Indigenous colleagues, the greeting at the top of rehearsal takes 20 minutes, half an hour. We don’t normally invest that much time to start the day,” Cimolino said.

“The payoff though was beautiful and I felt there was a sense of trust … This is part of a learning process for us that isn’t only about supporting our Indigenous colleagues, it’s also a learning process that I hope will make us a better place and our work better.”

She is of northern Manitoba Swampy Cree and Irish-settler descent. She offers insight into her life experiences as the Stratford Festival dedicates its social media platforms to First Nations artists.

When I learned that I would be going to the Stratford Festival to play Zhaboonigan Peterson in Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters,” I was overcome with excitement, joy and gratitude. What a gift to work in a room full of powerful Indigenous artists. This felt like an opportunity that I dreamed of during my school days. My dream, and the play, were ultimately postponed by the pandemic.

I spent six years training as an actor and I earned two degrees. During that time I gained many skills — but none of those skills would prepare me for what lay ahead. I could not have foreseen the amount of work I would be required to do. Work that had nothing to do with acting.

As an Indigenous woman growing up in this country, I got used to the questions: “Where are you from?” I grew accustomed to the comments: “You’re so articulate!” I learned to smile, laugh it off and gently correct. “They mean well.” Mostly. This is how I learned to walk through the world safely.

As I journeyed from schooling into my career as an actor, I had not realized that the way I learned to walk through the world had grown into a full-time job. No benefits. No pay. The ways I had educated family, friends, co-workers, strangers on the bus, I now had to apply to the world of directors, people of influence, of power, those who could hire or fire me.

I learned to be soft and agreeable so as not to frighten anyone.

“Of course, I’m not saying you’re racist.” I learned to put a lid on my anger and to be so incredibly patient.

“I know, I know you’re trying.”

I picked my battles and let things slide, and made offers and tried my very hardest to soak my words in syrup to make the truth more palatable.

I have run out of ways and words and sweetness. I want to speak candidly. I want to tell the truth.

The truth is my people are dying.

It’s hard to know what to say after that.

This is my truth. It is my truth when I walk into the rehearsal room, onto the stage and when I am alone with my thoughts. This truth is heavy and larger than the confines that this space allows. To share it comes at a cost and I am just one person.

I am feeling extra tender these days. I’m thinking about all the artists who came before me. I am angry. I am heartbroken. Everyday I am learning and unlearning. I understand that I am not untouched by the sludge of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, patriarchy and colonialism. Black Lives Matter.

There is so much work left to do.

I long for the day I can be in a space with my fellow artists again, whether that be in picturesque Stratford or anywhere art can be made. I believe in what I do now more than ever. I have to.

I believe that the art I help create can reach people, teach people, offer comfort and hope.

Read', 'Deborah Dundasbooks Editor', 'Books Editor', ""Deborah Dundas Is The Star'S Books Editor. She Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter""]",2020-07-04,"With no one to see the art, does the message get lost? If we can’t be with people, do we forget how to connect? No. Instead, we find new ways of sharing and understanding each other.

The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.

This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.

“The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.”

For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.

“Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”

In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.

These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.

To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca. Half of the sale price goes to the students and half to the school — to inspire and support more students to create, and in so doing to encourage all of us to see the world through fresh eyes.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
671,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2020/06/30/experts-dismiss-dealers-claim-to-have-long-lost-frida-kahlo-work.html,Experts dismiss dealer’s claim to have long-lost Frida Kahlo work,"['Aritz Parra', 'Berenice Bautista', 'Aritz Parrathe Associated Pressberenice Bautistatue.', 'June', 'Min. Read', 'Aritz Parrathe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press']",2020-06-30,"MADRID—Scholars in the work of surrealist Frida Kahlo have searched for more than six decades for “The Wounded Table,” a 1940 oil painting illuminating her pain over the breakup of her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera that hasn’t been seen since an exhibition in Poland.

And the historians strongly reject the idea that the mystery of its whereabouts has been solved, as claimed by a Spanish art dealer who says the painting is now sitting in a London warehouse awaiting a buyer willing to spend more than 40 million euros ($60.9 million).

Experts consulted by the Associated Press have concluded that published images of the work now on sale show nothing more than a copy of Kahlo’s painting.

Helga Prignitz-Poda, an art historian who has fruitlessly tried to track down the long-lost painting, said that there are clear differences between the work for sale and old photographs of the original and that there are similarities between the offered work with inaccurate replicas based on those old images.

In addition, she said, Kahlo did the painting on wood and not on canvas. The work for sale is described as a canvas painting.

Cristian López, the Spanish art dealer who says he represents the anonymous owner of the painting, stands firm in defending its authenticity.

“Time will give us the truth,” López said during a phone conversation in which he offered few details on the painting.

López, who is little known in the art world, said specialists have endorsed the painting’s authenticity, but he declined to identify them.

“Whoever proves genuine interest and the ability to pay the figure of 40 million euros, can spend as much time as wanted with their experts analyzing the work,” López said.

“The Wounded Table” was unveiled at the International Surrealism Exhibition in 1940 in Mexico City. It includes a self-portrait of Kahlo at a long table, flanked by a Holy Week Judas and a monster that embraces her, while the two sons of her sister stand at one end and her pet fawn is at the other. Blood flows from knots of the wood table, which is considered to represent the artist’s anguish of the just concluded divorce from Rivera.

Kahlo donated the painting to the Soviet Union in 1945 for a planned Mexico room at the Museum of Western Art in Moscow, but Soviet art officials disdained surrealism as decadent and the project was dropped. The Mexican works ended up in a cellar.

A year after Kahlo’s death, a Mexican group organized a travelling art exhibition for shows in Soviet bloc nations and arranged for a loan of “The Wounded Table.” Prignitz-Poda said there is photographic evidence the 46-inch by 98-inch painting was shown in Warsaw, but nothing is known of it after that. There is no clue whether it was returned to Moscow, destroyed or perhaps acquired by someone.

Susana Pliego, an art historian who has studied the work of both Kahlo and Rivera, is among the experts who don’t think the painting for sale is the real thing.

She said there is a big problem with faked Kahlo painting because the art market thirsts for more works by an artist who produced only about 200 paintings before her death in 1954.

“Fridamania has been a marketing invention,” said Pliego, who directs cultural programming at the Casa de México in Madrid and who worked for years on Kahlo’s archive. “Because her paintings are sold so expensively, someone makes a proposal to see if anyone falls for it.”

Hans-Jérgen Gehrke, an art collector who operates a museum dedicated to Kahlo’s works in southwestern Germany, considers it “implausible, if not directly ridiculous,” that an unknown 22-year-old businessman operating a website from a town in northwestern Spain is the guardian of the missing painting.

“There are thousands of Frida Kahlo fakes,” Gehrke said. “She is possibly the artist who has painted more dead than in life.”",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From spring to summer. From fearing each other to celebrating in each other’s presence. They are thoughts for our times, evoked by Inuit artist Jessie Oonark’s 1979 image “Angagok Conjuring Birds.”

Angagok (also spelled angakkuq) are often called upon to serve as healers or as keepers of justice in the community.

Here, they are transforming into birds, a recurring image in Oonark’s work, notes Sarah Milroy, chief curator of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, where a copy of this print resides. The figures, male or female, “serve as spiritual mediators, (and are) called to their roles through visions or dreams. Stories abound of their powers to fly or run as fast as the caribou.” Or to transform.

It is one of hundreds of images that Oonark, born in 1906 in the Barren Lands, north and west of present-day Baker Lake in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, created. She spent her early life in Utkusiksalingmiut camps, in traditional pursuits including dressing caribou and sealskins, as well as making parkas and other items of traditional clothing, wrote Janet Catherine Berlo in “North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century.”

In the late 1950s, Oonark moved to Qamani’tuaq — Baker Lake — and it was only when she was 59 that she began drawing and creating textile hangings. Soon she had her own art studio and, eventually, a salary.

Between 1970 and 1985 more than 100 of Oonark’s drawings were translated into prints and issued in Baker Lake’s annual print editions, Berlo writes. Three of her prints were also released through the famous Kinngait (Cape Dorset) print program between 1960 and 1961 — the only Inuk outside the community to have her work included in that collection. Her work hangs in the National Arts Centre; before she died in 1985, she was named to the Order of Canada.

Oonark’s compositions feature figures in traditional clothing, animals, and birds and traditional tools. In Inuit Art Quarterly, art critic and CBC reporter Robert Enright noted how “the whimsical, awkward gestures the figures make and the colours in the drawings speak unequivocally about Oonark’s uncompromising celebration of Inuit life.”

Now, we are able to see each other again in a world that doesn’t quite look like the one we lived in before. It’s time to reach out awkwardly to each other in a celebration of life. It’s time to heal.

Read', 'Deborah Dundasbooks Editor', 'Books Editor', 'Deborah Dundas Is The Star S Books Editor. She Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-22,"Storytelling is universal. It can bridge the space between individuals and cultures. It can bridge centuries. Even ancient stories have resonance today. Stories of love, war — and plague. The circumstances might not be exactly the same, but the parallels of experience and the universality of our emotions echo. When the world seems out of our control there’s comfort in that.

Often compared to Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” the story of “Layli and Majnun,” was written in 1188 and is one of five long romances from the poet Nizami’s “Khamseh” (Quintet). It tells of two young lovers who are prevented from being together by their families and community.

This illustration comes from a “Khamseh” manuscript dated 1527; it depicts the moment when, after many years of separation and emotional hardship that has left them physically weakened, Layli and Majnun are finally brought into each other’s company by a go-between.

They keep their distance, however, out of fear that the intensity of embracing each other would kill them. Instead, Majnun, a poet, sings a beautiful composition he has written to Layli in an expression of the intensity of his love.

As we are able, once again, to physically meet with friends and family after months of being apart, we can understand the emotion the two lovers feel. Whether we can understand the script or not, the illustrations encourage us to use our imaginations and create a story of our own using cues from the past.

And that’s poetry for you: even when we can’t understand the script, we can interpret the images. When we can’t understand the language, we can understand the emotion. Poetry’s images collide and refract, illuminating new ideas and connections. The breadth of human experience resonates and hums in the spaces between words, something we can experience together.

Still, as a personal memory, I’ve always loved it for the tableau of emotions and body language and relationships unwittingly captured that night. I love it, too, for the reminders it gives me about my apparently quite coy, younger queer self. Hey now, baby dyke.

It was July 1999. That much I know for sure because it’s date-stamped on the back of the photograph. The rest, not so much. But after reaching out to four friends who were all there that night, the best we could come up with is that we think we’re at the much-missed Gypsy Co-Op for some queer club night, for maybe somebody’s birthday, maybe not.

I went digging through my personal archive because in the right-before times, I had spent two days at the ArQuives gleefully looking at hundreds of photographs just as terrible as this one.

Housed on Isabella Street, the ArQuives is Canada’s LGBTQ2+ Archives and the world’s largest independent collection of LGBTQ heritage materials. As part of my photo laureate activities, we had been working together to produce an exhibition of photographs that would have launched on the front face of City Hall during Doors Open Toronto and stayed up for Pride Month.

Responding to the 2020 Doors Open theme, “Open TO Music,” I had wanted to visualize the relationship between music and LGBTQ activism in Toronto, and so I searched for photos depicting the presence of music not only at conventions and at marches and at rallies, but also at gay bars and trans parties and queer picnics.

For those two days, I was like a drag queen in a wig store, giddied and in awe as I pored over box after box of photographs. Capital-H history is in there, yes, in the documentation of events such as the first Gay Pride march in 1972 and the demonstrations after the 1981 bathhouse raids. But it was the photographs of small-h history, of the everyday activism of trans and queer folks just living their best life, that moved me to tears again and again.

People have donated everything from 4x6 prints to strips of film negatives and sheets of slides, and while the collections do include images created by professional photographers for newspapers or photo shoots, the bulk of the bounty is made up of amateur snapshots or what are often called vernacular photographs.

These ordinary photographs taken by ordinary people have received increased interest from photography scholars and collectors lately, though their value in revealing social histories has long been appreciated by community-based archives.

As I studied image after image at the ArQuives, it was these everyday photographs that showed me the laughter and the flirting and the tender moments of the past but, decidedly and frustratingly, only those belonging to certain ordinary histories and not others.

Just as with similar LGBTQ archives elsewhere in Canada and in the U.S, the stories of white, cisgender gay men and lesbians were overwhelmingly dominant, with trans and queer Black, Indigenous and people of colour histories barely accounted for.

Although not everything can be recorded and collected, let’s be clear, this collective “archival silence” is rooted in transphobia and the racism that everyone suddenly seems overly eager to acknowledge and slightly less so to address. These oppressions have limited whose stories are seen as worth preserving, as well as who has even been told their stories are worth preserving in the first place.

Many of these archives were founded by white gay activists in the early ’70s and, as much as the reckoning was already underway, there is a new-found urgency to current efforts to continue to acknowledge their contributions, while also directly grappling with the problematic challenges posed by their legacies.

Two books raising some of these issues have already been released this year alone, “Documenting Rebellions: A Study of Four Lesbian and Gay Archives in Queer Times,” by former ArQuives executive director Rebecka Taves Sheffield, and “Out North: An Archive of Queer Activism and Kinship in Canada,” by Craig Jennex and Nisha Eswaran.

And then last month, Archivaria, the journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, published an article by my colleague, Elspeth Brown, professor of history at the University of Toronto and long-time volunteer and board member at the ArQuives.

In describing her six years of helping to bring an intersectional, trans-inclusive framework to the organization, she echoes the present demand to actually take explicit action: “Making visible the materials of LGBTQ2+ people outside the white, cis, settler-colonial, usually gay male norm requires specific strategies and approaches; otherwise, the default historical formation of white ‘gay and lesbian’ people and their histories will continue to overdetermine the LGBTQ2+ archive.”

Along with Brown’s work at the ArQuives, these strategies have included a recent name change, hiring staff of colour, diversifying their 120-strong volunteer base and supporting exhibitions like last year’s “Legacies in Motion: Black Queer Toronto Archival Project,” in partnership with Myseum and Black Artists’ Network in Dialogue.

With this last project, rather than reproduce a colonial dynamic and collect the personal records themselves, the ArQuives supported the years of stewardship of local Black queer activists, including curator Courtnay McFarlane. As Brown notes, these postcustodial approaches “emphasize contributive justice and the addressing of structural inequalities.”

This leaves me with two options for my blurry photograph above and all of the others like it sitting on my shelves. But after my time looking and seeing and touching all of those other photographs, I can’t help but want a different experience for those who come after me. As soon as the ArQuives reopens, I suspect I’ll be headed over, boxes in tow. We are in #BlackSpring and Pride Month, and we deserve more.",[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
