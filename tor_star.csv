Reach Her Via Email', 'Carolyn Carolynevanshammond.Com']",2020-07-09,"I’m just going to say it: Yes, you can drink wine on the rocks. But there’s a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. Here’s the lowdown.

When you don’t care that the ice will dilute the wine as it melts, or that the deep chill is going to mask all the subtle complexity in the wine, go ahead and toss a few cubes in the glass. Otherwise, refrain.

My bet is, if you’ve dropped a generous bundle of cash on a bottle of fine wine, you’re not going to want to wreck it by watering it down and muting it. Which is why serving fine wine on the rocks is not usually a good idea. But there’s one exception.

And that’s Port. That sweet, fortified wine from Portugal that’s typically associated with Christmas gifting, by-the-fire sipping and post-dinner cheese boards is actually quite fabulous in the summer served on ice. Especially with a dish of salted almonds. Here’s why it works.

First off, Port is so concentrated that a little dilution isn’t going to kill the experience. In fact, it will actually enhance its drinkability.

Secondly, ice ratchets up the refreshment factor and offsets the style’s considerable sweetness.

And third, at about 20 per cent alcohol by volume, Port is a slow sipper. So it has time to warm up a little bit in your mouth as you drink it, giving the considerable complexity time to open, cascade and linger — even when served cold.

All that to say, if you haven’t tried Port on the rocks, I’d encourage you to do so with a bottle of white, tawny or ruby Port. Here are a few favourites that offer tremendous value.

White wine lovers will appreciate Taylor Fladgate NV Fine White Port (Vintages 69856, $15.95/750mL). Gleaming golden in the glass, this is a sweet, full-bodied wine made from a blend of eight white grape varieties and aged in wood for three years. Each sip saturates the palate with a blast of candied pear and orange zest, salted caramel and hazelnut, vanilla and a whisper of nutmeg. This is especially good served with a slice of orange in the glass. Score: 93

A tasty tawny to try is Warre’s Otima 10-Year-Old (LCBO 566174, $22.00/500mL). Tawny Ports are red fortified wines that have shed their deep ruby colour and turned amber, or tawny, from maturing in wood for an extended time. This version, comprised of wine aged an average of 10 years in oak, shines a deep amber hue and tastes of toffee and nuts, candied citrus and cherries, with touches of nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. It’s a sweet, satin-textured drink that goes well with the setting sun. Score: 92+

For a ruby Port that overdelivers, consider Taylor Fladgate 2015 Late Bottled Vintage Port (LCBO 46946, $19.00/750mL). Ruby Port is made from a blend of black grape varieties aged for two to six years in wood, thus retaining its deep colour. Taylor Fladgate’s version here shines dark red and unfolds with intriguing layers of fruit that taste sweet and poised yet dark. Blackberry and black licorice mingle with black cherry and cola, burnt almond and coffee, and a whisper of black peppercorn and smoke. And it’s of course long. Score: 93

If you’re inspired to whip up a batch of salted almonds to go with any of these wines, here’s my favourite way to make them.

Pour three cups of raw, unsalted almonds into a bowl. Dissolve one heaping teaspoon of salt in about two tablespoons of hot water. Pour the salty water over the almonds and toss. Spread the nuts on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and bake in a 400° F oven for about 10 minutes until golden, stirring halfway through. Remove the tray from the oven, pour the almonds into a bowl, drizzle them with about a tablespoon of really good olive oil and stir to coat. The nuts will quickly absorb the oil.

You can serve the almonds warm or let them cool and store them in an airtight container.

And if you’ve got a bottle of fine table wine kicking around that you want to chill fast, don’t be tempted to throw ice in the glass. Instead, make an ice bath — about half ice, half water — and submerge the bottle. Doing so will chill it faster than ice on its own and you’ll be enjoying your wine nicely chilled (but not too cold or diluted) in no time.",[]

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"You want to ask out that person you’ve been talking to during lockdown, but don’t know where you stand with them or if you’re on the same page. Are they romantically interested in you? Or has all the banter through endless texts, video calls and DMs been just about fighting off boredom? How do you shoot your shot?

You might say (like my married editor), “Just ask them!” After all, that’s the most direct way to get a clear answer. But for those of us who are single, that’s too risky. Too direct. Too bold. Point blank asking someone where they stand with you romantically, before you’ve even met in person, is not only a struggle (What do you say? When do you say it? What method do you use?) but this confronting conversation can ultimately lead to the demise of the connection.

“As humans we’re inclined not to confront each other and having ‘the talk’ with someone is ultimately a confrontation,” says Kimberly Moffit, a Toronto relationship expert. She says that not only are you inviting answers you may not want, but you’re running the risk of closing the door sooner than you want it to close. “Especially when things are going well, we don’t want to put the person on the spot to make a decision quickly,” Moffit said.

Instead of asking point blank, she suggests putting out little hints about how you’re feeling. “You’re not putting them on the spot asking where they’re at romantically, but instead you’re offering up a vulnerable, emotional statement about where you’re at,” Moffit said.

She suggests sharing your feelings, without putting pressure on them. You can say something like you’ve really been enjoying your connection and share something you really appreciate about them. “If the other person has similar feelings, they’ll offer it up to you immediately, but if they don’t they’ll stay silent. That’s a sign for you to pay attention to,” Moffit said. “Don’t ask them where they’re at because truthfully no one knows where they are at … we are in a pandemic.”

Another way of gauging if you’re on the same page is asking them about their relationship goals, suggests relationship expert Wendy Walsh, host of the “Mating Matters” podcast.

“The great thing about dating apps is it is a diverse mating marketplace of people looking for short term, long-term affairs and threesomes. Some want kids. Some don’t. Some just want an emotional support animal and may never want to meet in the real world,” said Walsh. “This is vital information that you need to establish at the beginning. And, more importantly, if someone does not match your relationship goals and you continue to talk, well, you’ve been warned.”

She says regular communication by voice and video phone is a way to tell someone is interested in you. “Also, a budding overlap in your social networks. Have they made a business connection for you? How about inviting you to Zoom parties with friends? Also, if they are able to talk about real feelings and have intimate conversations, that’s a good sign,” Walsh said.

A red flag would be what she calls text buddy relationships. “If they aren’t doing voice and video, they don’t want to get close.”

If you’ve been doing frequent video dates and/or phone chats, Moffit says, if you want to meet, you can propose something you’d like to do, like meeting up at a local patio or in a park. She suggests saying something like, “Hey, I loved getting to know you the past couple of months, there’s this awesome patio at my favourite spot in the city that just reopened that I’m going to hit up with some friends. Care to join?”

This allows you to take initiative and put the plan in motion, showing where you stand in an informal way and not putting pressure on them. “If they are into you and want to take things further, chances are they are going to want to meet up and see you in person. If not, you’ll find that out pretty quickly because if they can’t join after the first suggestion or the second, you are getting information from them that they aren’t interested,” Moffit said.

The in-person meeting is essential — if you feel comfortable with leaving the house and can abide by healthy practices to prevent COVID-19 spread — to determine if you have chemistry.

“You can chat with someone for months, then know instantly it’s not the right match the moment you meet them without a screen separating you. You can’t even assume you’re going to like them!” Moffit says.

If you’ve been talking for a while now, she suggests putting the messaging out there that it’s not a done deal until you’ve at least met in person to see if your virtual connection translates in real life. After that, spend some time together in different settings and see if it’s an ultimate match.

“You wouldn’t want everything to hinge on that first meeting because that’s a lot of pressure. Let them know you’re interested in spending time in person to see what’s there, so they know it isn’t a done deal yet,” Moffit said.

She suggests saying something like, “I really like what we have going on so far, but I’m excited to meet you in person to see what’s there.” This way, you’re giving them a sense of where you’re at and making it clear you’re not in a relationship, despite the elevated connection you perceive to share, romantic or otherwise.",[]

Read', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Christine Sismondo Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'Contributor To The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"Roughly 150 years old, the Manhattan is easily one of the most popular and enduring cocktails of all time.

That said, its popularity has been subject to the usual ups and downs associated with drink trends and, from about 1970 to 2010, it was a little less common, since many people had turned to vodka, rum and tequila cocktails like the Margarita, Piña Colada and Cosmopolitan. And, as often happens with drinks that aren’t in regular circulation, the quality of the Manhattans started to decline as a lot of bartenders simply forgot how to make one properly.

It’s an easy drink to make—whisky, sweet vermouth, bitters, stirred over ice and served in a cold glass with or without a cherry—but a lot of things can go wrong if you don’t understand a few basics.

First, like all drinks that are made with straight spirits, it needs to be stirred, so that it doesn’t wind up watery. Second, the bitters are essential. Third, splurge on a good Amarena cherry. Fourth, vermouth goes bad relatively quickly if it isn’t stored in the refrigerator. Finally, don’t be stingy with the vermouth.

Unless, that is, you’ve left your vermouth on a counter for a month, which was exactly what happened at a lot of bars in the vodka/tequila era. On top of that, a lot of people forgot the bitters since, even though a bottle of Angostura bitters sat on the back bar of many venues like a talisman or something, few of us understood how to use them. Bitters are often called the “salt and pepper” of the cocktail world and bartenders say that, quite often, if something is just a little off on a drink and they can’t figure out what, a dash of bitters will fix it.

These problems have largely been fixed in the past 10 to 15 years, thanks to the revival of traditional methods amongst bartenders who have been bringing back the classics.

Speaking of tradition, the first Manhattans would almost universally have been made with American rye whiskey but, since we’re doing 100-mile cocktails here and supporting local distilleries, we’re using a Canadian alternative, Stalk and Barrel’s Three Barrel Whisky ($34.95; LCBO 13323). Since it’s made just north of Toronto, we named it after the distillery’s location—in Concord.

The Concord

2 oz Stalk and Barrel whisky

¾ oz Haberdasher sweet vermouth (made in Prince Edward County)

2 dashes Angostura bitters

1 Amarena cherry (for garnish)

Method: Stir all ingredients (except the cherry) together over ice in a mixing glass for 45 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Add cherry.

NOTE: If you have trouble tracking down Haberdasher, Dillon’s Vermouth (also made in Ontario) is an alternative that’s available at the LCBO. And there are plenty of Ontario craft whisky options, but we wanted to shine a light on Stalk and Barrel, the province’s oldest micro-distillery, because it’s celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. They have several different expressions, including a rye and a single malt.",[]

We dated exclusively after just one month then, due to COVID, moved in together.

I could work from home, but he lost his job and was very bored, so picked up his photography hobby. He already had a lot of equipment at home.

He constantly takes pictures of me: when I’m just waking up, even when I’m asleep.

He snaps me in different sitting or lying down positions when I least expect it. He even tries to pose me when I’m in the midst of doing my work.

I’m glad that he got busy with an interest, but I’m a little uncomfortable as to what he’s done or is planning to do with all those pictures.

I’m often complimented on my figure, so I’m not being conceited when I say that I wonder if some of those wake-up or sleeping shots of me are suggestive.

If I’d been asked and agreed to that kind of photography, it’d be one thing. But he just shot whatever he wanted while I was focused on work.

I think I can trust him fully, but something’s niggling the back of my mind. I don’t want to accuse him of anything and cause a big fight.

How do I ask if he’s used me for selling soft porn?

Am I His Girlfriend or Model?

A: Just ask. What’s pestering your mind is doubt.

You haven’t mentioned whether he was eligible for government assistance during the pandemic. If he’s not, and yet seems to have income, it could be a factor troubling you.

You moved in together during very early dating. Your unasked questions about something so personal show that trust isn’t a firm factor in this still-new relationship during unusual circumstances.

Maybe he just finds you a delightful subject for photography. Or maybe there’s more to it.

But, as partners in a relationship, if you can’t inquire what he’s done, or plans to do, with so many close-up camera portraits of you, then trust IS missing.

My brother (married with two kids) lives with my parents in Europe. He’s abusive to his wife, has a violent relationship with my father.

He won’t move out, won’t get therapy, won’t admit to any wrongdoing. He blames everyone for the failings in his life, especially my parents.

I told him to seek therapy. He shamed me.

His explosions occur frequently. I fear for my mom’s life (she’s 71), how long she can take it. I fear my brother harming himself or someone else. I fear the terrifying hate between him and my father.

How to Help My Brother?

A: Try to help those caught in the middle of this terrifying hatred.

Contact the mental health resources in the country and area where your parents’ home is located.

Explain the volatile danger facing everyone there, including two children.

Ask for confidentiality assurance regarding the authorities not informing the women and kids, who’d be at further risk if suspected of reporting the situation.

Seek whatever help’s available, plus learn the laws regarding when authorities can intervene. Stay in close, private contact with your mother.

If things worsen, try to convince her to find safety elsewhere (quickly and also privately) along with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren.

Read', 'Mike Seelythe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Mike Seelythe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Harley Sitner was in Brooklyn for a wedding in March, feeling as if he’d just been sprayed by a skunk. Sitner’s hometown, Seattle, where he owns a camper-van restoration, repair and rental business called Peace Vans, was the site of one of one of the first huge coronavirus outbreaks. “People were like, ‘Stay away,’” he recalled.

Back home, with peak road-trip season approaching, his employees reported a rush of cancellations on rental vans. Sitner had just hired a “super-awesome” marketing manager and began thinking he might have to lay her off.

School was cancelled, and all but the most essential businesses were ordered to shut down. Sitner was compelled to give his employees a month off, save for a skeletal crew that stuck around to perform essential services like repairs.

“We were looking at some pretty significant revenue black holes,” he said.

Then, in mid-April, the phone started ringing in the repair shop.

“People started thinking they’d have a summer and wanted their classic Volkswagens looked at,” Sitner said.

But it wasn’t just that. There was also a run on a new line of modern camper vans his company had announced with Mercedes-Benz at the Chicago Auto Show in February: produced by a third-party manufacturer called Driverge, sleeping four apiece, and starting at $93,000 without kitchen and cabinetry, $120,000 with.

“We sold like 28 of them in 30 days,” Sitner said. “Some people are saying they’re not getting on a plane for two years or never going to Europe again.”

Sitner is 52, with a 10-year-old daughter named Eden Peach. In person, he projects a tender, Michael Stipe-ish vibe, wistfully remembering that “until recently, we hugged so many of our customers” and brewed espresso in the shop’s front office.

He became acquainted with Peace Vans as a customer, running his Vanagon (a.k.a. the Volkswagen T3) in and out of the shop, in Seattle’s industrial SoDo neighbourhood, between jaunts to Burning Man. In 2013 he learned from the shop owner that he planned to close the business, and Sitner persuaded him to hand it over instead.

Over the years, Sitner has served clientele from aging hippies to Instagramming millennials, and all political persuasions. (In the lot of Peace Vans there was an old VW bus from Iowa awaiting restoration with a National Rifle Association sticker on the driver’s-side window and a painting of the word “Peace” on the side panel.) But the venture with Mercedes, which began casually after he began buying the chassis of the brand’s Metris van from a dealership down the street, has brought a new kind of buyer, Sitner said.

Ed Stevens, a 51-year-old tech entrepreneur in Dallas, had planned to take his wife, Robin, and two adult children scuba diving in the Caribbean when the pandemic took hold. The virus’s spread, he said, was the reason he started looking to buy a camper van.

“We cancelled the reservation and hunkered down, and then I started thinking, ‘I can work from anywhere, Robin’s taking a class online, and we thought we’d just cruise the whole country,” he said. “As soon as I saw the official partnership between Mercedes and Harley, that was the motivating factor.”

(“The idea of building on a Nissan or a Ford light van did not meet the quality bar we wanted,” Sitner said, explaining his choice of chassis.)

Mark and Linda Kimlin had just spent the winter in Spain before returning to New York City in mid-March, feeling “very lucky to escape unscathed,” said Mark Kimlin, 63. But New York was itself about to get scathed, and with the lease up on their Upper East Side apartment, the Kimlins hightailed it to a home they owned in New Paltz, north of the city. (They expect to return to the city when things “settle down,” Linda Kimlin, 65, said.)

Their daughter had planned to get married in California in July (the celebration has been postponed, although not the ceremony) and, Mark Kimlin said, “it seemed like a good time for wide-open spaces and not getting on an airplane.”

His son-in-law-to-be had driven a simpler version of the Metris camper van and shared his positive experience with Kimlin, who bought one from Peace Vans on the strength of that recommendation and the fact that his wife “likes camping, but with a comfy bed.”

Talk to any camper-van owner and they’ll tout the relatively small size of their vehicles compared to traditional RVs and the taller Mercedes Sprinter vans that many Amazon delivery drivers whiz around in, explaining that the more compact Mercedes Metris and VW Vanagons are easily usable as second cars in dense neighbourhoods in major metropolitan areas.

But they’re also great for when a wildfire jumps the highway and bears down on your house — the precise scenario Naomi Neilson stared down in mid-June at her house in Shell Beach, California.

“Everyone was like, ‘Where are you going to go?’ And I was like, ‘I don’t know, I’m going to take my van and go,” said Neilson, 46, who owns a Metris camper van and runs a bathroom-fixture company called Native Trails. “I just threw some food and drinks in the fridge and was ready to go. It took me 10 minutes. I went down the coast a little way and just relaxed. I didn’t end up needing to evacuate for the whole night, but it was nice to be able to just throw a couple things in there and know I had a place to sleep and cook for as long as I needed.”

Of course, this is something owners of Volkswagen Vanagons have taken comfort in for decades.

While Metris owners like Ed Stevens never considered buying such a lovable relic of hippie culture because he “didn’t want to be spending two days somewhere while my transmission gets shipped in from God knows where,” VW owners like Brian Kolonick of Cleveland think the hassle’s worth it because, he said, “my kids think I’m cool for a minute.”

“It’s the way it smells, the way it drives, the way people look at you — you’re bringing them some level of joy,” said Kolonick, 42, who works in digital health for a company called Conversa in Portland, Oregon.

He rented a Vanagon from Sitner before he bought one and said some VW scenesters turn their nose up at him because he “can’t repair things” and has to call a mechanic. He’ll often visit Vanagon forums online, where he occasionally finds diehards dissing the Subaru engines in some custom conversions, arguing that they’re “taking away from the slow-running intensity” of the stock motor.

And it’s fair to surmise that some VW devotees think Metris owners are a tad soft. “We have friends who have them, and I’ve got to admit, we joke about their vans,” said Jim Samuel, 58, a real estate agent and University of Oregon grad in Seattle who named his 1991 Vanagon “Bertha,” after the Grateful Dead song. “But it comes down to people, ultimately.”

Joayne Andrews agrees. A 72-year-old retiree, she lives in Cathedral City, California, just east of Palm Springs, and has owned 26 Volkswagens in her lifetime, four of them vans. A Jetta is her daily ride, but when she really wants to get away, she’s got a 2000 Eurovan at home and an ’82 Westfalia stashed in Seattle that Sitner’s crew has been restoring for the past two years.

When she visits friends up and down the West Coast, she thinks her vans make her a better houseguest. “It’s nice to be able to pull into their driveway and not take up space in their house,” she said. “We’ve got our own little studio apartment.”

As for the Metris campers, her neighbour has one, and Andrews thinks “they’re lovely.”

She then added, “They’re superexpensive, but probably with what I had to have my van restored, I could have bought one.”",[]

Some of the most high-profile teenage influencers, including Hudson, had spent the previous several hours waging war on each other online in an event that became known as “TikTokalypse.”

They posted clapbacks on Twitter, stoked controversy on Instagram Live and shared cheating accusations using the Notes app. Top YouTubers like Tana Mongeau poured gasoline on the flames by reacting in real time on TikTok.

The whole event felt ripped from reality TV. Feuds, cliques and rivalries have long captivated viewers of shows like “Jersey Shore,” “The Real World” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”

Now, many wonder if a new wave of unscripted shows about the lives of young influencers could captivate the next generation of viewers. “This is a TV series waiting to be made,” Hemanth Kumar, a film critic, tweeted about the events Monday night. “Who’s calling dibs on this one?”

The race is on

Over the past several months, every major TikTok collective has taken steps to pursue a potential reality show.

Wheelhouse, a production studio, is working with the Hype House to pitch a reality show billed as “the modern day Mickey Mouse Club.” The Clubhouse, another Gen Z influencer collective, is working with ICM to shop the idea of a show around, which they hope to produce using an in-house team.

Clubhouse is also working with “Jawline” director Liza Mandelup and Concordia Studio, a production company, on a potential project. The Kids Next Door house has met with production companies.

Charli D’Amelio, the most-followed influencer on TikTok, and her family are also exploring the possibility of a reality show and have signed a production deal with Industrial Media, producer of shows like “American Idol” and “90 Day Fiancé,” her agent said.

TalentX, the management company behind the Sway House, said it hasn’t signed a shopping agreement with a production company yet, but has been taking meetings. “We are having multiple conversations now around town,” said Warren Lentz, CEO of TalentX. “It’s clear there’s a strong appetite and there’s white space that a streaming platform or network hasn’t stepped into. We have come up with five or six different show ideas that we’ve been talking with outlets about. I do know other houses are having those conversations as well.”

The boundaries between the online influencer world and reality TV are porous. Reality stars often amass large audiences on social media and pivot to full-time influencer-dom. And casting directors are known to pluck potential characters from the internet and put them on the big screen.

Tila Tequila, for instance, was a Myspace star before landing her own show. “The Amazing Race” and “Big Brother” have cast famous YouTubers in hopes of tapping into their young and engaged audiences online.

YouTube itself has greenlit many shows by its homegrown stars through its YouTube Originals program. In James Charles’ “Instant Influencer,” which premiered earlier this year as a YouTube Original, contestants compete to become the next great beauty vlogger.

But so far, there hasn’t been a hit reality show centred solely on the lives of a bunch of influencers.

The show that has come closest is “Reality House,” a 2019 unscripted series featuring a group of YouTubers living together in a giant house. YouTubers Kian Lawley and JC Caylen started the show and tried to get it picked up by a TV network or streaming service.

“We did take the show out to market but were unsuccessful in selling it,” said Andrew Graham, a talent agent at Creative Artists Agency. Still, it was a hit online. “Reality House” ran for two seasons, with a third pending, and reached nearly 1 million views per episode.

And though the idea of a group of internet-famous young people with big personalities all living together in a Los Angeles mansion may seem like a natural fit for TV, Julie Pizzi, the president of entertainment and development at Bunim Murray, a production studio behind hit shows like “The Real World” and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” said it’s much more difficult to pull off than one might imagine.

Pizzi said Bunim Murray has met with several influencer houses including Hype House, Sway House and Clubhouse. “The problems we have had is that often these houses are looked at more like a business,” she said. “They want to show the business of making these videos as opposed to the personalities and personal lives of the characters.”

“We’d have a hard time selling a show about these TikTokers doing their videos for TikTok, or getting deals with advertisers,” Pizzi said. “We’re more interested in their lifestyle and how they interact with each other, what the relationships are like between the different people in the house.”

Disparate management and representation is also an issue. In some houses, each influencer has their own separate management team and sometimes different agents. “Even just for a pitch it’s an enormous amount of legal work. You have to put every single person under contract,” Pizzi said.

Age, too, is a hurdle. While scripted shows starring teenagers and young adults like “Euphoria” and “13 Reasons Why” are huge successes, unscripted shows featuring a similar age range are less common.

“You don’t really want to put very young people in too mature situations,” Pizzi said. “It feels a little sensational. It’s very rare to even put an 18-year-old on a dating show.” Bunim Murray has had the most success with programming for Snapchat. “Endless Summer,” a docudrama series starring YouTuber Summer Mckeen, for instance, ran for several seasons on Snapchat.

“There’s very few homes for a show like this,” Graham said, referring to an influencer reality show. Though MTV did pick up a show about Mongeau for its YouTube channel, the company now seems to be “focused largely on reboots and proven Viacom/CBS talent,” Graham said.

“That’s where you’d think this show would go, but it doesn’t fit their current mandate,” he said. “You could take a swing at Netflix given that they have a number of unscripted formats that are working there — I’m thinking of ‘The Circle.’ Maybe there’s a world where you take a shot at a place like Amazon, but I don’t think there are a lot of homes for it.”

Some influencer collectives are moving forward on their own, storyboarding reality-type shows for social platforms and monetizing them through advertising deals. Henry Coxall, a founder of 404Haven, an influencer house soon to open in the Hollywood Hills, said the company has already hired an in-house production team to create a reality show on Twitch.

“We’ve discovered a big part of this online culture is feeling connected,” Coxall said. “People want to feel part of that story that’s occurring. We were like, how do we take our influencers’ lives and allow fans to get involved on a safe level that our talent feels comfortable with?”

Choose your own adventure

Many in the online creator space believe we’re only in the early stages of a significant shift in the entertainment landscape, and the first wave of Gen Z talent is just beginning to emerge.

“I think we’re going to see this whole field expand over the next year or two, and the rise of TikTok could be that catalyst,” said Avi Gandhi, executive vice president of digital at Wheelhouse. “I think the reality is a lot of content buyers and distributors, whether it’s traditional cable, streaming services or digital platforms, are looking to bring audiences their way. And they’re looking for stories from talent who have great audiences.”

Maxwell Mitcheson, head of talent at TalentX, said that “TikTok stars are the Lauren Conrads of their generation. Everything they do, for better or worse, garners traditional media coverage, from liking a shady comment to going to dinner with another creator.”

Though each of these content houses may be pitching its own show, influencers recognize the value of playing off each other. “A lot of people peg these houses against each other, but at the end of the day we’re all here to make content for our fans,” said Alex Warren, 19, a member of Hype House.

Lentz said that the way teenagers today consume drama is very different than watching a 30-minute linear TV episode.

“There’s this notion that got famous a few years ago of ‘the second screen,’” he said. “Today, there’s a third or fourth screen based on viewers on phones switching between different apps. They go back and forth between IG Live and TikTok and Twitter accounts, it’s almost like each fan is on their own choose your own adventure. They come up with their own narrative around these characters in each story.”

In that sense, he said, “Sway House is a TV show in and of itself. Hype House is a TV show in itself. In many ways, fans are already watching the TV show, just not on TV.”",[]

Read', 'Adina Bresgethe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Adina Bresgethe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"As Laura Duarte swipes through a seemingly endless stream of suitors on Tinder, she’s not only looking for a romantic spark, but COVID-19 chemistry.

In the early days of the outbreak, Duarte ruled out the duds on online dating apps who flouted lockdown rules by proposing in-person meetups.

Since then, many parts of Canada have eased social distancing restrictions to partially reopen bars and restaurants. Duarte said Toronto’s dating scene is heating up this summer, and the prospect of a real-life rendezvous no longer seems like such a remote possibility.

Still, the 25-year-old said the novel coronavirus has compounded the complications of modern courtship to the point that she’s yet to find someone who’s worth the risk.

“There’s so many intrusive questions that you have to ask,” Duarte said.

“Have you been with anyone else? Have you been tested lately? ... Are you wearing protection? Are you wearing a mask?”

Duarte is among the singles who say the pandemic has warped romantic rituals to turn casual dating into a serious commitment.

But sex is an important part of physical and mental wellness, and the desires of those looking for casual hookups should be acknowledged in public health messaging, advocates say.

For some, COVID-19 concerns have forced thorny conversations about intimacy and exclusivity before meeting face-to-face.

Awar Obob in Halifax, who is non-binary and uses the pronouns they and them, said they’ve encountered the full spectrum of romantic risk tolerance while exploring online dating apps, but none of these potential mates have proved to be a match.

“There are people who have thrown caution to the wind and say, ‘Let’s meet up right now,’” said Obob.

“Then there are the people who are so cautious that they’re like, ‘I’m not sure why I’m even on here.’”

Experts say there may be benefits to opening up communication about COVID-19 compatibility, and even public health officials could stand to be more candid about negotiating the forces of love and lust during a pandemic.

Asked if there was any way for singles to have sex safely this summer, Canada’s chief public health officer told reporters that standard social safety precautions should extend to amorous encounters, but admitted it was her first time fielding the question.

“I’m not a dating expert,” Dr. Theresa Tam said at a news conference last Friday.

“I don’t know what to say except (proceed) carefully, slowly, like all other advice on reopening social and economic activities.”

The first tip Tam offered was “don’t date if you’re sick,” noting that people can carry the virus even if they’re not showing symptoms.

She said “singular dating” is preferable to playing the field, so it’s probably best to get know someone virtually before meeting up in person.

For first date ideas, Tam suggested picking a spot outdoors at a safe distance from others, such as a picnic in the park.

The novel coronavirus is spread through respiratory droplets, so intimate contact, such as kissing, is a potential route of transmission, said Tam.

“This is a serious social contract you have with someone.”

Tam proposed a “checklist” to help daters consider how seeing someone new could have ramifications for their social circle, particularly vulnerable family members.

Winnipeg sex therapist Reece Malone said many daters are already putting this concept into practice by asking COVID-19 screening questions to gauge each other’s comfort levels.

Some of these topics can be touchy, Malone acknowledged, such as probing about a prospective partner’s recent sexual history or what kinds of physical contact they’d be open to.

But he said the process of getting to know someone before deciding whether to take things to the next level tends to pay off in the long run, both in terms of personal safety and relationship prospects.

“It’s an opportunity to increase your communication, as well as ask curious questions without the pressure of even having to meet immediately,” Malone said.

As COVID-19 brought the breakneck pace of high-speed dating to a virtual halt, Malone said many have come to appreciate the appeal of prolonged long-distance courtship, finding creative ways to fan the flames of desire from afar.

“This is bringing us back to slowing things down, getting to know somebody and expanding the quality of your relationship with that individual.”

However, delayed gratification isn’t for everyone, Malone noted. Sex can be an important piece of a person’s overall health and well-being, he said, and for some, serves as an outlet for stress during a time of extraordinary upheaval and disconnection.

Matthew Numer, an associate professor of health promotion at Dalhousie University, said in the first few months of the outbreak, public health officials took an abstinence-only approach to sex outside of live-in relationships, as characterized by the common refrain, “you are your safest sex partner.”

While that maxim may be true, it’s not always realistic, Numer said.

“Good luck in the fight against hormones,” he quipped.

We need look no further than the HIV/AIDS crisis to see the perils of stigmatizing sex during a pandemic, said Numer. And because the novel coronavirus is so transmissible, it’s all the more important to offer people tools to reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19, he said.

These harm reduction strategies should be tailored to each region, said Numer, but he expects common themes will include promoting frequent testing and wearing protection.

From public messaging to private exchanges, communicating the importance of consent will be crucial to keeping people safe, said Numer.

COVID-19 has normalized setting limits on physical contact without verbal permission, such as handshakes and hugging, Numer said. He hopes those habits will carry over to more intimate interactions, both during the pandemic and beyond.

“We need to acknowledge that we’re sexual beings and relationships are important,” he said.

“People do need connections, so how do we make that happen when we can’t always be physically connected?”",[]

Messy, gassy, and unapologetically, I take up space, much like a full-grown Saint Bernard, in my parents’ parallel universe. Sadly, the pandemic has reduced this broke-ass millennial into a drooling state of oversized adolescence. After living in a luxury granite box with six roommates (two of them were front-line workers), and surviving a turtle-slow recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, I found myself moving residences again in May 2020.

At 11 a.m., ravenous, I amble into my parents’ basement for breakfast. I count seven family-sized bags of yam tortilla chips, thirty-two cans of cream of mushroom soup, two forty-pound bags of jasmine rice, and seven bottles of blue dishwashing liquid. Name it, and we most likely have it, buried under the bulk bird seed on Shelf 8.

“Told you to always stock up for emergencies,” my mother announces. I roll my eyes, but I help her set a trap for our ongoing rodent problem.

Diaspora, like heart-exploding grief, OCD, and excessive ambition, has both wrecked and strengthened our family.

My Chinese family belongs to a particular sect of professional hoarders, and this current pandemic has only validated their lifestyle. Like many once impoverished immigrants, we have been preparing — AKA paranoid — for multiple global disasters long before COVID-19 happened. I once used to scoff at this gratuitous habit of radical saving and stockpiling on repeat, but it makes sense to me now.

For as long as I can remember, my parents have resisted the preternatural tug of the homeland. It wasn’t until March 2019 that the siren call, like severe tinnitus, became impossible to ignore. Off to Hong Kong we embarked, a place of once vicious famine and long-squashed dreams. It would be my first time in Asia, and I couldn’t bear to turn down a complimentary trip. Upon leaving Hong Kong International Airport, as if by sorcery, the humidity freshened my sandpaper skin, and volumized my iron-flat Vancouverite hair. It was as if the city was welcoming it’s long lost, weirdo daughter with a makeover.

Our week was a flurry of show and tell and, one day, we went to my parents’ respective villages. We took the MTR from Mong Kok, bussed on public transit, rode a train, which was followed by multiple taxi rides to the slums. It took 4.5 hours to get there. Finally, my mother, almost shyly, showed us her childhood home-school, built on top of a creepy open-hole graveyard, and talked about how she would play with the jutting bones of corpses as a child. The grotesque trees, arthritic-looking and uncared for, made me so sad I felt everything turn to decay inside me.

“No wonder you’re so messed up,” I blurted, and instantly regretted it.

“You’re the one who’s messed up,” she retorted in Cantonese. “Can’t do math, complains all the time about stomach aches-”

“No,” I said, shivering despite the heat. “I mean, this is why you are so scared of ghosts and starving to death.”

“Um, yeah,” she said, smacking me on the back of my head. I groaned.

But then she sighed, eyebrows furrowing together. She glanced around, no longer a simple tourist, as if really looking for the first time, seemingly sorrowful at the dilapidated graves scattered around us. Did she regret coming back? However she felt, for the first time I understood her fear of scarcity, this ancient inherited trauma.

After all, I felt diaspora was best suited for gamblers, entrepreneurs, great white sharks, and hopeless optimists. For the rest of us, mediocres and sentimentalists, when you involuntarily hop country and home, you accumulate a Tantalus gluttony, and you fill the physical void with pragmatic things that can be eaten, bartered or saved. POC, especially impoverished ones like my mother, understand that shit inevitably happens, and it’s best to be prepared. Nice housing is only provisional.

“We’re never coming back,” my mother finally pronounced, and we followed her, like a congregation of fruit flies — far away from her private destitution to our four-star hotel, our temporary home in Asia.

As for me, I didn’t mind Hong Kong at all. In fact, it felt like I had almost never left Vancouver. Everyone looked exactly like me, neither worse nor better. For the remaining trip, we ate and shopped like the middle-class we aspired to be, as if we were badass rice-eaters on vacation instead of scared immigrants on their homecoming. I arrived back in Canada with fifteen cheap polyester dresses, all beaded, lacy and ridiculous, and I decided I was ready for any literary event, Comic-Con or Halloween. It only fazed me a little that being a size 2 in North America meant that I was XXXL in Asia.

In my eccentric, complicated glory, I realized that I’d become capitalism’s bitch and my mother’s daughter: more is better and surplus is safer.

In my parents’ world, though, it often feels like I’m tumbling backwards when my peers are levelling up with adulting in the guise of matrimony, mortgages, babies, promotions. I tell myself when the pandemic is over, surely I’ll move into the RV parked on the driveway or perhaps a distant relation (that I don’t know of) will die, leaving me money and allowing me to purchase a sea vessel. Wouldn’t it be super-fun to live on a houseboat? I think excitedly. You could throw your roommates, friends, lovers, and family members overboard whenever they were too loud or obnoxious.

COVID-19 may be my generation’s diaspora, but it’s also my family’s latest, haunting trauma.

At my parents’ dwelling, I have a recurring high-stress nightmare where I am trying to frantic-pack a wheelie suitcase because the building is supposed to explode in two minutes. Panicked, I hurl clothing into a never ending black hole of fabric. Fed up, I zip up the case, but it expands like an inflatable balloon. Screeching, I beseech the suitcase to rescale to a normal size. Action-heroine I am not, and the suitcase knows this. Eventually, it grows so unwieldy and wide that it doesn’t fit through the door frame, but I’m relentless and determined enough to save all my belongings, even though I know I’m doomed. Then, as the building ignites, special effects inferno-BOOM!, homegirl wakes up-all lock-jawed, sweat-stinky, and terrified. It is a shame to lose all my things! I growl, and regretful I am in this waking life, and so I wonder where I had purchased the defective suitcase. Who do I blame, really, but myself? Anything, at any moment in flight, might turn out to be unbearable, might transform into a sign of absurdity that one might never escape.

The sign at the local splash pad has new rules: Use your elbow to push the button. Maintain physical distancing. No more than 19 people at a time.

There’s a lot to unpack for parents and caregivers as they try to keep kids cool on hot summer days, with splash pads and public pools now available for use in phase two of Ontario’s reopening plan.

With these outdoor options available for children, another challenge has emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on through the summer: how do you teach kids to play safely?

Signage on splash pads in the city provides guidance on safety measures, such as touching the button with your elbow instead of your hand. But with up to 19 people allowed at some splash pads in popular areas like Toronto’s Centennial Park, ensuring everyone follows those guidelines can be challenging.

We spoke to Dr. Upton Allen, head of infection diseases at Toronto’s SickKids Hospital, to see how parents and caregivers can take advantage of this outdoor public space while keeping themselves and their children safe.

“I try to let them recognize that once the guidelines have been issued for public play areas to open, it usually means that the risk of transmission is likely low. Kids should have fun,” Dr. Allen said, “but there are things that you really should try to do to reduce the risk and let them be aware of that.”

To help get that message across, he came up with a mnemonic called STOP N’ PLAN.

“It won’t be a one-size-fit-all type scenario, but there are some general things parents can talk about that might help them keep their children safe.”

S

Stands for staying away if a child is ill with COVID symptoms. In other words, the old principle of staying home if you’re ill.

T

It relates to touching. Speak to your kids and tell them, ‘don’t touch what is not yours.’ Tell them to focus on their equipment. Don’t be playing with other kids’ equipment or water bottles or supplies.

O

This one is more directed at the parents and stands for observe. Basically what you really want to do is to observe the surroundings, ensure they are safe and clean. Check out the washrooms ahead of time. Is there soap and water to wash your hands? Visit the particular splash pad or playground ahead of time. Know where you’re going before you go there.

P

Is for physical distancing. If you go to a particular area and it is overcrowded on that day, you may want to think, ‘do I really want to go today?’ And if you go somewhere where there’s a lineup, well, at least try and create some physical distance while waiting.

N’

Never, never, never share food or drinks. It might be obvious, but it’s important to teach young kids not to do that.

P

PPE, which is really for the parents based on their local city guidance. If parents are going to be there interacting and standing with other parents, they should have face coverings on.

L

Lave, which means washing and hygiene measures like bringing your own supplies to clean. That’s one thing I always say to the families is to remember to take your wipes, your hand sanitizer, and it’s probably not a bad idea to invest in a Lysol spray to be ready to clean an area that is frequently touched like a table — especially if it’s indoors.

A

Simply avoiding touching your face, eyes and mouth. Kids love to do that, so you can encourage them, but you know they’re still going to do it.

N

Stands for networking among parents at the facilities. If you go somewhere where you know people, that’s always good, but the key is to be able to share information and emphasize the importance that everyone remembers we’re all in this together. Parents need to remember that they could be a source of infection — it’s not just the children.

Dr. Allen said it’s important for kids to be aware of where they are going and why they need to be taking these precautions if they are old enough to understand these conversations. For the younger ones, it can be helpful to focus on short, simple mantras like “hands clean.”

He emphasized that there is a risk in contracting the virus in these settings, much like anywhere else, but it is a low one.

“You want kids to have fun. At the point when the city says you can go out, generally it’s a reflection of advice coming from experts and the risk is low. Given that we’re all in this together, collectively there are things we might be able to do to make that low risk even lower.”

But the internet contains some proper gems that get more interesting the longer you watch, all easily searchable on YouTube or other sites as indicated.

Diane Dufresne: Symphonique n’ Roll at the Colisée de Québec (1988)

It’s a crying shame that the rest of Canada doesn’t know Quebec’s reigning art-rock diva of the 1980s and ’90s, but this is probably because Dufresne never bothered with the Anglo markets. Before Bjork’s swan, Madonna’s Gaultier cones and Lady Gaga’s meat dress, there was Diane Dufresne and … any number of spectacular dresses, featured in several concerts now available on YouTube. In Symphonique n’ Roll, Dufresne sings symphonic arrangements of her synth hits and, at one point, wears a dress train with wheels covered in musical instruments, with a violin on her head. But the outfits are the least of it: the punk attitude, the hysteria, the ownership of the text, the unfailing musical instincts and the tongue-in-cheek moments all make for an exciting spectacle. Follow along with the lyrics if possible: her knack for turning them into dramatic monologues is something to behold. There’s also a Mahler song and a Verdi aria in the program, and she shines in both.

Julie Andrews Sings Her Favorite Songs (1989)

“You could say my mom was a bit of a stage mom,” says Andrews as she introduces Noel Coward’s “Mrs. Worthington,” and interrupts the singing with memories of performing with her mother’s and stepfather’s double act. The embodiment of all that is good manners and polish, Andrews started off on the wrong side of the tracks, entertainment-wise: music hall stages in the small towns of England. She loved every moment of it, she recollects, especially the short lady by the name of Ella Shields who was a male impersonator and who would dress up as an elegant bum for “Burlington Bertie from Bow.” Which Andrews proceeds to sing (and dance) herself. There is a risqué and elaborately set up #MeToo joke a quarter of an hour later, a hot rendition of “Le Jazz Hot” from “Victor/Victoria” and a lot more lanky dancing before she changes into a silver gown for the only sedate portion of the evening. Unlike most of her movies, this is not family-friendly and so much better for it.

La Traviata

There’s an intriguing recent Paris Opera staging of this Verdi opera available at Medici.tv, free with a Toronto Public Library card. Fronted by the charismatic South African soprano Pretty Yende, the production sets the Verdi-Dumas classic in the present time, with Violetta Valéry as an Instagram influencer, girl-about-town famous for being famous, both feted and owned by her followers in that unique way that social media celebrities are. By way of video projections, there are status updates and photo uploads happening seemingly in real time throughout the opera. In the final act, when illness strikes, millions of virtual friends are reduced to a single one in flesh and blood. In at least two operatic classics, sopranos die due to respiratory illness (tuberculosis); it can’t be long before COVID-19 becomes a dramatic device in productions of “La Traviata” and “La Bohème”

For the Gen-X set

There are a lot of concerts for the discerning Gen-Xer online — after all, the concert as an art form was created as members of that generation were coming into youth culture. Pet Shop Boys’ Electric Tour (2013) is a fantastic hybrid of light projections and electronica, aptly directed for video. There’s New Order in Berlin (2012), geezers by now but still having it. The 1998 Depeche Mode Live in Cologne, recorded for MTV, shows Dave Gahan’s baritone at peak suavity. There’s also Arcade Fire Live at Lollapalooza in 2017; and Oasis in Manchester in 2005, before an insane number of people, as the 1990s’ last hurrah. But for the sheer propulsion, visceral onslaughts and brain food, these are two standouts: Eurythmics Live in Sydney from 1987 and the Jonathan Demme-directed recording of the Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense, preserved on DVD and BluRay.

Laurie Anderson Home of the Brave (1986)

This is the young Laurie Anderson: playful and childlike as she moves between instruments and guest musicians, voice and sound modulation, recorded and live. No melancholy of “O Superman” here, nor the gravitas of “From the Air” — this is as carefree and fun as avant-garde song-making gets.

Mozart Great Mass in C minor

Insula Orchestra — named after the part of the brain that turns inchoate sensations into conscious emotions — is one of France’s several orchestras run by women conductors. Mozart’s “Mass in C-minor” was its first big statement to the world. An old church was opened for the purposes of this recording for the Arte TV network and four superb soloists hired. Period instruments are different from modern symphonic orchestras: sound comes across as smudgier and more in-between because they’re differently tuned and produced by different materials, gut strings not steel or nylon, and horns that come valveless, like bugles. In other words, the impression of precision and sharpness is harder to achieve, and Insula and the chorus do this — but observe the conductor, Laurence Equilbey. Hers is not a style of strict beat-tracking; it’s more of a trance from the first big tutti in Kyrie on. It’s a great pleasure to observe women owning such muscular and masculine works as Mahler’s 5th (see for example, Han-na Chang when she next guest-conducts the TSO) or Holst’s “The Planets” (Susanna Mälkki), but witnessing this kind of helplessness before the ineffability of music, as evinced by Equilbey, is a pleasure of a different, more poignant kind.

Making something is a great way to escape the stresses of everyday life, helping to distract you — even if just for a few minutes — from the reality of living in the midst of a pandemic.

Crafts like knitting keep our hands and minds busy and can be therapeutic, says Amelia Lyon, who owns Yarns Untangled, a knitting shop in Kensington Market.

It’s not uncommon for customers to come into the shop looking for ways to relax and de-stress, says Lyon, who has had customers stop in because a therapist or friend prescribed it. “It can help relax you, the repetitive action of your hands, the same one or two stitches over and over. Some days I get wound up and I realize it’s because I haven’t knit in a little while. I pick up my needles and calm right down.”

From knitting to folding origami or updating old furniture with paint, here are some crafts to help you pass the time and feel a little more relaxed — using stuff you probably have at home or can easily get at a local shop with curbside pickup.

Keep little hands occupied with origami

All you need is paper and a little patience to make simple origami creations. There are countless shapes to fold paper into; the paper crane may be the most well-known design of the age-old Japanese art. It’s a great craft to keep kids entertained and, as an added bonus, it requires minimal materials and makes very little mess.

Any type of paper can be cut into a square and used to fold origami, says Jocelyn Tamura, a student at the University of Toronto and member of UTFold, an origami club whose community projects include an origami program at the Hospital for Sick Children. Origami is a way for patients to relax, says Tamura, who hosts workshops that patients and their families can attend before or after appointments.

“It requires focus and distracts from any other thoughts or worries related to their hospital visit; it’s similar in some ways to meditation,” says Tamura. “Instead of focusing on the breath, we focus on the folds of the paper. It’s surprised me how much it can help young children, who may start off in a bad mood and leave far happier and calmer.”

If you don’t have origami paper on hand, it’s easy to make your own squares. A typical A4 size sheet of paper works perfectly. Help younger children get started by cutting paper into squares and try models beforehand to make sure the difficulty level is appropriate. Tamura recommends choosing simple models like animals and paper airplanes to start.

There are lots of how-to videos online but, for inspiration, look to Oriland, an online paper fantasyland of origami creations run by internationally recognized artists Katrin and Yuri Shumakov from Toronto. Learn origami, find 70-plus free design diagrams and instructions on basic folds. The couple have written over 30 books about origami and created more than 800 unique designs.

Jump on the dried flower trend

It’s no secret that flowers are a great pick-me-up, but fresh flowers don’t last forever, which could be one of the reasons dried flowers are making a comeback.

“Dried flower arrangements now make up about one-third of our business” says Shannon Whelan, a floral designer and owner of Euclid Farms in Toronto. “The idea of buying something that you can enjoy, and will also dry and last, definitely makes sense,” says Whelan. “If a bouquet doesn’t sell I can hang them upside down and dry them.”

It’s easy to do yourself. All you need are fresh flowers and string. After you’ve enjoyed the flowers, tie string around the stems and hang them upside down so they are spaced apart. Keep them out of direct sunlight and humidity, and leave them to dry until the base of the flower head is strong and brittle, about two to four weeks.

A good rule of thumb is to choose blooms with a woody stem and avoid flowers that hold a lot of water, like tulips, which have thick, watery stems that won’t dry well and end up mouldy, says Whelan. Opt for heartier stems like roses, hydrangea varieties like Annabelle, or eucalyptus.

Get creative arranging dried blooms in vases, jars or other containers that you have around the house. A quick search online will yield project ideas and video tutorials, from making a wreath to something as simple as filling a cloche with leftover dried flower heads. “People are buying gold hoops to use as wreath frames and only decorating one small portion of it, and it becomes this really interesting hanging element,” says Whelan.

Learn how to knit

Anyone can learn to knit, says Lyon of Yarns Untangled, which offers small-run, hand-dyed yarn suited to Toronto’s knitting and crochet community. “I have yet to find somebody that I can’t teach to knit, if they want to learn. It just takes the right combination of tools and the right teacher, video or instruction,” says Lyon, who learned to knit as a child.

Beginners should learn the basics by focusing on smaller projects like a mug cosy or coaster, before moving on to bigger projects like a sweater or blanket, says Lyon. “A lot of people start with a scarf, but these days we’ve been gently steering people away from that, because they take a really long time. The beginning of your project is going to look like you were learning, but by the end it will look smooth.”

Stick to an acrylic blend yarn when starting out; it’s inexpensive and a basic approachable material, says Lyon. She also steers beginners away from traditional straight needles to circular needles, which are more versatile and just as easy to use.

While the shop’s classes have been cancelled and weekly stitch nights have moved online due to COVID-19, Lyon recommends online for how-to videos or books. “Once you know the basic stitch, you can make a scarf, a hat, all kinds of different things.”

Use paint to transform old furniture

Spring is a good time to get outside and start a paint project. Whether it’s an old chair or table in need of sprucing up, or painting terracotta pots — perfect for the kids — painting can be a relaxing and satisfying DIY.

“It’s wonderfully soothing to pick up a paintbrush,” says Annie Sloan, an artist and inventor of Chalk Paint by Annie Sloan. Her first flagship shop opened its doors in Toronto last spring.

“Finding a creative outlet can make a huge difference to one’s well-being during these worrying times. If you are able to get your hands on a tin, then now’s the time to start painting those walls or transforming a piece of furniture,” says Sloan.

If you’ve got a little leftover paint from a past project, try adding a stripe or two to jugs and vases, or stencil trays and tables: the simplest splashes of colour and pattern can breathe fresh life into your home and can also be a great way to keep children occupied.

Get creative with some fruit and vegetable printing. “It’s not just for potatoes,” says Sloan. “Try using some lemons, limes, peppers, okra or whatever you have available in the kitchen, to add some fun prints to napkins or an old tablecloth.”

Read', 'Debra Norton Special To The Starthu.']",2020-04-09,"Two years ago, clothing designer Kate Theriault was at home healing from an injury and needed something to occupy her hands and mind, so she turned to sashiko – the centuries old Japanese art of mending.

“In that moment, when I knew I needed to mend myself, I was looking around for something to do, and sashiko came back to me,” says Theriault who had taken a sashiko workshop a couple of years before. “I was mending myself, my garments and I started to think, what else could I mend in my life?” says Theriault, a life-long sewer who teaches mindful mending and sashiko workshops in Guelph, Ontario, and sells sashiko supplies at her online shop Cedars + Sage.

Even if you’ve never heard of sashiko, which translates as “little stabs,” you may be familiar with the look which includes bold geometric patterns hand-stitched with white thread onto indigo dyed fabric. It’s a type of mending that is meant to be seen.

The technique originated in rural, northern Japan about 400 years ago to mend and patch clothes, extending the life and increasing the warmth of worn garments with added layers of cloth.

Today, visible mending is also an antidote to fast fashion – enabling crafters to mend rips, tears and general wear of clothing and other textiles, and it’s having a revival.

“We are becoming more conscious of our impact on the earth. This is a way to lesson our impact, to not throw away things, to keep them and avoid buying more,” says Theriault. “I also feel that anything that is working with our hands is having a bit of a revival right now.”

Toronto maker Stacey Sproule has seen a surge of interest in the craft since she started teaching visible mending classes in 2015. Classes would get cancelled, rarely selling out, but in the last year or so, she says every class has sold out.

“My workshops are aimed at getting you ready to feel empowered to start fixing your clothes. But I think that to say that you have to do this because it’s pragmatic is not enough, it’s visually satisfying too – it’s good for the planet and also beautiful – it’s a win-win,” says Sproule.

The craft appeals to everyone from sewers to people who haven’t worked with a needle and thread at all and makers such as Sproule say that the craft appeals to all ages – from younger people in their mid-twenties to the elderly.

Locally, the craft is taking off with shops such as The Make Den on Sterling Rd. and The Workroom on Queen St. offering workshops and classes.

Mending forces us to slow down.

Judith Martin is a Canadian textile artist from Manitoulin Island who uses naturally dyed thread and cloth to create hand stitched quilts. “Stitching the quilts makes me feel good,” says Martin. “I do this repetitive motion with my hands and run my hands over this beautiful texture that I’ve made, I feel better, I slow down and I think about things that come into my head and solve problems.”

Craft enthusiast Julie Cathro-Silver, took a sashiko workshop after noticing it had become trendy. She’s still working on mending the jeans she started and during this period of social distancing has started working on them again. “I’ve always found creativity to be therapeutic, with Sashiko mending, it’s the same thing — sitting with a project, even when my skills aren’t great, feels good, peaceful, and calming … the tactile nature of sewing is something that is very therapeutic to me, especially when the world is in full blown chaos.”

Although there are rules around sashiko, such as: the size of stitch (¼ inch, which works out to be the same size as a short grain of rice), the size of the spaces in between, stitches must be done in an order — all the horizontal lines and then all the vertical lines no matter how intricate your pattern. There is a lot of mindful thought in how you prepare to stitch but “the stitch itself – a running stitch, is the most basic stitch you can do,” says Sproule. “I’ve never had anyone throw up their arms and say I can’t do this.”

Basically, all you need is a needle and thread to get started. The idea is that you’re gathering several stitches of material onto a needle and then pulling it through, rather than going up and down, so a long needle is helpful. “But you can still do it with any needle,” says Sproule. “It’s just going to feel a little bit different.” If you can’t get hold of sashiko needles, long darner needles also work, and although 100 per cent cotton Japanese floss works best, in a pinch, you could use embroidery floss. When tackling a mending project, she recommends starting with woven materials such as cotton, linen or denim.

“I like to talk about it as feeling empowered to repair the things that you love. Nothing is hopeless. It’s a meditation on hope in some ways,” says Sproule.

Arts and crafts are often a go-to activity for parents and whether that includes a box of crayons and a sheet of paper or something more complex, the experience of taking a moment to create something can also offer a little bit of comfort in these uncertain times.

“Making space for creativity is transformative,” says Heather Phillips, owner of Articulations an art store in Toronto’s Junction neighbourhood. “We’ve always been big believers in daily creativity. Just taking the time to be present in the moment and create something is important for your well-being.” Phillips says she could sense the collective uncertainty in the community and a lot of idle hands, so she decided to do something to help parents. In just a few days, the store created, packaged and distributed 120 Stay Home Art Kits to give to families for free or by donation.

“We couldn’t offer any programs because we all have to stay home so we thought it would be nice to just share the items that we have. Whatever we had in the studio, we packaged them up into bite-sized pieces that parents could share with their kids,” says Phillips, who advertised the project on social media. “The response was insane, as soon as I posted the information online, the appointment slots quickly sold out.”

The kits were made up of a combination of used and new materials that the shop had accumulated from running children’s art programming over the past eight years, and included materials to create crafts such as hand puppets, paper weaving, acrylic painting and card making kits.

Phillips says that there are lots of crafts that you can do with materials around the house, including the recycling bin – such as painting cardboard boxes, using Styrofoam containers to make stamps or creating a family time capsule as a snapshot of this unique time together.

Here are 7 crafty activities that will help keep little hands busy and can be ordered online from local shops or downloaded for free.

Toronto artist Lindsay Stephenson created a series of free colouring sheets that can be downloaded from her shop The Penny Paper Co.

Stephenson says she finds the act of colouring meditative not only for her but also her 9-year old son Oscar. “It’s amazing how quiet the room goes as everyone focuses on their own sheets.”

Go ahead, let the kids draw on the walls with a giant colouring poster that can be hung on a wall or placed on the floor. Kids can colour and doodle to their hearts content. Order online from the Roncesvalles neighbourhood shop Early Bird & Worm - have it shipped or if you live locally, take advantage of the free porch drop-off. Giant Colouring Poster, $22.

Cross Stitching is a great hands-on craft for kids. With only one basic stitch to master, it’s a great introduction to embroidery. Stitching helps them to hone fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination and because it uses a blunt-end embroidery needle, it’s not as sharp as a sewing needle. The colourful over-the-rainbow cross stitch kit from Diana Watters Handmade is a fun starter project that includes everything they need to get started making a rainbow keychain or backpacker charm. Over the Rainbow Cross Stitch Kit, $22.

Adrian Ocneanu and Britta Evans-Fenton of Low Poly Crafts, create a line of pre-cut, pre-scored ready to assemble paper kits to DIY your own geometric wall art. They are offering free, downloadable projects that families can print at home and work on together. Ocneanu says that after sending a few kits to quarantined family members living in Italy, they realized how important it was to have something to fill their time. “That made me realize that our work is more meaningful now, in these times of social distancing, yet not everyone is aware of us or able to purchase our products.” So, they created a line of small print-at-home “Stay Safe, Craft Away” kits, and although the projects are generally meant for adults or older kids - the free, printable kits allow for a lot of trial and error and keep little, crafty hands busy and out of trouble.

His youngest (mid-20s, employed full-time) was living with us when the pandemic hit.

He’s the only stepchild of mine who’s never warmed up to me. He’s dismissive of me (and his father) and can be overtly rude.

He chose to self-quarantine with his relatively new boyfriend, who then moved in with us, too! He’s made little effort to get to know us.

Both were temporarily laid off and living nocturnally with noisy midnight feasts.

Despite receiving government financial assistance, my husband bought their groceries and alcohol (they’ve never offered to help out and they only clean up after themselves from eating).

Their interpretation of social distancing is far looser than ours. Our other children have been very cautious and only do curbside visits.

Both my husband and I are caring for aging parents (all mid-90s!) in their own homes. We’re terrified about exposing them to COVID-19.

Each time my stepson pushes for “more” relaxation of the lockdown (parties in the yard, haircuts, etc.), we’ve asked him to wait and explained why.

He then becomes rude, threatening and disrespectful to my husband.

I feel that if he wants to live like an adult making his own choices he should move out into his own place, which he can afford.

It’s causing great stress in our marriage and I don’t know how much more I can take. It’s also beginning to affect my physical and mental health. I feel unsafe in my own home, always wiping down everything, yet have no say.

Is it wrong to feel that we, as the true adults in the home, have a right to only move into Phase 2 at our comfort level?

What rights do these young adults have, making decisions that could be risky for others who are more vulnerable in our bubble?

They’ve been able to get out for walks and runs, have backyard visits to their other sets of parents, go for drives …

We’re just pleading with them to stay home as much as possible.

I know that I’ll have to re-emerge into this new world but feel that, given resurgences in the states that have opened too quickly, I’d rather wait this out a little bit longer.

I believe that my husband and I should have the right to make that decision in our own home.

Who Should Rule Our Home?

A: These are not kids, but they’re acting like spoiled teenagers avoiding any responsibilities.

They’re old enough to care for, and can afford, a home that they can rent together.

Your stepson’s been rude and thoughtless, taken advantage of his father and your joint hospitality to both him and a boyfriend you two hardly knew.

They’ve demonstrated no gratitude, offered no help and argued against your efforts to protect your elderly parents.

Whatever kept your stepson distant from you in the past, you’ve accommodated him long enough during the unusual demands of a pandemic.

His father also needs to tell his son, kindly but firmly, that it’s clear that he is ready for a great deal more say in how he lives.

And the natural and logical way for that to happen is by moving to his own home.

No other choice, no further indulgence, no more needless strain on your marriage during a time that’s stressful enough when aged parents’ lives need protection.

He’s from Eastern Europe, a completely different culture from mine. He’s so passionate about everything he does and about whatever other people do.

He’s sometimes an angry man who’ll say anything in front of anyone, without caring about the consequences.

What triggers his anger could be a small thing that he’ll yell and complain about.

But if I oppose his angry behaviour (e.g. by asking, “How can you talk like this …?”) he’ll turn to verbal abuse.

If I keep arguing, he could proceed to physical abuse.

However, when things are good, he’s caring, loving and understanding.

But as soon as he gets angry (even at his own boss sometimes), he becomes a volcano of dissatisfaction, saying negative things about me, my family, people in general, the world.

He doesn’t care about what other people may think about him.

Also, when he gets angry and behaves insanely, he later apologizes, saying that he shouldn’t have done it, that he cannot control his anger.

Then I try to sit down with him and extract the reason. He’ll talk about how his mother was depressed when he was a child, ignoring him and not caring about him. She once put a knife on his neck.

He’ll say how the Balkan War affected him …

What confuses me more is that he’s very supportive of my work and success.

I don’t know if the problem is in me because, when he gets angry, I can’t handle his loud, scary voice so I argue back in that moment of anger, which escalates things more.

Is He a Narcissist?

A: His eruptive, angry and dangerous behaviour is the problem here, not your uncertainty as to which label it falls under.

More important, don’t ever again question whether the problem is, as you wrote, “in me.” No, it’s deeply in him, sometimes rising harshly against you as physical abuse.

He needs professional therapy, but you can’t be the one to tell him so or his reaction may be extreme.

Be prepared to leave quickly if his abuse escalates.

FEEDBACK: Regarding the woman whose husband had secretly willed the vacation home she’d renovated with her own money to his children (June 2):

Reader: “For anyone contemplating marrying someone or living common-law: if your partner owns a house or cottage and you intend to put money into it, see a lawyer first to have the title changed to either joint tenancy or tenants in common.

“In Ontario, a will made prior to marriage is automatically revoked upon marriage unless it’s made in contemplation of the marriage with reference to the upcoming marriage and naming the spouse.”

She plans to travel exotic parts of the world with her baby just a few months after it’s born.

My daughter is a sweet, loving person but not very practical. She’s a steady, responsible worker and has some savings, but she can only rely for extras on her maternity-leave income. We’re not rich parents.

But she already told me that she’d be expecting hands-on help from me and her father, with no realization that his serious health problems will limit his helping with a newborn.

She also wants us to travel to meet her and the infant in the different countries she plans to visit.

The pregnancy is still very early. I told her to have an abortion. She’s already done so with past pregnancies so she said she’ll have to think about it.

But there’s a limit on how long she can take, if she’s to have a legal abortion.

She’s seeing a doctor soon. What should I do to get her to give up this pregnancy? Would you tell her to get an abortion?

Very Worried Mother

A: The decision to have or not have an abortion is not one I’d ever advise on from this column, which deals with relationships, not the religious factors nor medical issues nor human values that may be involved in that decision.

But there are other issues involved regarding your daughter’s life, which you as her mother can/should discuss with her.

One is her lack of personal responsibility regarding sex. At 29, and having already had unwanted pregnancies, she’s apparently not bothered to prevent them.

She also seems to envision an infant as a doll that she can easily transport in a backpack along with her other portable belongings.

If your daughter is as offhand, casual, impetuous and free-spirited as she sounds, she needs a lot of input from you about getting informed on infant care, necessary precautions regarding tropical diseases, travel restrictions due to the pandemic if it hasn’t disappeared, etc.

While I won’t tell her to have an abortion, I will tell her this: It takes a lot more than pregnancy to be a mother.

She needs to start acting like one now — by discussing her plans with her doctor, taking prenatal courses, talking to a tropical disease specialist about the advisability of taking an infant on such a trip, etc., etc.

Q: On a vacation last year, my husband was always eager to go to the lobby to access free Wi-Fi there.

I once caught him texting a friend’s girlfriend about what she was wearing. Confronted, he said she was talking about what she planned to wear to a wedding. He was short with me.

We’ve been married for 30 years with three kids and five grandkids.

I’ve caught him in a couple of lies. When confronted, he’d change his stories. He’ll go on and on … still lying, but being abrupt with me.

His family’s so dysfunctional. Two brothers are cheaters and the sister’s husband is questionable.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-01-09,"This story is part of a week-long series on dieting in 2020. Next up: Dieting and social media.

With a new year comes new trends. But when it comes to diet culture, a quick scan of the glossy magazines at grocery store checkouts shows how much we prize the dramatic weight loss story.

But just what effect does all this diet talk have on children?

Sarah Landry — known as @thebirdspapaya to her over 814K Instagram followers — has been vocal in her efforts to change how we talk about and display the diversity of the human body.

Landry, who lives outside of Toronto, went through a transformation several years ago, losing roughly 110 pounds in the span of a few years, ultimately dropping to an unhealthy weight for her — 114 pounds — and a size zero.

It wasn’t until she reached her “goal weight,” that she realized she wasn’t happy, nor was she healthy.

People were still congratulating her, even after she lost even more weight because of stress and life circumstances.

“I began to realize how many red flags there were toward diet culture and disordered eating,” says Landry. “It was unhealthy ... It was almost impossible to maintain (my weight) with how little I could eat and how much I had to exercise to stay that weight.”

She was obsessively calorie counting, weighing herself multiple times a day, and exercising out of guilt and fear around food and weight gain.

The mother of three wanted to set a better example for her children, especially her two daughters, Jemma, 11 and Maya, 13.

“It bothered me when my daughter, Jemma, was speaking about me and said to me something like ‘People love you for your weight loss,” said Landry.

And yet, her transformation story and her powerful posts on Instagram about accepting her body, landed her dedicated followers, magazine covers and media attention.

As she struggled with where the weight loss ended and she began, she worried what affect this behaviour was having on her kids.

“I can’t control TV and how inclusive it is but I can control the words that come out of my mouth and the conversations we have at home, and it starts with how I talk about myself and what I’m proud of,” Landry said.

After Jemma commented about the praise her mom receives, Landry made immediate changes, starting in their home. “There’s no diet culture talk allowed at home. We’ve gotten rid of scales in the house. I don’t want there to be this defining moment for them that they have a number. I want to continue to have a redirection of conversation and a change in the ways we talk about our bodies and ourselves,” said Landry.

Kyla Fox, clinical therapist and an eating disorder specialist, tells the Star that kids are sponges to their surroundings and are acutely attuned to their caregivers and their environment.

“The ways you feel about food and your body will be a mirror for your children. More of the work is on caregivers to heal themselves and their ideologies around food and their body in order to influence a positive relationship for their children,” says Fox. “If you don’t believe in the messages you’re hoping to instill like, ‘everything in moderation,’ ‘beauty from the inside out,’ ‘love the skin you’re in,’ neither will your kids.

Fox who has two young daughters, struggled with an eating disorder when she was younger and noticed care gaps and fundamental flaws in the treatment and recovery approach, which is why she developed The Kyla Fox Centre, a clinical and holistic eating disorder centre in Toronto.

The language we use within the house around food affects kids from a young age so it’s important to be mindful about talking about healthy dietary habits, she said.

But how can parents change the conversation to have a positive effect on their kids?

“To feel healthy is to learn how to live healthier. Perhaps the conversation is more about that. Mom wants to live her best life, feel stronger, happier, safer, share feelings more easily, take up more space in the world, go after what matters, listen in to her body more, understand what makes her feel full,” said Fox. “If we lived in a world where there was more open and honest communication about how to really feel healthy, we would be tapping in way deeper to ourselves and to each other.”

While parents can monitor language at home, they can’t control external forces that play on a child’s insecurities. This includes comments by other children or things they see on social media. Fox says a parent should be attentive to a child’s behaviour and address issues as soon as they are noticed. Is your tween reading calories on labels and selecting the item with a few less? If so, this is an opportunity to educate, have a deeper conversation to discover the root of why they’re behaving this way.

“The relationship your child develops with their body is an articulation of the way your child feels about themselves. And so being emotionally filled up — emotionally communicative, emotionally able to process, emotionally validated, emotionally supported — means that a child will be less likely to take out their feelings on their body through food. People who love themselves don’t hurt themselves,” said Fox.

“The only way to actively support others is to not hide behind your concerns, but address them. ‘Hey, I noticed you’re doing these things now that you didn’t do before, are you OK? Why do you think you have started this? Know that I’m here for you and want to be able to talk honestly.’ Opening up space for a bigger, safer conversation is key to bringing someone’s suffering/rituals/preoccupations forward,” said Fox.

Jemma now has an Instagram account of her own, bearing witness to her mom’s positive messaging, affirmations and body empowerment.

“As parents we can get so caught up being distracted by our bodies that we forget how many amazing things are going on around us,” Landry said.

Instead of asking your partner or friends whether an outfit makes you look fat, or asking how many calories are in something, or constantly complaining about having to lose 10 more pounds — all which create a negative dialogue for children — share what you love about yourself, she said.

Landry suggests “being mindful about how we speak about ourselves, and reminding each other to not comment on others bodies, when it comes up.”

Most importantly, don’t speak poorly about yourself, she said.

It’s not easy to learn to do but “When you take that out of the picture, you can connect more fully. More completely,” said Landry.

“I’m proud I got to change my own tune and have (my kids) be witness to it,” she said.",[]

What’s the first thing everyone does when they set out to lose weight? Join the gym.

That might be an important symbolic gesture. And it’s certainly good for other reasons. But it’s probably not going to help you lose a lot of weight, despite what most of us think. That message is starting to get out there, thanks, in part, to internet advice suggesting we put less stock in exercise to lose weight. Or, as the clickbait headlines put it, “Stop exercising to lose weight.”

The headlines might be misleading (we’ll get to that), but they are getting more people to face a certain reality: We burn way fewer calories than we think we do, even with a rigorous workout.

“It breaks down to the fact that it’s really hard to exercise enough to make a really big caloric deficit,” says Dr. Jennifer Kuk, associate professor at York University’s Faculty of Health. “When you look at shows like The Biggest Loser, people have to quit their jobs and exercise all day to get into the thousand calories of energy expenditure range, which is what you need for fast and dramatic weight loss.”

And, despite the fact that many of us have fitness apps on our phones and wrists, few of us are really thinking about what our calorie expenditures really mean—when translated into food. We have a tendency to over-estimate what we burn and underestimate what we consume and, as a result, some people over-compensate for lost energy by indulging in an over-the-top post-workout binge that’s three or four more times what they just lost. Stories of marathon runners who gained weight while training (often from sugary beverages) surface pretty regularly, demonstrating that even so-called “extreme athleticism” doesn’t give people a carte blanche to eat anything they want.

“We are so much better at eating back the calories than we are at exercising,” says Dr. Kuk, “I used to work in fitness clubs that had those organic healthy stores with the shakes and the cookies and I would see people on the treadmill, then see what they consumed afterwards. I guarantee you they more than doubled the number of calories they burnt.”

That doesn’t mean we should give up or cut back on exercising, though. Dr. Kuk, whose research is on obesity, diet and physical activity, says benefits transcend weight loss, and is alarmed that some people might be getting the wrong idea from online headlines.

“I know where that advice comes from,” she explains, “Basically there have been studies that have looked at different doses of exercise and divided people into three groups, thinking that the groups that did the most exercise would lose more weight. Instead, there was a tapered effect and the people doing the most exercise lost less than what you might expect. They actually did a little bit worse than the group below them.”

Dr. Kuk says that study started a debate about exercise and its relationship to weight loss, noting that it’s still unclear whether or not surpassing the “threshold of vigorous exercise,” really makes us eat more. Another interpretation, for example, could be that, having really gone to town at the gym, people are more likely to give themselves the rest of the day off—and fail to burn the calories they normally would. Either way, some clinical studies working on reversing Type-2 diabetes have actually discouraged subjects from increasing exercise while trying to lose weight.

Of course, this all assumes you’re exercising to lose weight. There are a lot of other reasons to hit the gym, advises Dr. Jason Fung, a well-known Toronto diet doctor and author of the forthcoming The Obesity Code Cookbook.

“I always say it’s like brushing your teeth,” says Dr. Fung. “It’s good to do it everyday so you’ll have better breath and fewer cavities, but don’t expect it to help you lose weight. It’s the same with exercise. You’re going to get benefits, but weight loss is something that’s really very inefficiently done by focusing on the exercise.”

Dr. Fung says we should think of diet and exercise as two separate things, with exercise playing a very small supporting role in weight loss. Instead, we should focus our energies on eating less and eating better food. “Willpower is sort of a finite resource,” he says, “So if you’re spending all your willpower on getting up and running, even when you don’t want to, you’re going to have less strength to avoid the foods that are testing you, like the donuts that are sitting in front of you at the Tim Hortons.”

So maybe keep on exercising, just maybe stop exercising to lose weight. Instead, he suggests we exercise to improve flexibility and/or become stronger. That’s something Dr. Kuk would agree with, given her research has shown that, even if people fail to lose a single pound, health risks associated with obesity can be mitigated with regular physical activity.

“Exercising for 30 minutes every day, even going for a walk after lunch, has been associated with beneficial effects for blood pressure, mental health and energy levels,” she says. “I mean, there are so many positive health effects from physical activity just, unfortunately, it isn’t as good at helping you lose weight as most people think.”

So go ahead and join the gym. Just don’t count on it as the key to shed pounds. And maybe try to find a fitness club that doesn’t have a handy little shake shack to tempt you into gaining back all those calories before you even walk out the door.",[]

Diets are so last year.

That’s the message a lot of registered dietitians are hoping to get out there, in hopes of convincing people not to embark on a new diet — any new diet — as a New Year’s resolution. Why not? Because nutrition experts are trying to encourage people to give “lifestyle management” a shot instead.

“The idea of following a diet is something we’ve been walking away from for a very long time,” explains Joanne Lewis, director of healthcare provider education and engagement at Diabetes Canada. “In fact, we try very hard not to use the word ‘diet’ anymore, because changing behaviour is not something that comes easily to people in general, since humans adopt their eating habits over time. It’s not something we can just flip a switch and easily change.”

That’s one reason most diets tend to fail the vast majority of people. One registered dietitian recently told me the average time people stick to a diet is about 30 days — and three months is a real success story. It might be thrilling to radically change-up your diet and feel like you’re really making a difference — at first. However, big changes don’t tend to survive the first high-stress period at work, or the first family vacation.

Worse, perhaps, is the fact that diets are a one-size-fits-all solution, as opposed to a plan for change based on an individual’s tastes, needs and limitations (be they time or money). At its best, lifestyle management begins with a solid assessment of your actual lived life to see what can be changed and what cannot. When done in a clinical setting to help a person dealing with, say, an obesity-related illness, it’s called a “lifestyle intervention,” meaning the patient has outside help, like a coach or nutritionist. Lewis says it’s not impossible to do on our own, although she strongly suggests people enlist friends or family to support lifestyle changes.

“To start off, before you change anything, just write down everything that you consume every day for a few days, making sure to include a weekend in there,” she advises. “People are much more successful when they start keeping a food diary and really look at it. The reality is most people know what they should be doing but don’t know where to start. They can start to see where they can make changes when it’s all laid out in front of them.”

From there, a lifestyle coach would suggest starting with one small change that can be made relatively easily. Lewis uses the example of starting to eat breakfast, if, say, you’re the sort of person who skips it, then becomes so hungry later that you overeat. Once eating breakfast is old hat, it’s time to introduce a new habit, like, for instance, taking a walk after lunch. Once you’ve mastered that, cut out that afternoon frappuccino and drink hot tea instead. The key here is to think about what needs to be done, then wade in slowly, getting used to the temperature.

That’s not nearly as sexy as plunging right into, say, the grapefruit diet, which dangles the promise of nine pounds lost over seven short days. We seem to fall for these diets time and again, mainly because we’re not satisfied with gradual weight loss.

“I think you don’t notice gaining two or three or four pounds in one year, but then, you know, cumulatively, after say five years, you start to notice it,” says Lewis. “And then one day it hits you. Nothing fits and then you want to go back to where you were five years ago right away, not realizing that it took you five years to put the weight on in the first place.”

In a 2006 book, Mindless Eating, Dr. Brian Wansink suggested we’d all be better off if we could get used to the idea of taking weight off slowly (the way we put it on in the first place) instead of being determined to take it all off at once. He says gradual weight loss is much easier, since our bodies fight against low-calorie deprivation diets by going into “conservation mode” — making it harder to burn fat. Add to that Wansink thinks there’s a limit to the amount of self-denial we can handle, especially in an environment where our willpower is constantly tested by an abundance of readily available snacks and a constant barrage of food porn. And he was writing before everyone Instagrammed their breakfasts.

For Wansink, the key is to skip the deprivation and, instead, focus on cutting out the mindless eating — finishing off the last slice of pizza just because it’s there, grabbing a donut to break up the day, or grazing on post-dinner snacks while binge-watching a TV series. That’s how we put the weight on — 100 or 200 calories per day that we never even realized we were eating — so, Wansink reasons that’s also the best way to take it off.

That fits in perfectly with lifestyle management — a diet you don’t even know you’re on. It starts with paying attention, then becomes a lifestyle when you reform most of the bad, mindless habits, and swap in good ones instead. This includes not just diet, but also physical activity, which could be something as small as getting up from your desk every once in a while. And not for a snack.

Best of all, unlike the grapefruit diet, it’s sustainable. And the new mantra in nutritional advice is quickly becoming: “If you can’t do it for the rest of your life, don’t do it at all.”

So maybe this year, resolve to give up dieting, and focus on lifestyle instead.",[]

After a lifetime of dieting and problems with binge-eating, Bobby Umar is down 35 pounds.

The weight loss began in June, when the 48-year-old motivational speaker decided to finally give the keto diet a 30-day trial run. Umar had resisted that low-carb, high-fat diet for years, since he didn’t think he’d ever be willing to give up pasta, rice and bread permanently. A 30-day challenge, though, seemed like a reasonable amount of time to try something new, so he gave it a shot.

“The first two weeks were really hard but, once I got past that, things really took off,” recalls Umar. “If you can get to that point, that’s when the hunger goes down significantly. I would say my appetite dropped by about 70 per cent and that’s when the weight really started coming down.”

More important, he says, was his change in mindset. After radically reducing both carbs and sugar, he found himself re-defining his idea of a “treat.” Instead of rewarding himself with an occasional dessert or sweet, Umar started thinking of a piece of good bread as an indulgence. Best of all, the binge-eating just stopped, something he attributed to both the keto and the fact that he started skipping breakfast.

“Breakfast is where all the sugar comes from like the bread and jam and things like that that I love, so avoiding breakfast works really well for me,” he says. “And I was worried that I’d eat too much at lunch, which is one of my triggers but, after two weeks, I wasn’t even binging at lunch for the first time in my life.”

As someone deeply immersed in diet culture, though, Umar was keenly aware that a lot of people who lose weight on deprivation diets can’t maintain the regimen and wind up putting the weight back on a year or two later. So Umar figured out ways to make it more sustainable for his lifestyle and preferences by tweaking it and combining it with other diets, including intermittent fasting, which touts the virtues of skipping or postponing breakfast. He says he sometimes gets comments from people who complain he’s not authentically keto, thanks to his modifications to the diet, which include less fat, more vegetables, and a stubborn refusal to give up popcorn.

He’s not alone. A lot of people try to get the best out of super-diets like keto, vegan and intermittent fasting by cherry-picking the things they like. There’s even one that’s trending these days, the “pegan” diet, a paleo/vegan hybrid that encourages people to cut out all sugar, legumes, alcohol and grains and, instead, eat mainly plants. One version of the pegan diet does allow for a tiny bit of meat (think along the lines of bacon on a salad), but it’s pretty restrictive.

“It kind of sounds like two worlds colliding,” explains Lianne Phillipson, a Toronto area registered nutritionist, consultant and author. “Because those on the paleo diet are really eating a lot of fish and meat, and then add in veganism to it, which restricts people to just plants. Combining the two seems really restrictive and I’m not really sure how anyone would be able to follow it for any period of time.”

Unlike peganism, most people’s Franken-diet plans aim to be less restrictive, not more, says Phillipson, who says it’s really common to see people modifying low-carbohydrate diets, in part, because it’s hard to stay on them for a long time, but there are some aspects of them that are good for our bodies and help us lose weight. “Those diets work for a lot of people because you get rid of a lot of the grains, like that morning sugary muffin or croissant or donut or whatever,” she says. “That’s really quite a good boundary to put up.”

Instead, fill that hole with a little inspiration from the vegan diet—fresh fruit and nuts, refried black beans with guacamole or, perhaps, a breakfast salad—which all help on the overall nutrition front, since Phillipson says almost everyone she’s ever worked with needs more fruits and vegetables. Although Phillipson thinks the pegan diet doesn’t offer enough variety to be sustainable for most people, a good vegan diet is nutrient-rich and low-fat—so long as you’re steering clear of processed faux-meat.

Although there’s a lot of variation when it comes to the philosophy, the elements that seem to work in a lot of diets, be they vegan, keto or (as Phillipson points out) Mediterranean, are remarkably similar, namely, avoiding processed food and excessive sugar and trying to eat as much “real food” as possible, especially fruits and vegetables.

All of that fits in perfectly with intermittent fasting, too, since these foods make it easier to feel full for a longer time than refined carbs and ultra-processed foods. Dr. Jason Fung, the Toronto doctor who wrote the book (several books actually) on fasting, calls fasting a “powerful addition to any diet,” since, he says, no matter how good the diet is, if you’re snacking all the time, it’s not going to work.

Bobby Umar would surely agree. “All my life, I never felt in control of myself and for the first time, I actually felt in control,” he says. “I was resigned to the idea that maybe I was going to have binge-eating as part of my life but I never binged once.”

He adds: “It’s hard to explain but, as someone who struggled with weight for 35 years, having control is extremely empowering.”",[]

Whether you’re dieting to improve your health or physical appearance, it’s hard to go it alone. While people used to seek out friends to hold them accountable and struggle alongside them, it’s becoming more and more common to find support online.

No matter what the niche, from fasting to keto and paleo, it’s easy to find a group of health-enthusiasts who are following the same regime you are, but can this lead to dangerous misinformation?

“When we’re talking about these kinds of forums or support groups, we really position them in the social aspect that it may affect how someone starts to view their body, their thoughts, feelings and behaviours around food and weight. If that starts to get really negative, it can lead to behaviours that can cause disordered eating,” says Ary Maharaj from the The National Eating Disorder Information Centre.

Weight loss can be a slippery slope, especially when it comes to more extreme diets like intermittent fasting, a trendy diet followed by celebrities including Kourtney Kardashian and Hugh Jackman, it consists of scheduling your meal times within a certain window. The most common form is 16:8, which means you fast for 16 hours and have an 8 hour eating window (ie. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

And within the fasting umbrella is the snake diet, a more controversial regime that requires zero food consumption, just electrolyte-filled supplements. Founded by trainer Cole Robinson, the snake diet consists of only drinking a mixture of water, sea salt, potassium chloride, baking soda, and sulfate salts to keep your energy up. Fasts can last a day to as long as a month.

Zovel Olivia Hyre, 28, is a Markham-based medical student, former national soccer player and a member of a snake diet fasting group on Facebook. After gaining weight, Olivia Hyre decided she needed a detox or cleanse of some sort, and thought a fast would do the trick. She first decided to try a juice cleanse, but then moved on to intermittent fasting, but finally came across the snake diet online, but before she even decided to experiment with the trend, she spent hours reading on the subject and watching the founder’s explanatory videos that broke down the science behind the regime.

Once she was convinced, she began fasting a few days at a time and felt a major, positive difference in her health. She began sharing her journey with her Instagram followers, and saw there was a lot of interest on the topic, and that led to her coming across the International Facebook group in April.

“Through finding that support, you realize that there are other people willing to do what you think you’re isolated doing on your own, there are actually others out there that are very avid about it,” she says, adding that the group is valuable because it’s able to actually inform individuals who are in need of more guidance.

“If someone posts about feeling dizzy, people can quickly respond and say they need to simply up their electrolytes and it’s natural the first day or two,” she says. “But if someone’s been fasting for 30 days and says they feel terrible and are vomiting, that’s when a bunch of people often jump in and say—pull the brakes.”

Listening to your body is key with any new diet, especially when it involves fasting for a long period of time. When part of an online forum, it can be especially tempting to compare yourself to the slew of before and after photos, but that’s when things can go awry. Social dieting forums are a wonderful way to stay motivated, connect with other health fans and learn more about various lifestyles, but anything can gradually go from moderate to extreme.

“Healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle is an admirable thing to work towards, that sometimes does require social support to keep on track, but there’s also more adaptive ways of doing that,” says Stephanie Cassin, a Registered Clinical and Health Psychologist and director of Ryerson University’s Healthy Eating and Lifestyle Lab, emphasizing the importance of adapting a lifestyle that’s lenient and not too rigid in order for it to actually be healthy and sustainable.

In moderation, fasting has been scientifically proven to improve inflammation, blood pressure, brain function, and potentially even cancer prevention according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, but the main worry is what happens when it’s taken a step too far, especially when there’s a crowd of digital fans cheering you on.

“If somebody had a susceptibility or predisposition to an eating disorder, and they started on a really restrictive fast, that kind of short term impact on their actual weight can become quite reinforcing,” said Cassin. “Sometimes people with anorexia will say that it actually just started as a diet that went too far and just kind of got off track.”

When it comes to more severe diet plans like fasting, it’s important to listen to your body and gauge whether you’re doing it to reach your weight goal or to genuinely improve your health. Just because it worked well for one person’s body, doesn’t mean you will have the same success.

Another issue is the spreading of misinformation. Misinformation can proliferate on social media, and it can spread quickly. For example, one member of an intermittent fasting thread on reddit wanted to break down big pieces of misleading information that they’ve come across in the thread, but even their post was littered with errors. In response to a few posts about being overweight due to drinking alcohol, the user responded saying that “Beers are high in calories but you urinate out lots of alcohol as it is a diuretic, it’s not in your system long enough to really affect weight. The real reason is when you are drunk you make worse decisions. Pizza, kebabs, pasta.”

But while millions of opinionated people and a wide and open database would seem to be a recipe for inaccuracy, others argue that social media users tend to fact check each other. One recent post saw dozens of intermittent fasters in the same thread were quick to point out all the errors in the post, one even wrote, “When correcting people, anecdotes are no substitutes for actual sources. I think the term for this should be fastplaining.”

Sarah Black, a 44-year-old Bowmanville-raised massage therapist, has been fasting for more than 25 years and is also part of an intermittent fasting thread. During her time pursuing a diploma in massage therapy at Centennial College, Black also had to take courses in health and nutrition, but her interest in the topic dates back to when she was 16 and diagnosed with celiac disease. Reddit is the only social platform she likes to engage in because she feels misinformation gets clamped down a lot faster than on other platforms —especially by her. Her level of experience on the subject has led to her chiming in occasionally on the thread whenever she came across someone fasting in an unhealthy or extreme manner.

“I’ll pipe up here and there, but more so if I see something that’s blatant misinformation, or something that sounds like orthorexia (obsessive behaviour in pursuit of a healthy diet) or any approaches that are inherently unhealthy,” says Black. “I tend to get mixed reactions. People are sort of appreciative like, ‘Wow, I hadn’t really considered that part or idea to this,’ and then other folks will get kind of defensive, like, ‘Who are you to say this?’ I try to back it up with research if I can, but some of it’s anecdotal.”

For example, in mid-November, a reddit user posted a question into the thread enquiring how they could be adding more caffeine into their fasting routine. A few people, including Black, were quick to jump in and say it’s not healthy to add caffeine to a fasting diet due to it being a “diuretic” and the intense craving may be due to a caffeine addiction.

One thing Black said she’s noticed, especially among less experienced fasters is the habit of being “overzealous” and extreme.

“Some people tend to get very dogmatic with their approach and don’t take the time to really assess if something is healthy or is verging on being unhealthy,” she says. “A lot of people get so invested in the process, that they’re not actually honing in on how their bodies are feeling while they’re doing it.”",[]

Next up: How do you juggle dieting with positive messages about body image?

Eating healthier can be hard, and harder still is the price tag that comes with eating more fresh vegetables, fish and whole grains, as the popular Mediterranean diet recommends.

“Out of all the diets, it’s the most sustainable,” says local holistic nutritionist and wellness expert, Jordana Hart. “The Mediterranean diet encourages people to eat real foods,” she says. It’s effective because it makes people feel nourished. “Some crash diets might be something someone can follow for two weeks; this is something someone can follow long term.”

While the Mediterranean diet is nothing new, if you live in Toronto, accessing it can be challenging and costly, as winter produce can be inconstant, and seafood has to travel long distances.

“We live in this world where people are eating a lot of processed food,” says Hart. “You can buy macaroni and cheese for 99 cents and call it dinner.” That said, the Mediterranean diet is manageable on almost any budget. “It just requires a bit more planning,” she says.

It also takes some added thought when shopping for the diet, says certified holistic nutritionist and best-selling author, Joy McCarthy. To keep costs accessible, McCarthy recommends emphasizing a lot of plant-based proteins like beans and legumes. “If you’re getting them dry and cooking them yourself, they’re one of the most inexpensive foods you can possibly buy,” she says. Don’t overlook frozen fruits and vegetables either. “I think people assume fresh is better, but we live in Canada and a lot of the foods here are imported anyways,” says Hart. The same goes for canned foods. “Instead of buying a fresh piece of tuna, you can buy canned tuna, salmon or anchovies. All of these canned fish are still high in nutrients and healthy fats,” she explains.

When buying fresh fish, thinking beyond tuna and salmon can drive down costs. “More affordable options would be proteins like West Coast or B.C. snapper,” says David Owen, owner of De La Mer Fresh Fish Market’s four locations. “It’s a Canadian fish that has a sweet flavour and firm but flakey texture like European sea bass and sea bream.” At about $10 a pound, tilapia is another great option according to Owen, who recommends it for fish tacos. “It’s relatively lean for those people who want a lower fat diet and it’s very mild, so good for kids,” he says. In terms of shellfish, Owen says mussels offer great bang for your buck. “There, you are looking in the ground beef bubble pricing. You can feed two people for like $7 or $8,” he says. Steaming mussels in white wine with garlic, shallots and diced tomatoes or cooking them in a green curry sauce makes for an easy and delicious meal says Owen.

Buying in season helps too. Depending on the time of year, McCarthy recommends farmer’s markets. “When zucchinis are in season, you can get one for less than $1,” she says as an example. It’s similar to buying in bulk. “Packaging can be 10-20 per cent of the cost, so if you’re buying dried chickpeas, mung beans or lentils, buy them in bulk not in a package,” says McCarthy. Lastly, keep an eye out for sales. “Every grocery store discounts from time to time to clear things out.”

Since the diet is flexible, places to shop for it are too. While McCarthy loves to support local independent businesses with great produce like the Sweet Potato, it’s not always the most cost-effective option. “I also like Organic Garage for things that are non-perishable or frozen,” says McCarthy. “No Frills actually has a huge organic section and very good prices. They also have a whole aisle of natural foods as well, which is very affordable,” she says. Both nutritionists agree that any major grocery store like Loblaws or superstore like Costco would be easy places to find everything needed for the diet too. Online, shoppers can buy produce through local delivery services like Mama Earth Organics, which partners with Ontario farms to deliver fresh and organic, vegetable and fruit baskets. Starting at $30 for a small sized bin, each order can be customized weekly based on consumer needs, so you’re getting high-quality in-season produce exactly when you need it.

Although the Mediterranean diet is high on simple unprocessed ingredients that doesn’t mean meals can’t be creative. McCarthy points to a lentil casserole and vegetable soup with beans and chilli as examples of hearty dishes that will keep you satisfied especially during cooler months. Sweets aren’t completely off the table either. “You can make something like an apple crisp, and if you didn’t want to use oats, you could do it with walnuts and seeds instead,” says Hart. Energy balls made with honey, oats and almond butter also make for great snacks she says.

McCarthy recommends batch cooking. “I’m a big fan of it because if you make it, you’ll have it for the whole week to enjoy,” she says. Like meal planning, batch cooking can help eliminate waste and cut down on costs. “Rather than buying new ingredients every day to make something, plan ahead and just know you’re making this vegetable casserole and meatballs,” adds Hart. “I find a lot of people buy groceries and don’t end up using them and that’s where the expense really is.”

Where Hart recommends investing more is on one particular Mediterranean diet staple. “Buying a good olive oil is very important,” she says. Shoppers should look for bottles that read “extra virgin olive oil.” It’s the best bang for your buck, because it has all the healthy fats with so many health benefits she advises. “Healthy fats are the building blocks for so much that goes on in our bodies. They create the healthy hormones responsible for mood and sleeping and help with memory and weight loss.”

The city’s newly opened Italian hot spot, Eataly, is an emporium for high-quality olive oils at all price points. “The Frantoi Cutrera Primo ($24.90) is made from the Tonda Iblea cultivar cultivated in a certified organic regime that received the BIO International prize in 2010 for the best organic olive oil,” says Dino Borri, VP of Global Partnerships at Eataly. “It’s fruity with intense hints of green tomato and fresh herbs plus a full-bodied flavour that lingers,” Borri continues. He suggests drizzling on soups and salads, but also on legumes, boiled rice and grilled vegetables. “One of Frantoio Franci’s most awarded oils from Tuscany, Villa Magra ($39.90) is intensely fruity with aromas of green olive, fresh and pungent grassy notes with hints of artichoke and elegant notes of roasted coffee,” he says. “Use this oil fresh in soups, on boiled or raw vegetables, bruschetta, red meats, tomato salads, with plain rice or pasta, as well as well-matured cheeses.”

“In the past 20 years alone, there have been so many fad diets, but the Mediterranean diet is more realistic because it incorporates all the essential foods into one place,” says Hart. It’s the diet’s flexibility rather than it’s hard and fast rules that make it so appealing. “It’s okay to make it your own,” says McCarthy.",[]

Read', 'Ricardowed.']",2016-10-12,"Here’s a secret most parents know: the trick to making any vegetable appealing to kids is to smother it in cheese. This recipe is no exception, but here’s a surprise: the squash in this recipe is actually an essential part of why this dish is so beloved by kids. Well, my kids anyway. The great thing about butternut squash is how sweet and creamy it becomes once it’s cooked. In this recipe, the squash also soaks up the irresistible flavours of leeks, onions and garlic sautéed in butter. This is such a fragrant dish (the whole house will smell like garlic butter!) that you won’t even really need cheese. But I would make it au gratin, so the kids will gobble it up.

Squash and Leek Rigatoni au Gratin

4 cups (600 g) peeled, seeded and cubed butternut squash

2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil

3/4 lb (375 g) rigatoni

3 cups (285 g) thinly sliced leeks (about 1 or 2)

1 small onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, chopped

1/4 cup (55 g) butter

1/4 cup (40 g) unbleached all-purpose flour

2 cups (500 mL) chicken broth

1 cup (250 mL) milk

8 cups (240 g) lightly packed fresh spinach, stemmed and coarsely chopped (2 bags of 6 oz / 170 g)

Red pepper flakes (optional)

Grated nutmeg (optional)

1 cup (100 g) grated cheddar cheese

1/2 cup (35 g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Salt and pepper

1. With the rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Place the squash on the baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Bake for about 20 minutes or until tender, stirring halfway through cooking. Set aside.

3. Meanwhile, in a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta al dente. Drain. Lightly oil and set aside.

4. In the same pot over medium-high heat, soften the leeks, onion and garlic in the butter. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the broth and milk. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes.

5. Off the heat, with an immersion blender, purée the leek mixture until smooth. With a spatula, stir in the squash, pasta and spinach. Adjust the seasoning. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and nutmeg, if desired.

6. Pour the mixture into a 13 x 9-inch (33 x 23 cm) baking dish. Sprinkle with the cheeses. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Let rest for 15 minutes before serving.",[]

This roundup of some of the best offers out there will keep you drinking well at the best possible price, while supporting Ontario producers.

One of the smartest deals is from Pillitteri Estates Winery in Niagara. It’s selling its 2019 Canadian Gothic White VQA Ontario for $99.00 per case of 12 bottles, reg. $156.00, and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario. This wine is normally only available at farmers’ markets, but it can now be purchased online at pillitteri.com for what works out to $8.25 per bottle. That price for a delicious local white is a steal.

The 2019 Canadian Gothic White is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Pinot Grigio and Gewurztraminer. It swirls with aromas and flavours of dried apricot and sun-drenched grapefruit, then it shifts toward tangerine zest, lemon curd, wildflowers and rose before leaving a crushed stone and salt finish. Taut, shimmering acidity hems in the effusive off-dry fruit. And this light-bodied, honest value white clocks a relatively low 12 per cent alcohol. Outstanding value for money. Score: 93

Here’s an insider tip for those enamoured by mineral-driven, dry styles of Chardonnay. Bachelder Niagara has just released a brilliant bottle to consumers, which is normally reserved for its restaurant clients—who would of course mark it up considerably. It’s the 2018 Minéralité de Niagara VQA Niagara Peninsula. They’re selling it for $22.95 at BachelderNiagara.com and waiving the shipping fee within Ontario for three bottles or more. That wine is deeply undervalued for what it is.

The attack is quick and racy, instantly mouthwatering. Then it fills out, broadens, and saturates with a powerful punch of luminosity that seems to glow in the mouth. Glossy mouthfeel, citric zeal, stone, salt, sweet butter, a touch of mushroom maybe—it’s all there. Then, it tapers to a resounding finish of grapefruit—flesh and peel—that goes on for ages. This wine will astound and amaze those with a thing for fine, mineral-driven, focused whites. Though marketed as a summer sipper, this wine will lift and tune the senses 12 months of the year. Score: 96

From Prince Edward County, Rosehall Run Vineyards offers a mixed six-pack of rosés valued at $160.00 for $125.00, with free shipping anywhere in Ontario. And they’re throwing in four GoVino wine glasses—those shatterproof, reusable and recyclable plastic glasses with a cult-like following.

The six pack—available at rosehallrun.com—includes two bottles each of the 2019 Just One Rosé and the NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé, which are both VQA Ontario. And it includes one bottle each of the 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir and the 2019 Pét-Nat, both from Prince Edward County. Each of the four wines offers an interesting variation on the rosé theme.

The 2019 Just One Rosé is a dry Gamay seasoned with a touch of Pinot Noir and a dash of Zweigelt. It shines sunset pink in the glass and rivets the senses with bright, forthright flavours of raspberry-lemonade—without the sweetness. It’s the kind of drink you’ll want to enjoy chilled on a porch swing in the country somewhere—but your balcony or back garden will do too. Score: 91

The coral-tinted NV Pixie Sparkling Rosé with its boho-label is made from Vidal and Pinot Noir and unfolds with sheer, off-dry flavours of wild strawberry and lemon-lime before the soft peach and cranberry undertow emerges along the length of the finish. It’s a well-balanced quencher with great purity of fruit. Score: 91

The salmon-hued 2019 Rosé of Pinot Noir tastes dry and crisp—a bit more serious, really—with understated flavours of violet, raspberry, beetroot and stone. It would work very nicely with grilled salmon or a mushroom quiche. Score: 89

And the 2019 Pét-Nat is a curiosity more than anything. Pét-Nat is short for Pétillant Naturel, a style of sparkling wine made by bottling the wine mid-fermentation. Doing so traps the carbon dioxide in the bottle while the remaining yeast gives the wine a cloudy appearance while adding complexity. This bottle is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Gris, Gamay, Riesling, Pinot Noir, and other varieties, and the result is a fizzy, hazy pink wine with flavours of mixed red berries, salted lemon zest, crumbled herbs, cranberry, and many other nuances. It’s tasty, but there’s also a certain rusticity about it. Score: 88

And for those looking for a six pack with a white, rosé and red tucked inside should look to Marynissen Estates Winery in Niagara. This producer now offers two bottles each of its 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling VQA Ontario, 2019 Rosé VQA Niagara Peninsula, and 2017 Heritage Collection “Nanny’s Blend” Red VQA Niagara Peninsula. The six-pack is $99.95, regularly $135.70, and is available at marynissen.com. And they’re waiving the shipping fee in Ontario.

The 2019 Heritage Collection “Charmed” Sparkling is a lovely blend of Riesling, Gewurztraminer and Muscat that tastes off-dry and elegant. It starts with the compelling scent of French lemon tart. The attack is brisk and lively with a mouthfilling hit of lemon lime and chin-drip peach laced with a touch of cool stone minerality on the finish. And the hint of sweetness is balanced by bracing acidity, so each sip finishes clean and dry. Great value. Score: 93

The 2019 Rosé is a riveting blend of Riesling, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Muscat. This cheerful, off-dry style offers immediate pleasure with quenching flavours of yellow plum, ruby grapefruit, and tangy raspberry. Lots of levity and oodles of clean, bright fruit. Score: 90

The 2017 Heritage Collection “Nanny’s Blend” Red is a grippy, bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot with tight-fisted flavours of black olive, black tea, and blackberry mostly with black pepper, roasted walnut and crushed stone on the finish. It’s the sort of wine that you’d want to serve with grilled meat or aged cheeses to match the wine’s firm structure and robust flavours. Score: 87

You like White Claw, that hard seltzer that’s all over Instagram and has been wildly popular since it launched March 1.

Sales are mind-boggling. The LCBO has sold 7.8 million cans of the stuff so far. Crazy, right? But wine can be likeable, affordable and ready to drink, too.

See, I love wine. And I want you to love it as much as I do. But if you’re new to the wine game, there are definite entry points. Gateway wines, if you like.

The wines I’m about to recommend don’t taste like White Claw obviously. But they’re refreshing, full of fruit and inexpensive.

For those who like the idea of drinking red wine but have always found it too dry and maybe bitter, Lambrusco is definitely the way to go. Unfortunately, the LCBO doesn’t stock many Lambrusco labels. But NV Riunite Lambrusco Frizzante from Emilia, Italy (LCBO 13492, $9.95) is now on shelves and deserves a mention because it is the quintessential gateway red with its sweet, fruity and fizzy hit of wild berry goodness. Clocking just eight per cent alcohol, you can quaff it well chilled on the patio for easy refreshment. And it goes with anything you like really — from pizza and pasta to a handful of salty snacks in the afternoon. Score: 90

If you’re hell-bent on canned beverages, try Gaze Wine Beverage Blueberry Pomegranate Moscato from California (LCBO 14685, $7.95/375mL can). Brand new to the LCBO, this lip-smacking blend of Moscato, blueberry and pomegranate juice strikes the perfect balance between sweet and sour. Think fresh berry goodness laced with sweet orange and juicy pear all shot through with gentle effervescence that amps up the refreshment factor. With no artificial flavours or colours and just 4.5 per cent alcohol, this tall, slim can is an easy way to get acquainted with fermented grape juice. Twist open a cold one with a handful of toasted nuts. Totally instagrammable. Score: 91

By the way, Gaze also offers a Coconut Moscato Chardonnay, but I wouldn’t recommend it.

Moscato forms the base of these Gaze beverages because it’s a wine that’s sweet, juicy and fruit-forward. It’s also relatively low in alcohol and appealing to those who find dry whites too tart. So Moscato is a name to know.

A pure Moscato worth trying is NV Barefoot Moscato from California (LCBO 234351, $10.95). It draws you in with its intense aromas of mixed citrus and stone fruit, then races across the palate with a sweet-and-sour attack of the same laced with pretty floral nuances. This vibrant wine tastes like sunshine in a glass and only has nine per cent alcohol. It’s terrific on its own, cocktail style, but also works well with spicy foods such as Pad Thai with lots of hot sauce. Score: 92

For a wine that’s not quite as sweet and fruit forward as Moscato but certainly easy to enjoy, pour Prosecco. It tends to have just enough sugar to polish up the acidity but not so much that it tastes overtly sweet. A reliable and relatively inexpensive choice is NV Villa Sandi “Il Fresco” Prosecco DOC Treviso from Italy (LCBO 394386, $13.95 till July 19, regular $15.95). Like most Prosecco, this bottle tastes like fresh pears with attractive nuances of apricot, white flowers and salt. It’s also relatively light with just 11 per cent alcohol. Smart summertime refresher and certainly an easy gateway choice for those inching toward less sweet wines. Serve it with soft cheeses such as burrata or brie. Score: 89

Those moving toward drier wines might also enjoy the 2018 Sandbanks Rosé VQA Ontario (LCBO 244616, $13.95). This local, pale, coral-coloured wine with just a hint of sweetness offers terrific value for money. It brims with delicate scents of strawberries and melon, then saturates the palate with citrusy zeal. There’s grapefruit, orange and lemon zest, a touch of tangerine and the suggestion of wild strawberry — all swirling around in a sprightly hit of pure refreshment. Chill it down and enjoy it with a classic Cobb salad for casual elegance. Score: 90

There you have it. Some wines that might just set you on a lifelong appreciation of fermented grape juice.",[]

If you’d asked for a fizz, say, 100 years ago, the bartender would have handed you a gin cocktail, since the Gin Fizz was one of the most popular drinks of the day.

What made it so popular? Aside from being delicious and refreshing, having a carbonated cocktail was still a bit of a novelty. Carbonated water was invented in the 1700s, but it wasn’t until the soda siphon (a.k.a. a seltzer bottle, that made water fizzy with carbon dioxide cartridges) became widely available and affordable that bubbly cocktails became common. For home bartenders, that was in the 1920s.

Fancy bars had carbonated water for making sparkling cocktails earlier. One of the most famous and flashy fizzy cocktails was the Ramos Gin Fizz, which was invented in New Orleans in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon and, within 20 years of its creation, had become a veritable cottage industry. Some of its appeal was the spectacle of teams of bartenders shaking fizzes for exceptionally long times, which was part of the secret to getting a frothy top.

The other part of the trick was adding an egg white, which, when added to a drink and shaken, turns foamy, pretty much the same way an egg white turns into meringue when whisked. The final touch comes from adding soda water at the end, which, just like a soda fountain drink, makes the bubbles rise even higher.

Because it contains cream, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is really an indulgent boozy soda fountain drink. It’s delicious, but it’s next-level cocktail-shaking and I prefer to steer clear of dairy in the hot summer months, so I thought it best to use a different Fizz for this column. There are plenty of options, since the family includes at least a dozen different recipes. Some people even include the Mojito and Tom Collins in the family. I have a soft spot for the Silver Gin Fizz—gin, lemon, egg white, sugar and soda water.

For this 100-mile version of the recipe, we’ve tweaked this classic slightly by using lime instead of lemon and Beattie’s Farm Crafted Potato Gin ($39.95; LCBO 645622), which is distilled from potatoes in Alliston, Ontario. It’s a neat distillery, since they use the odd-sized potatoes (chip industry rejects) to make vodka and gin, so it’s part of the zero-waste movement, too.

Alliston Fizz

2 oz Beattie’s Gin

1 oz lime juice

1 egg white

2 teaspoons special fine granulated sugar

1 tiny pinch of salt

2 oz soda water

Add ice, gin, juice, salt, sugar and egg white to a cocktail shaker and shake rigorously for 60 seconds—until the shaker is ice-cold. Strain into a tall glass with four or five ice cubes. Slowly pour soda water to make it froth up.

PRO TIP: Many bartenders keep a small bottle of saline solution at their stations and add a couple of drops to a range of cocktails, including the Fizz. It’s used for the same reason it is in baking, namely, that it helps bring out flavour. A lot of cocktail technique is actually pretty similar to baking, such as the use of egg whites or specific grades of sugar. Cocktail recipes may seem finnicky but, details are important. Special fine granulated sugar, for example, is much easier to dissolve in the cold shaking process than the normal granulated sugar you stir into your coffee.",[]

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-29,"This is the summer that gin made the pivot — from pink to orange.

It’s worth noting that they weren’t in the pink for long. It was only last summer, really, when we saw everyone, from behemoths like Beefeater to local craft producers like Willibald Farm Distillery, launch a pink gin. This year, judging from the new gins at the LCBO, well, orange is the new pink. Life moves at you pretty fast in the liquor world.

From my point of view, this is a good turn of events. The pink-gin craze was largely inspired by the phenomenal success of Empress 1908, a blue gin from Victoria, B.C., that turns pink when you add tonic or citrus. This colour-changing trick is the result of butterfly pea flower but, other than that additive, it was still a proper gin. Many of the pink gins that followed in its footsteps, however, also had a lot of added flavour and sugar. Some had as much as 70 grams of sugar per litre, which verges on being a gin liqueur, as opposed to a spirit.

Unlike the pinks, most of the orange gins have little to no added sugar. And, having tasted all the ones I can find at the LCBO, I can say that they’re all also pretty delicious. Not all are orange (sometimes it’s just the bottle), and that’s just fine with me.

What follows is a little roundup, from blood orange to Valencia oranges, with a little explainer on how to best enjoy them, since there’s a surprisingly wide range of flavour profiles involved.

Most people know blood oranges for their colour first and flavour second, but with the hue-free and aromatic Whitley Neill Blood Orange Gin ($44.95; LCBO 14754), it’s all about the taste. It’s got a bold, candied-orange peel flavour, but with none of the candy sweetness, making it pretty easy to pair with ginger ale or tonic. Our favourite way, by far, to drink this is to turn it into a Blood Orange Negroni — equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and this gin, stirred and strained into a glass filled with ice. No garnish required.

Since Tanqueray Flor de Sevilla ($30.95; LCBO 573956) is the sweetest of the six at the LCBO, the best way to serve this is to keep it simple — on the rocks with a spritz of soda. One of the nicest things about this light-coloured gin is that you can still taste the juniper through the delicate Seville-orange flavour, so you don’t want to drown it with mix. Two parts gin, one part soda and a wedge of lemon is all it needs.

If it weren’t for the fact that this is a full-strength spirit, Beefeater Blood Orange ($30.45; LCBO 15765) could pass for a punchy Italian aperitivo such as Aperol. It’s brightly coloured and has flavour to spare, so it will hold its own in a champagne cocktail like a modified French 75 — one ounce this gin and four ounces cava or other sparkly wine. Of course, gin and bubbly wine is a powerfully dangerous combo, so, if you want to tone it down a little, it’s also delicious with Lemon Tonic — one part spirit, three parts tonic.

Made with Sicilian oranges, Malfy Gin con Arancia ($39.70; LCBO 10715) is dry and lively with a complex blend of bitter and spicy notes — frankly delicious. You could stir this over ice and turn it into a lovely Martini with a twist of lemon to fully appreciate its sophisticated flavour profile, or pair it with a straightforward tonic water, such as Fever-Tree Mediterranean.

They call the region south of Barcelona the “orange blossom coast” for its ample sweet-orange groves, which provide the inspiration for Botica Valencian Orange Gin ($42.45; LCBO 12668), an international collaboration between folks in Spain and the Netherlands. It’s gin first, orange second, which is also just fine with us — especially mixed with grapefruit and soda water (two parts gin, two parts fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, one part soda).

You can’t really call Hendrick’s Midsummer Solstice ($59.70; LCBO 12564) an “orange gin” per se, since this colour-free botanical-forward gin also showcases fresh berry and floral flavours, but there’s a distinct orange-peel finish that we think qualifies it for inclusion. Like all Hendrick’s products, this is a crowd-pleaser, that becomes even more of an easy-drinking refresher when you add a little Elderflower Tonic. Also makes a great Martini.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-24,"One of the oldest cocktails in the canon, the Old Fashioned, needs little introduction.

Especially lately, since the drink has gone from a dusty old curiosity to a “call drink” — cocktails that aren’t necessarily on the menu, but get ordered by customers anyway. A couple of years ago, bartenders reported that the Old Fashioned was overtaking the vodka soda as the top call drink on King West.

So, if the Old Fashioned is so great, why did it need to stage a comeback? Well, for decades, the original cocktail lost its way as the Fruit Old Fashioned gained popularity. An Old Fashioned is basically just sweetened, slightly bittered, diluted whisky served over ice and garnished with an orange peel, but at some point people decided to take it up a notch by muddling fruit into the drink. That, in itself, wasn’t such a terrible idea. Unfortunately, one of the “fruits” involved was the maraschino cherry.

I once saw a bartender take a scoop of bright red Day-Glo cherries and toss them in the bottom of a glass, along with a few slices of orange, smash them up, then add ice, simple syrup and whisky. It was … not good.

Fortunately, as more and more bartenders started researching bygone recipes, a more minimalist Old Fashioned was revived. It became especially popular once people realized that it was more than a recipe, but rather a method that could be applied to just about any spirit. Once you master the basics, you can make it with rum, brandy, tequila or even gin.

Here, though, we are making it with Canadian whisky, since that’s a delicious spirit — and barrels of it are being made within 100 miles, right here in southern Ontario.

Old Fashioned

2 oz Canadian whisky

1 sugar cube

5 dashes Angostura bitters

1 oz soda water

Orange peel (1 inch by 2 inches)

Method: Place the sugar cube in an Old Fashioned lowball glass. Douse the sugar in bitters, add soda and start muddling until the sugar is dissolved. Add whisky and a couple of large ice cubes and stir for 30 seconds. Express the oils from the orange peel and serve. Or drink.

Tip: Bartenders pay a lot of attention to ice for a simple reason — rate of dilution. Spirit-forward drinks are generally served on one or two large cubes that don’t melt as quickly, since oversized ice keeps the drink from becoming watered down.

After three days seated at my dining room table, watching what was effectively Quibi for fashion — which is to say, the first streamed digital couture “shows,” forced online by the coronavirus pandemic and transformed into bite-size nuggets that ranged from ersatz music videos to schmaltzy short films and previews for collections to come — I’m starting to wonder.

Yes, everyone gets to watch what was formerly an entirely exclusive, just-for-insiders, demonstration of fabulousness. That’s a good thing.

But honestly, give me the runway.

I never thought I would write those words. Like many, I have complained about the waste involved in fashion weeks: all those people flying around the world to sit twiddling their thumbs waiting for a show to start while ogling the celebrities across the catwalk, most of whom are dressed in full-blown evening clothes at 10 a.m., surrounded by elaborate sets made to be demolished after 20 minutes, all in the service of (in the case of the July shows) a parade of insanely expensive handmade clothes for the very few. Nero, meet your fiddle and all that.

But what this whole digital experiment ultimately revealed is that, though music and movies have been using fashion to their own ends for decades now, reversing the equation doesn’t really work.

Not even when you rope in a famous film director, as Dior did with Matteo Garrone, the Italian auteur behind “Pinocchio” and “Dogman.” And give him carte blanche to make … a mash-up of myths involving mermaids, Narcissus, satyrs, bellboys and nymphs who really, really, want to wear lamé goddess gowns and wafting, feathered coats instead of barely there bits of chiffon. Not even when you team up with a cult-y musician, like Olivier Theyskens did with Sylvie Kreusch of Warhaus, for his debut at Azzaro couture, all rhinestone siren slinkiness balanced on a knife-edge just this side of kitsch.

Not even when you get a famous actress, as Iris van Herpen did with Carice van Houten, formerly the Red Priestess on “Game of Thrones,” and have her animate a single look that plays with your sense of perception in odd angles and cuts, so it seems to grow around her body like a nimbus of rebirth.

Not even when you dress up well-known models and convince them to do awkward dancing, as if they were punk princesses at the famous Parisian disco Le Palace, while wearing bejeweled bouclé and lavishly flounced taffeta, as Chanel did.

It feels inauthentic: a copy of an idea from another creative discipline. And the problems of couture are not so much financial (most of the brands that can afford couture have enough of a cash cushion to survive the current situation and someone, somewhere, is still buying it) as existential. With the dire state of the world, what’s the point?

There’s an electricity to a live event, with its sense of shared experience and risk, that answers that question and cannot be replicated in the vacuum of the internet. There’s a specificity to a fashion show, a rhythm in the entrances and exits and struts, a duet between body and cloth, that has its own cadence and offers its own implicit thesis about the costumes IRL, which loses its force when it gets moved to an URL. It’s too easy to look away. To roll your eyes. And giggle.

Well, now we know. And it’s not actually a judgment on the clothes themselves, anyway. It’s a judgment on the context.

When is a show not really a show?

In any case, thinking of these digital shows as shows is probably wrong in the first place. They were more like a joint declaration of belief: We’re still here!

(That’s why, even though it didn’t have an actual show, Maison Margiela offered up a 48-second lava lamp of a show trailer, starring the vamping model Leon Dame suggesting the form of a longer … something … to be a revealed July 16. Ditto Valentino, which clocked in at just over a minute with its hypnotically morphing single piece of fabric/promo for a July 21 show. They wanted to show their faith in the official couture organization, even though their main events are later.)

After all, fashion, like so many industries, is in crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic: stores shuttered, fabric mills closed, brands declaring bankruptcy. To dare, in the face of a lockdown that separated designers from their ateliers, to create any form of a collection for public consumption is a kind of triumph: an aria of optimism into the void, a testament to imagination and ingenuity.

And in fact, the videos that revealed just that — bringing the viewer inside the creation process — were the ones that hinted at couture’s true magic. Ironically, it’s the documentaries that may actually best convey the “dream” that is couture: the handwork and humanity woven into its seams.

So while Dior’s movie was misguided escapism (verging on the objectionable, thanks to an entirely white cast, which is the dream of exactly who these days?), its opening scenes, which took place in the ateliers, were irresistible. They showcased the fact that the collection — the gold Aphrodite dress with its flowing cape, the sunburst-shirred high-collar white shirt and a pale-pink halter-neck ball gown covered in beaded branches — had actually been created in miniature, scaled down to 40 per cent of a traditional toile to create a treasure chest of a collection that will later travel the world for clients to ogle and order (full-size, of course).

Designer Maria Grazia Chiuri had been inspired by Le Théâtre de la Mode, a travelling exhibition of 150 dolls created in 1945 by designers of the day such as Lucien Lelong, Schiaparelli and Jeanne Lanvin as a way to revive couture in a post-Second World War world and rescue the fashion industry from economic ruin and emotional despair. You can understand it: what worked once, might well work again.

Especially when close-ups of the 2020 versions revealed the careful artistry of the petites mains (little hands) that made them, the camera watching an artisan painstakingly using a tiny needle to create the fringing on the hemline of the moonlit gown.

Just as it was charming, if not entirely satisfying, to look over the shoulder of Daniel Roseberry of Schiaparelli as he sat sketching away on his “imaginary collection” in Washington Square Park, near the New York apartment where he was sheltering in place, drawing tape measure straps, power shoulders and zeppelin-size balloon sleeves (for looks that will be made later this year). And to have sneak peeks from Ulyana Sergeenko and Elie Saab at the hands transforming basic materials into extraordinary embroidery for their somewhat overblown creations. Even if all the soft focus nature that followed mostly called to mind a perfume commercial.

Up close and at home

They all made me long for more such intimate experiences: not just to goggle at the flotillas of tulle and cloqué of Giambattista Valli, with their exclamation points of bows both large and small (look: a swan! and look: a white taffeta bow as big as a torso atop a white chiffon dress as tiny as Joan Smalls’ waist!) but to understand how they are constructed. Though to be fair, at least with his video, you could see the clothes instead of just the mood.

To really understand the Chanel collection, for example, which ultimately looked a whole lot better than designer Virginie Viard’s recent stabs at half-hearted casual couture, you had to eschew the live action for the static lookbook: 30 styles versus the short’s five, including some lavishly restrained midnight blue gowns and not-quite-understated armorial tweed jackets.

In any case, only Viktor & Rolf managed to capture the absurdity of the whole exercise: us, sitting in our rooms around the world, staring into small screens by ourselves, mesmerized (or not) by well-intentioned efforts to elicit asynchronous rapture.

They did it with a five-minute play in three acts titled “change” (small c, all in gold balloons) that spliced the classic department store show with today’s working-from-home ethos, with a stentorian voice-over by the singer Mika and a heavy dose of levity.

See, for example, an empire-waist sapphire satin negligee spotted with lace storm clouds to reflect “a feeling of sadness and anger familiar to many these days.” Or the pale pink chemises adorned with “contradictory emoji,” the “frantically entangled” sashes swirling around enormous bathrobe coats, and the enveloping A-line silhouettes to guarantee “you will remain in your own safe zone while venturing out into the world.”

There was a lot more like that. “If only we could change ourselves as easily as we do our outfits,” said Mika. That is, of course, the promise of all this; the beauty is that we all keep hoping.

It just seems so much more convincing from the ballroom chairs.",[]

Read', 'Kelly Boutsalisthe Kit', 'The Kit', 'Kelly Boutsalisthe Kittue.']",2020-07-07,"Christian Allaire is rewriting the rules of fashion journalism. Allaire, who is Ojibway, is the fashion and style writer at Vogue. When his first Indigenous-focused fashion article for the venerable fashion title, “How 6 Indigenous Designers Are Using Fashion to Reclaim Their Future” went live, Indigenous people sent him a over a hundred tweets, DMs and comments.

“It opened the floodgates. I started receiving a ton of pitches and started being introduced to so many great new artists and designers,” says the writer by phone, from his parents’ home in Nipissing, Ontario, where he’s riding out COVID-19. “Indigenous designers don’t get the same coverage as others, so once we saw that it resonated, and there was talent out there to write about, I just really ran with it, which is a dream.”

Speaking about fashion, Allaire is simultaneously funny and serious, admitting that he thought he’d be in Ontario for a weekend and only packed two wild printed shirts and jeans. Three months later, “This is not the look,” he jokes.

Allaire can trace his love of fashion to cultural events and powwows he attended on his home community of Nipissing First Nation in Ontario. Years later, ignited by beautiful regalia at powwows, he decided to pursue a career in fashion journalism.

“I knew that it was a very competitive field and what sets me apart from the thousand other fashion writers out there [is that] I come from a culture that really is not respected in the fashion industry and their designs are often appropriated or copied without any recognition,” he says. “I write about authentic design and what that means today. A lot of people think it’s an old, traditional bygone craft, but there’s still designers doing it today. I knew from day one that’s what I was going to do.”

At Ryerson University in Toronto, Allaire was determined to get his fashionable feet in the door and aggressively pursued internships, completing several stints at Flare and Interview magazines, with the latter bringing him to New York City, his new home.

After covering New York and Milan fashion weeks and interviewing Christian Louboutin for Footwear News, Allaire went freelance in 2017. Soon after, an opportunity opened on Vogue’s production team during fashion month. The month-long gig involved tasks like building online galleries for runway shows. The next fashion season, he returned to do it again.

“I just sort of stuck around,” he recalls, beginning with working for the site as a contract writer before transitioning to a full-time employee for the digital arm of Vogue last summer. His first print piece, on Choctaw artist Jeffrey Gibson, appeared in the May 2020 issue. He captioned his Instagram post on the achievement as “Baby’s first print story!”

“I think I’ve gotten to where I am based on two things: hard work and luck. I have always been driven and always took internships whenever I could, started writing for free, networked my ass off. But every job I have gotten has also been thanks to the relationships I built and just good timing in general,” says the 28-year-old.

The Vogue gig has brought Allaire to the Met Gala twice, and he made sure to wear an Indigenous-made piece at the huge fashion event, a custom-made red beaded flower pin made by Toronto-based Skye Paul of Running Fox Beads, for the 2019 theme of Camp. “It would be campy for me to wear something very traditional, which was beadwork in my eyes, in a new fun way, so I paired it with a frilly shirt and sequined boots.”

Allaire jokingly likens picking his favourite designers to that of “picking a favourite child.” Still, his eye for beautiful work and understanding of the culture has brought incredible designers like Jamie Okuma, Warren Steven Scott, Keri Ataumbi, Liandra Swim and Tania Larsson into the fashion conversation. Although it has long upheld Western-centric notions of fashion, a name like Vogue still carries the kind of mainstream legitimacy that money can’t buy and can bring invaluable awareness to designers.

Allaire has recently covered Indigenous designers from South Africa and Australia, as the publication broadens its coverage of brands outside of North America. “It’s American Vogue and we will obviously spotlight American designers, but I think people are interested in hearing about brands from countries that they don’t live in. Shopping is not focused on where you live but on your emotional ties to a designer’s story.”

Sharing those stories will be something he’ll continue to do. “Indigenous brands seem like such a small market, but I literally can’t keep up.” In May, Allaire included 15 Indigenous designers in a story on sustainable fashion. One of those designers was Tania Larsson, a Gwich’in fine jewelry designer from Yellowknife. “He is a person who is changing our history,” Larsson says by phone “He’s impacting us in such a huge way, and I know that it’s going to ripple through ages.”

The writer, meanwhile, often underestimates the profound effect his stories have but does admit to frequently hearing about the significance of his stories from the people he covers and readers alike. “I want to give a platform for the voices who haven’t really been heard. There’s always a new brand, and that’s inspiring because it means that someone can feel more confident than ever to pursue fashion design and find resources.”

For Larsson, Allaire’s work goes beyond fashion. “It’s like sharing our culture, which for the longest time has been under attack.” With Allaire on Vogue’s masthead, representation of Indigenous designers can finally turn a new page.",[]

Read', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Cassandra Szklarskithe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA—A national clinical trial this summer will focus on protecting cancer patients against severe COVID-19 infection by attempting to boost their compromised immune systems.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital say they want to explore the potential of IMM-101, a preparation featuring a dead pathogen containing properties that can stimulate the “first-response arm” of the immune system.

Study lead Dr. Rebecca Auer, surgical oncologist and director of cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital, says it could help experts understand why some COVID-19 patients are relatively asymptomatic while others end up in intensive care or die.

“The difference, it seems, between these two different presentations has to do with how strong your innate, or your sort of non-specific, first-line defence immune system response is to the virus,” Auer said Wednesday.

“And so we’re hoping that by boosting and stimulating this innate immune response, particularly in those vulnerable patients that have a reduced immune response to begin with, we’d be able to prevent symptomatic infections and prevent serious infections.”

Cancer patients are at much higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19 because chemotherapy, cancer surgery and radiation treatments suppress innate immunity even further.

Auer points to an “urgent need” to protect them while the world waits for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, which could take another year or more to develop, test and implement.

A successful trial could also protect cancer patients against other respiratory infections as well as the coming flu season, says Auer, noting the threat of illness is a fairly big problem for those undergoing treatment.

“A study demonstrated that about 13 to 15 per cent of cancer patients will have to delay or stop their treatment because of influenza during the average flu season,” she says.

“And also, cancer patients don’t respond as well to the influenza vaccine every year because their immune system isn’t as strong. So we think that the IMM-101 may in itself be able to help prevent symptomatic influenza infections.”

Auer says IMM-101 has also been tested elsewhere for its anti-cancer properties and that, too, will be examined in this trial, although it’s not the primary objective.

The researchers say the bacteria, Mycobacterium obuense, is safe to use in cancer patients because it has been killed by heat.

The Canadian study will recruit 1,500 patients currently receiving cancer treatment, and participants will be randomly assigned to receive either regular care or regular care plus IMM-101.

Auer says the treatment would be administered as an injection in the arm, to be followed by two more booster shots.

Researchers will follow patients for a year, watching for any respiratory infections and monitoring whether the treatment works and how long it lasts.

The trials will take place in eight centres located in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec.

Researchers say people interested in participating should speak with their cancer specialist.

Researchers from the Ottawa Hospital came up with the idea and worked with the Canadian Cancer Trials Group at Queen’s University to design the trial.

Dr. Chris O’Callaghan of the Queen’s University group notes cancer patients are also at greater risk of COVID-19 infection because they require regular medical care, making it difficult to adhere fully to public health guidelines.

“These patients are unable to practise social isolation due to the need to regularly attend hospital to receive critically important cancer treatment,” says O’Callaghan, who will oversee the trial.

Auer says a successful trial of IMM-101 could also suggest usefulness in treating any patient with a reduced innate immune system, such as older patients with chronic illness.

She notes that the tuberculosis vaccine known as BCG — which uses a similar formulation to IMM-101 but uses live bacteria instead of dead bacteria — is being tested around the world to see if it can boost the immunity of health-care workers exposed to COVID-19.

Funding and in-kind support, valued at $2.8 million, comes from the Canadian Cancer Society, BioCanRx, the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, the Ottawa Hospital Foundation, the Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization, ATGen Canada/NKMax and Immodulon Therapeutics, the manufacturer of IMM-101.",[]

(Not as safe as a casino, but there are things you can do)","['Christine Sismondo', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Starthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Christine Sismondospecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-07-02,"Is it safe to go back in the water?

Over the past few weeks, the City of Toronto has reopened outdoor swimming pools, splash pads and beaches, indicating that it’s safe to wade back into public swimming. Given the recent rise in temperatures, that’s welcome news.

There’s still a little confusion, however, as to whether or not swimming in a public pool is a risky activity. I’ve read that SARS-CoV-2 can’t survive a chlorine bath but, at the same time, there’s a meme circulating on Facebook from CTV News (sourced from MLive.com) that ranks risk levels of various activities. Public pools are right up there at level seven (out of nine) — less risky than churches, buffets and gyms, but more risky than movie theatres and casinos.

Given that every casino I’ve ever been in is a) indoors and b) involves people handling plastic chips, dice or buttons on machines (that other people also touch) oh, say, 50 times an hour, that seems kind of odd. So I decided to ask an infectious disease expert if it was safe to go swimming. Or should I just play it safer and go to Casino Rama instead?

“The risk is really not inherent to being in the pool, in and of itself,” says Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease specialist at the University Health Network of Toronto.

“Because, frankly, there’s not a great deal of evidence that, whether you’re talking about a lake or stream or chlorinated pool, the virus will thrive for any length of time in a concentrated way that could be transmitted from one person to the next.”

Great news for swimmers, right? Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean there’s no risk. Sharkawy went on to explain that the real concern, especially with outdoor pools, is the clusters of young people in close contact. No frolicking in the pool!

“The other thing I think is important to recognize is that people sometimes accidentally ingest pool water or freshwater,” says Sharkawy. “We’ve all had experiences with young kids or people who are not active swimmers who will swallow a big gulp of water, and that can end up in their nose or in their throat, which will make them start coughing around other people.”

There are ways to mitigate these risks, however: most obviously, social distancing. Sharkawy says that the safest way to take a dip would be to go for a swim with the people in your bubble in a relatively quiet lake, like Simcoe, for instance.

That’s not an option for many, though, which is why SwimTO, the City of Toronto program that developed guidelines for the safe reopening of pools and beaches, has been a welcome relief to many. One of the first to avail herself of the amenities was Amy Lavender Harris, an urban geographer who, along with her 11-year-old daughter Katherine, went on the second day that High Park pool was open. Spoiler alert: they had such a good time, they went swimming again a couple of days later at Smythe on Scarlett Road.

“We’ve been to two pools so far,” says Harris. “Both times, there were lineups, but the lineups weren’t that long for the recreational swim. They have restricted capacity for both, but the competition for the lane swim seems to be much more intense because of all the kids who are competitive swimmers and haven’t been in a pool for four months, and are just desperate for lane swim to make up for all of this lost time.”

The leisure swim, on the other hand, was a relatively short wait, says Harris. And well worth it.

“It was so wonderful to be in a pool,” she says. “We took the shutdown very seriously. We stayed at home and we always wear masks when we go into any business; we don’t go out on frivolous errands. But, at this point, after four months, you do start to have to weigh risks like the risk of getting sick versus overall health and your mental well-being. And for us, as parents, we think that, for a child who has been separated from her classmates and dealing with all of her summer camps, art programs and normal swim training being cancelled, getting back into a pool is important for her normal development as a child.”

Harris says she’s “grateful” that SwimTO came online so quickly and says that it feels safe because of the limited capacity, the contact tracing and the sanitizing in between swims (people are admitted in shifts and everyone’s name is taken). It appears to be a good system. There’s little information on the city website as to specific protocols for each pool. In response, some Toronto swim fans have put together Swimming Holes We Have Known, a crowdsourced resource for specific information about each site.

The one improvement Harris suggests is that the city look at extending the hours for the entire summer, the same way they do in a heat wave. The more facilities open for as many hours as possible the better, so we don’t wind up with crowded facilities — like the ones Sharkawy raised concerns about — as we try to balance the competing needs of human contact, exercise and recreation against containing the virus.

“There’s no question that we have to temper caution with a message that is going to be understood to be in the interest of everyone rather than one that is condemning people or shaming them,” says Sharkawy. “People don’t want to be blamed, they want to be given guidance.

“Everybody is responsible for it, whether it’s parents trying to teach their children how to behave when they’re out in public, whether it’s modelling good hand hygiene or whether it’s trying to respect distance,” he continues. “We can all do this successfully if we remain true to our pledge to be socially responsible citizens.”",[]

Read', 'Sarah Laingthe Kit', 'The Kit']",2020-06-27,"Given the events of the past three months, many of us are newly converted germaphobes, transformed from the kind of people who would ride the subway to a café and eat a croissant without washing our hands on arrival to the sort who are terrified to pass someone too closely on a sidewalk.

Dr. Bonnie Henry gets it: “We scared people and, once you scare them, it’s hard to undo.” As provincial health officer for British Columbia (and author of “Soap and Water & Common Sense,” a guide to avoiding viruses, parasites and disease), it was Henry’s job to scare us. It worked! But now we need to learn to live in this new normal.

So now that we’ve entered Stage 2 of reopening across Ontario, we have questions. Throw off your mask (if you’re at home!) and settle in for some expert answers.

How often should I wash my face masks?

“Cloth face masks should be washed in a washing machine after every use,” advises Dasantila Golemi-Kotra, an expert in microbiology and an associate professor at York University. They should be dried in a dryer “or outside, especially now that the weather is hot.”

No washing machine? “Put the mask in hot water with detergent, let it sit for 30 minutes and then rinse.”

If you have a single-use mask and you can’t readily get more, Golemi-Kotra suggests allowing it to dry out in a box for three days. But if the mask has been used extensively in crowded areas or for a prolonged time, throw it in the garbage.

What kind of mask is best?

Face masks essentially act as a filter, so the more layers a mask has, the more effective it is, says Jason Tetro, a microbiologist and the author of two books on germs. An N95 mask has 250 layers (although the public has been asked to leave those for medical professionals and other front-line workers), while a cotton bandana has two or four.

What if someone walks by me within two metres and we’re not wearing masks?

“Unless someone is actively coughing or sneezing in your direction, the risk of getting infected when you’re on the move is low,” says Golemi-Kotra. Henry agrees and adds that more risk lies in “sitting next to someone in a coffee shop, having a conversation, sitting in a meeting room where people are talking, or going to a church service and standing next to someone who’s singing.”

Is it a good idea to wear gloves?

“With gloves, you actually end up picking up more (particles) from surfaces and you can’t effectively use a hand sanitizer,” Tetro says. “If you’re using gloves because you think there might be coronavirus on that melon you’re knocking on, just use your hands.” Then wash them or use sanitizer if that’s not possible.

Should I avoid the subway?

Tetro does advise avoiding public transportation if you can. “All of those ‘tubes’ — buses, subways, planes — are basically like emergency rooms,” he explains. “They’re usually crowded and full of people whose health status you don’t know.” If you need to take transit, wear a mask, as the TTC mandates, and maintain as much distance as you can. Henry recommends using transit in off-peak times if possible.

Is it safe to eat in a restaurant?

Recently, Henry went to a newly reopened restaurant for the first time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking,” she admits, but she took comfort in the measures that she and her team had put in place: capacity limits, tables far apart, frequent cleaning and servers taking orders from a distance.

Worried about using restaurant cutlery? Don’t be, says Tetro. “Most restaurants have hot water dishwashers and as long as the water reaches 65 degrees Celsius, you’re fine.”

What about takeout coffee?

The main concern is drinking from a potentially contaminated lid. Tetro warns against using lids left on the counter because you have no idea who has coughed or sneezed on them. “If the barista puts on a lid behind the counter using gloves, there should be no risk,” he says.

We all touch the same hand sanitizer pump in stores. Is that dangerous?

Not really, says Golemi-Kotra, since you’re hitting your hands with the sanitizer after they’re contaminated. Make sure you’re doing that properly: “Put a generous amount of the sanitizer and rub those hands and fingers as you would do when washing hands.”

What’s the safest way to have people over?

Henry recently had friends come to visit on her lawn. “I put a bottle of wine and glasses on a tray in the middle, poured it and then everyone got their own glasses.” She served individually wrapped treats. “Last night, I went to a friend’s house for dinner. She has a long table, and I sat at one end and she and her husband sat at the other.” If in doubt, follow Henry’s motto: “Fewer faces, bigger spaces.”",[]

This is a common practice at condominiums. The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) Certificate of Registration is issued to individuals registered to trade as a salesperson or broker. It has no association with COVID-19 or the current state of emergency in the province.

In Ontario, individuals trading in real estate must be registered with RECO, the provincial regulator of the real estate industry. RECO administers the laws in Ontario’s real estate sector, on behalf of the government and in the public interest. The certificate helps protect consumers by providing a means of identification for registered real estate professionals.

Salespersons and brokers are expected to carry a printed card or use the MyRECO Certificate app that allows them to show their certificate on a mobile device, when requested.

Property management often request to see a certificate before allowing a salesperson and buyers access to view a property. Many residential buildings use the certificate as a security measure to verify that visitors to the unit are who they claim to be.

The Certificate of Registration also means you can rest assured your real estate rep meets the established standards for being registered and the protections that come along with that, including education and insurance.

Every real estate professional in Ontario must complete a specific education before they can become registered to trade in real estate. They must also complete additional courses every two years to keep their knowledge up-to-date.

They are also required to uphold professional standards of conduct and ethics with an emphasis on fairness, honesty and integrity. They must follow rules and regulations under the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act, 2002 that protect Ontario home buyers and sellers.

Registered salespersons and brokers are also held accountable for their actions in real estate transactions. In the instance that something goes wrong, RECO offers a complaint and discipline process designed to protect consumers.

Finally, as a condition of registration, all salespersons and brokers are required to have insurance coverage that protects both consumers and industry professionals, with payments held in trust and insured against loss, insolvency or misappropriation by a brokerage. Errors and Omissions Insurance provides an added layer of protection where damages and legal costs arise from errors, omissions and negligent acts that may occur while trading in real estate.

Another way to confirm a real estate professional’s registration is by visiting www.reco.on.ca and clicking on the Real Estate Professional Search bar.

Read', 'Heather Hudsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-07-08,"If the kitchen is the heart of a home, the bathroom has become a refuge as we continue to stay at home and stay safe

Here are three inspiring master bathroom renovations that were dreamed up and completed before the pandemic.

Back to the future: Andrea McQueen was called in to rescue a Burlington, Ont. couple’s master bathroom from a hopeless time warp.

“That bathroom would have been pretty luxe in the ’80s,” said the owner of Andrea McQueen Design, of the dusty-rose-carpeted corner tub, melamine counters, massive wall mirror, shiny black wallpaper and track lighting.

“The couple wanted a functional bathroom that was really beautiful. However, we were conscious about where we invested and where we saved to achieve the look they were after,” said McQueen.

First step: reconfiguring the layout to create a huge, glass-enclosed double shower and provide room for a free-standing tub sourced from Costco.

McQueen cleansed the room of its frenzied patterns and colours, updating it with a soothing white palette. The Carrera marble inside the shower plays off the dove-grey vanity. White porcelain floor tile was a cost-effective choice, and the herringbone pattern elevates the look. Pot lights, sconces and a pretty chandelier cast all kinds of illumination in the room.

“We saved the splurge for plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, lighting, mirrors and a heated floor,” said McQueen.

The big spend was on the double vanity with a mullion detail and big drawers from Top Notch Cabinets in Oakville. “Drawers are super functional storage as opposed to doors,” added McQueen. “Having a place for everything in the bathroom and no clutter really does make your life better,” said McQueen.

A refuge for health-care workers: In pre-pandemic times, interior designer Beth Lowenfeld, principal of Four Blocks South, created a master bathroom oasis for a Forest Hill couple who are both doctors.

“Because they both lead hectic lives and have high-stress jobs and two small kids, the couple wanted to create an area where they could retreat,” said Lowenfeld.

The homeowners were looking for watery hues and sandy tones that remind the wife of her native Newfoundland. “It was exciting to work with more colour than the average Toronto homeowner would choose.”

Enter a deep turquoise shower. “We showed them a much more neutral option and there was no contest. They both immediately gravitated to the turquoise,” said Lowenfeld.

The standard ceramic tiles are set off up by smaller enameled glass tiles from Montreal-based Céragrès with a cascading effect meant to mimic the rippling of water.

The couple loved the streamlined look of the Vanico walnut vanity they happened upon in Roman Bath Centre. “It has lots of storage and sneaky details in the drawers that accommodate everything you can imagine.

“The couple had been living in a small condo for a long time with little kids. And the wife had reached her breaking point with chaos, so being strategic and having a place for everything was huge for her.”

A corner soaker tub is strategically situated under a skylight. “During the day, the way the light reflects on the tiles and reflective surfaces is beautiful.”

Final touches in the the seven-by-11-foot room included a heated towel rack and heated floor.

“Of all the spaces we worked on in the house, this room was one of the most rewarding. The wife said she had a bath the first night they moved in and it was just like heaven,” said Lowenfeld.

A retreat in the trees: Before Laura Stein and her husband could create a new master bedroom and ensuite, they had to serve an eviction notice to a brood of raccoons.

“Yep, there was a full family of raccoons in what would become our bedroom. They even made themselves raccoon-sized doors by cutting through the siding on the outside of the house and pulling it back to gain entry,” said Stein, owner of Laura Stein Interiors.

After a humane goodbye to the former tenants, Stein got to work designing a challenging ensuite bathroom in their 100-year-old Roncesvalles home.

A window on one side of the room, a door on the other and two sloped ceilings in between meant Stein had to experiment with different layouts and ultimately installed a floating wall smack in the middle of the room.

“This became the plumbing wall. On one side is the shower and the other side holds the vanity and sink. And what’s nice about this design is that it separates the shower and sink area so we can both be in there at once and not be in each other’s way.”

Beneath one angled wall is a closet for her husband and beneath the other is a built-in cabinet to store linens and towels.

The floating wall has porcelain tile made to look like marble on the vanity side, and it wraps around to play off the river rock stones on the floor of the shower on the opposite side.

Stein custom-designed the walnut vanity, including the mirror featuring two face-flattering strip lights on either side and cabinetry above it. “It gives us a high-end contemporary feel. And since it’s floating, it lets more light move through the room,” she said.

“I wanted the bathroom to feel like an upscale treehouse. We have a lovely tree on our front lawn. We have a top-down/bottom-up blind that is usually open at the top, so it feels like we’re up in the trees.”",[]

The Thames Valley Trail follows a meandering 130-kilometre path along the Thames River, one of southern Ontario’s major waterways. The river’s three main branches — known today as the North, Middle and South Thames. The trail follows these branches through diverse habitats in the Carolinian Forest Region, in which a wide range of plant species thrive. In spring, populations of trilliums and other wildflowers explode in the forests, while the pungent smell of early-blooming skunk cabbage permeates the air in swampy wetlands. In open areas, you’ll find everything from meadow herbs to cultivated crops.

The North Branch and South Branch meet at The Forks in the heart of the City of London, and flow through downtown parks. Thanks to these green spaces, urban wildlife, from rabbits and groundhogs to white-tailed deer and coyotes, flourish. The sight of an eastern spiny softshell turtle sunning itself along the muddy banks is a special treat. With its pancake-shaped leathery shell and long, pointed nose, this threatened reptile is extremely distinctive. Much of its habitat has been lost to shoreline development, so Ontario’s softshells are left to depend on sites like the Thames to survive.

There are many spots from which hikers can access the trail along its length. Start at London’s Ivey Park, follow the river northward to Harris Park, and then cross the river at Blackfriars Street. Wander the opposite bank back south to Riverside Park. Kensington Bridge returns you to your starting point.

The St. Williams Conservation Reserve is part of the Norfolk Sand Plain, a delta that formed on the northern shore of Lake Erie after the retreat of the last ice age’s glaciers. Early pioneers eventually settled much of this land, clear-cutting populations of native trees and plants over time and exposing the sandy soil to the elements. The St. Williams Forestry Project was established more than a century ago to grow and plant seedlings in an effort to stabilize what had effectively become desert areas. As one of the first projects in Canada, it serves as a model for subsequent initiatives.

Made up of oak woodland, oak savannah, forest, wet- lands and sand barrens, the St. Williams Conservation Reserve is located on Crown land within the Long Point Biosphere Preserve. With more than 1,000 hectares at two sites, the reserve is a multi-use area that supports a great number of Canadian species at risk. Today, it is being managed to restore and preserve the richly diverse Carolinian habitats and flora and fauna populations that once flourished here.

While exploring the trails, keep your eye open for one of Ontario’s most beautiful and endangered woody plants, the eastern flowering dogwood. This small tree is alive with large blooms in May. Interestingly, the white “petals” on the four-parted flowers are not petals at all but bracts, a leaf-like structure that has taken on the petal’s job of attracting pollinators with their showy colour. The familiar poinsettia and bougainvillea plants share the same characteristic.

Another St. Williams denizen to watch for is the eastern hog-nosed snake. When attacked, it hisses, makes a striking motion, flattens its neck and even plays dead. It’s a harmless display intended to discourage potential predators. Unfortunately, in recent years, this snake has moved from threatening to threatened as its population has declined; a research project at St. Williams is focused on how to preserve this intriguing Ontario species.",[]

But like you, we dream of travelling again, and are publishing these stories with future trips in mind.

KILLARNEY MOUNTAIN LODGE — Moose and black bears occasionally wander the grounds of this historic resort on Georgian Bay’s rugged north shore.

But nobody gets concerned until a beaver waddles ashore, because Killarney Mountain Lodge is now home to the world’s largest log-built conference centre.

It looks delicious to beavers and magnificent to humans.

The 2,500 trees London lawyer Holden Rhodes planted at the 72-year-old resort he bought five years ago have been wrapped with plastic tubes to keep beavers at bay. But it was the 500 people busily building Canada House last year that kept the beavers from chewing on the pine logs from Ontario and Douglas fir trees from British Columbia that eventually became this palace of timber.

Now that the 34,000-square-foot conference centre is up and open, Rhodes and his wife, Carey, are hoping a steady flow of vacationers, wedding parties, convention delegates and those looking for fine dining will scare beavers away from the impressive Canada House.

Rhodes named his conference centre Canada House because it displays the primary features of Canada: rocks, trees, water galore, big space and fabulous views.

It’s one of Ontario’s finest meeting places, but it has no subway connection. It’s 430 kilometres north of Toronto and 110 kilometres southwest of Sudbury, but it does sit on Canada’s 400-year-old principal canoe route.

Little has changed in the village of Killarney since executives of Detroit’s Fruehauf Trailer Company arrived here in the late 1940s to build a remote hideaway so its senior executives, best customers and principal suppliers could escape from the pressures of big business in the city.

You could only reach the village by boat or float plane and it offered some of the finest fishing, hunting, hiking and sunsets on the continent. Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa used to come to this wilderness to negotiate labour deals in comfort with Fruehauf execs between poker games. There are rumours that he is still here.

At age 38, Maury East and his wife, Annabelle, bought the private retreat in 1962 and swung open its thick wooden doors to the travelling public. That’s when Ontario decided to connect Killarney to the rest of the world and built a 65-kilometre paved highway through the woods to connect with Highway 69, the principal highway between Southern Ontario and Sudbury.

The East family operated the 14-hectare Killarney Mountain Lodge for 53 years, selling it to Rhodes five years ago.

After graduating from a British law school and postgraduate law studies at Western, Rhodes became a partner in London’s McKenzie Lake law firm, practising corporate law.

In his spare time, he launched a small agency that traced the ownership and maintenance history of used cars across Canada. His part-time firm, Carproof, grew substantially until he sold it to the owners of Carfax in the U.S. for $650 million.

Rhodes has poured $42 million into KML, upgrading the various cabins, cottages and motel suites that can accommodate 301 visitors, plus another 94 at neighbouring Sportman’s Inn, also owned by Rhodes.

About 25 per cent of Killarney’s 500 residents are employed at the resort. The village and resort sit on the Killarney channel, a body of calm waters protected from the waves of Georgian Bay by uninhabited George Island.

More than 725 boats, averaging 12 metres in length, but some at nearly 34 metres, were moored at KML’s marina last season, 60 per cent of them visiting from the U.S. Most days, there are usually two or three float planes at the marina as well.

Last year, the channel was full of float planes when a bush plane pilots group held its annual general meeting in Canada House.

Thousands of canoes also arrive at Killarney each summer. Close by is the historic French River — Ontario’s first major highway — which was the principal route 400 years ago for Coureur des bois, wilderness explorers and Indigenous travellers moving from Montreal to Georgian Bay.

The French River is the first declared heritage river in Canada and is still a popular canoe route.

The nearly 162,000-hectare Killarney Provincial Park sits next door to the village. The wilderness park has 183 campsites on 50 separate lakes, 80 kilometres of marked hiking trails, 11 different canoe routes, is open year-round and last year was Ontario’s first provincial park to be designated a Dark Sky Preserve. There are fewer than 100 such preserves in the world and 19 are in Canada.

Rhodes plans to make KML nearly as popular in winter as it is in summer with snowmobile rentals, cross-country skiing, ice fishing, star gazing into a clear, dark sky and outdoor campfires.

If you prefer indoor campfires, Canada House has two of the largest stone fireplaces built in Ontario.

More than 15,000 hours of masonry work went into building the two fireplaces, plus all the stone flooring and walls used throughout Canada House. Some of the stone comes from a quarry in Wiarton on the Bruce Peninsula, plus pink granite from Manitoulin Island. And there is plenty of exposed pink granite protruding through the grass on the lodge’s 14-hectare campus.

Rhodes is no stranger to Killarney and the vicinity. His mother and his grandmother were both born in the village and he spent many summers in his youth exploring the area woods, the waters and the village.

His grandmother worked at the lodge for East. His family goes back practically to when Killarney was founded as a fur trading post in 1820.

For many years, the village was known as Shebahonaning, Ojibwa for “safe passage.” The village and the lodge had proposed a joint celebration of the community’s 200th anniversary on July 1, but Rhodes said the celebration has been postponed to 2021.

Canada House displays paintings by Indigenous painters on all its walls, many from the Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island.

Two dozen ceremonial dancers from Wiikwemkoong participated in the official opening of Canada House last June.

Soon, Rhodes will lift a 12-ton wooden canoe paddle on to the exterior of Canada House and plans to make Killarney the paddle capital of Canada. The paddle will be a time capsule to be opened in 200 years. It’s being crafted by local resident Mike Ranta, who twice has paddled his canoe coast-to-coast across Canada.",[]

But like you, we dream of travelling again, and are publishing these stories with future trips in mind.

The Brent Run Canoe Race was initiated after rumours that, during the early 1930s, the Stringer boys paddled their cedar-strip canoe from Canoe Lake to Brent and back again in twenty-four hours. The best recorded time to date is twenty-three hours, held by past members of Camp Ahmek, Chuck Beamish and Bob Anglin.

I recommend that you take a bit more time to complete the trip. Eight days is perfect. Canoe Lake is the starting line. To reach the access, turn north off Highway 60 toward the Portage Store. The gatehouse is down on the beach, near the parking area. From Canoe Lake, head north into Burnt Island Lake and either spend your first night here or portage 790 m into Little Otterslide and Otterslide Lakes. As Burnt Island is overused, I prefer going the extra stretch.

From the northwest corner of Otterslide, the route continues north into Big Trout by way of Otterslide Creek using five flat but sometimes muddy portages: 250 m, 390 m, 260 m, 730 m and 105 m. The last of the portages on Otterslide Creek takes you to the right of a picture-perfect cascade. A short paddle from the put-in, up a narrow inlet, is the breathtaking Big Trout Lake.

Big Trout is a large lake, and if winds come up it may be difficult to paddle across to the northern end, so make sure you head out early. Cross the expanse of water to the 300 m portage into Longer Lake, located just west of two small islands. Don’t mistake the unmarked path on the opposite side of the islands as the portage; it leads into a small pond fed by twin creeks, and even though it will eventually take you into Longer Lake, the marked portage is much quicker.

There is a beautiful campsite on Longer Lake, located at the mouth of the creek that flows out of the previously mentioned pond; however, it’s next to impossible to find it unoccupied. I usually push on to Burntroot by way of two short portages, the first 40 m and the second 75 m. Both are marked to the right of a double set of rapids. The second set is an easy swift, but running the first set of rapids is risky. The problem with portaging is that the trail is cluttered with poison ivy; it might be safer to wade or line your canoe down on the right.

From Burntroot, the route heads east down the Petawawa River to Cedar Lake. You should arrive on Cedar Lake by late afternoon on your fourth day and still have time to go for a soda and ice cream at the Brent store before making camp.

To return, simply backtrack to Canoe Lake. But when you reach the finish line back at the Portage Store, don’t expect a crowd cheering you on from the docks. After all, you’ve just completed the Brent Run in the worst time in the history of the race. Of course, it’s not whether you win or lose, it’s what you see along the way that counts!",[]

Read', 'Darcel Rockettchicago Tribune', 'Chicago Tribune', 'Darcel Rockettchicago Tribunefri.']",2020-07-10,"CHICAGO—Twenty-one debutantes (14 high school seniors and seven juniors) spent a portion of their weekends from January until spring learning etiquette and things like how to waltz, how to tango, and how to curtsy. And when you add the young men who would be their escorts and backup escorts, that number more than doubles. All the work was intended to lead to The Links Inc. Chicago chapter’s 60th annual Debutante Cotillion, a formal ball where the debutantes are presented to society with the support of their escorts, family and friends. But just like proms, graduations and other milestones for young people, COVID-19 squashed this event.

“The original cotillion date was April 25, but then we changed it to June 13, and then we changed it to the first weekend in August, and then we said this isn’t going to be accomplishable,” said 2020 Cotillion chair and The Links member Dr. Joy West. Originally scheduled to be held at the Fairmont Chicago under the theme of “Diamonds and Pearls,” the cotillion is now planned for May 1, 2021. “This was devastating for us, basically because of the families. The senior families in particular.”

According to West, when the idea for a virtual cotillion was presented, families turned it down.

“Families wanted the full experience, and they didn’t think the virtual experience could capture the beauty and grace of the moment for their debutantes, so they opted to wait,” West said.

The move didn’t sit well with Havilland Williams, a rising senior at the Chicago High School for the Arts. When she mentioned to friends that she was preparing for the cotillion, she said, many of her peers weren’t familiar with the concept of the ball. She likens it to a quinceanera, but it’s not a birthday party.

Cotillion is a rite of passage for young women in the Black community. It’s a tradition that has been going on for 60 years in Chicago under the guidance of the Chicago chapter of The Links Inc., the national women’s service organization based on friendship and community service. Founded in 1950, the Chicago chapter places a special emphasis on volunteering in the fields of youth services, international trends, health services and promoting African American art.

“To find out school was cancelled and the cotillion was cancelled? I was really upset,” Williams said. “But what can you do?”

Her escort, Lorenz King, who will be attending Morehouse College in the fall, calls the recent spate of cancellations and postponements unfair. As a St. Rita of Cascia High School senior, he trained for the ball alongside Williams but won’t be coming back to escort her. Instead his younger brother will go.

“We’ll never get this again in our lives. I’ll never get to graduate high school, I’ll never get prom, and we work so hard. It’s just the feeling of accomplishment, after everything you’ve done, and you’re just not going to get it,” King said. “It gets frustrating sometimes. ... It’s kind of sad that we didn’t get a payoff of everything we did.”

West said that all of the debutantes have the opportunity to walk in 2021, and while all the juniors will do so, only about four or five seniors will return from college to participate. It’s a huge miss for participants, after the community service, fundraising, classes and workshops. And let’s not forget finding the proper ball gown, which has to be floor-length and white, accompanied by white gloves.

Participants raise money by selling ads to small businesses, and the cotillion class chooses a community organization to receive the money raised. The Chicago chapter of The Links focuses on mental health and wellness, West said.

“Our national mission is to transform communities through service, and we feel like continuing the legacy of cotillion by providing an opportunity for our young people to witness resilience through times of unrest, is important,” West said. “What we wanted our current families and community to see is a dedication to continuing to transform communities through service. Even though our goal to give $60,000 (U.S.) back to the community for our 60th did not happen, we have recommitted to doing just that for 2021.”

According to LaTisha Williams, Havilland’s mother, the cost to the family of making the cotillion happen runs in the thousands of dollars, and that includes selling $150 tickets to relatives and friends for seats at tables during the event. But Williams said it’s worth it for her only daughter to have this opportunity for education, mentorship and camaraderie. Havilland Williams and King said they not only learned etiquette, but have taken part in financial workshops about stocks and bonds as well as ones centred on mental health.

Havilland Williams considers cotillion to be on a higher level than prom.

“It has more elegance and grace in it and kind of like ballet — makes me feel poised and pretty, and I like how that makes me feel,” she said. “With prom, it’s just everyone is there, everyone wants to look better than you, but in cotillion, it’s more about unity.”

“In the end, you just see the dancing, but there’s a lot that goes into it,” King said. “A lot you can take away from it — years down the line, and that’s why I think it’s better than a homecoming or a prom.”

Camille Lonzer, a 2019 debutante from South Shore, says the event was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that she’ll remember forever.

“It’s just a rush of happiness seeing everyone in their dress. ... I would compare it to a graduation or a prom because you get to show off and show out. It’s definitely exciting,” she said. “I wasn’t too much of a social person beforehand, and it sort of opened my eyes to a lot of different people who have a lot of different opinions and perspectives. But also the community service aspect of the cotillion, it was life changing for me. I think that’s a nice aspect of it because you really feel like the community needs you as a person.”

“2021 will still be our 60th anniversary, although I don’t know what the flavour of that will look like,” West said. “But what we do know is that the journey to cotillion — the rehearsals and workshops — will be a fun and informative time for the debutantes and escorts. We want to make this next year just as interesting as this past year was.”",[]

Read', 'Camille Bainsthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Camille Bainsthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"VANCOUVER—For 30 years, Hilary Jordan talked to her husband about the goings-on in their family and the world, but she wasn’t sure if the police officer injured in a crash could hear anything as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed.

“I like to believe that he did hear me,” she said in an interview this week.

“I said something to him before he passed, which made him know that it was OK to leave us, and I had never said those words before, so shortly thereafter he did pass. I do believe he could hear.”

Ian Jordan suffered a head injury when he and another officer were on their way to a call in Victoria in September 1987. He died in April 2018.

Now, research from the University of British Columbia suggests people who are unresponsive can hear, even hours before they die.

Lead author Elizabeth Blundon, who recently graduated from the university with a PhD in psychology, said the findings may bear out a persistent belief among health-care workers that hearing is the last sense to go in the dying process.

The study, published recently in Scientific Reports, was the first to investigate hearing when people are close to death, in one case six hours beforehand, Blundon said.

The research involved eight patients at a hospice doing a hearing task when they were still responsive. Five of them repeated the task when they became unconscious.

A control group of 17 young, healthy participants also took part in the study, which was completed between 2013 and 2017.

Participants wore a cap with 64 electrodes that measured brain waves as they listened to a series of tones grouped in five patterns that would occasionally change.

Those in the control group pressed a button when they heard the pattern change while the responsive patients at the hospice were asked to count the number of times the pattern changed.

The brain activity of the control group and the responsive hospice patients was very similar to that of the unresponsive patients, Blundon said.

“It’s an encouraging sign that at the very least the brain is reacting and processing at some capacity the auditory information that it’s receiving,” she said of the glimpse into brain activity that persists in the transition between life and death.

“But I can’t tell anybody if their loved one understands them or knows who’s talking to them,” Blundon said, adding further research is needed to delve deeper into the mysteries of end-of-life hearing.

Previous research into hearing of unresponsive patients has been done in Europe on patients with traumatic brain injury and showed they also respond to sound, said Blundon, who hopes to continue her work at the University of Miami, where she may also look into the effects of music on those near death.

Dr. Romayne Gallagher, who recently retired as a palliative care physician at St. John Hospice, where part of the study was completed, said she noticed during 30 years in her job that patients would react positively when they heard the voice of a loved one, even on the phone.

Families can take some measure of comfort from spending time talking to their loved ones, even when they don’t respond, she added.

“A lot of people are scared of this time and they don’t quite know what to do, and we often say to them, ‘Talk to them, play their favourite music.’ Things like that.”

Jordan said she spent thousands of hours “chit-chatting” with her husband and playing his favourite music from the 1970s and ’80s on a boom box she brought to hospital.

“It just seemed natural, speaking to him,” she said, adding that he seemed to respond most favourably every time she mentioned their son Mark, who was 16 months old when the crash happened.",[]

Read', 'Special To The Star', 'Want To Be A Dating Diarist', 'Email Datingdiariescontact Gmail.Com']",2020-07-10,"Gemma is 24, lives in the west end and works in the tech industry. She says, “I moved in with my parents during the pandemic, but I’ll be moving back to the west end when things clear up.” She says, “I wear a lot of decently stylish thrifted clothes. If I can look down and see that everything I’m wearing is second-hand, I’m proud of my outfit.” (Gemma says that her friend describes her style as “someone who got their clothes wet at school and had to go through the lost and found.”) Gemma is “a bit dorky, but in a good way. I’m energetic and enthusiastic. I love to have fun and I’m a good listener. I’m that person who is friends with everyone.”

I met Antonio through Instagram. He’s a friend of a friend. I liked his artistic style. The photos he posts capture things really beautifully. We started messaging and always had fun banter, and I got really curious about him. I suggested a phone call, but he wasn’t interested. He kept messaging me, though. I could tell he was very thoughtful, and thinks deeply and critically about things.

I asked Antonio out casually a few times, mentioning I’d be around his neighbourhood and we could grab coffee if he was interested. He always seemed pretty enthusiastic but then always ended up being busy. Once he agreed to a date but then blew me off a few times, and then finally cancelled due to an “emergency,” but didn’t say what that was. He was so inconsistent. He seemed interested in me, complimented me, then failed to initiate or respond. I don’t know why I was still even a little bit into him. It was an infuriating cycle.

I claimed I was completely done with him. But Antonio kept messaging me. The next week I saw him post about a show he was going to be at that night and, in a moment of pure spontaneity, I just kind of inserted myself into his evening. I said I’d see him there and we could finally meet. He said that would be cool. I made it seem like I was planning to go to the show anyway and not that I was 100 per cent going out of my way to see him!

He definitely seemed happy when I arrived. We hugged hello. It was hard to gauge how I was feeling when I actually met him. I was still right there in the adrenalin and rush of the last-minute decision. It was really weird putting together my perceptions of him from Instagram and my perceptions of him in the moment. I was trying to figure out if I was attracted to him. To be honest, Antonio kind of reminded me of these really cool guys I went to high school with, the people that everyone loves who are also kind of obnoxious.

I was definitely nervous. He thanked me for showing up and told me he was surprised that I made it out. I was surprised, too! We couldn’t think of what exactly to say to each other then. It was loud; the setting wasn’t totally conducive to life-story sharing. When I described my job to him, he didn’t seem totally engaged. The mood was still lighthearted, though. He seemed very in his element. We danced and joked around and I started having a good time. The music was amazing. I had that warm and whimsical feeling that you get when strangers join together and share one experience. For a while I felt like I was in a movie.

We eventually moved outside where we could actually hear each other talk. At one point he told me we should “totally do this again” as if I hadn’t already suggested on at least three separate occasions that we meet up for a date!

I left after last call. We hugged goodbye. When I got home he had messaged me saying that it was great to finally meet each other and thanked me again for coming.

We message occasionally on Instagram, but it leads nowhere. That’s just what “dating” looks like for me right now. I’m still trying to grasp his interest level. Not knowing probably drives my curiosity even more. Maybe I’ll bump into him when we start going to bars again, but planning anything? That’s too much to ask.

Read']",2020-05-19,"When the COVID-19 crisis upended the world as we knew it, grocery stores remained sturdy beacons of near normalcy. The way we shop has changed—socially distanced line-ups, one-way aisles, plexiglass cashier shields—but the vital relationship between supermarkets and their customers endures.

In this spirit, Sobeys Inc. launched the Community Action Fund, an initiative aimed at giving back to local communities by committing millions of dollars in donations to organizations helping those in need during these difficult times. The program is focused on creating localized solutions, empowering the company’s some 1,500-strong grocery and drugstore banners—including Safeway, Foodland, FreshCo, IGA and Lawtons—to decide how to best to support their neighbourhoods.

“Nobody has a better idea of what their local communities need now than our frontline store teams across the country,” says Michael Medline, president and CEO of Empire Company Ltd, owner of Sobeys. “It’s inspiring to see how quickly they banded together to give back to people in need.”

For store managers like Don McWilliam of Foodland in Stratford, Ont., the program presented an opportunity to lift up a fellow small business. Upon learning that local spirit-maker Junction 56 Distillery was pivoting its production to create much-needed hand sanitizer—donating much of it to high-risk essential services like shelters, and selling the rest to the public at cost—McWilliam and his team knew they’d found a worthy endeavour. Their contribution—pre-purchasing $1,000 worth of product to be distributed for free—helped two-fold: sanitizer would reach the hands of Canadians faster while helping to alleviate the economic stress faced by the craft distillery after generously transitioning its business.

Standing behind his community feels natural for McWilliam, crisis or not. “I’ve always looked out for the underdog,” he says. Growing up, he remembers that grocery stores were always giving back, a tradition he’s keen to preserve.

Another casualty of the COVID-19 crisis has been food security amongst our most vulnerable populations. Sobeys Inc. and its dedicated partners have stepped up to the plate. Across Ontario, the company has donated $300,000 to resource-strapped food banks like the Daily Bread Food Bank, Second Harvest and regional organizations in North York, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Thunder Bay and Ottawa. The company’s contributions—financial support plus donated gift cards, thousands of prepackaged hampers and cases of pantry essentials—helps those who need it most.

Through the Community Action Fund, Myles Power, store manager at FreshCo University & Bridge in Waterloo, Ont. was able to present $1,500 worth of $50 gift cards to his local chapter of Food4Kids. Since 2016, the non-profit organization has been dedicated to serving snacks and meals to children through school programs. But in light of school closures, Food4Kids was struggling to get food on the plates of kids who needed it.

As a grandfather of nine and a two-decade-long owner of the FreshCo store, where he’s employed generations of family members, Power couldn’t fathom the thought of any child in his community going hungry. “This one is close to my heart,” he says.

The concept of family, and of making a difference in the lives of others, has been a throughline within Sobeys Inc. since its inception in Nova Scotia over 100 years ago.

Even as the increased risks and mitigating precautionary measures descended on the stores, this “family first” attitude helped to unite the staff at the Sobeys Queensway location in Etobicoke, Ont. “Everyone looks after each other and helps out, chips in when needed,” says store manager Shawn Bergman. “If someone’s down, we’re there to pick them up.”

When it came time to decide how they’d allocate their share of the Community Action Fund, the Sobeys Queensway staff turned their efforts to nearby St. Joseph’s Health Centre, which recently reported a COVID-19 outbreak. Bergman and his team donated $2,000 worth of Sobeys gift cards to hardworking hospital staff, giving them a chance to pick up lunch or stock their fridge without worry after a long shift.

“As much as we’re frontline workers working in grocery stores, the true frontline workers are the ones working in hospitals and the healthcare system,” says Bergman. “With the hours that they’re putting in and all their dedication, we just wanted to show that we care and appreciate what they do.”",[]

Read', 'Kathryn Hudsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-14,"Just over a month ago, if you wanted to pop into Itacate restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon, you would’ve been out of luck. Its owners, the Moreno family, reserved Tuesdays as a day off from making mouth-watering tacos de carnitas and traditional mole. But that changed in the wake of COVID-19: They decided to open their doors to feed the community for free.

The Moreno family immigrated to Toronto from Mexico City in 2007 and opened Itacate in 2016 to cook the kind of soulful food they had grown up on. Now, outside the door of the little counter-serve spot on a strip of St. Clair West dotted with family businesses, a simple sign invites anyone in need—frontline workers, those who have lost their jobs, homeless people—to pick up a hot meal at no charge. Last week, they prepared 150 portions of chicken fajitas, each served with a steaming side of rice and beans.

“My mom decided we were going to start making free meals for people who need it because, well, she's like that: She feels good when she’s taking care of people,” explains Jahaziel Moreno, who runs the restaurant along with her parents and sisters. “We don't ask for identification to prove you’re a frontline worker or anything. We just let people know that there is good food here for those who need it.”

The restaurant has faced its own financial pressure: Plans to open a second storefront have been shelved after sales drastically slowed because of COVID-19 restrictions (they used to do a solid late-night shift, for example, serving hearty tortas to the party crowd). “My mother had some savings, so we are using that at the moment,” says Moreno simply. “She has a saying in Spanish, which is basically: If you give to people, then one day God will give it back to you.”

Francisco Rico-Martinez, co-director of the FCJ Refugee Centre on Oakwood Avenue, just around the corner from Itacate, wasn’t surprised to see the Moreno family in masks, serving take-out meals to neighbours free of charge. “They’ve passed through very difficult times since arriving in Canada, and they have been resilient,” he says. “I helped them with the process of becoming permanent residents, and when that happened last winter, they invited more than 100 people from the neighbourhood to a party. It was a way to say thank you to the community for helping them to stay in Canada.”

Kerri Romeo, who says she could live off of Itacate’s “incredible” chilaquiles for days, has lived in the St. Clair West and Oakwood area for four years and sees its community spirit thriving despite recent hardships. “It’s great to see everyone keeping this neighbourhood alive,” she says. “This stretch of St. Clair West is in transition—there are a lot of empty storefronts—but newer businesses like Primrose Bagel Co. have offered free coffee and bagels, and little free pantries have popped up across the neighbourhood for those who might need it.”

Rico-Martinez, who brought the FCJ Refugee Centre to St. Clair West 16 years ago, feels the same way. “This remains a neighbourhood of family businesses,” he says. “I’ve been amazed at the donations from the community. Every day, we receive groceries on our porch, we receive packages of art supplies for children. The Moreno family is a huge part of the sense of belonging that exists in this community.”

Itacate has long been a taste of home for Josue Hernandez, who immigrated to Canada from Mexico a decade ago and stops several times a month get his fix of authentic tacos and crisp, weighty pambazo sandwiches. “My relationship with the family is bigger than the restaurant now: I have a friendship with them,” he says. “Every time I go, I joke about soccer with Jahaziel’s father, because our favourite teams are rivals. It’s the kind of place where you feel like you know everyone—but they literally know everyone. They are so close with each other, and they treat everyone like a part of their family.”

Before social distancing stopped the Morenos from seating customers at their two small tables, they relished offering sit-down hospitality—they wanted every guest to feel welcome. “Do you know what Itacate means?” asks Rico-Martinez. “It’s the word people in Mexico use for the big bag of food your mom might prepare for you to take home after a visit. That gives you an understanding of the type of restaurant they wanted to create.”

The Morenos’ dedication has not gone unnoticed; neighbours pop their heads in often to offer thanks and encouragement to the family as they prep meals. “A customer left us a card that read: ‘Not all heroes wear capes or scrubs—some wear aprons.’ My mom cried,” says Moreno. She stops to think for a moment. “My mother cooks with love and people can feel that.”",[]

Read', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-14,"There are basically two things people talk about these days: COVID-19…and all the bread they’re making. Social media is filled with people proudly showcasing their fresh loaves and arranging sourdough starter swaps. As pandemic baking rises in popularity, Ontario’s independent mills are grinding around the clock to meet the demand.

Matt Faust, the general manager of mill and bakery Brodflour in Liberty Vilage, says that prior to the pandemic, the business’s main source of income was the café. Flour sales were about $1,500 per month. Once COVID-19 hit, however, flour sales jumped to $15,000 in April alone. Now, Brodflour baristas are lifting a lot more than lattes.

“In the past, we’ve been making sandwiches and toast and coffee, and now those people are helping us get large flour orders out the door, helping package up wholesale orders, managing wholesale customers,” says Faust. “I wouldn’t say we’re frontline workers, but I like to think that we offer an essential service.”

Brodflour over-bakes every day, providing loaves to local community and respite centres and food security programs. Contactless pick-up is available for customers, but Brodflour is on UberEats as well, allowing baking-mad citizens to place an order from the comfort of their couch.

About 100 kilometres west of Toronto, in Fergus, 1847 Stone Milling has been overwhelmed with flour-delivery demand. The mill has seen a 3,000 per cent increase in flour sales, much of it going to Toronto (and some being donated to a local bakery making bread for health care workers). The surge has required multiple sets of grandparents to pitch in and help fulfill orders. Everyone is working seven days a week. The mill used to have farm-gate pick-up, but now it’s delivery-only, with a stream of FedEx, UPS, and Canpar drivers rolling through every day to pick up dozens of sacks.

“It’s too bad that people have to pay for shipping, but I think it’s better in the long run so that they have the flour delivered right to them,” McKeown says. “Plus, it’s bulky and heavy and it’s nice to have it arrive at your door.” The mill recently received a telephone call from the area’s MPP, Ted Arnett, thanking them for continuing to serve the community during these strange times.

K2 Milling in Beeton, Ont. also has a growing stable of admirers. Mark Hayhoe—who also goes by the moniker “Kaptain Flour”—is descended from a long line of flour millers and has been milling flour in Beeton for almost three decades. But he says he’s never seen anything like this. Home flour sales are up 500 per cent since the pandemic started. K2 developed their own way to mill flour that “focuses on flavour, not colour,” and take pride in the “accessibility, transparency, and traceability” independent mills can offer customers, but maintaining an adequate supply of grains has been tricky these days. So has “seeing and hearing the fear and worry from our new customers and trying to remain calm, re-assuring and alert,” Hayhoe says. “But people have been uncannily kind, gracious and truly appreciative towards our daily grind. I hope our little artisanal flourmill in Simcoe County has encouraged people to understand the resiliency of the artisanal food system in comparison to the industrial food one. It did bend, but it did not break.”

It has, in fact, flourished. The pandemic has even inspired new flour businesses. Flour-delivery service West End Flour started up at the end of March via Instagram, ferrying 20-kilogram bags of K2 Milling’s Viking, Bianca, Ferdinand, and Red Tail varieties to west end denizens, all the way from Beeton. Why are people so wild for baking right now? “Comfort,” Hayhoe says. “Bread is a historically important basic food. It has been given a bit of a rough ride the past decade, and it takes times like this to realize how vital the staff of life is to humanity.”

And, so, the millers persevere, ensuring that the breadboxes of Toronto remain blessedly full. “We’re really thankful that we can keep working and that we’re able to provide our community with something that they really need right now,” McKeown says. “It’s not just the flour: it’s that sense of normalcy and making them happy. When you’re baking, you’re happy.”",[]

Read', 'Briony Smithspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-24,"Meet Tyler Watts, St. Stephen’s Community House

In 2019, St. Stephen’s Community House lost provincial funding for its overdose prevention services program. Then the pandemic happened. For drug users and people in life-threatening withdrawal, support services like ERs, detox beds, shelters, drop-ins, and doctors and psychiatrists have become hard to access, according to Tyler Watts, a coordinator of overdose prevention services at St. Stephen’s. Many services have also gone phone- or web-based, which is a barrier for people that are on a fixed income or homeless.

Social isolating is also often impossible for St. Stephen’s clients—and dangerous. Watts usually urges clients to never use drugs alone. “But how do you maintain that in a society that is now told to isolate?” he asks. “Plus, they’re being criminalized for being on the streets and not isolating because there is nowhere to go. They struggle to find a drug supply that isn’t toxic and deadly and it is increasingly hard to find spaces they can use and feel safe.”

Now, every morning, a larger-than-normal line of clients snakes around the building. Only two people are allowed in at a time. If someone overdoses, employees must get into full PPE before helping. “It can be quite distressing when you’re looking at someone turning blue and you’re trying to squeeze goggles onto your face before jumping in to save them,” says Watts.

Recently, Watts says, a woman arrived at the site in tears because she had been wandering around all night, looking for somewhere to use the washroom. “She told me she’d never felt so stripped of her dignity,” Watts remembers. “It makes me so sad that people can’t even get their most basic needs met.” Still, Watts soldiers on. “The reason I come to work now is the same as it’s always been: to save lives. The pandemic hasn’t changed that—only made it that much more important.”

Meet Kylie Beatty and Theresa Hirschberg, Sistering

On any given day, more than 9,000 Toronto citizens experience homelessness. Many of them are even further marginalized. “There weren’t—and still aren’t—many specialized services that focus on women, and trans and non-binary folks,” says Theresa Hirschberg, a team coordinator at Sistering, the multi-service agency’s Parkdale Pandemic Response Site. “Sistering provides a collaborative space to advocate for the most vulnerable folks in the city.”

Before the pandemic, an average day for Hirschberg involved building relationships with clients, crisis intervention and referring people out to collaborative agencies. While the pandemic rages on, their clients still need help. “Closing the drop-in and shifting to a respite program was that ‘whoa’ moment,” says Kylie Beatty, who is also a team coordinator at Sistering’s response site. “It was clear that access to services had changed significantly, and the way we were connecting would have to change.”

So what does an average day look like now? “No two days are alike,” Beatty says. “But we’re still checking in with folks and making sure we’re all supporting each other and staying safe.” Each day, the team coordinators read up on the ever-changing interaction guidelines, and they’re outfitted in personal protective equipment (PPE). They also must screen every client for potential COVID-19 exposure, along with adhering to the distancing requirements. “We had to redefine our service model but still keep that level of participant focus and care,” says Hirschberg. “The pandemic has highlighted the willingness and capacity to come together as a community. [Clients] reassure each other and show generosity to each other—and seeing the community that they have developed in the space has been heartwarming.”",[]

Read', 'Briony Smith Special To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-24,"Andrew Wyatt was never much of a FaceTime guy—he hadn’t really video-chatted with anyone until his daughter was born. But, over the course of the past month, he and his colleagues at Progress Place—a community organization specializing in mental health support—have had to go pro. Wyatt is the mental health unit supervisor at Progress Place, which, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, has taken its support services virtual. Progress Place has extended the hours of their peer support chat service, the Warm Line. There are at least three virtual support activities per day, ranging from yoga to seminars on how to keep busy at home. “I’m also regularly taking phone calls from members to chat, and provide wellness checks, and support and case management as needed,” says Wyatt.

Clients are reveling in this new form of community. “It obviously doesn’t replace the face-to-face connections, but it’s so important to see people that you know, and for someone to be excited when they see your face pop up on a screen.”

Wyatt and his fellow staffers also brave the outside world daily to deliver free meals to members who live nearby, providing wellness checks. “Food security is incredibly important for our community,” Wyatt says. “For people who are low-income, it’s a huge challenge to access healthy food. This helps provide people with a sense of hope that we’re all going to get through this together.” Recently, Wyatt says, a community partner client cried when he got his food because he was so relieved to know that he didn’t have to brave the grocery stores.

The wellness checks are essential too. When a recent check revealed that a woman had become psychotic, she was taken to the hospital to receive mental health services. Another wellness check on a woman showed that she was consumed with fever. At the hospital, she tested positive for COVID-19. She’s now back at home, quarantined, receiving regular telephone support from staff. Both checks occurred in the past 10 days.

“For years, our goal has always been outreach and preventing people from isolating at home because it can make people more symptomatic and lead to hospitalizations,” says Wyatt. “Now we’re at a point where people don’t really have a choice—they’re being told to distance and isolate. It’s critical to remember that, for a lot of people in our program, a sense of community has been taken away from them because of their illness, whether it’s because of a schizophrenia diagnosis that has left them without a job, friends or sometimes even family, or whether it’s from an anxiety or depression diagnosis that stems from bullying. So being able to facilitate virtual activities or hand out meals to our members has ensured they continue to have that same sense of community that a lot of us take for granted.”",[]

Read', 'Jillian Vieira Speical To The Star', 'Speical To The Star']",2020-04-24,"In times of crisis, there are those who run straight toward the frontlines. Operating room nurse Andrea MacDonald is one such person. When the COVID-19 pandemic descended on the city, the 34-year-old, who has devoted the majority of her 10-year nursing career to the Thoracic Surgery and Lung Transplant team at Toronto General Hospital (TGH), answered the call to step up without hesitation.

In early April, MacDonald decided to volunteer for TGH’s newly formed Early Response Intubation Team (ERIT), a four-person group dedicated solely to intubating COVID patients. Since the virus aggressively impacts the respiratory system, this procedure, which assists in mechanical breathing, can literally be the difference between life and death. But it’s an incredibly taxing process that takes about two hours and involves inserting a plastic endotracheal tube almost a foot into the windpipe. And it’s dangerous for medical staff, given the direct exposure to a COVID-positive patient’s airways.

The sacrifices would be significant for MacDonald. Becoming a member of ERIT meant trading in her established Monday-to-Friday work week for an intense schedule of 12-hour shifts: two days followed by two overnights. It also meant entering the very centre of the pandemic response, something that wasn’t required of her. But MacDonald was all in. “There was no question whether or not I would join it,” she says.

MacDonald’s colleague Nicole Maia, a registered nurse, says it’s no surprise that she was one of the first to put her name forward for the job. “She is always going above and beyond for the team and for her patients,” Maia says. She notes MacDonald’s unflappable attitude when faced with high-risk situations—“calm, focused and highly collaborative”—but besides her strong clinical skills, Maia says it’s her compassion that makes MacDonald uniquely suited to these difficult moments. After all, this is an extremely frightening and lonely experience for a patient. “Andrea is an incredibly empathetic and humble nurse,” Maia says. “It’s her reassuring approach that brings security to her patients, especially when they are at their most vulnerable.”

Still, MacDonald was nervous when she first joined ERIT. “I went in on that Monday with a lot of uncertainty,” she says. “How many codes would there be a day? How long is this going to go on for? Am I going to get sick? Are we going to have enough resources?” But once the increased personal protection policies and procedures were in place and the team got down to work, those fears quickly dissolved. As of April 17, MacDonald had performed several emergency intubation procedures. The team is prepared to do up to 10 a day, but she hopes that, as the curve flattens with time, it won’t come to that.

While MacDonald admits that her work life is infused with a new unease, being on the frontlines actually eases her worries about the pandemic. “I felt like it helped with my anxiety about the unknown,” she says. “If I was to offer help in any way that I could, it would make me feel more hopeful about the outcome.”

Once a vaccine becomes available, when social distancing measures wane and the “new normal” becomes, well, normal, MacDonald thinks we’ll look back on this time as one of unity. We’re arguably more isolated from each other than the human race has ever been, but she sees evidence of solidarity everywhere. She points to the way her new team came together, got prepared and practised intubation simulations in less than a week (“I’ve been extremely impressed with everyone’s willingness to jump in and help”); and the daily 7 p.m. salutes to frontline workers, though MacDonald is quick to share that recognition. “I like to think of it more as we’re all doing our part in one way or another,” she says. “For the people banging the pots and pans, it’s simply staying at home—and that’s just as important as what I’m doing every day at work.”

Like the rest of us, MacDonald is buoyed through the day-to-day by self-care rituals like home workouts, takeout dinners and video calls with friends and family checking in on her. Also keeping her motivated are the ubiquitous “We’re all in this together” posters by Toronto-based artist Dreeem, taped up in temporarily vacant shopfronts across the city. “Every morning on my way to work, I walk down into the subway and I see that poster. I say it a couple of times in my head, ‘We’re all in this together.’ And I really do believe it,” MacDonald says, the emotion evident in her voice. When it’s all over, she says, “I think I’ll remember seeing that poster every day.”",[]

Read']",2020-05-14,"In 2019, the median price of a house in Canada rose to just over $500,000, pricing many Canadians out of the market. Lachlan MacLean believes his company can help provide a solution.

“MHCs, also known as land lease communities, are the ‘missing middle’ in the housing market,” says MacLean, Vice-President Property Operations for Parkbridge Lifestyle Communities. “It’s increasingly hard for Canadians to make the jump from renting to ownership. Our model of home ownership can provide a middle step.”

Land lease is a well-established ownership model, points out MacLean, but it isn’t well-known in Canada. It allows you to purchase a home without buying the land on which it sits. The land itself is owned and maintained by the owner-operator – and the result is significant savings for buyers looking to break into the housing market.

In Edmonton, for example, you’d pay $380,000 for the average freehold home, compared to approximately $100,000 to buy a home in one of Parkbridge’s communities, located within the city. Let’s assume you put a 10 per cent down payment on a MHC home and take on a high-ratio mortgage for the remainder (manufactured homes are eligible for CMHC mortgage insurance). You would pay approximately $500 per month for your mortgage and $680 for monthly site rental on the lot where the home is situated. The grand total: about $1,200 in monthly costs.

In contrast, the carrying cost of a mortgage on a single-family freehold home of a similar size in Edmonton would be about $1,900 per month. Although you could buy a condo for less (about $225,000), you would still pay about $1,600 per month: $500 condo fee +$1100 mortgage. And renting a condo or apartment would cost about $1,700 per month — far more than the monthly payments for an MHC home.

Apart from affordability, the main draw of MHCs or land lease communities for buyers is the chance to have a yard of one’s own and to become part of a cohesive neighbourhood, according to MacLean. If you’re picturing stereotyped trailer parks, you would probably be pleasantly surprised by the tidy homes, well-kept yards and neighbourhood feel that characterize Parkbridge’s communities.

“We have communities in Canada where, if you drove in, you’d have no idea this was a manufactured home community,” MacLean says. “Manufactured homes aren’t meant to be moved. They’re not on wheels, and people build decks and landscaped gardens around them.”

Homeowners in land lease communities commit to keep up the maintenance of their homes and yards when they move in. And because they are able to build equity in their homes, they have a vested interest in making sure their properties are well-kept and attractive.

As the owner-operator of land lease communities, Parkbridge acts much like a small municipality, managing and maintaining infrastructure and services. Site rental fees in land lease communities go towards maintenance and repairs of water and sewer systems, sidewalks and roadways, common amenities such as parks and playgrounds, collection and remittance of property taxes and fees, as well as professional management and maintenance of the community. Snow removal, grass-cutting and amenities upkeep are also traditionally covered. “We’re in it for the long haul,” says MacLean. “We care about our homeowners’ enjoyment and investment in their home and community”.

To enhance the sense of community, almost all of Parkbridge’s communities offer recreation centres to hold events, such as crafts for kids, shuffleboard games and community dinners. Many also feature playgrounds and other amenities. That makes the communities particularly popular with both retirees and young families.

For retirees or empty nesters, points out MacLean, buying into a Parkbridge community can offer a chance to free up equity from the sale of their previous home and still have a yard of their own and a sense of belonging. At the other end of the spectrum, young families often purchase land lease homes as an affordable stepping stone into home ownership. “These are cohesive, supportive neighbourhoods with a strong sense of community pride,” MacLean says. “And they offer a chance to fill a very real gap in the housing market.”",[]

Read'],2020-03-31,"Land lease is an affordable home ownership model that allows people to own a home without buying the land. While land lease is a well-established home ownership model in many countries, it is less well-known in Canada.

Parkbridge’s land lease communities are particularly attractive for young families looking to buy their first home and for retirees looking to free up money for life’s other priorities while still continuing to maintain and build equity. Parkbridge is a leading Canadian developer and owner-operator of land lease communities, with 55+ communities in Canada.

As Parkbridge continues to grow, it’s helping Canadians better understand how land lease works and why the option can be beneficial. Here are some frequently asked questions about land lease. To learn more, visit parkbridge.com.

Q: Is buying a home in a land lease community like buying a traditional home?

Yes! Buyers work with a real estate agent and lawyer and obtain financing as required before closing the purchase and sale agreement. Those wishing to buy a home in a Parkbridge community must make an application with the community management team and then sign a site lease. Parkbridge recommends you complete this application and have it approved before finalizing any home purchase.

Q: How do I get a mortgage on a home in a land lease community?

Homeowners in Parkbridge communities work with mortgage brokers and financial institutions to obtain financing with Canada’s major banks and credit unions. Thanks to industry awareness efforts in recent years, financing on land lease homes is now broadly available at many financial institutions and credit unions across Canada.

Q: Do homes in land lease communities increase in value?

As with other forms of home ownership, appreciation value depends on a number of factors, like location and the state of the economy. At one Parkbridge community, homes purchased between 2007 to 2017 rose in price an average of seven per cent per year. Some homes more than doubled in just six years.

Q: What legislation supports homeowners in land lease communities?

Land lease communities across Canada are governed by provincial legislation and regulations that differ slightly across jurisdictions but in all cases enforce the rights and responsibilities of both residents and land lease owners.

Q: What happens when a resident’s lease expires? Are they able to renew?

Yes, residents are able to renew their lease. The homeowner works with the land lease operator on renewing the lease agreement.

Q: Is the lease transferable upon sale of a home?

Yes. This is called an Assignment of Lease and is covered under provincial legislation.

Q: How does the new owner enter into a lease agreement with the land lease owner?

The seller informs the community management team of their intention to sell. Before finalizing the home purchase, the buyer completes a lease application.

Q: How much is rent?

Rent varies from community to community and is regulated by the respective provincial governments. Rent depends on the local market as well as the services and amenities that are provided in that community.

Q: Are land lease communities different than Manufactured Home Communities?

Manufactured Home Communities (MHCs) are the earliest example of land lease. Today, Parkbridge has modular, manufactured and traditional-build homes.

Q: Why do homeowners choose to live in a Parkbridge land lease community?

On average, the purchase price of a home in a land lease community is up to 30-per-cent less than a traditional freehold home in the same area. Parkbridge’s land lease communities are also professionally managed, often with quality amenities, which helps create a sense of community where residents feel supported and connected. Amenities can include community centres, pools, playgrounds and fitness centres. Services can include snow removal and maintenance of common areas. Amenities and services vary by community, depending on the needs and wants of the owners.

And a final advantage is that unlike other developers, Parkbridge maintains a presence in the community, investing alongside homeowners to ensure there is ongoing, thoughtful attention to community infrastructure, standards and amenities.

Read']",2020-03-31,"“The Trailer Park Boys was the worst thing that ever hit our industry,” says Al Kemp, Executive Director of the Manufactured Home Park Owners Alliance of BC. With its images of rusting trailers and chronically under-employed bad boys, the show reinforced negative stereotypes about ‘trailer parks.’ And the bad press spread to take in land lease communities and Manufactured Homes too.

Here’s the thing: such communities are as different from trailer parks as chalk and cheese. Read on for some facts that correct some common myths and misconceptions.

Fact # 1: Manufactured home ownership is a valuable option for middle income families and retirees

Mark Bourree, Senior Regional Manager, Property Operations for Parkbridge (the largest land lease owner-operator and developer in Canada says the option is increasingly popular with people of all ages and stages, but particularly with seniors and young people starting out in life. For young families, manufactured homes provide an option that costs up to 30 per cent less than a conventional home. This is because you’re paying for the house, but not the land underneath it; hence the term ‘land lease community’. And unlike apartments, they offer a yard where kids can play.

As for seniors: “A lot of people downsize from their empty nest home and move into a community of manufactured homes,” Kemp says. The two main advantages: the reasonable price ensures seniors can easily live on their pension while freeing up money for life’s other priorities. And “if you are away for a period of time, your house is absolutely secure because neighbours watch over it.”

Fact #2: Manufactured Homes are a good investment

“The law of supply and demand works in this industry as well,” says Kemp. “Let’s say you bought your home for $40,000 about 20 years ago and you’ve taken really good care of it. Now you’re ready to sell.” Depending on the location and condition, the same home might well sell for more than a new home today (in the range of $200,000), he says.

Fact # 3: A Manufactured Home is not a mobile home

The vast majority of manufactured homes are moved once and remain in place throughout their lifetime – they don’t have a hitch or wheels. As well, manufactured home communities are becoming increasingly known as ‘land lease communities.’ Canada’s largest land lease owner-operator and developer, Parkbridge, has modular, manufactured and new traditional build homes to choose from, depending on the location and community.

Fact # 4: Manufactured Homes are well-built and follow the same building codes as freehold homes

For the last 30 years, manufactured homes have been required to meet a code called Z240, similar to the requirements in Canada’s National Building Code. “They have the exact same criteria as any freehold home built in Canada,” says Bouree. Expect a solid frame, full insulation, energy saving features, gyproc walls, and a roof meant to last 25 years.

Bourree says that manufactured homes are manufactured in the tightly controlled environment of an indoor factory, then moved into place on the back of a semi trailer truck. “They’re well-designed and engineered,” he says. “And they have to be able to withstand the winds going down the highway at 100 kilometres an hour.”

Fact # 5: There is an incredible sense of community among neighbours

Many Manufactured Home Communities offer enviable locations close to major cities, as well as the kinds of amenities that draw people together, from playgrounds to community centres and hiking and walking trails. Because the communities are professionally managed, owners commit to maintaining their homes to the standards of the community as part of their lease. “It’s like having a condo board, only without the drama,” says Bourree. “Most of our residents stay for a very long time.”

What’s more, points out Kemp, unlike an apartment building, where you might be acquainted with the neighbours across the hall but not those above or below you, people in manufactured home communities tend to know each other well. “Often they organize barbecues and bingo games and garage sales,” he says. “Plus knowing your neighbours creates security – residents will question a stranger in the park.”

Read', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Starmon.']",2020-03-09,"Oh, studying: A tedious rite of passage for all college and university students, and one that conjures up images of late nights, deep yawns and endless procrastination. Between the distractions and inevitable boredom, effective studying can feel like something you wing rather than something you master.

But – like any activity – learning to study well just requires a little practice, and some useful tips from the experts.

Chris McGrath, vice president of student success at George Brown College, says it comes down to understanding your study style, and the setting you need to optimize self-learning,

Many people have an expectation “that there’s only one way to study, or one magic approach,” says McGrath. “The reality is that everyone’s brain works differently, and we are all very diverse learners.”

“Students who are struggling to get into a pattern of effective study … should reach out to one of the academic support centres on their campus. They can provide resources to help a student orient their thinking into the type of learner they are, and they can then cascade down and contemplate some really effective behaviours that will help make study time more practical.”

That might mean adjusting the way you revise depending on the topic you’re studying, and the tools you’re using.

“If I’m reading content, I can sit on my sofa (to study),” says McGrath. “If I have to write, it has to be at a desk … and I need background noise, because it stimulates my brain activity.”

There are also other variables to consider, says McGrath, including where a student tends to study: At home, in a dorm, or – for commuter students – shared spaces like libraries or cafes.

“Campuses have abundant spaces where students can really hunker down and focus with minimal distraction,” he says. “On commuter campuses I encourage (students) to think about finding a good spot on campus and accessing that space part of their regular schedule, and I encourage them to leverage their commute time (to study).”

For these students, accessing study materials in audio format may be an ideal way to review lectures or readings on the go.

Scheduling dedicated, uninterrupted study time is also an ideal strategy for those who are looking to become more efficient with reviewing course material and preparing for exams.

“The phone gets turned off, (you’re) free from distraction, in a physical environment where (you) feel comfortable and not overstimulated, and where (you) can maintain focus,” he says. “And don’t schedule anything for longer stretches than 30-minute chunks.”

That’s because our brains tend to wander after 30 minutes of intense focus, and we need to take a minute break to re-set.

“Make studying a regular habit,” adds McGrath. “Many students assume the only time they need to study is when they have a deadline but engaging in on-going review will help optimize their learning, so when deadlines approach, they don’t have to cram.”

“It’s really a test of give-and-take, and trying different techniques, but it starts with having an honest awareness of what someone’s particular approach to learning is.”",[]

Read', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Kristen Thompsonspecial To The Starmon.']",2020-03-09,"New students usually have a list of must-know spots on their college or university campus: the library, coffee shop, bus loop and bookstore. But campuses are full of equally important resource spaces that all first-years should familiarize themselves with if they want to make the most of their experience. And this can begin before classes even start

“Everybody’s got a Twitter feed, everybody’s got an Instagram page, says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. ""As soon as students know what university they are going to, they should follow some of those (accounts).”

Signing up to participate in your school’s orientation program is another great first step in learning not only where the arts or sciences buildings are, but also health and wellness services, writing centres, financial aid, learning support, counselling, career centres, LGBTQ+ or Indigenous groups, and other on-campus resources.

And don’t discount the value of connecting with older students. Humber College, for example, has a first-year experience program that matches new students with upper-year mentors, and runs events informed by student needs.

“It is important for students to be connected to the campus community, because often that connection leads to … a greater opportunity for success academically and personally,” says Ian Crookshank, Humber’s dean of students.

“Through connecting with the campus community, students are not only more informed in terms of what support is available, but also better able to recognize when things aren’t going quite right. During a student’s journey, bumps in the road are inevitable. Challenges can arise academically, emotionally, financially and personally. There are some students who have a support system that can help them through the bumps. For other students, that support system may need a little bolstering.

“The campus community can help to normalize what a student is going through, let them know that for every valley there will be a peak, and provide them with several ways to help find what they need to (do to) overcome. This is done by accessing resources, but also having … an open door to a space where they can be themselves, or a connection to an opportunity to grow.”

Crookshank points out that while there is a fair amount of well-intentioned discussion about the need to increase the resilience of today’s youth, that mentality also misses the point that for many of our students, life to this point has not been easy.

“The thing that is sometimes in need of development for those in first year is an understanding of how to access that resilience and resourcefulness in a post-secondary context, how to remain positive and ask for help. That’s where connection to the campus, learning about the resources, understanding the culture, etc. can be incredibly helpful. And when they feel overwhelmed or challenged, they know that there is an incredible group of people who want to see them succeed and are there to help.”

Ultimately, students should remind themselves that university and college life is about more than just academia: It’s about feeling whole and at home.",[]

Leaving friends, family and familiarity behind is tough, but a new community can be found on your campus – you just need to know where (and how) to look.

“It is absolutely true that our antidote to all the stress that life throws at us is our social connections,” says Steve Joordens, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto. “So, when you pick somebody up and transplant them somewhere else, they lose that connection.”

Not only is it normal, but actually expected for first-year students to have bouts of loneliness, and in turn feel more stressed than normal, he says. The best way to overcome those feelings of loneliness and stress is to create a new social network where you are.

“Connect with others who share some interests that you share,” Joordens suggests. Look into clubs, teams or organizations on campus that are devoted to one of your areas of interest, and join in. Making friends with people who share your hobbies – and allowing you to discuss familiar topics – can really help students make new social connections.

If walking into a room full of strangers seems overwhelming, Joordens suggests connecting with one of the organizers or members online, first.

“A lot of students, especially with phones and social networks being so powerful, (find it) low-risk to reach out to somebody in a chat,” he says. “Find that first friend, have chats on social media, and get comfortable with that person on that platform. … It’s a less risky, more controlled way to get to know somebody, but don’t let it become a crutch or a hard chasm to cross.”

Ultimately, says Joordens, connecting in-person is the goal. A simple strategy to tackle that first get-to-know-you conversation is to ask the other person questions about themselves, which often makes the conversation go smoother.

“The reason we all find it hard (to make new friends) is we all have a mild form of social anxiety, (or fear) we will do something that makes a fool of ourselves,” says Joordens. “That’s a threat, and that threat makes our sympathetic nervous system act up. So, when we’re about to walk into a room full of strangers, that’s what makes us feel nervous.”

The trick is learning to control that fear. “Go on YouTube and look for guided relaxation videos. Rather than telling yourself to stop being nervous, you can learn to tell yourself to relax,” Joordens says.

Ultimately, being able to connect human-to-human and walk into a room full of strangers is an important skill for future success, and students will have to continue facing that fear long into adulthood.

“Yes, it will be uncomfortable, but you’ve got to do it,” Joordens says. You never know, you may make life-long friends in the process.",[]

Since the legalization of recreational cannabis use in Canada in 2018, there has been high demand for skilled workers in all areas of the industry.

The majority of job opportunities focus on cannabis cultivation, harvesting, processing, manufacturing, and administration. Educational programs to train or certify students in these areas have been few and far between, however. Those that do exist are located far outside of the GTA.

Meeting industry demands

Centennial College is set to launch a new cannabis cultivation and processing certificate program this fall that will bridge this gap and cultivate much-needed workers in Toronto.

The entry-level part-time program will offer both theoretical and hands-on education in the cultivation of cannabis, from seed to sale.

“Most of the existing cannabis cultivation programs in Ontario are in Niagara, or Guelph, or the hinterland, and there’s a dearth of talent for us here in Toronto,” says Joe Goldfarb, curriculum developer and instructor for the new program. “We saw a gap here in the city that needed to be filled.”

Joe Goldfarb - Curriculum Developer & Instructor, Cannabis Cultivation Program, Centennial College

Cultivating the best

Students in Centennial’s new cannabis cultivation and processing program will take courses in a blended format, with practical experience at a licensed cannabis production facility. “Our program is split into two parts,” says Goldfarb, who is also the head of operations at local cannabis company Medz Cannabis and so has an insider’s understanding of the industry.

“There’s an online component and an on-site component. We’ve paired the theoretical learning with on-site learning here at our facility. Students will get hands-on experience working with cannabis plants. They’ll be helping with every single facet of the industry.”

The hands-on learning will cover working with nutrients, pest control management, different stages in the growth cycle of a cannabis plant, pruning and trimming, sanitization, documentation, and compliance with government policy, laws and regulations. It’s a well-rounded, comprehensive education. “This isn’t happening anywhere else in terms of cannabis industry education,” says Goldfarb.

The program’s courses include introduction to cannabis studies, cannabis law, cannabis cultivation theory, cannabis cultivation systems, cannabis processing theory, and formulation of cannabis products.

A reputation of excellence

Over the past 50 years, Centennial College has transformed itself from a local community college into a worldly institution, with a presence in countries like China, India, South Korea, and Brazil.

Centennial has a record of exemplary teaching, innovative programming, and extensive partnership building. This new program fits the bill in terms of the college’s reputation as a forward-thinking school.

There’s a present and growing need for well-trained staff in cultivation facilities across Canada. Centennial’s new program will prepare graduates for job opportunities in cultivation operations, quality assurance and quality control, processing, consumer education, and more.

Centennial’s cannabis cultivation and processing program is the first of its kind and is open to anyone (aged 19+) who wants to explore a career in the cannabis industry. For more information, visit centennialcollege.ca.",[]

That’s because evidence suggests that artificial intelligence — or AI — will be one of the leading economic drivers of our time, with an estimated worldwide business value of $3.9 trillion USD by the year 2022.

Canada has quickly become a leader in the AI space, with research strength and transformative startups. In fact, Montreal has the highest concentration of researchers and students of deep learning (a subgroup of machine learning in AI) in the world, and Toronto has the highest concentration of AI startups in the world. As AI and machine learning are increasingly changing and improving how we do business, companies don’t want to be left behind. And with more companies adopting these technologies, the demand for high-quality talent is on the rise.



The university recognized the demand for data scientists within organizations, and the small talent pool, and decided to bridge the gap. The program aims to help put students on the right path toward a career as a data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, or AI practitioner.

Students in the program have the opportunity to work in cross-functional teams to translate learnings into business insights and help guide business decisions. “The majority of our students are mature students who have some work experience and are looking to reskill or upskill within their careers,” says Beitinjaneh, “and what they learn can be applied directly to their work.”

Jean-Olivier Pitre, a data engineer with the Société de transport de Montréal (STM), Montreal’s municipal transport service, enrolled in the program to advance his skills in turning data into insight, and it paid off. “Because of the advanced analytics work that I produced with my team on how to optimize service on the Montréal metro's orange line, I received the Coup de Coeur STM award, an award given to STM employees who did astounding work for the customer experience and/or directly contributed to our 2025 organizational plan,” he says. “This wouldn’t have been possible without this program. McGill gave me the knowledge and the tools, but especially the roadmap and strategy on how to generate value from data in order to make a positive impact in the real world — in our case, to millions of weekly users”

The public sector industry has shown notable gain, with a trend of 54,000 net new jobs in the last year. Compared to 12 months earlier, the survey found that jobs in the industry grew by 1.8 percent and the public sector’s total number of employees increased by 33,000.

“About 3.6 million Canadians are employed in the public sector,” says Carmen Sicilia, associate professor and director of indigenous relations at McGill University School of Continuing Studies. “These public service positions are in every single community — not just in large cities, but small communities including Indigenous communities in Northern Canada.”

Starting a career in the public sector

The School of Continuing Studies at McGill prepares individuals for jobs in the present and future, regardless of whether they’re launching their career, growing their career, or newcomers to Canada who need to rebuild their career. Launched in 2018, the undergraduate-level certificate in public administration and governance was so successful that inquiring students had to be put on a waiting list. To follow up on that success and meet the demand, McGill has launched a graduate-level diploma in the subject which has already began accepting applications and will launch this fall.

“The certificate and diploma in public administration and governance aim to help learners prepare for a career in the public sector or advance their current career positions,” says Sicilia. “The curriculum aims to strengthen students’ managerial and leadership competencies and equip them with the knowledge, analytical skills, and problem-solving strategies that are critical for success in public service organizations.”

The new programs are both completely online and follow a blended approach, meaning classes are live, allowing students to connect and interact with the course lecturer and classmates, alongside parts that are self-directed and can be done online from anywhere the student wishes to do classwork.

“Individuals don’t have to leave their jobs, their families, or their communities,” says Sicilia. “What’s so fascinating is the sharing that goes on in the classroom. Because individuals are working in various communities, learning doesn’t just come from the lecturers, but from the learners themselves.”

“The jobs are there,” says Sicilia, adding that programs in public administration and governance, like the one at McGill, give people the opportunity to get access to these careers. “We listened to what the needs are from the organizations and we asked them specifically, ‘What competencies and skills do you want individuals to come out with? Don’t give us course names. What tools or knowledge do they need to have?’”

Debbie Verduga, crime analyst

Verduga has spent more than 10 years working in GIS (geographic information systems), analyzing data spacially. Four years ago, she went to work for the Toronto Police doing crime analysis. She was recently promoted to senior data visualization and open data specialist, overseeing data and building solutions for crime analysts. Recently, Verduga decided to go back to school part time to complete her crime analytic certificate through The Chang School at Ryerson, which she expects to finish this spring. “The big advantage is that the program helps you analyze crime using state-of-the-art technology and specifically tailored techniques. The technology is always changing, so ongoing education is important. This kind of training is also great for those working in crime analysis for banks, insurance and consulting companies.”

Sherry O’Connor, critical care nurse

O’Connor finished nursing school in May 2018 and applied to Scarborough General Hospital to work in critical care, partially due to a unique opportunity to work on the unit while doing a critical care nursing program at Humber. “I wanted to be a critical care nurse and because I believe so strongly that lifelong learning is essential to my profession, this seemed like a great opportunity.” The course ran for 12 weeks; O’Connor was paid her full-time wage to do clinical hours on her unit and spend time in the classroom. “It was an intense 12 weeks but, in the end, I was fully oriented and ready with the skills I needed to work on the unit.”

Ian Hollingbery, landscape designer

Hollingbery left his corporate financial career in 2013 to pursue his passion for gardening. He worked towards his garden design certificate at George Brown while starting up his landscape design business, the Artful Gardener. “It was perfect timing because everything I learned in class, I was able to apply and use in my business.” He has continued to take advantage of the benefits of lifelong learning since finishing his certificate in 2015. Hollingbery is currently working on a certificate in horticultural therapy and hopes to develop a therapy program for teenagers with autism. He also plans to take construction courses through George Brown to help him work more knowledgably with contractors.

Charmaine Pelletier, retirement residence general manager

Pelletier had worked in the retirement field as a culinary services manager and executive chef, but in order to move ahead in her career, she decided to take the retirement communities management course through Centennial College. “With encouragement from my employer, Delmanor, I studied while I worked as interim general manager, an assistant manager, and eventually general manager.” Pelletier took one module at a time, completing all 10 modules online while she worked. “The modules gave me the full spectrum of what happens in every department. It makes you a well-rounded manager.” Pelletier’s corporate management team has seen the benefits and they have since encouraged others who are interested in management to register for the program.",[]

Read', 'Michelle Williamsspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-03-10,"Ten or 20 years ago, the lines were very distinct between full-time post-secondary education, which was primarily daytime classroom study, and continuing education, or “night school”.

In today’s world, nothing is quite as distinct. “The lines are blurring. If you ask students in full-time programs or those in continuing education, they’re all looking for flexible learning opportunities: experiential learning, learning on the job, in a lab, online,” explains Emily Milic, public relations and communications manager for Humber College. “These days, flexible learning is embedded in the DNA of most curriculums. Full-time and continuing education students have families and commitments and flexibility is key to a successful program.”

Continuing education has also changed in recent years. “It continues to provide opportunities for individuals to learn new skills or improve their existing skills, but employers are now working with the continuing education colleges on planning curriculums and ensuring their employees get what they need from the continuing education experience,” explains Milic.

Humber, for example, has an education training solutions department to directly work with individual companies. “The group works with individual companies directly to work out their needs and help them devise curriculums to reach those goals, whether that means single-day training sessions or a long-term course series,” says Milic. Most continuing education providers have relationships with corporate partners, and the arrangements are variable, but the goal is that these programs will provide educational options that work for both the learner and the corporate organization.

Why are corporations so involved in the structure of continuing education? One term used to describe today’s continuing education is open-loop learning. “It used to be that you went to school to get your credentials, then you went on to work at your career. Typically these days, though, you’re in and out of continuing education throughout your career. We are facilitating that by creating programs that meet the needs of those individuals and their employers,” says Milic.

This certainly suits the way people want to learn and the way industry wants and needs them to learn. And while industry is involved in curriculum across the board, the relationships vary. In some cases, institutions of learning are working with companies to develop very specific programs for employees, to help them develop professionally and personally. In other cases, employers help support employee advancement by offering educational assistance programs to employees.

One such relationship is between Walmart Canada and Humber as lead education partner. Walmart offers financial assistance to associates and their families, providing opportunities for tuition reimbursement and demonstrating their commitment to their employees.

Humber’s Barrett Centre for Technology and Innovation has partnership agreements with several sector companies who are working together to develop education geared to employment pathways and recruitment opportunities for Humber students and graduates. Initiatives include STEM outreach activities, robotic equipment and audio-visual systems.

Ultimately, this new role of continuing education schools partnering with corporations is working for all parties, providing win-win situations for employers and their employees.",[]

Blockchain Development

York University School of Continuing Studies

Launching in fall 2020, York’s Continuing Studies will feature two unique programs dedicated to the development of blockchain, an emerging technology used to help encrypt and secure data, making it more resistant to alteration. There is a huge demand for blockchain developers, and these programs are designed to fill the growing skills gap. One of the two programs at York will be “blended” — students take most of the program online and come in for one in-class weekend session per course. There will also be a full-time post-graduate program in blockchain development.

Cannabis Industry Studies

Seneca

This emerging market is rapidly expanding in Canada and globally and this program is in response to the demand for individuals with cannabis-related knowledge across a number of sectors.

Fundamentals of Mental Health

Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)

This eight-week online course includes an overview of symptoms and treatment strategies for mood disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia, and health-promoting strategies used when working with clients experiencing mental illness. Open to those interested in learning more about fundamentals of mental health, it’s recommended as a preparatory course for the CAMH’s disorders certificate program.",[]

Read', 'Stephen Whynothe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Stephen Whynothe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"Dallas defenceman Roman Polak and Vancouver forward Sven Baertschi on Saturday joined the list of players who won’t be reporting to training camp for the resumption of the NHL season.

Baertschi told the Canucks he’d be opting out of participating in the expanded 24-team playoffs, following Calgary defenceman Travis Hamonic informing the Flames he won’t be playing because of family reasons. Polak is not on the Stars’ roster for the start of training camp Monday, and a team spokesman said the 34-year-old veteran won’t be attending at this time.

Polak is a pending free agent who last month agreed to a deal in his native Czech Republic next season and told reporters there he wasn’t planning on returning to the NHL if play resumed. Baertschi, who spent much of this season in the minors, is under contract through 2020-21.

“Sven informed us late yesterday that he has chosen to opt out of the NHL return to play program,” Canucks general manager Jim Benning said. “It was a difficult decision but ultimately one we respect and understand.”

The Tampa Bay Lightning won’t have captain Steven Stamkos at 100 per cent for the opening of camp because of a lower-body injury, but they’re optimistic he’ll be ready when games get under way in early August. GM Julien BriseBois said Stamkos fully recovered from core muscle surgery in early March but was injured again during voluntary workouts.

“We don’t have a specific timeline for when he will be a full participant in camp, but we expect he will be ready in time for games,” BriseBois said. “He’s here, he’s skating, he’s been getting treatment, he’s been coming to Amalie (Arena) doing his dry land work. But he will not be a full participant on Day One of training camp.”

While Stamkos has a better chance of being ready for Tampa Bay’s next game than he would have after surgery if the playoffs had started in mid-April, the Flames will have to cope without Hamonic when they open their series against Winnipeg on Aug. 1.

Hamonic became the first player to publicly choose not to play in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamonic’s daughter was hospitalized last year with respiratory issues, and he and his wife also have a baby boy. Their health concerns, not the soon-to-be 30-year-old’s impending free agency, led him to opt out.

“I wish I could lace up my skates and be out there battling, blocking a shot and helping my team win, but my family has and always will come first,” Hamonic said. “Being my little kids’ dad every day is the most important job I have. I love this game and by team. This is a decision that is extremely hard for me to make.”

Flames general manager Brad Treliving said, “While we will miss Travis in our lineup, we understand and respect his decision.”

The Lightning already got a pandemic scare when three players and additional staff tested positive for the novel coronavirus last month. The positive test results forced the team to close its facilities for a brief period of time.

The Minnesota Wild, who face the Canucks in the qualifying round, ruled out defenceman Greg Pateryn indefinitely with an upper-body injury. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said Saturday the league will be taking over injury and illness disclosure from teams as a way of protecting player privacy.

And then, something different happened","['Joanna Chiu', 'Joanna Chiuvancouver Bureauthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Joanna Chiuvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Joanna Chiu Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Both Canada-China Relations', 'Current Affairs On The West Coast For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"VANCOUVER—As she boarded a bus Monday after a morning of classes at a downtown Vancouver campus, Tina Hoang was pleased to see that most passengers were physically distancing.

She sat down at an empty area near the middle of the bus.

But soon, a white man got on board and walked by a row of people who were all wearing masks, who all happened to be people of colour.

“Jesus Christ! Everyone is wearing a mask. It’s the f---ing Chinese virus,” he ranted loudly.

Hoang, who is 21, said she snapped at that moment after enduring months of dirty looks from people in Vancouver, which she attributed to scapegoating for the coronavirus outbreak.

I told him, “Hey, that’s really racist! Don’t say that! It’s very rude of you.”

The man stopped and stood over Hoang, who is a small woman of just five feet.

At that moment, Hoang felt scared, but she stood her ground and demanded an apology from the man.

He snarled, “No! It’s a Chinese virus, from Chinese people eating s---.”

That’s when other passengers on the bus stepped up.

To Hoang, it felt like a collective uprising against a spate of racist attacks in the city.

In March, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.

Eight per cent of Chinese Canadians respondents said they have been physically attacked by strangers during the pandemic, according to a recent survey from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta.

On the bus, the passengers weren’t going to stand by for another attack.

Two older women, one of Latino descent and the other of Southeast Asian descent, began to lecture the man about his “shameful” behaviour.

They were trying to educate him about why people wear masks, Hoang told the Star.

“The women said something along the lines of, ‘Everyone is trying to be respectful and take care of each other by wearing masks and keeping a distance.’”

Some passengers said, “Don’t be racist!” while others chose more subtle means of solidarity, changing their seats to stand or sit protectively around Hoang, who had burst into tears.

“You made this girl cry; how can you do that?” one man said.

Hoang told the Star she was shaking from anger, thinking about the racism her family endured when they lived in a mostly white suburb of Mississauga, Ont. Her parents are immigrants from China and Vietnam.

“People belittled my mother for not speaking English correctly, and white men hit on her. I couldn’t believe my mother had to stand up for her rights, and I still have to do it now,” Hoang said.

Before she reached her stop, the man struck out again, telling her, “You’re a piece of s--- for eating s---.”

“I hope you can find inner peace,” Hoang responded calmly.

Of the 516 Chinese Canadians who responded to the poll from the Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta, 43 per cent also reported being threatened or intimidated.

“Every day, I pray that you people die,” is one of the threats and name-calling instances respondents reported.

“Since March 2020, I have been repeatedly yelled at on the sidewalk in my own neighborhood,” said one person who took part in the survey.

Because of the support of her fellow passengers, Hoang says she feels hopeful about the future.

“Canada has systemic racism, but people are willing to stand up for change and that makes me proud to be Canadian,” she said.

Read', 'Brenna Owenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Brenna Owenthe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-07-09,"VANCOUVER—Reputed gang leader Jamie Bacon pleaded guilty Thursday to a charge stemming from shootings in 2007 that left six people dead at a highrise apartment building in Surrey, B.C.

Bacon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to murder Corey Lal in the so-called Surrey Six case.

He also pleaded guilty to one count of counselling to commit murder in a separate case involving the shooting of a man who survived an attack on Dec. 31, 2008.

Sentencing has been tentatively scheduled for July 23, when victim impact statements will be heard by the court.

Court heard a joint sentencing submission that includes 18 years for conspiracy to murder and 10 years for counselling to commit murder to be served concurrently.

Outside court, defence lawyer Kevin Westell said if the sentencing submission is accepted, Bacon is looking at an additional five to six years in prison after time served is taken into account.

“This has been a long, deliberative process of coming to the right agreement with the Crown,” he said. “We’ve come to a resolution that’s principled and that’s appropriate from all sides.”

Bacon was also charged with one count of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case, but only pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal. Court heard the murder charge will be stayed at the sentencing hearing.

Police have said four of the victims were targeted, but Chris Mohan, who lived on the floor where the killings occurred, and Ed Schellenberg, a maintenance worker, were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Eileen Mohan said outside court that she would like to see Bacon serve at least 12 years for his part in the Surrey Six case.

“It breaks my heart,” she said when asked about the possibility Bacon could be free in five or six years.

“This crime came to my doorstep. We didn’t go to it, and this crime dictated my son’s life that he’s buried and dead now, and it’s dictating our lives for the last 13 years. That has to be considered.”

Mohan said she will deliver a victim impact statement in person at the sentencing hearing.

“I will have my day in court with him,” she said.

“Six people’s lives meant something to this country and to the laws of Canada.”

It’s yet to be determined whether Bacon will appear at the sentencing in person or via video link due to restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.

In court documents, the Crown alleges that at the time of the murders, Bacon was a leader of the Red Scorpions gang.

The officer in charge of the investigation previously told the court it was one of the largest and most complex investigations that police have undertaken in the province. By November 2016, about 1,300 officers had been involved in the investigation.

In 2014, two men were convicted of six counts of first-degree murder in the Surrey Six case.

Read', 'Alex Mckeenvancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Alex Mckeen Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Transportation', 'Labour For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"VANCOUVER—Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond says the greatest hurdle as she investigates a “game” in which B.C. doctors and nurses allegedly guessed the blood-alcohol levels of Indigenous patients may be hearing from the health-care workers who participated.

So she’s making the promise that any health-care worker with information about the racist practice — including those who participated or watched it happen — will not be reported to their bosses if they take part in the investigation.

Turpel-Lafond says she’s already hearing from Indigenous people from every corner of the province. The calls and stories recounting racist, sometimes harrowing treatment in emergency rooms have been “countless,” she said.

The Indigenous lawyer, who’s known for her child-welfare advocacy, was appointed by Health Minister Adrian Dix three weeks ago to lead an investigation. Since then, Turpel-Lafond has assembled an investigative team, launched a website, survey and phone line to deal with allegations that health-care staff made a game out of guessing the blood-alcohol levels of Indigenous patients in emergency rooms before treating them.

No health-care workers have yet been suspended as a result of the allegations, which Dix said weeks ago were credible enough to warrant the investigation.

Turpel-Lafond said the focus of the investigation will be to get to the bottom of what happened, not to “name and blame.”

The promise of confidentiality is not what some were hoping for initially.

Richard Jock, interim CEO of the First Nations Health Authority, a provincial body that delivers health services to 200 First Nation communities in B.C., said in a previous interview he was initially surprised to hear the allegations, but upon speaking to Indigenous doctors, found out that such things may be common in the province.

“This particular game may have been in play for many years,” he said.

Jock said it would be crucial for the investigation to reveal details of those involved in the practice, so that there can be professional action and accountability to the communities they serve.

Of note, B.C.’s legislation protecting whistleblowers does not yet apply to the health authorities.

Turpel-Lafond said the stories she’s heard over the past several weeks dealt specifically with the issue of the “disturbing” blood-alcohol guessing practice, as well as broader issues of anti-Indigenous racism faced by patients.

“As an Indigenous person, I’m not completely shocked. The stories that I’ve heard are very difficult stories,” she said. “In some instances, they’re stories where a person’s life has been lost. I certainly feel that pain that I’m hearing.”

Turpel-Lafond said it’s become clear to her that an investigation on this topic is overdue in B.C., and that she urgently needs to hear from Indigenous people and health-care professionals across the province to get to the bottom of the allegations.

She said, professional associations including Doctors of B.C. and the B.C. Nurses Union have been “unequivocal” in their support of her investigation.

“If there are obstacles and it cannot be done, we need to go down another path,” she said, referring to the possibility that she may recommend the investigation morph into an inquiry in the future.

She also said it’s crucial that even as disturbing allegations of treatment of Indigenous people emerge, First Nations, Métis and Inuit people should continue to seek out the health-care services they need, particularly as B.C. continues to face health crises from the COVID-19 virus and opioid overdoses.

Turpel-Lafond is known for delivering frank and thorough feedback on public-interest issues, particularly on the topic of child welfare. In 2015, she wrote an extensive report criticizing a government-commissioned report on child-welfare reforms, saying that not enough was done to consult Indigenous groups.

Turpel-Lafond said she hopes to have an initial report completed in a matter of months.

Read', 'Steve Mckinleyhalifax Bureau', 'Halifax Bureau', 'Wanyee Livancouver Bureau', 'Vancouver Bureau', 'Smsteve Mckinley Is A Halifax-Based Reporter For The Star. Reach Him Via Email']",2020-07-09,"VANCOUVER—Everytime Melissa Steinhauer sees a police officer, she worries they might start asking questions.

In her neighbourhood, the Downtown Eastside, drug use is prevalent and so is conflict between users and police.

Steinhauer, who uses heroin and cocaine, said she’s thought about being arrested for possession “many times, but it hasn’t happened, which I’m thankful for.”

The fear she describes is what experts say has proven deadly time and time again, pushing drug users further underground and away from harm-reduction services.

Years deep in an opioid crisis that’s raged across the country and even become deadlier, in some quarters, during the pandemic, Canada’s police chiefs say it’s time to try a different approach.

They’re publicly calling for the decriminalization of the personal possession of illicit drugs and for all police agencies in the country to recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue, rather than a criminal one.

In a new statement, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police proposed diverting people dealing with substance abuse or addiction issues away from the criminal system and toward social services and health care. The association stipulated such change would need to be synchronized nationally.

“Canada continues to grapple with the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug supply that has devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives,” said Chief Const. Adam Palmer, president of the CACP in the release.

“We recommend that enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focused approach that requires partnerships between police, health care and all levels of government.”

The report also endorsed access to users of a safe supply of pharmaceutical-grade opioids to combat the uncertain composition of illegal street drugs, which is the cause of many opioid overdoses. It further made a recommendation in favour of supervised consumption sites — where people could use drugs in a clean, safe environment, under the supervision of health professionals trained in emergency intervention.

Under the CACP recommendations, police would continue to target drug traffickers, producers and importers.

Steinhauer, who is a secretary at the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society, said decriminalizing personal possession of illicit drugs would be a step in the right direction. Police though, she said, need to recognize the damage they do when officers seize drugs from dealers as well.

When her regular dealer loses his dope to officers, Steinhauer is sometimes left scrambling and forced to buy drugs from someone she doesn’t know. Sometimes that means the drugs are contaminated.

“Then I don’t know what’s in it,” she said. “Sometimes when you’re really sick, you don’t think ‘Oh, I’m going to get it tested.’ You just want to feel better. You want to get your medicine and feel better.”

There have been 15,393 apparent opioid-related deaths in Canada between January 2016 and December 2019, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

In May, more than five people in B.C. died every day from illicit drug overdose, the highest number yet recorded in the province, according to the BC Coroners Service.

The recommendations from the CACP were spawned by a Special Purpose Committee report titled: Decriminalization for Simple Possession of Illicit Drugs: Exploring Impacts on Public Safety & Policing.

Waterloo police Chief Brian Larkin, who co-chairs the CACP’s Special Purpose Committee, said the opioid crisis — which began on the West Coast around 2014 and swept across the country over the next two years — made it clear that some changes were due.

“When you look at policing, we’re responsible for advancing public safety in Canada,” said Larkin. “And we have a consensus amongst police leaders, including federally, that it’s time to have a dialogue. What’s been happening in the past clearly is not working for us.”

He said in preparing the report, they examined the approaches of countries such as Portugal, Sweden and Norway, where drug possession is still illegal, but criminal sanction, it’s been decided, is not the solution.

Drug policy advocates applauded the Canadian police chiefs’ call for decriminalization, but some were wary of the programs that might replace current practices.

“The way that CAPC has framed it, suggests they may be in favour of implementing some kind of administrative regime. So if somebody is found to be in possession, they won’t get criminal charges, but they may get a fine, or they may be forced into treatment,” said Caitlin Shane, a staff lawyer at Pivot Legal Society.

“When people fear arrest, or detention, or any kind of penalty, they’re going to be forced into more precarious scenarios, when using drugs.”

The organization has been calling on authorities to recognize the “harms of criminalization” for decades, said Shane.

“What we want to see is a situation where no one is penalized, whether criminally or administratively, for possessing small amounts of drugs for personal use.”

In the CACP report, the committee outlines the toll of the opioid crisis and why it believes decriminalization of possession alone won’t work.

“While decriminalization can reduce some harms for people who use drugs, they are still dependent on an illegal market where the contents and strength of drugs are unknown. The unregulated drug supply in Canada has become toxic leading to overdoses and death.”

The recommendations put forth by CACP would require some changes to the Controlled and Substances Act, said Larkin. That puts the onus going forward on the federal government.

“At the end of the day, we can suggest, we can recommend, but it’s up to the federal government to introduce legislation,” he said. “But we think that we will have a voice — this isn’t some utopian pie-in-the-sky thing that we’re floating out there. We feel very confident in our discussions with government.”

The CACP made it clear that its recommendations for dealing with the opioid crisis were independent of the ongoing conversation on scaling back police funding in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota on May 25.

“A decriminalization or diversion model will not provide any opportunity for police agencies to reduce their operating budgets or staffing,” said the report, which was dated July 2020.

“Some have suggested that decriminalization would free up police officer time and budgets could be reallocated to other priorities; however, police agencies must continue to resource drug enforcement units dedicated to disrupting the illicit drug markets.”

Read', 'Alex Boutilierottawa Bureau', 'Ottawa Bureau', 'Alex Boutilier Is An Ottawa-Based Reporter Covering National Politics For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"OTTAWA–WE Charity hired 465 people to help administer the federal government’s student volunteer grant program. And then a political scandal hit.

The charity organization laid off 450 contract workers across the country last week and told them not to speak about their work with WE. The charity told the Star that the 15 other new hires were found full-time positions within the organization.

The workers were hired as contractors — some fixed-term, others “independent” — to deliver the Canada Student Service Grant, the Liberal government’s $900-million program to pay students for volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially said WE was selected to run the program because it was the “best and only” organization capable of doing it.

But as the government faced persistent questioning about Trudeau and his family’s personal relationship with WE, and the decision to give the charity $19.5 million to administer the program, the Liberals and WE announced a mutual decision to nix the deal.

Now hundreds of people caught in the middle of the unfolding political scandal are out of work as the global pandemic stretches on.

“While we were hopeful that we might continue to work with a number of these individuals, the circumstances we are facing as a result of the (program) made this impossible,” WE Charity wrote in a statement to the Star on Saturday. “Due to the transition of the (program), we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to end the contracts for those hired in that capacity.”

WE said that, since handing the program back to the government, the charity “did not take any of the funds that were allocated to pay for the work to date or remaining work.

“All sunk costs and remaining payments to staff and vendors are being paid for by WE Charity.”

Two sources told the Star that WE originally indicated it would honour the contracts, most of which were set to end Aug. 31, according to the organization. But on Tuesday, the sources said, WE let them go. The organization told the Star that workers were given additional compensation based on how long they had worked with WE.

Asked about the confusion over WE honouring the full contract, the charity said: “We apologize if any of our communications with these employees felt incomplete.”

One of the clauses of the termination agreement with WE instructed its former contractors not to speak with the media about their work with the charity.

“The clauses in the contracts for fixed term and independent contractors related to intellectual property and maintaining confidentiality are standard across the organization,” WE wrote in a statement.

The organization told the Star that workers were given additional compensation based on how long they had worked with WE.

The WE deal has become a significant political scandal for Trudeau and the Liberals. While questions were immediately raised about the prime minister’s participation in WE-hosted events, and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau’s connections to the charity, it was revealed this week that WE’s for-profit corporation paid Trudeau’s mother and brother a combined $284,000 in speaking fees between 2016 and 2020.

On Friday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau was drawn into the scandal after his office admitted that his daughter was employed by the charity.

Neither Morneau nor Trudeau recused themselves from cabinet’s decision to award the contract to WE. Trudeau is now facing his third ethics investigation as prime minister, and the opposition NDP is urging Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion to launch a similar probe into Morneau.

Read', 'Kevin Mcgranstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Kevin Mcgran Is A Star Sports Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"NHL commissioner Gary Bettman took offence to the notion that the league, teams or players might not abide by, or may try to evade, the COVID-19 protocol that will be an integral part to holding the Stanley Cup playoffs in Toronto and Edmonton.

Notably, any player who tests positive must self-isolate and be removed from team activities until deemed free of the coronavirus.

“I think the question — not to push back on it too hard — presumes a level of dishonesty and a lack of integrity (that we) and the people we serve would reject categorically,” Bettman said during a Saturday video conference call. “The fact is that all of us, and everybody we serve, understands the importance and the seriousness of what we’re dealing with.

“And I don’t think anybody is going to want to be involved in playing games with the truth, the facts and the reality of what we’re all dealing with.”

Bettman, deputy commissioner Bill Daly, players’ association head Don Fehr and his special assistant, former player Mathieu Schneider, assembled for a video conference call to tout their double achievement: a collective agreement coupled with a return-to-play outline that will see training camps open Monday for 24 teams and the Stanley Cup now up for grabs.

The protocol is a big reason why the federal and provincial governments are allowing the tournament at all, with teams given exemptions from the 14-day quarantine rules that otherwise apply when someone crosses the border into Canada. A player who tests positive or shows symptoms of the contagious virus must be isolated from everyone else until he passes two tests, as well as a doctor’s appraisal.

In the middle of a pandemic with more than 600 players and team officials set to descend on Toronto and an equal number in Edmonton, trust is an issue.

NHLers are famous for playing through injuries and hiding illnesses with the Stanley Cup on the line. Doctors and other observers have questioned whether teams and the league even follow their own protocols when it comes to diagnosing concussions.

“If concussions were contagious, I think players would feel differently about it,” said Schneider. “And I think the guys certainly understand the notion that if they are not honest with symptoms, or how they might feel, that they put their entire team in jeopardy.”

NHL officials recently announced 35 players had tested positive for COVID-19, without any further details, and they don’t intend to release the names of anyone who tests positive going forward. They will also refrain from announcing any injuries during the playoffs, to mask whether players have COVID-19 or some other ailment.

“I think the interests of medical privacy are important, and we’re going to protect them,” said Daly.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said he had “a high level of optimism they will follow the protocols. I think that they also understand that if they don’t, the whole tournament could come apart. There’s a lot at stake here.”

Read', 'Peter Edwardsstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Peter Edwards Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Primarily Covering Crime For The Star. Reach Him Email At Pedwards Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-11,"There likely won’t be any retaliation for the murder of Hamilton mobster Pasquale (Pat) Musitano, who was shot dead on a Burlington street Friday afternoon, according to a former undercover cop.

“Pat was done . . . ,” Paul Manning said in an interview of Saturday. “He burned his bridges . . . I think that’s the end of it.”

Halton Region police haven’t identified any suspects in the murder of Musitano and the wounding of a second man, who has not been identified. The second shooting victim was in serious condition in hospital on Saturday while Musitano was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police report that one male suspect fled the scene of the 1 p.m. shooting at 484 Plains Road East in Burlington, heading west in a grey, four-door sedan, which police described as similar to a new model Infiniti Q50 with a sunroof. This vehicle will have fresh damage to the driver’s side near the doors, police said.

Musitano, 52, had fallen far in the past decade, from when he had been considered by police to be an Ontario lieutenant for Vito Rizzuto of Montreal, who died of natural causes in December 2013.

In the past few years, Musitano grew increasingly isolated after his younger brother Angelo was murdered and his uncle Tony Musitano died of natural causes. No one has been charged in Angelo Musitano’s murder.

Pat Musitano’s father Domenic died of natural causes in 1995 at age 57. Domenic Musitano was cleared in 1983 on four charges of conspiracy to commit extortion and jailed in 1985 as an accessory after the fact in the slaying of Domenic Racco, the son of Toronto mobster/baker Michele (Mike) Racco.

Pat Musitano made plenty of enemies recently through a scam that involved drawing investors into a gravel company, Manning said.

One Toronto investor was able to get some $400,000 back, after threatening Musitano, but plenty of others were angry and frustrated, Manning said.

In the final days before a hitman shot him dead Friday afternoon, Musitano found comfort in the frequent company of a senior citizen who was once his father’s bodyguard, sources say. The man is now 77 and never was an imposing specimen — standing five-foot-six and weighing 134 pounds, according to his RCMP file.

He was also of British heritage, meaning he could never be inducted into the Mafia, Manning said. Manning doesn’t expect that man to have any epiphany and begin co-operating with police because of his companion’s murder.

“He was a rounder,” Manning said. “He was a tough guy. That dude won’t flip either.”

Musitano’s elderly companion is described in a 2002 RCMP intelligence report as a “liaison” between the Buffalo mob and the Musitanos.

In its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, the Buffalo mob — nicknamed “The Arm” — was led by Stefano (The Undertaker) Magaddino, who ran a funeral home in Lewiston. Police said The Arm’s reach stretched from Western New York into Pennsylvania, Ohio and Ontario.

The report says Musitano’s elderly friend had previously been close to Niagara Falls, Ont. mobster Carmen Barilliaro, but something went wrong and there was a split in 1988.

Barillaro was murdered by hitman Ken Murdock in 1997 on the orders of Musitano and his brother, Angelo.

Both Musitano brothers were sentenced to 10-year prison terms.

Related charges against Pat Musitano for the 1997 murder of Hamilton mobster Johnny (Pops) Papalia were withdrawn by the Crown.

Pat Musitano was also a suspect in ordering the murder of Salvatore (Sam) Alaimo, 53, a factory janitor and father of five who was shot to death in the garage of his home on Nov. 21, 1985, after running up gambling debts.

Regarding Friday’s shooting, Halton police investigators appealed for anyone with dash cam a​nd/or commercial or residential surveillance footage from the area between 11 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. to contact them.",[]

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-11,"SAINT-APOLLINAIRE, QUE. — The bodies of two girls who were the subject of an Amber Alert were found in a suburb of Quebec City on Saturday, in what Premier François Legault is describing as a “national tragedy.”

Quebec provincial police said they found the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, in a wooded area of St-Apollinaire, Que., drawing to a close a days-long search that gripped the province.

“Like all Quebecers, I am devastated, without words. Losing two children, what we hold most dear in life, is incomprehensible,” Legault said on Twitter. “It is a national tragedy.”

He said that all of Quebec is grieving with Norah and Romy’s loved ones.

A spokeswoman for the provincial police confirmed the news of the girls’ deaths on Saturday afternoon, saying the investigation into the cause of death is ongoing.

But Ann Mathieu said the current priority is to locate the girls’ father, Martin Carpentier.

“We think that he is still in the area, so the police operation is still on to find him as soon as possible,” she said.

The girls had been missing since late Wednesday. Their disappearance has gripped people across the province who had hoped they would be found safe.

Police had said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east on the highway when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

An Amber Alert was issued for the girls Thursday afternoon, and an extensive police search began in the rural area south of Quebec City.

That search had resumed Saturday morning, with police deploying a helicopter, as well as canine units, ATVs and on-foot search teams, to try to locate the three people.

Police believe Carpentier could still be in St-Apollinaire or the nearby town of St-Agapit, Que., Mathieu said.

“We ask the residents of St-Apollinaire and also St-Agapit to really be alert,” she said.

Bernard Ouellet, the mayor of St-Apollinaire, said earlier Saturday that the tragedy touched the hearts of people across the province.

“Everyone has tears in their eyes,” Ouellet said in a brief interview. “It’s not easy for anyone.”

Mathieu said police are asking anyone who sees Carpentier or has any information on his whereabouts to immediately contact 911.

Police say the 44-year-old was wearing a grey T-shirt and jeans when he was last seen. He is listed as being five-foot-ten and weighing 130 pounds.

Read', 'Tonda Maccharlesottawa Bureau', 'Ottawa Bureau', 'Tonda Maccharles Is An Ottawa-Based Reporter Covering Federal Politics For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-25,"OTTAWA— Former top officials from Canada travelled to China last November in an attempt to free two Canadians detained there, the Star has learned.

The “bipartisan and non-partisan” effort to win the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor was part of a back-channel diplomatic effort at finding a compromise that its organizer, Gordon Houlden, believes must continue.

Houlden, the director of the University of Alberta’s China Institute, was among a group of academics joined by former Conservative cabinet ministers John Baird and Ted Menzies, former Canadian ambassador Rob Wright, former Liberal justice minister Allan Rock and former deputy foreign affairs minister Len Edwards.

They met, with the knowledge of the Trudeau government, over several days with current and former Chinese Communist Party officials in Chengdu, Sichuan province.

The unofficial delegation was not paid for by the Canadian government, although Canadian officials did provide a briefing to its members prior to their departure, said another source who spoke only on background.

The delegates later told Dominic Barton, Canada’s ambassador to China, that China would release the two men if Canada released Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive arrested in Canada following an extradition request from the United States. Kovrig and Spavor were arrested just days after Meng was detained in Vancouver in December 2018.

Houlden, a former Canadian foreign service officer, confirmed the details Thursday in an interview with the Star, just hours after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flatly rejected appeals by another group of prominent Canadians to drop the Meng extradition case to secure the men’s freedom.

“There aren’t a lot of options other than dialogue right now,” said Houlden. “I’d like to see a resumption of dialogue before we are hemmed in too much or the Chinese hem us in too much.”

Houlden said there were signals last fall that the Chinese were willing to compromise: the day his group left Chengdu for Beijing, China announced it would lift import restrictions it had slapped on Canadian pork and beef.

But Houlden said the tough talk by Chinese and Canadian officials in public statements in the past week could now make compromise difficult, even though dialogue “offers the best prospect for an exit.”

He also rejected calls by Conservatives for Trudeau to punish China. “It will be hard to out-sanction China,’ he said. “They’ve got a bigger stick and bigger levers.”

On Thursday, Trudeau said his government has “a range of options and measures” it is considering, but would not say what his next move might be.

The prime minister did not deny that the justice minister has a legal power to drop the case against Meng, but he said giving into China’s pressure tactics to get Kovrig and Spavor released would be “absolutely unacceptable.”

Trudeau said that would put Canadians abroad “in danger” by allowing China and other countries to think they could get away with “randomly arresting” Canadians whenever they want.

“We cannot allow political pressures or random arrests of Canadian citizens to influence the functioning of our justice system,” he said.

As for those advocating in favour of a deal, “I respect these individuals but they are wrong in their approach,” Trudeau told reporters.

That was in response to a letter from 19 prominent Canadians, who cited a May 22 legal opinion that said the government can and should release Meng now, and need not wait for years for the extradition case to wend through the courts.

The signatories included Allan Rock and Len Edwards, who went on the November trip to China. Rock declined to comment Thursday.

Another signatory, Yves Fortier, an international arbitrator and former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, said Trudeau’s statement closes an avenue.

“The decision rests with the PM. End of story, as far as we are concerned,” Fortier told the Star.

But in an interview with the CBC, However Kovrig’s wife said the letter was not a wasted effort because it has created a more “sophisticated” understanding about the Canadian legal environment, and Canadians now know that the minister has the lawful authority to withdraw the Meng extradition.

“The question then becomes should that authority be exercised,” Vina Nadjibulla said.

“We’re now having a real conversation about the complexities of this case,” she said. “The government has to exercise political judgment in finding a way forward and not just say the rule of law prohibits us from doing anything.”

Nadjibulla had released the legal opinion by lawyer Brian Greenspan, which was commissioned by Rock and former Supreme Court judge Louise Arbour, who is a past UN human rights commissioner and past head of the International Crisis Group, the research group for which Kovrig worked.

This week, after months of denying any connection, China’s Foreign Ministry publicly cited that same legal opinion and Kovrig’s wife’s statements, and linked the fates of the two men to Meng’s release.

“Such options are within the rule of law and could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Canadians,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.

When Greenspan learned in an interview with the Star that China had relied on his work to call Canada out, he said his legal advice was “never meant to weaponize anyone.

“It was meant to provide an accurate assessment of what options were available to Canada,” he said.

Trudeau’s refusal to negotiate with China for the detainees’ freedom is the same stance that he took in 2016 when he refused to pay a ransom for Canadians captured by a terrorist group in the Philippines. Two Canadian men were subsequently killed.

The latest group of prominent Canadians to call for Meng’s release included Liberals, Conservatives and New Democrats — former ministers, deputy ministers, ambassadors, foreign policy advisers and academics. All urged the Trudeau government to heed the advice to release Meng in exchange for the release of the two men.

Among the signatories was Robert Fowler, a former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations who was himself kidnapped in Niger in 2008.

The group’s letter, which was obtained by the Star, said the signatories acknowledge “it does not sit well with anyone to yield to bullying or blackmail.” But they said resisting doesn’t guarantee anyone’s future safety either.

“China might well decide that next time it will need to escalate by detaining more than two Canadians,” they wrote. More broadly, they say the Meng Wanzhou saga has undermined the Liberal government’s ability to vigorously criticize China for its actions in Hong Kong or for domestic human rights violations elsewhere in the country. “In short, Canada’s foreign policy is also being held hostage.”

But Trudeau was unmoved.

“It is not just the two Michaels who are at question here — it is every Canadian who travels in China or anywhere else overseas,” he said.

Trudeau said the government is aware of its discretion in law. “There is and has been from the very beginning an element of that that involves input from the justice minister at the appropriate time,” he said. However the prime minister repeatedly referred the need to respect the “independence” of Canada’s justice system, and Canada’s international treaty obligations with the U.S.

Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Trudeau should get tougher on China, but also said the prime minister should not intervene in the Meng extradition case.

“I don’t believe setting aside the rule of law is an appropriate response to two Canadians who are detained illegally,” he said. “I don’t believe it would leave Canadians who are around the world in a very secure position if hostile governments or hostile organizations around the world know that a government would entertain that type of policy.”

Correction - June 26, 2020: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly said Rob Wright, former Canadian ambassador to China, was among signatories on a letter saying that the Canadian government could free Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and end the extradition case against her. As well, former Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Robert Fowler was kidnapped in Niger in 2008.

Read', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Dirk Meissnerthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-21,"VICTORIA—In a building where face-to-face debates between political opponents are normal activities, the British Columbia legislature will be a much different place when it returns Monday for a summer sitting.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the required physical distancing to slow the spread of the virus will see the normally crowded 87-member chamber reduced to 24 politicians. Meetings and scrums will be held virtually through Zoom from locations around the building or across B.C.

It will be historic, unique and exciting, say members of the legislature, who agree democracy will prevail during the pandemic.

“There’s several books to be written about this,” said Adam Olsen, interim Green party leader.

“This parliament continues to amaze me in that just when you thought it wasn’t going to get any weirder, then a global pandemic happens. I am often finding myself marvelling at how unique a time it is to be elected to the legislature to this particular parliament.”

Since the 2017 election, he said, B.C. has been rolling through a historic political period with a minority NDP government relying on support from the Greens, and the COVID-19 pandemic adds one more chapter.

NDP house leader Mike Farnworth said discussions with the opposition parties, the Speaker and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry have resulted in a plan for the legislature that is safe and functional.

“People will be impressed by what’s in place,” he said. “It’s going to allow every member to participate either in the chamber or by Zoom, by virtual. There will be question period. There will be debates on legislation.”

The legislature is scheduled to sit until Aug. 12, said Farnworth.

Politicians who are not in the chamber will participate virtually in debates. Committee meetings and interviews will be done from their offices in the legislature or their ridings, he said.

Farnworth said the pandemic plan will serve as a model in case of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in the future.

The government plans to introduce legislation and pass the budget it tabled in February before the pandemic took hold.

Finance Minister Carole James recently said the B.C. economy has plunged into recession, with more than 300,000 people losing their jobs, hitting the province’s finances hard.

Opposition Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson said his party has supported Henry’s public health measures, but now the focus is on the economic recovery.

“We’ve been writing letters to the premier for the last month with dozens of suggestions about how we can get B.C. rolling again, including things like a three-month suspension of the provincial sales tax so that people can get the confidence to go out and involve themselves in the economy again,” he said.

Wilkinson said the NDP can expect vigorous debate during budget estimates because the government’s “assumptions have been shot to pieces by the pandemic.”

Andrew Weaver, the former Green party leader who now sits as an Independent, said the return to the legislature sets the stage for the pandemic recovery.

“If we go back in history, some of the greatest advances in human civilization occurred after some of the greatest tragedies,” he said. “Every challenge, I view and I think others should to, view through the lens of what opportunity does it create. That will be my focus going into this session.”

Weaver, who will continue to support the minority government, said he expects a quieter, more respectful tone in the legislature.

“If you are sitting at home, it’s kind of hard to get riled up, desk thumping, heckling,” he said. “I don’t see how people will do that from home.”

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-16,"VANCOUVER — The Canadian government and federal authorities are sending mixed signals in response to a complaint over forced confessions allegedly extracted by Chinese authorities that have been broadcast in Canada, a human rights group says.

But the lead complainant in the case says what is clear is that in the six months since the complaint was filed, Canadian officials have not reached out to him to ask about his experience and the confession he says was forcibly extracted, then used as propaganda on Canadian airways.

Simon Cheng is a Hong Kong citizen who was working for the United Kingdom’s consulate in Hong Kong when he was detained by authorities at a democracy protest last August.

Cheng was held for two weeks during which time, he says, he was tortured, interrogated and forced to make a recorded and false confession to soliciting prostitution.

The videos were not released until after Cheng spoke out about his detention to the BBC.

Cheng’s videos were among numerous confessions that were broadcast into Canada via the China Global Television Network (CGTN) and China Central Television 4 (CCTV-4), available on cable. Both are networks are owned by China’s government.

The human rights group Safeguard Defenders filed a complaint in December with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. The complaint details about 30 confessions involving about 60 people, including Cheng, whose confessions were broadcast into Canada.

Now Cheng is questioning why the CRTC hasn’t reached out to him.

“I think, if they haven’t contacted me, that means they didn’t take it seriously,” Cheng said.

“That is my concern.”

Cheng said he’s hoping the complaint can help prevent further instances of people being forced to confess in recordings he said are meant to become propaganda.

Last week, the CRTC told the Star in an email the commission did not license foreign channels nor did it have an application to remove either channel from digital services in Canada with no move to pull the channel from Canadian services expected. It also said the complaint was still “open.”

Peter Dahlin, director of Safeguard Defenders, said that as far as he’s concerned the response meant the CRTC was not moving on the complaint.

“It’s not really a complete denial,” he said of the CRTC statement. “But the way it’s formulated makes it sounds very much like they are not intending to move on this.”

Safeguard Defenders says no witnesses in its complaint to the CRTC have been contacted by the regulator.

On Monday, Canadian Heritage denied a request from the Star to speak to Minister Steven Guilbeault about the issue, calling the response from the CRTC “appropriate.”

In a followup email, the department said it was allowing the CRTC to go through its process.

“There is an open complaint on this matter with the CRTC, (which) is following its complaint process,” wrote spokesperson Martine Courage in an email.

In its statement, Canadian Heritage also said it expects the CRTC to regulate in manner consistent with the Broadcasting Act and Canadian values.

Dahlin said Canadian Heritage’s assertion the complaint process is being followed seems to run counter to the CRTC’s statement it doesn’t license foreign channels and referring to the complaint simply as “open.”

“It’s very interesting to hear Heritage Canada would have such a different interpretation,” Dahlin said.

Dahlin said it was encouraging to see the statement include some pressure for the CRTC to act on the complaint.

He pointed to a 2006 approval for CCTV-4 to be carried on Canadian cable services, specifically warning it could be removed from cable service if it aired “abusive” material.

He said similar complaints filed in the U.K. are going more quickly. There, broadcast regulator Ofcom has already moved on complaints filed against CGTN last year, including one in which the network was found to have broadcast biased reporting about the Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations.

The CRTC on Tuesday told the Star complaints are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and time frames may vary.

Read', 'Nick Wellsthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Nick Wellsthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"VANCOUVER—Shayla Raine ended her kick-boxing class on January 20 to a flood of text messages asking what was going on in her apartment.

The University of British Columbia Okanagan student rushed home to find a trail of blood leading to the suite she shared with Mona Wang and another student.

“That was one of the scariest moments of my life,” said Raine at a Saturday rally held in support of Wang. “When I opened the suite, it looked like a crime scene. Furniture was shuffled, there was pills ... it was not a good scene.”

In a statement of claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court, Wang alleges she was injured during a January wellness check by Cpl. Lacey Browning, who took Wang into custody under the Mental Health Act.

The incident spurred a number of protests in support of Wang — and against the use of force by police — in British Columbia on Saturday.

Raine was one of dozens who gathered in the rain outside of the Vancouver Art Gallery to make their voices heard. Some carried signs calling for an end to police violence and reform of the wellness check system.

Similar protests were held in Surrey, Richmond and Kelowna.

“I think it’s honestly amazing to have received so much support for everything that has happened. It’s making this a lot easier to speak out,” Wang told reporters before the event.

Wang says it’s disheartening to hear from other people of similar interactions with police.

“It’s kind of lit this fire under me knowing how often this happens. I just want more to be done,” she said.

Wang’s statement of claim alleges Browning’s conduct was “abusive and repetitive in the extreme” after the officer found her lying in a state of semi-consciousness on the floor of her apartment.

None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court and statements of defence filed by Browning, the Attorney General of Canada, and British Columbia’s minister of public safety and solicitor general deny any wrongdoing. All three are named as defendants in the case.

Surveillance video from Wang’s apartment building appears to show a female officer dragging the student face first down a carpeted hallway and into an elevator. The officer then appears to briefly step on Wang’s head while waiting for additional first responders in the lobby.

Wang’s mother Lin Yan also spoke at rally, sharing her shock over what her daughter experienced.

“The violence done to her, bruises all over (her) body, bleeding eyes...she had to stay in hospital for three days,” she told the crowd. “I felt deeply saddened, shocked and outraged. Isn’t the police supposed to protect us, not to turn around and assault us?”

Destiny Baker, one of the demonstrators at the rally, said she wants people to understand many people still face oppression and that people are angry.

“We’re coming here today, we’re risking our lives to get a sickness because we care that much. We care about her and we care about every single other person who has gone through such injustice,” she said.

The incident led a B.C. RCMP commander to push for the expansion of teams that pair an officer and a nurse during mental health checks.

Chief Supt. Brad Haugli of the southeast district said in June that the police and crisis program has been effective in de-escalating situations involving people in crisis and helped ease the referral process when treatment is necessary.

Read', 'Brenna Owenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Brenna Owenthe Canadian Presssun.']",2020-06-28,"SURREY, B.C.—Deaths and injuries involving police during so-called wellness checks coupled with recent protests against police brutality are generating scrutiny over how officers respond to people struggling with mental health challenges.

Police departments in Halifax, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Kelowna are among those that have partnered with local health-care providers to create mobile response units that pair officers with mental health professionals.

They tout these specially trained units as a more effective way of handling calls related to mental health, while advocates say chronic underfunding of mental health services has thrust police into a role for which they’re ill-equipped.

“There aren’t good supports for mental health to begin with, so people end up in distress and their only resort is to call the police it seems, or to call 911,” said Margaret Eaton, CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association.

Officers have a high degree of discretion when it comes to using force and their presence during wellness checks is rooted in stigma and fear that people with mental illnesses are dangerous, Eaton said in an interview on Thursday.

Meenakshi Mannoe, a campaigner with Pivot Legal Society, said police intervention in mental health crises too often leads to people being funnelled into the criminal justice system.

The Vancouver-based organization works with communities affected by poverty and social exclusion, with a focus on police accountability, drug policy, homelessness and sex workers’ rights.

“We see it in the statistics of who’s incarcerated, whether it is Indigenous people who have survived intergenerational trauma, or people with mental health issues who were acting in ways that were criminalized,” said Mannoe, who is also a registered social worker.

“Yet we continue to invest in the most crisis-oriented, escalating approach, which is law enforcement, when we could be investing in foundational institutions that actually prevent crisis.”

In Surrey, B.C., RCMP officers say they’re doing things differently. The detachment has been working with nurses specializing in mental health for 20 years through its Car 67 program, born from a partnership with the Fraser Health Authority.

The car operates from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m., when police say the volume of calls related to mental health tends to be higher.

Surrey RCMP officers attended more than 7,600 calls related to the Mental Health Act last year, and Car 67 handled just under 900 of them.

Car 67 may be dispatched directly or called in by other front-line officers, explained Tina Baker, a nurse who’s worked with the mobile unit for the last decade.

Either way, police assess the situation first to make sure it’s safe for Baker or another nurse to attend.

When she is called, Baker checks the person’s health records, which police cannot do. That provides a baseline understanding of what the person may be grappling with and what treatment they’ve already had, she said.

Whether a person is getting help can influence if they are taken into custody under the Mental Health Act, said Baker.

If they have support in the community, “we can liaise with them as opposed to going to the hospital,” she added.

Apprehending under the act can be traumatizing and confusing, said Baker, especially since it involves handcuffs. When she’s on duty with Car 67, Baker said she works with the officer she’s paired with to de-escalate the situation.

“A lot of people can be quite calm and then the minute you change their environment, whether it be into the police car or into the hospital setting, then they can become agitated. So, we have a role to keep everybody safe until we know that client is going to be OK.”

Cpl. Scotty Schumann, who leads the Surrey detachment’s mental health outreach team, said police are probably taking people to the hospital more often than necessary when a nurse isn’t present.

The outreach team receives specialized training from the Fraser Health Authority, which team member Const. Maciej Roszkowski said builds compassion and offers insight into the root causes of people’s behaviour.

“I always picture what if this was my family member in distress,” he added.

Roszkowski is among a group of officers specially selected based on their interest in working with vulnerable people, said Insp. Wendy Mehat, who oversees the outreach team.

“Our policing strategy is not based on arresting and handcuffing our way out of situations. It’s developing bonds, negotiating with our clients and getting them the support and referrals and help that they need,” she said.

At Pivot Legal Society, Mannoe said specialized police training is not a substitute for preventative measures and crisis services that are led by people who have experienced mental health challenges, or in other cases homelessness or substance use.

People and communities who tend to be criminalized don’t associate the police with safety, she noted, and external accountability can be limited when it comes to police officers’ own conduct while responding to mental health crises.

“The police attendance at these wellness checks can, in fact, escalate situations and put people at real risk. For people who are using substances or experiencing homelessness or who are racialized, that risk is compounded by systemic racism and bias.”

Mannoe points to a program in Oregon called Cahoots, which stands for crisis assistance helping out on the streets, as a good example of a community-based program that works. It’s dispatched through the local emergency communications centre but doesn’t necessarily involve police.

Wellness stems from dignified access to health care and basic needs, “not a uniformed officer banging on your door,” she said.

Read', 'Amy Smartthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Amy Smartthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-06-17,"METCHOSIN, B.C.—The mayor of a Vancouver Island community where two inmates are accused of murdering a man after they escaped from a minimum-security prison says they never should have been there in the first place.

John Ranns says he’s warning people in Metchosin to stay vigilant as long as there’s a loophole allowing inmates to be transferred to low-security facilities through an override of their security classification when they still pose a risk.

“The wrong people got sent,” Ranns said in an interview.

The RCMP said on Friday that James Busch and Zachary Armitage have been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Martin Payne, whose body was found in his home on July 12 last year.

Police were alerted on July 8, 2019, that the two men had escaped from the minimum-security William Head Institution outside Victoria. An off-duty officer spotted the men while walking his dog almost two days later, leading to their arrest.

It was only when Payne, who was 60, failed to show up for work that officers found his body days later.

Busch, 42, was serving an indeterminate sentence for second-degree murder and assault. Armitage, 30, was convicted of offences including a violent aggravated assault and violent robbery.

In a sentencing decision following the escape, provincial court Judge Roger Cutler says Armitage had served eight years of a 14-year sentence when he fled the prison.

On July 7, during a walk by the water, the two prisoners decided to escape by walking along the shoreline of the ocean-front facility during low tide, the decision says.

“Given the offender’s prior violent record and his history of escaping lawful custody, including four prior convictions, I was perplexed as to why at the time of his escape the offender was serving his sentence at a minimum-security institution,” Cutler writes in the decision.

“This situation was particularly troubling as the information provided to the court indicated that the offender had recently escaped in 2016 and less than two years later, in February 2018, he had been assessed as a medium security or moderate risk to escape on the security reclassification scale.”

However, a week after the assessment, it was overridden to minimum security, the decision says. Two months after that, Armitage was transferred to William Head.

Cutler says he reviewed an internal Correctional Service Canada report provided by the Crown recommending the override because Armitage had made positive efforts and progress to rehabilitate himself. His case management team did not believe he posed a risk of escape, Cutler says.

The escape is understandably disconcerting to the public, the judge adds.

“The public is entitled to expect that those incarcerated for violent criminal conduct and who have an extensive and recent escape history are rarely, and only with solid reasoning, placed in a position where escaping incarceration may be achieved by merely walking along the shoreline at low tide,” he says.

“And, when such an escape occurs, the public ought to be provided a full explanation of the process leading to the decisions made by those responsible.”

Cutler added one year to Armitage’s sentence for the escape, but at the time of sentencing the Crown had not alleged he committed any offences while at large.

On Saturday, commissioner Anne Kelly of the Correctional Service of Canada said an investigation was started on how to prevent and respond to escapes, and measures have been taken to enhance security.

A written statement said escapes from federal prisons are uncommon, with nine across Canada in 2019-20. The last one at William Head was in 2014 and before that in 2004.

The Correctional Service said in a statement Tuesday the investigation is in its final stages and all minimum-security inmates have had their security levels reviewed.

Policy changes include mandatory psychological risk assessments for specific inmates before they’re assigned to a minimum-security prison and higher decision-making authority for their reclassification.

The assistant deputy commissioner is now the final decision maker for the reclassification of any inmate convicted of a sex-related offence, or who was initially rated maximum security and who committed an offence causing death or serious harm and has three or more years before they are eligible to apply for day parole.

The assistant commissioner of correctional operations and programs, and the deputy commissioner for women remain the final decision makers for the reclassification of a dangerous offender to minimum security.

Ranns said when Armitage was transferred, the minimum security warden had no say and that under the changes, that remains the same.

The Correctional Service did not immediately respond when asked for confirmation of Ranns’ understanding of the transfer, and the William Head warden could not be reached for comment.

“It just makes sense to me that the warden who understands that program the best and understands the community the best doesn’t get a chance to refuse an inmate,” Ranns said.

“While a lot of positive changes were made, the major factor hasn’t been addressed and that is: Those guys should not have been there in the first place.”

Ranns said William Head has been a “very good corporate citizen” and communicates well with the community.

The prison has a strong program for preparing inmates to reintegrate into society in the final months before their release, Ranns said. They live in housing units together, cook for themselves, do their own laundry and participate in work programs in the community.

Sooner or later, almost every inmate is released from prison and they need to have the life skills to contribute to society, Ranns said.

“It’s a very good program with very good results. The problem is, how did (Armitage and Busch) get there,” he said.

Read', 'Natalie Obiko Pearsonbloomberg']",2020-03-19,"A week into a pandemic that has forced a swath of Canada’s economy to shut down and wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the nation’s stock market, a Vancouver mansion sold for $150,000 over the asking price.

As the coronavirus upends the real estate business, along with everything else, the country’s indefatigable buyers are taking some pause — but, so far, not much.

John Pasalis’ firm was getting ready to list a $1.1 million home in Toronto’s trendy Leslieville district next week but was pre-empted by two “bully” offers — those made ahead of the official selling date. A deal was struck before the property ever hit the market.

“Some of those buyers are seeing the slowdown as a way to compete without too many people,” said Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty.

Before the virus landed in Canada, its three biggest markets — Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver — were gearing up for a sizzling house-hunting season this spring. That outlook has now dimmed.

Home resales are expected to fall in the coming weeks as the economy contracts. Agencies are cancelling open houses, and a traditionally face-to-face industry is using virtual tours to get some deals done.

In addition, new home construction and renovations will take a hit. Toronto said Wednesday it was suspending all but emergency issues of building permits as city facilities are closed.

An extended drop in Canada’s housing market would be a major blow to an economy already reeling from the meltdown in oil prices. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Bank of Canada and the country’s biggest commercial banks are pulling out all the stops to try and head off a serious recession.

The central bank has now cut interest rates a full percentage point to 0.75 per cent in the past two weeks, spurring mortgage rates lower, and it may cut again. The banking regulator is loosening bank capital requirements to free up $300 billion of lending capacity.

Meanwhile, Canada’s six biggest lenders, including Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank, said they would consider six-month mortgage-payment deferrals for small businesses and individual borrowers impacted by the pandemic.

In the longer run, relentless demand means any pullback will likely be short-lived and prices should hold up, said Robert Hogue, senior economist at RBC.

“In all likelihood, this will be a temporary hit with a rebound taking place later this year once the COVID-19 situation settles down — though the timing and magnitude of the rebound are highly uncertain at this point,” Hogue said in a research note this week.

Immigration bump

Re/Max, one of the nation’s biggest brokerages, on Tuesday urged its 18,000 brokers across the country to cancel all open houses. In Vancouver, developers are closing sales centres and construction sites will be impacted as building activity is interrupted, according to Anne McMullin, president of the Urban Development Institute, an industry group.

But underpinning the market is the fastest pace population growth in 30 years, driven in large part by immigration, and the appeal of Canadian real estate to those with cash to deploy at uncertain times, including foreign buyers.

In Montreal, a New-York based buyer just made an offer on a property listed at more than two million after a virtual visit, said Debby Doktorczyk, owner of Engel & Volkers Montreal, which counts 175 brokers.

Momentum helps. The housing market entered the spring selling season on a high, with sales across the country up 25 per cent from February 2019. Toronto and Vancouver home resales surged about 44 per cent from the same month a year ago, while Montreal’s were up about 23 per cent.

The market was extremely strong — if not a bit “crazy” — before the pandemic, says Doktorczyck. Now, “instead of getting 15 offers for a property, we’re getting five,” she said, adding virtual visits are likely to become more common.

Market oxygen

Even in Vancouver, which was only just emerging from its worst year in decades before the coronavirus, Royal LePage broker Adil Dinani says his shop is still doing 90 per cent of the deals expected.

Dinani was up past midnight negotiating the sale of a $2.3 million, six-bedroom home in an affluent suburb just outside Vancouver. The open house on Sunday had drawn 40 groups — some 85 eager buyers undeterred by the virus — who waited to enter one group at a time. The property drew seven offers, including the winner — an all-cash bid, almost $150,000 above asking.

While open houses may be suspended, home buyers can still see homes by appointment, say agents. Meanwhile falling mortgage rates will act as a spur. Borrowers can now get a five-year variable mortgage at 2.1 per cent and a three-year fixed at 1.99 per cent, according to RateSpy.com.

“You know the saying — oxygen for any real estate market is low interest rates,” said Dinani at Royal LePage in Vancouver. “Well interest rates just got lower. There’s a lot more room to move in Canada. That prime rate can come down more, unlike the U.S. and other nations that are pretty much operating near zero.”",[]

Where would a wealthy young millennial couple with a young child want to live in Canada? The Star asked a few luxury realtors for suggestions.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have plenty of choices if they decide to live part-time in British Columbia, said Andrea Jauck, a luxury realtor with Vancouver-based Pinnacle Group Real Estate Marketing. She noted that the province offers private locations with spectacular views that are still relatively close to Vancouver.

The couple reportedly spent the holidays at a secluded beachfront villa in North Saanich, a community located about a half-hour drive north of Victoria on Vancouver Island.

“They could have gone anywhere ... but they chose B.C.,” said Kris Cyganiak, co-founder of the Pinnacle List, a website that curates luxury property listings from around the world. According to Cyganiak, there’s a good chance the couple will choose B.C. again.

Have your say:

But Barry Cohen, a luxury realtor in Toronto, says the couple is more likely to move to Canada’s largest city.

Meghan lived in Toronto for at least seven years while filming her TV show “Suits,” and the city is also much closer to the United Kingdom than Vancouver. Harry and Meghan reportedly plan to spend their time in the U.K. at Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor.

Listing price: $6.5 million

Sometimes, you want something a little outside the city, new with a contemporary feel to it. This newly constructed 8,277 sq. ft. lot is only a one-hour drive from downtown Vancouver — so the duchess can commute to any potential acting jobs in Hollywood North — and is located in Anmore, a quiet community of 2,200 people.

The home features built-in Tesla charging stations, 46 solar panels and a view of the North Shore mountains. It has a “chateau” and “Whistler-inspired” look, that could give the royal couple the West-coast feel they seem to enjoy.

This listing also features a lower price point, thanks to its location outside of Vancouver’s city centre, something Harry and Meghan may consider if they are striving for “financial independence,” as they suggested in their public statement announcing they planned to step back from their royal duties.

The duke and duchess appear to enjoy waterfront properties — they reportedly stayed at a beachfront villa on Vancouver Island over the holidays — so they may enjoy a home with a private dock, like this North Vancouver property, which also features panoramic ocean views and a private elevator.

North Vancouver is a short 15-minutue Seabus trip to downtown Vancouver. Prince Harry and Meghan, along with their young son Archie, may appreciate the municipality known for its family-friendly neighbourhoods and proximity to hiking trails, said Jauck.

The couple was spotted hiking on Vancouver Island on New Year’s Day, and even stopped to help fellow hikers take a photo.

Listing price: $16 million

“Being that they are a young couple, and with a growing family, they are looking for community, and given their wealth and potential need for privacy, they would consider Forest Hill,” said Cohen, of the north Toronto neighbourhood.

“They are familiar with Forest Hill, they have friends that live at Forest Hill,” he said, adding there are excellent private-school options in the area. Plus, Meghan’s close friend, Jessica Mulroney, lives in a nearby neighbourhood.

This particular home features an indoor tennis court, an indoor saltwater pool and a marble staircase. Not to mention an underground eight-car garage.

61 The Bridle Path, Toronto, Ontario

Listing price: $16.9 million

This gated community is known for its expansive two-acre lots and is home to some of Canada’s most famous residents, including rapper Drake.

The Bridle Path neighbourhood would offer the royal couple the “utmost of privacy,” said Cohen. “That community could service them well.”

And this particular 14,280 sq. ft., 11-bedroom property is no stranger to royalty.

“The sprawling bungalow used to be owned by Prince,” said Cohen.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-12-11,"VANCOUVER—A new report from the Real Estate Investment Network released Wednesday warns investors to look out for what it calls “likely policies,” such as a foreign buyer tax from the new minority Liberal government that could dampen returns in the short run.

Yet, owners of rental properties may be in for a boost as immigration levels are expected to continue rising, pushing rental demand and rental property values up, according to the network.

The report collects policy proposals from Canada’s major political parties and lays out which are likely to become reality, given that the Liberal party is governing from a minority position.

“Seeing what is most likely, it really allows people to (say), I need to focus on this if I’m a real estate investor,” said Jennifer Hunt, vice-president of research with the network.

The Real Estate Investment Network offers analysis on the Canadian housing market to help investors make decisions on which properties to purchase.

There are lessons to learn from Vancouver, Hunt said.

B.C. introduced a 15 per cent tax on properties bought by non-Canadian citizens in 2016. That was increased to 20 per cent in 2018. Homeowners in B.C. are also subject to a speculation tax which can range from 0.5 to two per cent. And the City of Vancouver implemented a one per cent tax on empty homes in 2017.

These measures resulted in a slump in the local housing market, and it could happen at a federal scale, too. Ottawa is likely to increase taxes for “foreigners and non-Canadian residents,” according to the real estate investment report.

On the other hand, the rental housing market seems poised for a boost, Hunt said.

The report identifies immigration as a key factor in the rental housing market. This will likely increase the demand for rental housing, since immigrants are likely to rent when they first arrive in Canada, said Hunt.

“For a rental housing provider, if you’re already providing housing for individuals, there’s going to be a larger demand.”

And that pressure on rental markets is good news for investors.

When the vacancy rate is low, owners of rental properties are able to increase rents, Hunt said. That in turn can increase the value of rental properties, boosting potential profits for investors, she said.

But that’s why the federal government should build more rental housing as quickly as possible, according to policy analysts.

“Personally, I think we should be thinking about housing for people who live and work in the city,” said Marc Lee with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. “Too much of the new build or mentality on housing has shifted to housing as an investment property.”

He added that government-subsidized rental is especially important because low-income rentals are not profitable for developers to invest in, so it’s up to governments to ensure they get built.

Urban planner Andy Yan added that investment properties such as short-term rentals like Airbnb also affect the vacancy rate.

“They’re having a negative effect, particularly on the rental housing market,” said Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s city program.

“It’s a new form of demand on the rental housing market that has actually reduced the supply of rental housing for people who live in cities.”

Regulating short term rentals, which could be bad news for investors, would benefit renters, he said.

But Hunt said there’s more to housing affordability than just supply and demand. Wages play a big role, too, she argued. If people made more money, they would be able to afford higher housing costs.

“Something that is not often talked about is the fact that there is not much wage growth.”

When asked whether investment success and housing affordability could exist at the same time, Hunt said, “I believe that they can. I just believe that there is a lot of market influences that come into play.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-11,"FORT MCKAY, ALTA.—The chief of a northern Alberta First Nation says masks are now mandatory after the community learned of its first COVID-19 case.

Fort McKay First Nation Chief Mel Grandjamb announced the positive test in a video message posted to Facebook on Friday, and he says that protective masks will now be necessary for everyone outside of their homes and yards in the community.

Trips into and out of the First Nation will be limited to one per day, and travel within the community is strongly discouraged.

Grandjamb asked members to make sure youth stay at home, too.

He also asked people not to blame the person who tested positive, and encouraged the community to stick together.

He says contact tracing is being done, and that anyone who gets a call from health authorities should co-operate with them.

“The minute you’re out in the community, any public buildings, masks are mandatory. We will be monitoring the compliance and we will be talking to the individuals in the event of non-compliance,” Grandjamb said in the announcement.

“It’s proven from a number of studies and things that we read that masks will prevent the spread.”

Grandjamb said the community has had a plan since March 9 for what to do in the event of a positive test, and is following it.

He noted the announcement was not about instilling fear, and said essential service personnel will be required to undergo advanced screening.

Commercial drivers entering the community will also be screened.

“We have seen from observations in other communities that as the names of affected individuals are revealed that they can face negativity towards them,” he said.

“Let’s remember we are all family in this community.”

Read', 'Kevin Mcgranstaff Reporter', 'Staff Reporter', 'Kevin Mcgran Is A Star Sports Reporter Based In Toronto. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"Integrity. It’s the word that came up over and over on Saturday as NHL commissioner Gary Bettman touted the league’s return to play, the completion of the 2019-20 season and the idea of crowning a Stanley Cup champion in the oddest of ways, in the weirdest of circumstances.

“The integrity of the return-to-play system was paramount in everybody’s mind,” Bettman said on a conference call.

The league, of course, paused operations on March 12, when it felt like the entire world was coming to a standstill with the coronavirus seemingly out of control in Italy and Spain and ramping up in North America.

That’s when Bettman, deputy commissioner Bill Daly, players’ association boss Donald Fehr and his special assistant, Mathieu Schneider, went to work on a return protocol twinned with an extension to the collective agreement.

“It was a recognition by both sides that we were being confronted with an incredibly difficult and unprecedented situation,” said Bettman. “We needed to work together to solve the myriad problems that would be in front of us, that required us to focus on return to play, to focus on transitional rules, to focus on protocols, and to focus on an extension of the collective bargaining agreement that would give us labour peace for an extended period, which turns out to be the next six years.”

The extension keeps a salary cap in place (important to Bettman and the owners) while allowing teams to retain their core rosters (important to fans) and guaranteeing players will get paid through the pandemic (important to players). It was no small achievement, especially considering the public battle that Major League Baseball went through before finally opening training camps in home cities.

The NHL ultimately ended the regular season and devised a way to return with expanded playoffs:

Put 12 teams in Toronto, starting July 26, and 12 more in Edmonton — cities where the rate of infection is now low.

Strictly limit what they can and can’t do, and test them daily.

Hope COVID-19 doesn’t get in the way before a champion is determined in early October.

So, now fans have more than the virus to consider. For one, should this season come with an asterisk?

Maybe, given the circumstances that have led to summertime hockey, but the argument against is stronger.

For one thing, there are now officially five rounds to the playoffs instead of four. The champion might have to win 19 games, not the usual 16. First, there’s the best-of-five qualifying round for teams seeded fifth through 12th in each conference, while the top four play a three-game round robin for seeding. Then the usual four rounds of best-of-seven.

The league offered to make the first two rounds best-of-five, to shorten the time required in the restrictive bubbles. The players pushed back. Why? Integrity.

“It was the players who said, ‘No, we want best-of-seven because when the Stanley Cup champion is ultimately crowned, we want it to be on the same basis as the other (modern-era) Stanley Cups,” said Bettman.

Added Schneider: “Players were against it for the very reason of keeping the integrity, and not wanting an asterisk in any shape or form by the Stanley Cup winner in this year.”

That said, it’s not like other years in many other ways:

COVID testing, daily for players, and the wait for results will hang over every game, every practice.

Not everyone had equal access to ice time with players scattered around the world.

Teams that might have gone into the playoffs hamstrung by injuries will see players return healthy, the Leafs (Jake Muzzin, Ilya Mikheyev) among them.

Players can opt out with no penalty or discipline. Calgary’s Travis Hamonic already has, citing family health reasons.

And after a long layoff, games that matter will start in a hurry.

“The only thing we have to compare it to — the intensity coming out of the gate — would be a World Cup, where we start right at the beginning of the season with extremely intense games,” said Schneider. “It’s maybe that kind of atmosphere for the guys, and we’re trying to take all necessary steps to make sure guys have everything they need to prepare for the games and stay healthy.”

If all goes according to plan, the Stanley Cup champion will be decided no later than Oct. 2, with free agency kicking off exactly seven days after. But can the league pull it off without a hitch?

In Europe, professional soccer in England and Germany seems to be doing OK. But in North America, Major League Soccer has already seen two teams withdraw from its Floria tournament because of positive tests.

Bettman was asked what the NHL would do if a team or two had to withdraw. He didn’t have a direct answer.

“The fact is, we’re going to be taking advice from the experts, the medical people in terms of what is and isn’t appropriate, as we move forward on understanding that COVID-19 is out there and what the risks are,” said Bettman.

“One positive test shouldn’t shut down the tournament, but obviously we have to be very cognizant of player health and safety and if we have an outbreak situation,” added Daly. “There’s no hard and fast number. We’ll take our lead from the medical professionals.”

The league acknowledged it settled on Toronto and Edmonton, abandoning Las Vegas, because of the number of COVID-19 cases. And with thorough protocols in place, including testing and limiting player movement from training camps to the completion of the Cup final, the league believes it has a recipe for success that others can copy.

“What we’re about to do is what every business and public institution is going to have to do over the next weeks and months as they reopen,” said Fehr. “This is not going to be: We’re going to do this in hockey, or we’re going to do this in sports, and everybody else is either going to stay closed forever or have some other magical procedure to follow.

“To the extent that we can help develop things that could be helpful elsewhere, that’s great.”

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-11,"KANESATAKE, QUE.—Rolling convoys are marking the 30th anniversary of the Oka crisis in Mohawk communities near Montreal.

Thirty years ago today, on July 11, 1990, Quebec provincial police moved in on a barricade erected by Mohawks in the spring to protest the planned expansion of a golf course on what is ancestral land in Oka, about 50 kilometres northwest of Montreal.

A provincial police officer was killed and a 78-day standoff between Mohawks and Canadian soldiers followed.

In Kanesatake, northwest of Montreal, locals loaded into their vehicles and came down the main road, honking horns and waving Mohawk flags to mark the day.

A similar event took place earlier today in Kahnawake, southwest of Montreal, where a rolling convoy of vehicles from that community stopped on the Mercier Bridge, which was barricaded in a solidarity for those manning posts in Oka.

The 1990 siege ended when the expansion was cancelled and the barricades came down.

Three decades later, however, the underlying land claims dispute remains unresolved.

Sacha Bhatia Is Chief Medical Innovation Officer', 'The Division Head Of Cardiology At Women S College Hospital.']",2020-07-10,"As we awaken from COVID-19 lockdown, it is clear that Ontarians’ experience of the pandemic has not been equal. Although the virus itself may not know race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, these factors have played a clear role in who is being disproportionately affected.

A recent CBC report found neighbourhoods with high COVID-19 rates were more likely to have a high proportion of racialized people, immigrants and low-income residents. Rates of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 were dramatically higher in these neighbourhoods compared to the average.

Bruce Arthur recently wrote a recent column in the Toronto Star asking who was providing advice for the government during this pandemic. While the government has consulted widely, the usual cadre of hospital CEOs, leaders of academic institutions, civil servants and public health officials are likely to top that list.

And as has been the case since Jacques Cartier first sailed up the St. Lawrence, that group is mostly white, and male from a privileged background. To be blunt, the medical leadership in Ontario does not look like the people who ride the TTC every morning and use their medical services.

This phenomenon is well documented. A 2016 study by the Academic Women’s Association at the University of Alberta found that 96 per cent of the leadership positions at Canada’s 15 research intensive universities were held by white men and women, and very few of the key decision makers within our health care system are racialized.

This is by no means a criticism of the dedicated public servants, medical and academic leaders who are working tirelessly to guide us through the pandemic. All are top of their field. Nor do we view this homogeneity of voices as a political decision, as the same experts would likely be around the table whether the government was blue, red, green or orange.

However, the leaders at these tables are in a position of power. They have the ability to direct how resources are distributed, or how policies are made for all of us. Increasing the diversity of voices advising the government during this critical time is neither “tokenism” or “affirmative action” but is a critical step to ensure that those in power make good policy choices that meet the needs of all Ontarians.

Policy-makers have had to make judgment calls throughout this pandemic informed by the best medical evidence, however in the case of COVID-19 there hasn’t been much evidence to rely on. Many of these judgment calls are social policy decisions, such as closing schools, or allowing outdoor gatherings.

These judgment calls have trade-offs, advantaging one group over another. Having voices at the table that can speak from different experiences can bring those trade-offs sharply into view. Decision makers that bring different perspectives can help us avoid blind spots in our policy-making that may be fatal for people in our society who all too often end up marginalized.

Would we have been so slow to test in congregate living settings if some of the key medical experts or leaders knew those settings well or grew up in them? Would we make the same decisions about the inhumane way people are being treated in federal prisons, often locked in their cells for 23 hours a day, if some of the experts at the table knew community members who had been in jail? How differently would we treat personal support workers, the majority of whom are women of colour, if one of our hospital CEOs was raised by one?

One of the key themes during the Black Lives Matter protests has been critically examining who are the voices being heard when it comes to key matters of policy, like policing. The differential impacts that COVID has on visible minorities and marginalized communities, and our policies to protect these communities will, and should, come under scrutiny. Having policy decisions informed by medical leaders and experts who are from these communities is not about tokenism. It could save lives.

Reach Him Via Email', 'Walkomtom Gmail.Com']",2020-07-10,"Finance Minister Bill Morneau made one thing patently clear this week: As far as the federal Liberal government is concerned, deficits don’t matter.

They really don’t.

Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have long been cavalier about deficits. In the 2015 election campaign, they promised to spend in order to get the economy moving even if that meant briefly running a deficit.

In the 2019 campaign, they dropped the word briefly, arguing that they could run deficits indefinitely — as long as the federal government’s debt as a percentage of the national economy was falling.

This week, they effectively abandoned even that target. Thanks to the pandemic, the debt-to- gross-domestic-product ratio has risen sharply. But that, said Morneau in his fiscal snapshot Wednesday, isn’t reason to cut back spending or raise taxes.

In fact, he said, the government will spend $50 billion more. In the current fiscal year, the deficit is expected to balloon more than tenfold to $343 billion.

Don’t get me wrong. I think the Liberals are right to abandon what had been, in the days of Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, their fixation on deficits.

Since then, federal and provincial governments of all political stripes have used the deficit bogeyman as an excuse to slash social programs ranging from medicare to employment insurance.

Whenever a new social program, like pharmacare, is proposed, naysayers needed only raise the word deficit to scupper it.

So kudos to Morneau and Trudeau for acknowledging what many economists have long pointed out: countries like Canada can survive deficits quite handily. Government borrowing is not necessarily a recipe for disaster. In most cases, it involves Canadians borrowing from themselves.

Since April, for instance, the government has been borrowing at least $5 billion a week from the Bank of Canada. In effect, and properly so, the central bank is printing money to help fund the deficit.

Today’s monster deficit stems from COVID-19. Shutting down the entire economy in order to preserve public health carries a cost. Morneau’s fiscal snapshot predicts that Canada’s gross domestic product will shrink by a stunning 6.8 per cent this year.

The government’s response has been to devise a bevy of emergency programs designed to patch things up. Employers have been offered wage subsidies if they agree to keep workers on the job. Workers sideswiped by the virus have been offered benefits to tide them through temporarily.

Small businesses have been offered low-interest bank loans to stay afloat. Young people have been offered money for volunteering.

All of this is aimed at keeping the economy afloat until the pandemic has run its course. All of this assumes that the pandemic will run its course.

But what if it doesn’t? What happens if the world doesn’t return to a pre-pandemic normal?

Will people eat out as much? Or will they fear catching the virus? Will holidayers and business people be willing to travel as much as they did? Or will they try to avoid crowded planes and heavily frequented hotels?

Will we get through this first wave of the pandemic only to be sandbagged by a second? If so, do we just shut down again?

Most Canadians labour in the service industry. But it is workers in this industry, ranging from store clerks to nursing home workers to baristas, who have been hit hardest.

The service industry was whacked by the first wave. Will it survive a second?

All of these questions were neither asked nor answered in Morneau’s snapshot. They will have to be faced eventually.

But at least the finance minister made it crystal clear that he’s not bothered by deficits. That’s not much. But it’s something.",[]

Reach Her Via Email', 'Sdelacourt Thestar.Ca Or Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"Sometime in the next few days, Justin Trudeau will promise to consult the ethics commissioner about any future plans to let charities hand out government money.

This is not a leak of the prime minister’s intentions; it is a prediction, based on how he has handled ethics transgressions of the past.

The newest one is Trudeau’s connection to the WE charity, hand-picked by his own government to dole out nearly $1 billion in pandemic-relief efforts for students: a choice that has since gone from reversal to regrets to really big trouble.

It’s not the first time things have gone so badly this way for Trudeau and that’s the baffling thing.

If this was a binge-watching series, viewers would have seen the hints in previous seasons.

First there is the denial and doubling-down.

Then there is the retraction, accompanied by revelations that things are worse than originally reported.

Then comes the prime minister’s promise to do better.

After more than four years in power, this shouldn’t have become a habit.

Trudeau’s ethical problems with the WE charity were magnified exponentially on Thursday when it was revealed that his mother and brother had enjoyed financial benefits from their association with WE.

Thanks to revelations by CBC and Canadaland, we now know that Margaret Trudeau received $250,000 in honorariums for speaking at 28 WE events between 2016 and 2020.

Alexandre Trudeau, or Sacha, as he’s known, was paid $32,000 in speaking fees between 2017 and 2018.

The fact that this is news to Canadians is one thing.

The fact that it is news to the Trudeau government — or seems to be — is a clear sign that little has been learned from previous ethical lapses.

While the payouts to Trudeau’s family date back to his time as prime minister, this particular controversy has echoes of his past, even before he gained power.

Trudeau, many will remember, came under significant political heat for his own time on the charity speaking circuit back in 2013, when it was revealed he had been accepting money for speeches while he was an MP.

As is the pattern, first Trudeau defended it, then offered to repay the fees.

So there was the first red flag in this current controversy: did the PM, or anyone around him, ask whether there was a speaking-fee problem here?

As it happens, there was: nearly $300,000 of it.

(Oddly enough, that’s roughly around the same amount — $277,000 — that Trudeau had offered to pay back on his own speaking-circuit controversy back in 2013.)

Then there was the ethics problem with his trip to the Aga Khan’s island in 2016; a trip that came about because of longstanding relationships with Trudeau’s wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, as well as Margaret Trudeau.

Is this starting to sound familiar?

Then, as now, the trip was vigorously defended by the PMO, until it was revealed that the Aga Khan runs a charity that receives millions of dollars from the government.

The ethics commissioner ruled the trip was a violation of the rules.

Trudeau said: “It is important that as we move forward, we learn from this mistake.”

One of the mistakes was not doing the due diligence beforehand.

Another one was refusing to acknowledge it as a mistake when the initial questions were asked.

But it seems to be a perpetual Trudeau impulse; perhaps best illustrated by his initial statements when the SNC-Lavalin scandal of 2019 first hit the news.

The story was, in Trudeau’s now memorable words, “false.”

It wasn’t false, but this also seemed to be news to Trudeau and his team throughout the weeks and months that the new facts emerged about the political-legal knot of pressure surrounding a favoured Canadian corporation.

The ethics commissioner’s findings after that controversy had Trudeau vowing to do better, too.

“We recognize the way that this happened shouldn’t have happened,” Trudeau said.

The WE charity fiasco has all the ingredients of ethics lapses past.

There’s the troubling closeness of his wife and his mother to a charity-turned-government contractor.

Sophie and Margaret Trudeau, let’s not forget, were in London for a WE charity event that brought the COVID-19 pandemic literally to the PM’s home in early March.

Shades there of the too-close relationship with the Aga Khan.

Throw in trouble with speaking fees and what rules the government is willing to blur for the sake of jobs (SNC or student jobs) and it feels like we’ve seen this movie before.

Critics of the government love when history repeats itself; it establishes patterns easy for the public to understand.

Trudeau, it seems, can’t resist them either.

Next comes the promise to do better.

Correction – July 10, 2020: This column was edited to note that while Justin Trudeau offered to repay $277,000 in speaking fees he earned in 2013, it’s not known how much he actually did pay back. As well, Trudeau has been prime minister for more than five years, not four as previously stated.

Trump’s defiant help for Stone adds to tumult in Washington",[]

Read', 'Jonathan Lemirethe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Jonathan Lemirethe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump’s intervention into a criminal case connected to his own conduct drew fierce rebukes Saturday from Democrats and a few lonely Republicans, with calls for investigations and legislation.

But it remained to be seen if Trump’s most recent defiance of the conventions of his office to commute the sentence of political confidant Roger Stone, just four months before Election Day, would matter to voters grappling with a deadly COVID-19 surge and a national discourse on racial justice.

Shortly before heading out Saturday morning for his Virginia golf club, Trump made unfounded accusations against his political foes while taking another swipe at special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which led to convictions for six Trump aides or advisers, including Stone, a larger-than-life political character who embraced his reputation as a dirty trickster.

“Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place,” Trump tweeted. “It is the other side that are criminals, including Biden and Obama, who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!”

Trump has long sought vengeance against the Russia investigation that helped define his first two years in office. And now that the coronavirus pandemic has imperiled his reelection chances by crushing the economy and sending his poll numbers sliding, he has taken to testing the limits of his power in order to reward loyalty and fire up his conservative base.

Mueller himself spoke out — a rarity for the former FBI director — in an op-ed posted Saturday by The Washington Post in which he defended his investigation as “of paramount importance“ and added: ”Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so.”

The decision to commute the sentence of the 67-year-old Stone, who was convicted of lying to help the president and set to report to prison on Tuesday, was loudly celebrated by some in Trump’s orbit as a triumph over deep state prosecutorial overreach.

But the move announced Friday evening came over the advice of a number of the president’s senior advisers, who warned him it would be politically self-destructive to reward Stone for his silence. Trump had long floated the idea of clemency for Stone — as well as for other associates in legal trouble, including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort — which itself was viewed by some as witness tampering by encouraging them not to co-operate with prosecutors.

The reaction from Democrats was swift and furious.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday called it “an act of staggering corruption,” saying legislation is needed to prevent a president from pardoning or commuting the sentence of someone who acted to shield that president from prosecution. House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff called it “offensive to the rule of law and principles of justice.”

And Trump’s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, resurfaced a 2019 tweet in which he said that “Trump has surrounded himself with people who flout our laws — we shouldn’t be surprised that he thinks he is above the law.” He added: “Still true.”

Republicans largely stayed silent on the issue Saturday, reluctant again to challenge a president who remains very popular with rank-and-file GOP voters. But one loud voice was Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who was also the lone GOP senator to vote to convict the president during his impeachment trial earlier this year.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” Romney tweeted Saturday.

Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, signalled dismay with the commutation, saying in a statement Saturday that it was a mistake while calling the Russia investigation “badly flawed“ and a source of “frustration.” He added that Stone had been duly convicted and that any objections to the conviction and trial “should be resolved through the appeals process.”

Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina congressman who made a short-lived primary challenge to Trump, wrote: “So much for the Republican Party being the party of law and order. Have we not lost our minds in not condemning as a party the president’s corruption by Roger Stone.”

But most of Republicans who did speak out about the decision supported it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump confidant, said Stone was convicted of a “nonviolent, first-time offence” and the president was “justified” in commuting the sentence.

Advisers who had previously talked Trump out of acting on Stone’s behalf awaited the possible fallout, but they considered that Congress may be too consumed with virus relief packages while wondering if the electorate long ago tuned out any talk of the complicated Russia investigation, particularly during a pandemic.

But Trump likely could not afford more political damage. He is decidedly trailing Biden, per his campaign’s own private admissions, and his effort to reboot his reelection bid took another blow when his planned rally Saturday night in New Hampshire was postponed. Campaign officials had deeply worried about low turnout. While an impending storm was blamed for the cancellation, sunny skies were seen in Portsmouth an hour before the president had been due to arrive.

By commuting Stone’s sentence, Trump evoked other controversial acts of clemency by his predecessors, though his was done in the height of an election year.

President George H. W. Bush pardoned former Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Christmas Eve 1992, six weeks after he was defeated for reelection, prompting an uproar from Democrats and the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair. And President Bill Clinton waited until his final hours in office in 2001 to issue a raft of pardons, including of financier Marc Rich.

But one president who resisted the use of pardon was Richard Nixon, who privately discussed acts of clemency but never followed through even as many of his associates faced legal trouble during the Watergate scandal.

A few months after resigning, Nixon himself received a pardon from his successor Gerald Ford.

Stone, a former Nixon aide, told the AP he expressed his gratitude to Trump in a phone call.

“You know, he has a great sense of fairness,” Stone said. “We’ve been friends for many, many years, and he understands that I was targeted strictly for political reasons.”

Read', 'Eric Tuckerthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Eric Tuckerthe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"WASHINGTON - Former special counsel Robert Mueller sharply defended his investigation into ties between Russia and Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, writing in a newspaper opinion piece Saturday that the probe was of “paramount importance” and asserting that a Trump ally, Roger Stone, “remains a convicted felon, and rightly so“ despite the president’s decision to commute his prison sentence.

The op-ed in The Washington Post marked Mueller’s first public statement on his investigation since his congressional appearance last July. It represented his firmest defence of the two-year probe whose results have come under attack and even been partially undone by the Trump administration, including the president’s extraordinary move Friday evening to grant clemency to Stone just days before he was due to report to prison.

Mueller said that though he had intended for his 448-page report on the investigation to speak for itself, he felt compelled to “respond both to broad claims that our investigation was illegitimate and our motives were improper, and to specific claims that Roger Stone was a victim of our office.

“The Russia investigation was of paramount importance. Stone was prosecuted and convicted because he committed federal crimes. He remains a convicted felon, and rightly so,“ Mueller wrote.

Mueller did not specify who was making the claims, but it appeared to be an obvious reference to Trump, who as recently as Saturday derided the investigation as this “whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam.”

The mere publication of the op-ed was striking in itself for a former FBI director who was tight-lipped during the investigation, refusing to respond to attacks by the president or his allies or to even make public appearances explaining or justifying his work. In his first public statement after the conclusion of his investigation, Mueller had said that he had hoped his report would speak for itself. When he later testified to House lawmakers, he was similarly careful not to stray beyond the report’s findings or offer new evidence.

But that buttoned-up approach created a void for others, including at the Justice Department, to place their own stamp on his work. Even before the report was released Attorney General William Barr issued a four-page summary document that Mueller privately complained did not adequately capture the gravity of his team’s findings.

In the months since, Barr assigned a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, and the Justice Department moved to dismiss the criminal case against former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn even though Flynn had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period.

The op-ed traced the basis for the Stone prosecution, with Mueller recounting how Stone had not only tampered with a witness but also lied repeatedly about his efforts to gain inside information about Democratic emails that Russian intelligence operatives stole and provided to WikiLeaks, which published them in the run-up to the election.

Those efforts, including his discussions with Trump campaign associates about them, cut to the heart of Mueller’s mandate to determine whether anyone tied to the campaign co-ordinated with Russia in the hacking or disclosure of the stolen Democratic emails.

Stone was particularly critical to the investigation, Mueller writes, because he claimed inside knowledge about WikiLeaks’ release of the stolen emails and because he communicated during the campaign with people known to be Russian intelligence officers. He also communicated with members of the Trump campaign about the timing of the WikiLeaks releases, something that he denied.

“We did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government in its activities,” Mueller wrote. “The investigation did, however, establish that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome. It also established that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

Stone was found guilty last fall of witness tampering, false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian election interference. He was sentenced in February to 40 months in prison and was due to surrender on Tuesday, until the president commuted his sentence.

“Roger Stone was treated horribly. Roger Stone was treated very unfairly,” Trump told reporters on Saturday.

He was one of six former Trump associates or advisers to be convicted in the Russia investigation. In total, the investigation produced charges against 34 individuals, including 25 Russians accused either of hacking into Democratic email accounts of engaging in a covert social media campaign to divide American public opinion ahead of the election.

Mitt Romney blasted President Donald Trump Saturday for “unprecedented, historic corruption” in commuting Roger Stone’s prison sentence.

Even as most other Republicans held their tongues, the Utah senator slammed Trump for trying to save his own skin by protecting Stone from punishment.

“Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president,” Romney tweeted.

Stone was convicted last year of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of an official proceeding.

He lashed out at Romney on Saturday, and claimed that he was prosecuted for refusing to turn on Trump.

“Mitt Romney, you are as phoney as your hair colour,” Stone said in a video posted on Twitter.

Romney joined a chorus of critics outraged at the commutation, which Trump issued Friday night.

A commutation reduces or completely removes a sentence but does not absolve a guilty person of their crime.

The former GOP presidential nominee has long been a thorn in Trump’s side and was the only Republican lawmaker to vote in favour of his removal in the impeachment trial.

But most Republican lawmakers pointedly kept quiet about the commutation, which prevents Stone from having to report to prison next week for a three-year sentence.

Sen. Pat Toomey, who occasionally criticizes Trump, said it was a “mistake” for the president to commute Stone’s sentence.

Trump acolytes like Sen. Lindsey Graham supported the decision, noting that Stone had not previously been convicted of any major crimes and is a nonviolent offender.

Since taking office, Trump has commuted sentences for 11 people including Stone.

By the end of his second term, President Obama had granted 1,715 commutations.

Fire alarms at the San Gabriel Mission rang around 4 a.m. When firefighters arrived, they saw smoke rising from the wooden rooftop in one corner of the historic structure, San Gabriel Fire Capt. Paul Negrete said.

Firefighters entered the church and tried to beat back the flames, but they had to retreat when roofing and other structural materials began to fall, Negrete said.

“We were trying to fight it from the inside. We weren’t able to because it became unsafe,” he said.

After evacuating the church, the crew was joined by up to 50 firefighters who tried to douse water on the 50-foot-high structure from ladder trucks, he said.

“The roof is completely gone,” the captain said. “The fire traversed the wood rapidly. The interior is pretty much destroyed up into the altar area.”

The cause of the fire was under investigation, Negrete said. He said the recent toppling of monuments to Junipero Serra, the founder of the California mission system who has long been a symbol of oppression among Indigenous activists, will be a factor in the investigation.

“This will be another box that they’re going to check off,” Negrete said.

Robert Barron, the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, tweeted that he was “deeply troubled” by the fire as he awaits further information about its cause.

The church was the fourth of a string of missions established across California by Serra during the era of Spanish colonization. The Franciscan priest has long been praised by the church for bringing Roman Catholicism to what is now the western United States, but critics highlight a darker side to his legacy. In converting Native Americans to Catholicism, they said he forced them to abandon their culture or face brutal punishment.

Depictions of Serra have been protested and vandalized over the years, and Pope Francis’ decision in 2015 to elevate him to sainthood reopened old wounds. More recently, protests focusing on the rights and historical struggle of Black and Indigenous people led activists to topple statues of Serra in San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles.

In response, the San Gabriel Mission recently moved a bronze statue of Serra from the church entrance to its garden, away from public view, Terri Huerta, a spokeswoman for San Gabriel Mission, told the Los Angeles Times.

Police increased patrol and officials stepped security around the mission’s grounds about two weeks ago, she said.

The interior wall of the church was redone a week ago. Crews had just finished installing the pews as part of a larger renovation of the property to mark the anniversary of the founding of the mission in 1771, Huerta said.

The firefighters’ aggressive stance and “a little bit of a miracle” kept the flames from reaching the altar, she said.

The church had been preparing to reopen next weekend following a four-month closure to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Selena Quezada, 26, was in tears when she drove to the mission after she heard about the fire. She said she grew up in the parish and attended the elementary school on the church’s grounds.

“I was baptized here, I had my first communion here ... I was getting ready to get married here next year so this hurts,” Quezada said. “It’s just really sad to see such a historic place burned down because this place means a lot to us.”

The church, built of stone, brick and mortar, originally had a vaulted ceiling that was damaged by two earthquakes in the early 1800s, Huerta said. Franciscan fathers replaced the ceiling with a wood-paneled ceiling, and the roof was last repaired following damage caused by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, she said.

Follow Him On Twitter', 'Gregorchisholm Or Reach Him Via Email', 'Gchisholm Thestar.Ca']",2020-07-11,"The Blue Jays’ four-year attempt to turn Vladimir Guerrero Jr. into a viable third baseman has failed, but that doesn’t mean the work put in at the hot corner was a complete waste of time. From Toronto’s perspective, it was worth a shot.

The inevitable finally happened on Friday when Jays manager Charlie Montoyo announced Guerrero’s stint at third had come to an end. Toronto’s promising slugger will get the bulk of his at-bats at first base, while also making some regularly scheduled starts at designated hitter.

This type of move had been expected for at least the last two years. Guerrero’s strong arm was an asset at third, but he had questionable range, poor footwork and had trouble charging balls. With 17 errors in just 96 games last season, it became apparent whatever progress was being made wasn’t happening nearly fast enough. Something had to give before Toronto moves closer to contention.

“It’s all about having the best chance to compete,” Montoyo said. “It’s going to be a short season. So, for me, the best chance for Vlad is to play first, DH and also play third. Knowing Travis Shaw can play third, and he’s a good third baseman, also helps with that. But this is more about Vladdy and giving him a chance to succeed.”

If Guerrero’s defensive issues were common knowledge for years, long before an error-plagued season, why did the Jays keep him at third base for so long? Well, why not?

It takes more athleticism to play third than it does first, especially during an era when infielders are getting moved all over the field because of defensive shifts. The long-term fear is that Guerrero’s body type will not age well, so at least one line of thinking is that by keeping the 21-year-old on the left side of the diamond, he would be forced to take his training regimen more seriously.

That may or may not have worked. Last season, the rigours of playing a big-league schedule took a toll on his body and limited his range even more. He finally appeared to acknowledge his off-season routine needed to change. It was the type of wake-up call the Jays had been patiently trying to deliver for months. Guerrero reported to spring training earlier this year having lost an unspecified amount of weight, but perhaps still not as much as originally anticipated.

The expectation is that at least some lessons will carry over into his work at first. The Florida Marlins got four years out of Miguel Cabrera at third before he moved to first with the Detroit Tigers. The Jays would have liked something similar with Guerrero. It just wasn’t in the cards, and with promising prospects such as Jordan Groshans and Austin Martin on the way — who could both play third — there was no sense in pushing the issue any further.

So now Guerrero transitions across the diamond, just like Edwin Encarnacion did for Toronto back in 2012. Once nicknamed E5 because of his errant throws from third, Encarnacion quickly turned into a cornerstone of the franchise after switching spots. First and third require different skill sets, but there are enough similarities that players from across the league make the move on a regular basis.

“He’s always asking questions, he wants to learn,” Jays first baseman/DH Rowdy Tellez said of Guerrero, who has been taking reps at first since the spring. “He’s always trying to be better … It’s a different position, different type of footwork around the bag, different types of things you don’t do at third base. All I can say is, he has been tremendous. He’s working hard over there and I’m happy he’s putting in that kind of work. Asking questions, asking the right questions.”

Guerrero’s transition doesn’t change much in the short term for the Jays. Shaw, originally signed to play first, moves to third, where he has spent the bulk of his career. Tellez, who hit three homers in his first two intrasquad games this past week, will be the primary backup at first while also getting at least semi-regular at-bats at DH. Add in a slew of backup infielders such as Joe Panik and Santiago Espinal and the Jays appear covered off.

Say what you want about Toronto’s chances of contending for the post-season, but there’s no denying the roster offers versatility, which makes moving Guerrero this late in the year an easy thing to do.

“I just want to do anything to help my team,” Guerrero said through an interpreter. “I’ve been talking with my teammates, the other first basemen to try and get some advice, and just to be ready whenever the chance comes.”

The elephant in the room that has yet to be addressed here is whether the Jays used Guerrero’s struggles at third base as an excuse to keep him in the minors for longer than necessary. The answer to that can be yes even while admitting nothing would have changed if Guerrero had been at first base or anywhere else on the field.

They could have moved Guerrero to first base two years ago and still used defence as a viable excuse to avoid a successful grievance for manipulating service time. The Jays still could have pointed to the need for an improved fitness routine. They could have said just about anything to justify the move and almost every team in MLB would have taken the same approach.

It’s time to move beyond that. It’s old news. Guerrero’s moment has already arrived, and yet he still has a lot of improvement to do both at the plate and in the field. Encarnacion’s career took off once he was freed from the shackles of third base. The Blue Jays hope the same thing happens with their latest Dominican star.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"The level of trust the Raptors have built among themselves — through injuries and roster alterations, through a championship run and a tremendous interrupted season that followed — is one of the traits they are counting on to carry them through these most unusual of times.

It will be why they endure another training camp, and why they can mix and match lineups and player groupings and still be able to function at a high level about three weeks from now when the NBA season begins again.

They could feel it Saturday at the NBA’s campus on the Disney grounds just outside Orlando, where they practised as a full group for the first time since early March.

There was rust — that was unavoidable — but there was also familiarity and trust.

“I think there’s a trust level with the team that we have,” point guard Fred VanVleet said after the workout. “Managing guys’ bodies, injuries and just looking ahead, I think it’ll be a smoother approach, rather than just trying to jump right back in and ramp it all the way up right away.”

The Raptors played a little five-on-five, and it wasn’t starters against backups or anything like that. It’s not how the team operates when it’s playing games, because of the versatility in the roster and the injuries that decimated it at times in 64 pre-hiatus contests. But it also gives the coaching staff and players a level of comfort they don’t have to learn in this incarnation of training.

“Just based on the situation I think it’s important for us to play, but I also think it’s important, you know, to kind of ease in or taper in a little bit because we’re conscious of health in general,” coach Nick Nurse said. “This sounds like a contradiction, but I started heavier than normal and just told the guys to please self-monitor and let’s not get carried away. We got a long way to go here today (but) for the most part it was really good. And what Fred said about the trust factor really, really showed up. I mean a lot of guys are doing a lot of things that we normally do, just right from the get-go here, which was great.”

Check back after a couple of weeks of the same monotony, the same restaurants, the same hotel room, the same old faces and experiences, and a locked-down environment with no family and no escape to see how everyone’s handling it. For one day, at least, it was freeing to be back doing what they love: playing games and competing and being a team.

The minutiae of sets and rotations and defensive principles and the intricacies of high-level basketball will come with fine-tuning. Now it’s about being whole again.

“I think you saw some rust, some excitement, and that ‘first day of school’ type of thing for everybody — coaches and players,” VanVleet said. “It was good, it was good.”

The Raptors were uniquely positioned to handle the intake process at the Disney campus, having spent nearly two weeks in virtual seclusion at a Naples, Fla. resort hotel and a Fort Myers gym that was under their control.

Still, even having been tested for COVID-19 every other day for the past fortnight, there was some predictable trepidation at the Disney process.

All 37 members of the team’s travelling party were tested right when they arrived Thursday, were quarantined in their rooms until a second test was done Friday night, and were all cleared Saturday morning so they could practise.

“I would say that’s become part of what you do,” Nurse said of the process. “I think the first couple times we did it here — and certainly going way back to March 11, when we went off and got tested (for the first time) — your level of anxiety was a lot higher then, for sure. But I think it’s always: cross your fingers, knock on wood, good thoughts. All that stuff, every time.”

Those moments of anxiety will likely continue through the daily testing procedures, a constant reminder that a global pandemic still rages. But they are at least out a bit and doing what they do. Considering the alternative, that’s all right.

“Yeah, I’m definitely used to quarantine; I’ve been quarantining for like months in my house,” Pascal Siakam said. “Two days is nothing. It went by quick. Found things to do, like video games, anything I can do to let time fly.

“And (it’s) just being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team. We just want to play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere, and that’s all I really care about.”",[]

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-10,"There was fresh optimism in the air at BMO Field on the first weekend of March, when Toronto FC grabbed a late 1-0 win over Eastern Conference rival New York City FC in the home opener.

The Reds were coming off a somewhat unexpected trip to the MLS Cup final for the third time in four years and, despite losing to the Seattle Sounders, a stable off-season was full of well-received moves:

Captain Michael Bradley, who made $6.5 million (U.S.) last season as a designated player, agreed to re-sign for less.

That opened the door to acquiring Argentine attacker Pablo Piatti as one of their new big three.

They extended the deals of centre back Chris Mavinga, winger Auro Jr. and goalkeeper Quentin Westberg.

And they planned for the future by adding 2020 SuperDraft pick Ifunanyachi Achara, among other homegrown youngsters, to the roster.

The mix of rookies and veterans paid off in their second game of the season, a 1-0 victory on Achara’s first Major League Soccer goal in the 81st minute. Five days later, the league suspended its season because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

On Sunday morning, the Reds return to the pitch against D.C. United (TSN, 9 a.m.) at the MLS is Back tournament, which began Wednesday night in Orlando, Fla.

The competition: The month-long tournament at ESPN’s Wide World of Sports Complex uses a World Cup-like format: six groups of four, with each team playing three group-stage matches over about two weeks. The top two from each group and the four best third-place finishers advance to the knockout stage. The finalists will play seven matches in total.

The group: TFC is in Group C with Eastern Conference rivals Montreal, New England and D.C. United. After their opener, the Reds face Montreal on July 15 at 8 p.m. and New England on July 21 at 9 a.m. — all on TSN. Clubs can name rosters of up to 23 players and make five substitutions per match.

The stakes: The group-stage results will count in the regular-season standings, while the tournament winner earns a spot in the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League — replacing the berth traditionally awarded to the regular-season conference leader that did not win the Supporters’ Shield. There is also a $1.1-million (U.S.) prize pool to be dished out.

COVID complications: FC Dallas and expansion Nashville SC, both still at the tournament, were ruled out for matches after a total of 19 players tested positive for COVID-19. All tournament players will be tested regularly, including the day before a match, according to MLS.

Who’s in? Piatti, who has not played a competitive match since December, is expected to make his TFC debut. Bradley, who had off-season surgery to repair a right ankle injury suffered in the MLS final, missed the first two games of the season but is expected to be available.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-06-07,"VANCOUVER—The swath of light-blue shirts was visible from the other side of the stadium.

That section of BC Place was reserved for a group of dedicated Vancouver Whitecaps fans known as the Southsiders. Just minutes before half time in a tense soccer match against the Portland Timbers on May 10, dozens rose from their seats and headed up the stairs to the concourse.

The rowdy fans banged drums and chanted team songs at the top of their lungs. Their Whitecaps-blue T-shirts were emblazoned with three simple words of protest: “We Believe Them.”

It was the Southsiders’ third walkout in a month, joined by another fan group called the Curva Collective and other attendees. The Southsiders were making a show of support for more than a dozen female players who say a former coach of the Whitecaps and U20 national women’s teams bullied and sexually harassed them between 2007 and 2008, when he was dismissed.

The coach, Bob Birarda, was never charged with a crime, and the allegations are unproven. He was later suspended from a coaching position at Coastal FC, an all-ages soccer club in Surrey, in March after the allegations surfaced online.

Those allegations first appeared in a Feb. 25 blog post by former Whitecaps player Ciara McCormack. On March 26, former national team player Andrea Neil weighed in with her own post, which pointed out flaws in the initial investigation. Then on April 4, another 13 former national team players coached by Birarda in 2007 and 2008 published an open letter “calling for a thorough investigation ... as well as a significant overhaul of player safeguarding practices.”

Disappointed by team officials’ handling of the allegations, including a “lack of transparency,” the Southsiders staged four stadium walkouts throughout April and May, co-ordinated a T-shirt campaign and continued to push team management on the issue through public statements.

Then, progress. On May 20, Whitecaps owners Greg Kerfoot and Jeff Mallett met with McCormack and three of her former teammates. A week later, they hired an independent third party to review club policies around safety.

“I don’t think it would have happened without (the Southsiders’) support,” said McCormack.

The Southsiders never questioned their role. These fans, known for their raucous behaviour at games, are supporting women in a way some survivors say is defying stereotypes and demonstrating how accusations of sexual misconduct in sports should be handled.

“It’s 2019,” Southsiders president Peter Czimmermann said as the group gathered at a Gastown pub in May to watch an away game. “This group is for everybody.”

Southsiders celebrate the Whitecaps, for sure, but Czimmermann said they also have the aim of “making the team better and making Vancouver better.”

“We are an inclusive organization,” vice-president Paul Sabourin-Hertzog agreed. “We try to make the group inclusive of gender, (as well as) anti-racist, anti-transphobic, all those things.”

That’s why, as soon as the 13 women published their April 1 letter, the Southsiders asked for a meeting to see how they could help.

For McCormack, it was completely unexpected. When the first walkout happened on April 17, planned entirely by the fan group, she was in shock.

“I still get emotional about it, because we were so unsupported for so long ... and all of a sudden, it’s like your big brother shows up at the playground,” said McCormack.

McCormack believes the Southsiders are unique in Canada for taking on the role of advocates. And plenty of players have needed support.

In February, a CBC investigation found at least 222 coaches of amateur sports in Canada had been convicted of one or more sexual offences in the past two decades.

In May, every member of the board of the Ottawa Lions track-and-field club resigned after a report commissioned by Athletics Canada detailed a systemic failure to address multiple allegations of sexual abuse, assault and harassment of athletes, some dating back four decades.

Last year, three skiers filed a lawsuit against Alpine Canada seeking damages for alleged abuse by former coach Bertrand Charest. He was found guilty of 37 sex-related crimes associated with nine athletes in 2017, though he is appealing both his convictions and his 12-year sentence.

Formal solutions are on the way. In May, Minister of Science and Sport Kristy Duncan said the federal government would develop a national code of conduct for sport to protect athletes from abuse.

But Southsiders fans took matters into their own hands, demanding meetings with Whitecaps owners and pushing them on social media to hold open press conferences to answer reporters’ questions.

Despite being in the thick of the fight, the group has not been shielded from such problems themselves. Some Southsiders have reported being harassed and intimidated, possibly by members of their own ranks.

Last fall, in an attempt to better understand the experiences of women and minorities in the group, the Southsiders conducted an anonymous survey. It showed some Southsiders did not feel safe or welcome at times at Whitecaps games.

Darcie Kerr, a longtime Southsider and former board member, said in an emailed statement that she “spoke personally with a number of supporters” and heard stories of “verbal abuse, harassment or unwanted sexual advances or touching.” Since the survey question only asked whether people had ever been harassed at a game, she said she did not know whether Southsider members committed the acts.

Kerr said the findings indicated that there was more the group needed to do to create a “strong, positive and safe place for women at Whitecaps games.”

She decided to form the South Sisters earlier this year, a subgroup meant for “all females, people who identify as female and allies.” It now has 48 members.

The South Sisters have collaborated with BC Place and the Whitecaps to have a “dedicated female security team” available at games. They also influenced a decision to replace “invasive pat-down security checks” with metal-detecting wands at the entrance.

“The core group is still male dominated — that’s due in part to the history of male-dominated sports — but the people involved are really trying to promote inclusivity,” said South Sister Pippa Adams, a PhD candidate studying feminism and pop culture at Simon Fraser University.

“You can see that through the Pride flags waved at every match, the women leading the chants at matches and the support of these women.”

The Southsiders’ support is rare in the world of sports, she said, but she believes the way fans react to sexual misconduct allegations is changing.

“There’s something visceral about sports that isn’t the same with movies or TV,” Adams explained. While actors are removed from the viewer at home, in a stadium, fans are under the same roof as players and management.

Hockey legend Theo Fleury has experienced the cultural shift on a personal level. Once a player with the Calgary Flames and the New York Rangers, he published a memoir in 2009 detailing sexual abuse by his former junior hockey coach Graham James, not long after player Sheldon Kennedy accused the same coach.

“I definitely felt supported by the people around me, but there was still some stigma attached to it,” he said in an interview. “I think that people were maybe a bit naive on handling these things because victim-blaming was still around.”

Since his memoir, Fleury has worked to support young people in sport and promote awareness about possible harassment and abuse before it happens. He has seen “a lot of changes” in the way allegations are handled by fans and said what the Southsiders are doing is exactly what he wants to see.

“I love the fact that they printed shirts that say ‘We Believe You’ ... That is the greatest thing you can say to someone,” he said.

“It looks like in Vancouver they’ve got it spot on.”

They’d driven through the dark from their family home in Guelph and were planning to visit friends on a Florida farm and do some camping. Soltys had spent weeks reading books on the Everglades to his kids.

But they never got past the check-in desk. Waiting for the family was Sunwing’s general manager, who quietly told them they would not be allowed to board.

“They wouldn’t tell me what was going on,” Soltys said. Instead, he was handed a small envelope.

When he looked inside, “all the background noise kind of faded away.” Inside was a redress form for travellers experiencing trouble, bearing the insignia of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

It was happening again; February wasn’t the first time Soltys experienced trouble at the border.

Soltys, a soft-spoken orchardist who works cultivating fruit trees, fears he’s somehow become a threat in the eyes of Canada and the United States, ensnared by an interwoven network of security databases. Despite his best efforts, Soltys has been unable to find out what he’s accused of doing; all he knows is that the consequences are very real.

According to scholars of surveillance, security and civil liberties, once drawn into the modern system it can be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to get answers or get out.

A clue brings more questions

On Jan. 11, 2017, after visiting the same friends in Florida, Soltys and his family were stopped at the Buffalo-Fort Erie Peace Bridge border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency. They sat for roughly an hour while border agents worked on their computers. Then they were released, with little explanation.

Soltys left the encounter feeling rattled and submitted a Privacy Act request to try to get some answers.

Within a month, he received a photocopy of the notepad used by the CBSA officer who pulled the family aside. Near the bottom of the page, beneath his name and birthdate, was a single word: TUSCAN.

At the time, the word meant little to Soltys.

But a year later, in June 2018, the British newspaper the Guardian published a series of articles detailing a massive traveller screening list maintained by the United States. The database, employed in secret for more than 20 years by law enforcement on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border and revealed to contain more than 680,000 names, is known as “Tipoff U.S./Canada” — TUSCAN.

According to the documents obtained by the Guardian, TUSCAN is explicitly designed “to intercept and potentially apprehend or refuse entry to known or suspected terrorists.” The FBI database is used by the CBSA as one of its screening tools and is designed to streamline information sharing between Canadian and U.S. law enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security, FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on TUSCAN — advising Star Vancouver to reach out to the Canadian government — including whether Soltys is in the database or is otherwise a concern for U.S. law enforcement.

Headaches, delays and ‘random’ checks: One Edmontonian is pushing the government to finally fix the No Fly List

Is Canada right to tighten its border?

Canada’s Ministry of Public Safety said the country’s security agencies cannot answer questions about specific individuals, citing classified information. Those agencies did say they don’t contribute to TUSCAN and only investigate legitimate threats to the public.

This month, Soltys said the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, to whom he had complained about the lack of information he was getting, told him the CBSA had pulled him over in 2017 because the border agency was concerned about another “Matthew Soltys” with a different birth date.

Soltys is skeptical. He has a countertheory: that his activism may have landed him on the terrorist watchlist.

An eye on activism

Soltys, who studies biology, is polite in conversation but is also an outspoken and lifelong environmental activist.

“Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always been driven by a strong concern for our future,” he said.

In the summer of 2009, Soltys was part of an 18-day protest on the edge of Guelph, an effort to halt the destruction of an old-growth forest slated for development of the Hanlon Creek Business Park. Soltys became an informal spokesperson for the group before a court injunction dissolved the occupation.

In the fall, more than 70 protesters — including Soltys — greeted a busload of civic officials and developers near the site. The protesters, according to Guelph Mercury reporting at the time, became combative, and police intervened.

Soltys was one of five protesters to be sued by the joint landowners of the site. The lawsuit was eventually dropped.

In 2006, Soltys was arrested for spray-painting an “existing graffiti wall” in Guelph with a message mocking the label “eco-terrorist.” A judge gave him an absolute discharge — the lowest-level sentence an adult can receive. No conviction is registered, and the charge is automatically removed from an offender’s record after a year.

For six years, Soltys hosted a weekly radio show on environmental and social justice issues. And in 2017, Soltys and his family visited a protest camp in North Florida, where other families had gathered to demonstrate against a natural gas pipeline.

Any of Soltys’ actions could have landed him on any number of police and intelligence databases, according to Jeffrey Monaghan, an assistant professor at Carleton University’s Institute for Criminology and Criminal Justice.

Monaghan — co-author of a book on RCMP monitoring, surveillance and infiltration — is friends with Soltys and described him as a “perfectly civil, very thoughtful fellow, who’s far from a dangerous criminal.”

Citing his body of research, Monaghan said that in the late 2000s, especially in the years leading up to Vancouver’s 2010 Olympics, war on terror resources were increasingly directed toward regular, domestic protest policing.

“All of a sudden it seems perfectly normal within (security) bureaucracies to start applying war on terror, anti-terrorism resources to someone who is essentially an environmental protester,” he said.

RCMP and Canadian spy agency CSIS scour social-media profiles and attend protest gatherings undercover, Monaghan said.

Paul Champ, an Ottawa litigation lawyer focusing on human rights and public-interest law, said the RCMP and CSIS regularly track demonstrations, creating dossiers on individuals based on their level of participation.

“The spotlight of national security is starting to move away from Islamic extremist terrorists to people who are environmentalists and are just trying to organize politically,” said Champ, also vice-president of the BC Civil Liberties Association.

Michelle Schmidt of the RCMP’s National Communication Services told Star Vancouver the RCMP “does not investigate movements or ideologies but rather criminal activity that threatens the safety and security of Canadians.”

John Townsend, head of media relations for CSIS, said Canada’s CSIS Act prohibits the investigation of persons conducting “lawful advocacy, protest and dissent.”

Trapped in a tangled web

Yet links between security agencies are becoming increasingly tight, meaning an organization can have access to info gathered under totally different policies.

In 2015, a proposal was revealed that would allow CSIS and the CBSA to share resources without requiring the approval of their political masters. And the TUSCAN documents refer to the RCMP’s collaboration with stateside police.

“They’re all integrated,” Monaghan said of the agencies’ databases. “The infrastructures they’ve built produce false positives. They’re meant to be overly precautionary. And they’re meant to be trading all this information.”

CSIS confirmed it “works closely with domestic and international partners” to “share threat-related information within the Government of Canada and foreign partners.”

In an email, the CBSA told Star Vancouver the border agency “does not contribute intelligence to TUSCAN.” But the TUSCAN documents note that, in exchange for access to TUSCAN, Canada agreed to give the U.S. access to its own no-fly list.

The “interoperability” and opacity of these databases means getting one’s name removed permanently from the system is virtually impossible, Monaghan said.

“As soon as a person is caught in a database, you’re actually fighting multiple databases, which you don’t even know whether you’re in or not,” he said. “It’s just a Kafka-esque process.”

While it’s possible for Canadians to have their names scrubbed from Canada’s official no-fly list, TUSCAN is under U.S. management. Canada can apply to the U.S. to have a name removed, but the FBI is under no obligation to comply. In its statement, the CBSA did not respond to a question asking how a Canadian might have their name scrubbed from TUSCAN.

Soltys has had little luck pursuing help through official channels. In response to a request with the office of his MP, he was told the CBSA couldn’t speak to the U.S. decision to block him from entering the country in February.

In addition to his own freedoms, Soltys said his situation has left him fearing for the future of his country.

“It makes me feel very upset that in this time where there’s news about the crisis of climate change every day in the mainstream media, in this context, people who are environmental activists are considered terrorists,” he said.

“The government and intelligence agencies see me as a threat to national security … when the greatest threat to national security is the current prediction for climate change.”

Read', 'Wanyee Listar Vancouver', 'Star Vancouver', 'Wanyee Li Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Courts', 'Wildlife Conservation', 'New Technology. Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-06-03,"VANCOUVER—The woman fidgets with a black hair tie, sitting in a windowless office in downtown Vancouver. The fear that he will come for her and her children again has never gone away.

She came to Canada in 2006. They started dating six months after that. Five years later, she became pregnant with their first child. That’s when the violence started.

She reported the violence to police, and her ex-husband was eventually charged with two counts of assault and one count of sexual assault. But there is nothing preventing him from approaching her again — unless she obtains a protection order from family court. Going to family court would mean facing her abuser, again.

Anti-violence and legal advocates say cases like hers demonstrate the need for integrated courts that can handle both criminal and family-law cases. Otherwise, survivors of domestic abuse face the risk of retraumatization and even conflicting judgments.

Navigating the bureaucratic and opaque court system left her afraid and confused. All the while, she and her two children were living in a shelter in the Vancouver area. It was December 2015.

“My life was in such a mess … We were trying everything to find a place, to not be in a shelter for Christmas,” she said, her voice shaking.

“It’s hard to describe it because you’re so stressed, you don’t know what to think — would someone actually come take my kids away from me because I’m in a shelter, because I don’t have everything together?”

For the woman, whom Star Vancouver is not naming due to continuing concerns for her safety, going to family court would mean having to face him again, having to tell her story again and even potentially having social workers interview her children, now ages five and eight, again.

Legal advocates say stories like hers are common — about a third of all of YWCA’s clients who seek legal help from the organization encounter this problem of navigating both the criminal and family court systems.

This most often happens with domestic abuse survivors because there are both criminal and family-law elements to their case. And it means protection orders for children are sometimes not granted due to a lack of inter-court communication, while survivors stand the risk of being re-traumatized over and over again.

Traditionally, criminal and family courts are kept separate because they have different priorities. Criminal court is designed to prioritize public safety while also protecting the rights of the accused. Family court, on the other hand, is geared toward the rights of children.

Survivors of domestic abuse cases often find themselves navigating both courts at the same time. Evidence needs to be presented twice, and judges can make rulings that, unbeknownst to them, interfere with a fellow judges’ ruling on the same case, the same people, in another court.

Pausing to collect herself, the woman recalled her experience walking into the courtroom. Facing her abuser was the last thing she wanted to do but she had to be brave for her children, she said.

“It was cold, it was scary,” she said. “You feel like you don’t have any rights, when you’re going in there.”

Advocates say an integrated court system for domestic abuse cases will result in fewer court appearances, saving taxpayers money, and allow for one judge to consider all factors in the case, including both criminal and family matters.

Canada’s justice system relies on survivors of abuse to come forward and testify in order to keep the guilty accountable, said Pat Shannon, a staff lawyer at YWCA’s legal education program for women in transition housing.

“(Those women) are really taking on the burden of moving that process forward. We all benefit, and it’s a true act of service,” said Shannon.

“We should do more to support that process while also protecting the rights of the accused. The integrated court system seems to be doing a great job of both.”

The YWCA helps women who do not receive sufficient legal aid from the province by providing pro-bono legal representation.

Surrey would be an excellent place to pilot an integrated court, said Shannon, who noted many judges in that tight-knit court system are already generalists, often hearing criminal and family cases on the same day.

British Columbia’s attorney general, David Eby, said in an email that the province is not currently considering an integrated family and criminal court model, but is “open to exploring similar initiatives.”

“We recently introduced a new Early Resolution and Case Management Model to assist families who want to resolve family law matters,” he said.

The model provides families with needs assessment, mediation and parenting education, as well as assisting with child and spousal support, parenting arrangements and more. It also includes a process for seeking protection orders.

The model is available in Victoria, and Eby said the government may introduce it elsewhere if it is successful.

Jurisdictions like Duncan and Surrey also have criminal courts that specialize in domestic abuse cases.

Any court that focuses on domestic abuse survivors and their children should offer community-based support that can help with everything from emergency housing to childcare to counselling, said Elba Bendo, director of law reform at the legal advocacy group West Coast LEAF.

The organization has advocated for an integrated court system for years.

The lack of legal aid funding in B.C. disproportionately affects women, and the lack of an integrated court system to deal with domestic abuse cases compounds that issue, said Bendo.

She also said more research needs to be done on how integrated courts focused on domestic violence can help survivors from racialized communities, rural communities, and LBTQIQS+ communities.

Sitting in the dimly lit room and looking down at her hands clutched around the hair tie, the woman who survived years of violence said she is still hopeful authorities will adjust the court system to help other women like her.

“I want to see change,” she said. “I want to change the world. If nobody speaks up, then no change will happen.”

Alex Morton has been a thorn in the federal government and fish farm industry’s side for years, taking them to court twice on this issue — and winning both times.

Morton, the ‘Namgis First Nation and environmental groups say fish farms are “viral factories” for a highly contagious pathogen, Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), that is putting wild salmon at risk.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada, often called the Department of Fisheries and Oceans or DFO, allows farms to transfer salmon from land-based hatcheries to ocean pens without testing for the virus.

In February, a federal court judge sided with Morton and the ‘Namgis, striking down the government’s no-testing policy. The court gave DFO until June to come up with a new approach.

Fighting the case in court, as well as earlier legal battles against Morton over the same virus, cost taxpayers $2.26 million, according to a summary document released to Star Vancouver under the Access to Information law.

“If they spent $2.3 million dollars to fight me on this, and the ‘Namgis, that’s just wrong,” said Morton when she learned what it had cost Canadians.

Given B.C.’s declining salmon populations, Morton said it’s “inexcusable to allow an industry to pepper this coast with release points of this virus.”

‘Namgis Chief Don Svanvik said the revelation “just adds to the bewilderment” of the whole case.

“I would like DFO to at least use the same amount of vigour defending wild fish as they do the open net pen fish in fish farms. It seems to be a cockeyed priority,” he said.

“We’re salmon people, we’re people of the sea and we’re losing that because of how we treat the environment.”

B.C. has been ranked the world’s fourth-largest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon. It’s the province’s biggest agri-food export.

According to DFO the aquaculture industry directly employed 1,595 people in 2017. The BC Salmon Farmers Association says the industry supports closer to 7,000 jobs.

A spokesperson for Fisheries and Oceans Minister Jonathan Wilkinson did not address the legal fees in a response to Star Vancouver’s request for comment.

Instead, Jocelyn Lubczuk, Wilkinson’s press secretary, said: “protecting wild pacific salmon is a top priority.”

She pointed to various initiatives the department has undertaken “to ensure our aquaculture sector is economically successful and environmentally sustainable.”

These include moving to a new management approach that accounts for regional differences, a new framework for risk management, and an ongoing study looking at the feasibility of closed-containment fish farms, which would separate farmed fish from the open ocean.

On Tuesday, the department also announced that it will create a new external Advisory Committee on Aquaculture Science to ensure its policies are based on “the best and most up to date scientific information.”

As for DFO’s next steps on PRV, Lubczuk said the department would have more to say in the weeks ahead.

In her February decision, Justice Cecily Strickland wrote that the government’s existing PRV policy “fails to embody and is inconsistent with the precautionary principle, and it fails to take into consideration the health of wild Pacific salmon.”

“The background of this legal case kind of makes you scratch your head,” said Stan Proboszcz, the science adviser with Watershed Watch Salmon Society.

“The federal government is essentially being accused of not acting in a precautionary way and allowing potentially virus-positive fish to be put into Canadian public waters,” he said.

“Why is the federal government fighting this sort of thing?”

Declining wild salmon put the whole ecosystem at risk. In particular, the southern resident killer whales rely heavily on Chinook to survive.

Morton acknowledged Wilkinson is in a tough position. She met with him in person last week for nearly an hour and said it was the first time any federal minister has agreed to meet with her.

“No minister before him has given this industry the bad news that they are going to have to change their practice to protect wild salmon,” she said.

“It’s a role that Minister Wilkinson has inherited, but he is facing a very tough choice. He is going to either have to oversee the extinction of wild salmon or he is going to have to tell this industry it’s time to get out of the water.”",[]

Read', 'Jenny Pengstar Vancouver', 'Star Vancouver', 'Jenny Peng Is A Vancouver-Based Reporter Covering Business. Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-05-01,"VANCOUVER—As exhausting as caring for young children can be, Melissa Dixon treasures the moments that make it all worth it, like being embraced years later by kids who still remember her as their preschool teacher.

Dixon has worked with children for most of her life, but after her rental building in Vancouver’s West End sold last May, it could undo her career — and B.C. has precious few early childhood educators (ECEs) to lose.

“I feel like I’m stepping on eggshells a little bit because I don’t know what my next step is,” said Dixon.

Over the past six years, she has been able to pay her bills while living in a one-bedroom apartment for $780 a month. Dixon and the rest of her building’s tenants will be evicted by the end of 2020, as the new owners are considering demolition.

“I know my work wants me but I don’t know if I have a livable wage to live in a regular housing situation because I don’t have the proper funding to live in a $1,500 or $1,700 one bedroom,” she said.

For five decades, the association that represents about 1,200 workers in early childhood education, ECEBC, has said its educators are underpaid for the education and experience they need to work in the field. The B.C. government’s online job portal, WorkBC, indicates that the median wage for ECEs in the province is $17 per hour.

Dixon works with kids ages three to five at a preschool in Strathcona, making $21 an hour. Even with some gigs as a First Nations singer and dancer helping to pay the bills, she says she won’t be able to afford Vancouver’s typical rent.

“I have allotted what I need for the bills and then I am almost paycheque to paycheque,” said Dixon.

She’s now looking for subsidized housing so she doesn’t have to leave the city or the field she loves.

Last year, roughly 20,000 ECEs and assistants were employed in the province, according to WorkBC. They typically work in daycares, child-care centres and preschools with children from infancy to age five before they make the transition to kindergarten. Educators develop and lead activities that nurture children’s intellectual, physical and emotional growth at a critical stage of brain development.

The ECEBC is calling for a “fair compensation” of $25 an hour plus benefits to allow educators to make a living wage.

In an open letter issued in March, ECEBC said the industry is facing “a crisis with recruitment and retention” of workers as it tries to meet the demands of families across the province. Daycare centres have notoriously long wait-lists, especially for infants and toddlers.

A lack of educators has forced some centres to close and others to operate undercapacity. Dixon said she has seen it in her home community of Sechelt.

“They have a multimillion-dollar child development centre, but it’s the same thing. They can hold 75 children and they’re holding 16,” Dixon said.

Early childhood educator Jaime Bellringer told Star Vancouver that some centres in her community of Prince George have closed down because they couldn’t find educators to fill the space, while families face wait lists that are “miles long.”

Early childhood education is in her blood. A third-generation ECE, Bellringer was aware of the industry’s reputation for low pay but felt its social impact is too great to ignore.

“I knew it (getting an education) was quite expensive and not necessarily pays all that well so I saved up for a couple of years so I could go back without having to take students loans,” said Bellringer.

“It’s something that I think is really important. If my mother and grandmother hadn’t done it, those generations wouldn’t have carried on the way that they have.”

Educators are required to complete, at minimum, a certificate program that takes less than a year but can choose to get a two-year college diploma or a four-year bachelor’s degree.

Once employed, they’re often underpaid for the “complexity” of their jobs, especially when working with diverse populations, said the director of ECEBC, Lynn Reside.

“We have a very mixed population … where maybe they’re dealing with trauma, they’re dealing with English as a second language, they’re dealing with poverty,” Reside said. “There’s a lot of complexity: children’s mental health, their physical health.”

There is “positive change” on the way, Bellringer said, which she finds “really exciting.” In its 2018 budget, the B.C. government announced a four-year $1.3-billion investment in child care with the goal of improving quality and making care more affordable and accessible.

Part of that investment is going toward bursaries for ECEs to help with the cost of their education. Another portion is being used to increase wages for ECEs in licenced facilities participating in the Child Care Fee Reduction initiative: a $1 per hour increase this year and another $1 per hour increase in April 2020.

One of the educators receiving the wage bump is Jennifer Everett, who lives in Parksville, B.C.

As a single mom of two children, she pushed hard with her non-profit’s board for a significant raise from under $17 an hour — the living wage in her community — to over the living wage to eventually making $24 an hour.

She said the raise was essential in keeping her in the field she’s worked in for 15 years.

“I could not afford to stay in this sector and make that amount of money and pay to have an education, when I can go to a local grocery store in my community and make just as much,” Everett said.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-11,"TORONTO - A Canadian investment firm attempting to purchase Torstar Corp. has upped its bid in response to a rival offer for the media conglomerate.

NordStar Capital LP has amended its agreement to purchase the owner of the Toronto Star and other community newspapers, saying it will now pay $60 million instead of the initially agreed-upon $52 million.

Its offer of 74 cents per share is a 17.5 per cent increase over its earlier price of 63 cents per share.

NordStar, a firm run by businessmen Paul Rivett and Jordan Bitove, intends to take Torstar private.

Torstar confirmed earlier this week that it had received a potentially superior second offer, which it said was unsolicited.

Rivett and Bitove previously said they had no plans to increase their bid in response.

Nordstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shareholders will vote on the transaction at a meeting set for July 21.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 11, 2020.

Read', 'Josh Rubinbusiness Reporter', 'Business Reporter']",2020-07-11,"The battle to acquire Torstar took a dramatic turn Saturday with the emergence of an improved $60-million bid from NordStar Capital, which topped a rival $58-million offer from Canadian Modern Media Holdings Inc.

The new bid from Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett, the entrepreneurs behind NordStar, has the support of Torstar’s board of directors, the voting trust of five families who control the Star’s A-class shares, as well as Fairfax Financial, the biggest holder of B-class shares, with roughly 40 per cent.

Under terms of the revised bid, those agreements are “hard lock-ups,” meaning the voting trust and Fairfax can’t change their votes to support any other bid, a source said.

“I’m beyond excited, humbled and really looking forward to the Star being around for the next 100 years,” Bitove said.

The new bid tops a rival offer from Canadian Modern Media Holdings Inc., a group including Matthew Proud, CEO of Dye & Durham Corp., his brother Tyler Proud, CEO of technology company Avesdo Inc., finance industry veteran Neil Selfe and former Ontario finance minister and Ontario Liberal Party president Greg Sorbara.

That team had not yet made their bid official and were facing a deadline of Monday at 5 p.m. to do so. The source of their financing has not been disclosed.

Bitove and Rivett, through their company NordStar Capital, would have had five business days to match the offer, but they didn’t wait, making a higher pre-emptive bid instead.

The latest bid still values the company at less than the $69 million in cash Torstar had on hand at the end of the first quarter. Torstar was also debt free.

A July 21 meeting where shareholders are being asked to vote on NordStar’s offer is scheduled to go ahead. Torstar’s board had previously said it recommended the original NordStar bid, calling it “in the best interests of the company.”

The Proud brothers’ offer was worth 72 cents per share, while Bitove and Rivett’s offer had been worth 63 cents per share before they raised it to 74 cents this weekend. Bitove and Rivett initially offered 56.6 cents per share, but that offer was rejected by Torstar’s board. Their 63-cent offer was made public in late May after being recommended by the board.

Torstar shares closed at 71 cents per share Friday, down one cent on the day.

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"The kinky and the curly are obvious. But the “yaki?”

You might not understand why Vivian Kaye’s million-dollar, Hamilton-based hair extension business carries the tongue-in-cheek name, KinkyCurlyYaki.

Certainly, she says, banks and business advisers have not.

But the women who buy Kaye’s products online — 80 per cent of them in the U.S. — they get it.

“If you’re a black woman who’s ever worn hair extensions you know what yaki is,” said Kaye, 42.

The term originates from the yak hair that was used in the past to make hair extensions and weaves. The silky texture of “yaki” hair resembles a Black woman’s hair that had been chemically straightened — a style that used to be the standard professional look for Black women.

Kaye’s company is an offshoot of her own search for naturally textured hair — all KinkyCurlyYaki products are made from human hair sourced in India and manufactured in China.

She has been overlooked by banks, business accelerators and other agencies that failed to understand her products and her market. But that has also cost them the opportunity to participate in KinkyCurlyYaki’s success.

Now she wants to share what she has learned by coaching other women, who don’t necessarily have the vocabulary, confidence and experience to parlay their ideas into a thriving enterprise.

“Any time I talk to anyone who is in a position to give money, they always ask, ‘How did you build a $1 million business and no one’s given you money to do it or to grow it,’ ” she said.

The answer is obvious: “I’m not serving an interest that would be of interest to you. The demographic I serve looks like me.” said Kaye.

“It’s almost as if no one wanted to help me just get a piece of my own self,” she said.

Black hair care is a $6 billion industry dominated by Asian manufacturers and suppliers. But they weren’t supplying the kind of textured hair that Kaye wanted.

“I wanted to look ‘presentable’ but I wanted something that would look authentic on me. What I found was that when they did have kinkier textured hair it was buried underneath the silkier textures,” she said.

“They were always selling silky hair because that was seen as beautiful whereas nappy hair or kinky hair was seen as ugly,” she said.

During a recent video chat, with her six-year-old son Xavier in the background watching TV in their Hamilton living room, Kaye appears more suburban soccer mom than the polished entrepreneur pictured on the KinkyCurlyYaki website. Her long gold painted nails are the only visible link to the beauty business.

She spent her early adult life working in Toronto but since Xavier she’s replanted herself in the Hammer close to her immigrant family who came to Canada from Ghana when Kaye was a baby.

Her dad was a mechanic. Her mother stayed home to raise four girls. After attending French immersion at Cathedral High School in Hamilton, Kaye headed to York University to study anthropology but she dropped out following a bout of depression.

Her French helped her land a series of call centre jobs and she loved the customer service aspect of the work. Eventually she made her way to a tech start-up where she was a one-woman marketing department.

When that ended, she took a job with an office services franchise company. She ran a wedding decorator business on the side.

She remembers wanting a bigger car for her business. When she slipped out to a dealership on her lunch hour, the salesman said her vehicle was worthless on a trade.

Her manager noticed she was down and he offered to go back with her.

“We went there the next day — me and my big, white, tall male boss — and literally all they could talk about was golf. And the guy was, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ll give her this for the trade-in….’ And the next thing you know I had a truck,” she said.

Even as a wedding decorator, she recognized the shocked expressions when meeting clients she had previously only spoken with on the phone.

“Racism is alive and well, the quiet racism we have here in Canada,” says Kaye.

She left her full-time office job in 2010 when her wedding decor business was doing well and she wasn’t worried about making rent on her Mississauga apartment.

Two years later at a networking event, a Black woman pulled her aside and asked about her hairdresser. Kaye had sourced her hair, going through a manufacturer to get the precise textured products she wanted. But she wasn’t thinking about selling the look.

“That woman asking me if I would tell her who my hairdresser was paid the highest compliment. She, as a Black woman didn’t know I was wearing a weave. She thought it was my own hair,” said Kaye.

That is when the light bulb went on.

When the summer wedding season died down in December 2012, the idea resurfaced. Kaye remembers thinking, “Let’s just launch the thing. Let’s just sell some hair online.”

The business took off. In 2013, KinkyCurlyYaki had done just under $500,000 (U.S.) in sales.

“This is someone who was an immigrant, a college drop out, who had no idea how to run an e-commerce business,” she says.

In 2016, after becoming pregnant, Kaye moved back to Hamilton, bought a house and ran the business from her basement. She was so busy raising her son, it took her about three months to notice that sales had passed the $1 million mark.

KinkyCurlyYaki now operates out of a 1,000 sq. ft. warehouse space in Hamilton.

“When I look back I’m really disappointed because I didn’t have access to any other resources. I wish I was more educated about taking on debt,” she says.

She had her immigrant parents’ aversion to debt and operated on cash.

“It worked for me but I think it was detrimental to the growth of my business,” she says.

Encouragement and education were scarce.

The bank that monitored the movement of U.S. funds into her account — part of the payment system Kaye was using at the time — would call to ask where all that U.S. money was coming from but never offered to help her expand.

Two years ago, she attended a pitch competition in Montreal — an event where entrepreneurs showcase their ideas to attract funders. Kaye wasn’t pitching but she noticed who was.

“White guys … were getting money for ant farms that didn’t exist. Here I had a viable product that was actually making money and I couldn’t get money for it,” she says.

She was encouraged to apply to the Canadian Technology Accelerator in New York. When she did, she says she was told, “We love you but we don’t know how to help you. We don’t understand the demographic, we don’t understand the product that you’re doing, we don’t have any connections in that industry.”

But, she adds, “I’m pretty sure if I had an ant farm they would figure out who could help me.”

“A lot of businesses like mine fall through the cracks because we don’t have the connections or the network that a lot of other people do.”

Now with COVID-19 interrupting KinkyCurlyYaki’s supply chain, Kaye has turned her attention to business coaching and mentorship through a company called Founders Fund.

It’s an offshoot of another social enterprise called, Tease Tea. Its CEO Sheena Brady and Kaye are peer mentors who connect about every three weeks to discuss their challenges and celebrate their victories.

Started last year, Founders Fund is a national membership-based, online growth accelerator, providing mentoring, leadership and grants to women entrepreneurs, who are vulnerable of slipping through the cracks.

Among its approximately 500 members, 34 per cent identify as women of colour and 31 per cent identify as immigrants. Of the $225 annual membership fee, 50 per cent goes directly into funding grants for women’s enterprise, said Brady.

In its inaugural year, Founders Fund gave about $40,000 to five companies, she said.

“(Kaye) just got what we were doing from Day 1, where a lot of people didn’t get it. We need to have successful people who have made it on the other side,” said Brady. “She’s an incredible storyteller. She’s really good at keeping people engaged and inspired.”

Kaye is passionate about the program “because there was nothing like that available to me. Because I’m part of it, other women of colour joined,” she said.

Black women don’t go where they don’t see themselves, said Kaye.

When white women tell her don’t understand that, she asks them to think about their own discomfort when they are in a room full of men.

“If you don’t feel welcome or appreciated in that space, how do you think we feel going into all white people spaces?

“If we are welcome the next thing we know the photographer’s there taking pictures specifically of you because they want to show how diverse the event is,” she said. “Sometimes I’m willing to be that token because then I’m getting my foot in the door.”

Kaye wants to help build the confidence of “women who don’t fit into that girl boss criteria, that skinny white woman drinking lattes with her white friend and Gucci purse.

Read', 'Lynn Elberthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Lynn Elberthe Associated Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"LOS ANGELES—With their marriage under social-media scrutiny, Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith reaffirmed their commitment to each other as Pinkett Smith admitted to having a relationship with musician August Alsina when she and Smith were separated.

In a one-on-one conversation Friday on Pinkett Smith’s series “Red Table Talk,” she said she was reluctantly discussing Alsina’s reported comments because of the public speculation they provoked.

What started as a friendship and a family effort to help Alsina with his health about four years ago became a “different kind of entanglement” at a time when she and Smith thought their marriage was over, Pinkett Smith said.

“An entanglement? A relationship,” Smith said, prodding his wife to be more specific, alluding to the Facebook Watch show’s dedication to candid discussion.

“Yes, it was a relationship. Absolutely. I was in a lot of pain. I was very broken,” she replied. “Now, in the process of that relationship, I definitely realize that you can’t find happiness outside of yourself. ... I would definitely say we did everything that we could to get away from each other, only to realize that that wasn’t possible.”

At one point in the conversation they echoed each other, saying: “We ride together. We die together. Bad marriage for life,” an allusion to a catchphrase in Smith’s “Bad Boys” franchise.

The two have been married since 1997 and have two children, Jaden and Willow. Each appeared uncomfortable at times during their exchanges on the talk show.

A representative for Alsina didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pinkett Smith, who starred in two “Matrix” films, questioned why Alsina would bring the episode up again, saying he had broken off communication with her. She also pushed back at the idea that Smith had given her permission for the affair. Alsina was quoted in an interview as saying the actor had given his “blessing.”

“The only person that can give permission in that particular circumstance is myself,” Pinkett Smith said, then cut Alsina slack for his remarks.

“I could actually see how he would perceive it as permission because we were separated amicably. And I think he also wanted to make it clear that he is not a homewrecker, because he’s not,” she said.",[]

Read', 'David Friendthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'David Friendthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"Independent concert venue owner Jeff Cohen simply wants his famed Horseshoe Tavern to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the past four months, the legendary Toronto stage that’s hosted the likes of the Rolling Stones and the Police has gone dark, and its famed checkerboard floors immortalized in the Tragically Hip’s “Bobcaygeon” left empty.

Like most smaller Canadian music venues, the future is anything but certain.

“The live-venue industry right now in Canada is on the verge of bankruptcy,” Cohen said.

“We’re not opening, probably, until the end of this year — maybe next year ... We have no income coming in whatsoever. It’s a bad scene.”

Along with several other indie concert venue owners, Cohen has been making noise about the troubling years ahead for Canada’s live music scene in hopes the federal government will take more action.

There was a glimmer of hope on Tuesday when Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault outlined a program that lets owners of for-profit venues apply for a piece of $20 million promised to support the live music sector.

The money will be divided among numerous corners of the industry, including venues, concert promoters, booking agents, managers and music festivals. The funding is part of the second phase of support in the $500-million emergency support measures introduced in May for Canada’s arts and culture organizations.

Anyone who’s granted approval will receive a minimum contribution of $5,000 that’s supposed to last until the end of September.

Beyond the live music business, the federal government has earmarked $5 million for the recording industry that will be administered by Factor and Musicaction, which specialize in developing and supporting Canadian music talent.

Erin Benjamin, chief executive of the Canadian Live Music Association, which advocates for the industry, called the move by Canadian Heritage to support venues “a good start” that needs to be built upon in short order.

“It’s better than nothing,” she said.

“It’ll help some companies for a very short amount of time ... but we’re not done here. We can’t be done.”

While Cohen doesn’t know if he’ll qualify for a portion of the venue funding, he’s skeptical about how much it’ll actually help the Horseshoe.

“I’ll be able to pay two weeks of rent,” Cohen said, pointing out it’s roughly $40,000 a month for the downtown location.

“It’ll be something, and we’ll be grateful for it ... but I’m skeptical until I actually see the payments.”

He suspects the Horseshoe may also fail to meet some of the requirements outlined on the Factor website. Among them, a venue must have booked at least 50 per cent Canadian musicians at its venue last year to qualify.

“Horseshoe Tavern was open 360 days last year, I don’t think we wrote down which bands were Canadian and weren’t. I don’t think we even know,” Cohen said.

“The eligibility makes no sense.”

Smaller venues have been able to tap into other financial support measures, which include the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the emergency wage subsidy.

In Toronto, city council recently passed legislation that allows property owners to claim a tax break of 50 per cent tax on spaces that operate primarily as live music venues. The intention is for those savings to trickle down to the tenants who are still not allowed to reopen.

Live venues in other Canadian cities are at different stages in a process many anticipate could stretch well into next year.

Vancouver bars were some of the first to reopen, though several clubs in the city warned that patrons may have been exposed to COVID-19 in recent weeks.

Montreal’s music venues were allowed to legally reopen in late June, but concertgoers have to remain seated and dancing is forbidden.

In Halifax, Karen Spaulding reopened the Carleton Music Bar and Grill in the final days of June, but it hardly feels the same to her.

“It is at half capacity for three days a week, instead of normally five to seven, and it’s acoustic shows only,” she said.

“Just the world, the audience and the guests, all feel different.”

The Carleton operates as a restaurant, which helped Spaulding’s attempt to get the business back on its feet, though she said overall revenues have dropped somewhere between 50 to 75 per cent.

But as much as she’s concerned for her business, she’s also worried about local Canadian musicians who relied on these venues to make a living. That’s motivated her to look for solutions as she faces a long winter that brings a whole new round of questions.

Spaulding said she’s been in conversations with lenders, while also tapping into other government programs that help support her staff. She’s also looking into whether it would be worthwhile to launch streaming online concerts that would “put more money in the artists’ pockets” over the coming months.

“I’m going to personally go out on a limb to keep the venue going,” she said.

“We’re huge believers in live music.”",[]

As we begin to come together again with family and friends — with our community — we talk about the life we lived before the pandemic and look to the life we might live after.

Between Before and After lies what is possible. It’s a space to think, to reflect, to dream, to innovate. It is the space, perhaps, where there is a stillness, like that needed for prayer.

These are lessons captured by Inuit artist Elisapee Ishulutaq and her painting “Tusiarvik (A Place for Prayer)” — in which an understanding of what went before leads to innovation and creation.

“As an artist who participated in the founding of the print studio in Pangnirtung (in Nunavut), Ishulutaq is recognized as a pioneer of artmaking in her community and thus given the respect due an elder,” Christine Lalonde wrote of Ishulutaq, who died in 2018, in the catalogue “Builders.”

“Despite being the elder in the group, Ishulutaq emerged as the most capable and ready to experiment … New directions are not only taken up by emerging artists, they are pursued actively by elder artists whose technical experience allows them to adapt processes to new media with confidence and perhaps innovate further than their younger contemporaries,” wrote Lalonde, associate curator of Indigenous art at the National Gallery of Canada.

In “Vision, Space, Desire: Global Perspectives and Cultural Hybridity,” Indigenous artist and curator Jolene Rickard, quoted by Lalonde, notes that Indigenous artists “have densely packed cultural survival kits that transfer knowledge from one generation to the next, despite unremitting attempts at genocide, culturacide, and other forms of political and philosophical erasure. Native communities or nations have something the world needs to know about: the insight of continuity.”

Instead of forgetting the past, we must learn from it. Let us share our stories, our experiences; let the time we’ve spent become part of our collective knowledge. Then we can weave the past and present in a future that has learned its lessons.",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenzie For The Toronto Star']",2020-07-10,"“Not by bread alone.”

This biblical aphorism came to mind when my editors suggested that during these challenging times, I should concentrate on more affordable “cars for the masses.”

Ah, but who doesn’t enjoy a bit of candy now and then?

As Robert Browning said (aren’t we literary today?): “A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”

Hence, the Lamborghini Huracán EVO. Starts at $305,691 for the coupé, $336,258 for the Spyder.

With a boatload of options — the “Grigio Artis” (i.e., grey) paint alone was $22,400 — my tester came to $384,991.

EVO is distinguished from other Huracáns by improved active aerodynamics and more carbon fibre, in the largely aluminum tub, and throughout the interior. This and other “lightweighting” techniques carve off 40 kilograms.

It’s very fast.

It’s very loud.

Both thanks to the mid-mounted naturally-aspirated 5.2-litre V-10, with 640 horsepower at 8,000 r.p.m., and 443 lb.-ft. of torque at 6,500 r.p.m.

Climbing in requires a bit of agility, and it may take a while to find a comfy seating position.

The seats are a nice balance of grip and comfort. My right thigh got a bit stiff after a few hours; might have something to do with being pressed to the firewall...

New for Huracán is a central touchscreen. Their website claims “traditional buttons become dematerialized,” as if that’s something to be proud of. When you are rocketing off into hyperspace, the last thing you want is to be fiddling with a touchscreen trying to turn off the radio.

Then again, the car is so loud it’s difficult to hear the radio or your phone anyway. Better to focus on your driving.

This screen also picks up fingerprints more readily than most, and you can’t set it to “daytime” brightness when the headlights are on.

Which of course they always should be.

So, let’s drive.

Hint — best spend a bit of time in this car before trying anything too dramatic. The technology makes the car so forgiving that you can get in way over your head right quickly.

Because the laws of physics always apply.

Flip the aircraft-style switch cover, press the button, and the beast roars to life.

Pull back the gear-selector release, tap a steering wheel paddle shifter for the seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox — there is no shift lever as such — and off we go.

The Lamborghini Dinamica Veicolo Integrata (for the linguistically-challenged, that’s Integrated Vehicle Dynamics) system somehow anticipates the driver’s intentions and adjusts the front-to-rear four-wheel drive torque split, four-wheel steering, torque vectoring, and traction control systems to get you around corners faster than you’d think possible.

That said, I did get a bit of front-end plowing on a local roundabout at a fairly modest speed, probably because during my late-spring test drive, the car was still sporting winter tires, having just been shipped in from Alberta.

You can select from three drive modes — Strada (street), Sport (duh...), Corsa (race) — by a switch in the six-o’clock steering wheel spoke. This is altogether too handy; you can inadvertently hit it if you’re busy at the wheel.

These settings change all those performance parameters to suit, and there’s a more noticeable delta in these settings than usual in such systems.

The dashboard display also changes to supply information relevant to that mode.

Corsa is a bit frenetic for anything but the track. (My helmet is packed and ready to go at a moment’s notice, Lamborghini...).

What’s missing is a “custom” setting; personally, I’d choose Sport for everything, but back off the transmission downshift sensitivity a notch.

The ALA (Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, active Lamborghini aerodynamics) system opens and closes flaps at the front and rear to increase or decrease downforce as needed.

It can even open one side and close the other, to optimize the car’s handling in more-or-less real time.

One of the first controls you want/need to access in any Lamborghini is the front-end lift system. When exiting a garage or entering a gas station, pressing this switch lifts the front end by 40 mm to reduce the chances of scraping any of those expensive under-car bits.

Any Lamborghini guarantees a thrill-packed ride.

But the Huracán EVO might be my favourite from the stable of the fighting bull (Lamborghini’s traditional symbol).

While not as ultimately powerful as an Aventador, Huracán’s lighter weight makes it seem more agile, more accessible.

I’d probably opt for the Spyder. Hey — it’s a nice day as I type, and since I’m already dreaming...

Anybody speeding near a school should lose their licence, that’s how strongly I feel.

(Of course, typically Toronto, it’s all about the money. Never mind slowing down traffic so children don’t get hit by cars and killed. The city is more interested in what it can get out of wallets. But I digress.)

Parents tell their kids, as I told mine, look both ways before crossing the street. You never know. But kids are kids. Sometimes they get excited and forget (which is why we have crossing guards now).

So my daughter’s about seven, and home for lunch with me, and I kiss her as she leaves to go back to school and she runs across the lawn and right in front of a car on the road. Thank God the driver had seen her coming and was ready to stop, which he did. She burst into tears when she realized what had happened.

We tell our kids, when you are standing at a stop sign or a light, make eye contact with the driver so he sees you and then you can cross. I come driving along and I have to stop at a sign and a neighbour’s little girl is standing, kitty-corner, across the road in the subdivision where we live. She waits for me to come to a stop and she looks at me and then she steps off the curb and right into the path of a car coming along the through street.

She was so busy making eye contact with me that she forgot to look both ways. She might have been 10. There’s so much to remember when you’re just starting life. Again, the driver of the other car sensed potential disaster and had slowed down enough to stop. But it was close.

There is a school in my GTA neighbourhood. It fronts on a suburban street and backs onto a busy commuter road. There are flashing yellow lights on the busy road with a 40 km/h limit, 20 fewer than normal which most people ignore anyway. The police aren’t there with radar often and when they are, they stick out like a sore thumb. When they aren’t, it’s the Indianapolis 500. Some people slow down, but not many. We need a camera.

Childhood is a dangerous time. I’m sure we can all think of close calls we had when we were little. I can think of a couple of instances when one false move would have meant you wouldn’t be reading this. My palms can actually start to sweat when I think of one in particular.

But most of us get through it, somehow. Others aren’t so lucky.

In 1962, I was a cub reporter on my first newspaper. I’m not going to name the town, except to say it’s in Ontario. I’m doing this because this story is upsetting and there might be people around who would remember it.

A 17-year-old kid parked his car, a 1957 Chevrolet with an automatic transmission, across the street from the high school, which was at the top of a steep hill. He didn’t put on his emergency brake and he didn’t turn his wheels toward the curb, which is stuff you learn in driving school, although in those days his driving school was probably his dad.

When the driver’s side door didn’t close the first time, he hauled off and slammed it shut and that caused the stem-mounted gear lever to pop out of park and snap over to drive. The car started to roll down the hill with the kid, who was walking across the street to the high school when it started to move, running to catch it and yelling for anyone around to watch out.

A 12-year-old girl was walking along a cross street at the bottom of the hill. It is a beautiful sunny morning and it is Friday and the weekend is coming and she doesn’t have a care in the world. And she freezes when she sees this car coming and a guy running behind it, yelling.

In her panic, she then starts running and runs into the path of the car and she dies when it crushes her against the porch of a house on the corner. It is an absolutely awful scene.

One thing stood out: you’ve heard of superhuman strength? It exists. In a life-and-death emergency, with their adrenalin pumping like crazy, two 10-year-old little boys who were walking behind the girl pushed that huge car off her in an attempt to help her.

As you can imagine, the 17-year-old boy whose carelessness started all this was beside himself.

How do I know? I arrived on the scene about 10 minutes after it happened. It was the police photographer’s day off and I was a two-way newspaperman — a reporter who took photographs — so they asked me to take the pictures for the anticipated inquest: the girl under a blanket in front of the house, the gearshift in drive, and so on. In return for the favour, they told me everything.

I was very upset, as was everybody. To this day, I equate schools with children and disaster and I have no patience for drivers of cars who ignore signs telling them to slow down because there are children around.

And a monetary fine mailed to their house is not good enough. Not even close. If it was up to me, and the sign said 40 km/h and they were caught going 45 or faster, they wouldn’t get a letter. A police officer would go to their house and arrest them.",[]

Hall wrote that McKellar and “other city planning experts” say we need a “more accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists, and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic.”

Nice turn of phrase.

I would like to invite Messrs Hall, McKellar, and any “other city planning experts” to join me exactly six months from the date that story appeared — that would be Jan. 29, 2021 — on Yonge Street at York Mills Road, so I can watch them ride their bicycles north to Sheppard Avenue.

That’s only a 40-metre climb.

No problem.

If that’s too much, let’s move a bit further south, to the Summerhill subway station, so they can pedal up to St. Clair Avenue.

That’s a mere 23 metres of altitude adjustment.

Piece of cake.

Hope they can fight their way through the hordes of other cyclists who will be enjoying the ride in temperatures which historically have been between a balmy 3 C,to a more cycling-friendly minus-4.

Wouldn’t want to get too overheated, now would we?

Oh yeah, watch out for the snowplows and snow drifts.

Or how about Pottery Road, running between Broadview and the Bayview Extension?

Cool.

Heading west?

We did a shoot a couple of years ago for TSN’s “Motoring TV.”

It was a perfect midsummer Saturday afternoon.

Myself and the cameraman did the entire bit walking in the bike lane on Bay Street, just south of Bloor.

The bit took about two minutes.

During which, we encountered a grand total of — wait for it — zero bicycles.

None.

Lots of pedestrians on the sidewalk.

Lots of vehicles in the street.

Not a single bicycle in the bike lane.

They weren’t just being “Toronto-polite” and giving us room to do our shoot.

They simply weren’t there.

If they aren’t going to be there on a perfect summer weekend day, when are they going to be there?

Where do those people live? And where do they work? How can they commute by bicycle?

Maybe they’re lucky, like I used to be.

Back in the day, I was a professor at Ryerson. We lived in Leaside. When I taught summer school classes, I sometimes rode my Raleigh to work, cutting through Rosedale on Glen Road, which bypassed many of the area’s hills.

But like many people with young families, we couldn’t afford a house big enough for our growing brood in Leaside. So we moved to the boonies, north of Milton.

Fortunately, I was an “early-adopter” of the “work where you live” mantra. My job means I can write in my home, and electronically send my stories to the Star.

Yep. I pretty much invented the concept of “telecommuter.”

Most of us aren’t so lucky.

Most of us live “here,” and work “there.”

So it’s either transit, commuter train, or the private automobile.

The 401 is the city’s “main street” any way you look at it. It carries hundreds of thousands of vehicles every single work day.

At times it’s the busiest highway in all of North America.

Riding a bicycle is illegal on the 401.

And riding a bicycle to work is simply not an option for the vast majority of Torontonians.

In July, never mind January.

I have heard city planners praise Copenhagen, Denmark, for its bike-friendly infrastructure.

I’ve been there.

It is beautiful.

It is compact.

It is also flat.

Toronto is not and never will be Copenhagen.

Our city planners better get used to it.",[]

Read', 'Josh Rubinbusiness Reporter', 'Business Reporter']",2020-07-08,"In 43 years of business, the Rose and Crown pub never had a patio — until a few weeks ago.

For co-owner Johnny Rafferty, the new line of tables on the sidewalk in front of the Yonge and Eglinton institution has been a godsend after months of struggling to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It’s been great. If we didn’t have this, we probably wouldn’t have been able to stay open past July 1,” said Rafferty of the temporary patio, made possible thanks to the City of Toronto’s CafeTO program designed to help restaurants struggling during the pandemic.

Like all restaurants and bars in town, the Rose and Crown’s dining room has been closed since mid-March. After blanketing the neighbourhood with flyers, Rafferty was discouraged when only a handful of takeout orders came in. With a three-week-old son — with his wife and pub co-owner Lisa Duff — there was even more incentive to make things work.

“We’ve been doing every single thing we can to stay alive. We’ve postered the neighbourhood with our menus. We’ve done social media. This patio is the first thing that’s made a real difference. It’s so nice to see some of our regulars again,” said Rafferty, adding that it’s been a happy, laid-back atmosphere.

No one, he said, has been complaining about having to wear a mask to go inside and use the bathroom or pay their tab. “People are just happy to be out.”

While the program has been a hit for those able to open up a new patio, it’s been frustratingly slow and bureaucratic for others. Want your temporary patio to go on private property rather than a public sidewalk? The city’s not even considering those applications until July 13, more than a month after the June 4 announcement of the program. Want to put your patio in a curbside or bike lane? Your application might be caught in a backlog, waiting for a site inspection from city staff.

There have also been conflicting messages from city staff, says Celina Blanchard, owner of west-end favourite Lambretta Pizzeria.

“The first inspector came out and said ‘OK, you’ll be able to put a couple of tables out front. Then we got an email saying ‘you can’t get put out tables until your patio is approved.’ Then we got another email saying ‘go ahead and put the tables out,’” said Blanchard, hoping to set up a patio in a curbside lane on Roncesvalles Ave.

“The last I heard from them was Monday. They said they were backlogged and I needed to wait more,” said Blanchard, who set up two tables in front of her restaurant while she’s awaiting the curbside lane. Meanwhile, her takeout business has slowed dramatically since Toronto entered Stage 2 and existing patios opened up.

“People want to go out, after having been cooped up for so long. I can’t blame them,” said Blanchard, who nonetheless has been gratified to see her customers again. “Everyone’s been so positive and supportive. It’s been amazing.”

At the Granite Brewery, the brewpub’s existing front and back patios have been busy since Toronto joined Stage 2. Owner Ron Keefe had hoped one of them would be a lot bigger by now, extending into the space in front of two businesses which closed permanently during the pandemic.

“As soon as I got to the part of the form where you had to check off ‘public or private,’ it was ‘nope, we’re not even gonna look at this for a while,’ I kind of wrote it off at that point,” said Keefe, who’s hopeful bylaw changes for patio extensions on private property will be approved, as expected, by the city’s planning department July 13.

Julie Kwiecinski, Ontario regional director for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, says the City of Toronto’s high hopes for the program haven’t been met with action on the ground: “It’s a well-intentioned program. But it needs to move a lot faster. Summer’s disappearing quickly, and no one’s going to be sitting on a patio in November.”

City spokesperson Jasmine Patrick defended Toronto’s performance, saying that staff from three different departments — Municipal Licensing and Standards, Transportation, and Economic Development — have been “working around the clock” to get new patios up and running. Patrick added there are no cookie-cutter solutions for different types of spaces; a few tables on a sidewalk is one thing, shutting down part of a road is another.

“Every location has specific and sometimes complex considerations, especially related to meeting important accessibility and safety requirements,” said Patrick, adding that the city has received 774 applications as of Tuesday. So far, 97 sidewalk patios have been approved, along with 28 curb-lane closures, she said.",[]

But this week Boohoo became the newest face of worker exploitation after revelations about conditions in the factories where subcontractors make its clothes.

Started by Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane in 2006, Boohoo was a pioneer of the ultra-fast-fashion retail phenomenon, geared toward young women and powered by social commerce, offering cheap fashion products designed to be browsed, bought and worn on social media.

Worth more than big names like Marks & Spencer and Asos combined, the company’s brands include Nasty Gal, PrettyLittleThing, MissPap and BoohooMAN, among others.

Kamani, 55, is a billionaire and Britain’s new king of cheap fashion, after the downfall of Topshop’s Philip Green. A one-time garment supplier to market traders and later a fashion wholesaler, Kamani spotted opportunity in selling cheap clothes online and without a middleman, setting up shop with Kane, who started out as a designer, in Manchester.

Press shy, he is the group executive chairman of the Boohoo Group, while Kane is creative director. The company rarely responds to requests for interviews from the news media.

Kamani’s son Umar, 32, is less low-key and also a key figure at the group. Alongside his brothers Adam, 31, and Samir, 24, he founded PrettyLittleThing in 2012, targeted to young millennials, with designs frequently worn by pop bands like Little Mix.

The Boohoo Group bought a 34 per cent stake in PLT for 269.8 million pounds ($462.7 million Canadian) in May from Umar, and it is seen as the jewel in the company crown. Society magazine Tatler named Umar its eighth most eligible bachelor for 2019, and he is frequently pictured on social media hobnobbing with the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Megan Thee Stallion and Kylie Jenner. He has almost 800,000 followers on Instagram.

Adam Kamani is now in the property business. Samir Kamani is the boss of BoohooMAN.

Ultra-fast-fashion players like Boohoo and Fashion Nova have emerged from, and adapted to, fashion trends driven primarily by social media. They have few or no bricks-and-mortar stores. And they cater to the Instagram and TikTok generation that wants to buy today what their favourite celebrity or influencer wore yesterday and will post about their new purchases online.

Fulfilling these shoppers’ relentless demands for new products as quickly as possible means working with factories close to home, which is why Fashion Nova sources a significant proportion of its collections from Los Angeles, and Boohoo from Leicester, England.

More established fast-fashion retailers like Zara and H&M tend to source from developing markets and came under increasing public pressure to investigate, police and invest in the factories that make their products after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013.

But newer, ultra-fast-fashion retailers have encountered a little less scrutiny thanks to a younger customer base and keeping discussion of their business practices out of the limelight.

They introduce new trends every week and are just as likely to be influenced by the clothes from a reality TV show as the clothes from the runways of New York or Paris. Prices can be even lower than fast fashion or the high street, with $5 bikinis and $15 dresses, and come with next-day delivery. Often, they will be discarded after a single wear.

It is a slick business model that has made ultra-fast-fashion retailers a force to be reckoned with even in a pandemic. Boohoo sales grew by 45 per cent to 367.8 million pounds in the period of March through May compared with last year, according to the company. Boohoo also recently bought up a number of British high street stalwarts that were on the brink of bankruptcy, including Warehouse and Karen Millen.

In June, the company board approved a package that would pay up to 150 million pounds to the company’s founders and to Kamani’s son Samir Kamani, of BoohooMAN, if they could increase Boohoo’s value by two-thirds in three years.

On Sunday, the British newspaper The Sunday Times published an undercover investigation that said workers in a factory in Leicester that supplied Boohoo were being paid as little as 3.50 pounds an hour. (The national living wage in Britain for ages 25 and above is 8.72 pounds.) The article also said that workers were working without proper equipment to protect against the coronavirus.

The Sunday Times article came several days after a report published by Labor Behind the Label, a garment worker campaign group, that said that multiple garment factories in Leicester, including other Boohoo suppliers, “were putting workers at risk of infection,” with little or no social distancing or personal protective equipment requirements and low pay during lockdown.

Leicester was the first place in Britain to have local restrictions enforced last week to tackle a surge in coronavirus cases, which may be linked to working conditions in its factories that supply fast-fashion retailers.

The town, which has a large South Asian immigrant population, has long been a centre for clothes manufacturing. Its dark factories have been described as an “open secret,” well known in both the industry and government, and were documented in a Financial Times investigation published in 2018.

Boohoo told the Sunday Times that it was investigating the claims and that the factory in the story was not a direct supplier. It also said that it would terminate its relationship with any suppliers that were found in breach of its code of conduct.

On Wednesday, the company published a further statement on its website, saying it would begin an independent review of its British supply chain, invest $12.5 million in “eradicating malpractice” in any supplier factories and step up its use of third-party auditors.

“As a board, we are shocked and appalled by the recent allegations that have been made and we are committed to doing everything in our power to rebuild the reputation of the textile manufacturing industry in Leicester,” the Boohoo statement said.

The company said it would report on its supply chain review in September, when it publishes its half-year results, with further updates in January 2021.

Asked for comment by The New York Times, Boohoo did not supply any additional information and referred a reporter to the statement on its website.

Reaction

Between the infections spike in Leicester and the fact that the allegations involved British factories, the impact of the week’s revelations about Boohoo has been considerably larger than most fashion supply chain investigations. The increase in infections and the new information have prompted both a government response and volatility in the stock market.

Priti Patel, Britain’s home secretary, described the allegations as “truly appalling” and asked the National Crime Agency to investigate “modern slavery” in Leicester’s clothing factories.

This week Boohoo’s market value plunged by more than 1.5 billion pounds in two days. Boohoo is now worth a third less than it was last Friday afternoon, before the supply chain allegations wiped more than 1.5 billion pounds off its stock market value. Some retailers, including Next, Zalando and Amazon, say they plan to pull Boohoo clothing from their sites.

There was a considerable reaction on social media, led by several influencers who had formerly been faces of Boohoo brands. The company has 12 million Instagram followers and spent more than 90 million pounds on marketing last year.

In an Instagram post, Vas J Morgan, a former collaborator, said: “Slavery is slavery and my heart hurts for the families that have suffered at the hands of companies that fail to do due diligence like this. Companies that make billions off the back of hardworking people trying to feed their family.”",[]

The two banks confirmed they plan to sign the BlackNorth Initiative CEO pledge, the brainchild of a group led by Wes Hall, a prominent Black executive who founded Toronto-based Kingsdale Advisors. Signatories to the pledge agree to hit the 3.5 per cent target within five years and other measures, such as hiring at least five per cent of their student workforce from the Black community.

Another company in the S&P/TSX 60 Index, Rogers Communications Inc., told Bloomberg it will commit to the 3.5 per cent target. Enbridge Inc. said chief executive officer Al Monaco plans to attend the BlackNorth virtual summit on July 20, but clarified the company has yet to make a final decision on the pledge. Only companies that have signed the pledge are eligible to participate in the event, according to BlackNorth.

Several other firms, including Royal Bank of Canada and Sun Life Financial Inc., said they are still reviewing the BlackNorth pledge.

Royal Bank said earlier this week it’s instituting a policy of filling 30 per cent of open executive positions with Black, Indigenous and other people of colour.

The most recent census found that Black people made up 3.5 per cent of the population in Canada, where the killing of George Floyd has led to street protests and stirred debate about whether the country is as inclusive as many of its citizens think it is.

At Canada’s six largest banks and two largest life insurance companies, about 10 per cent of top executive roles and eight per cent of non-executive board positions are held by visible minorities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But only one of the 188 senior positions at those eight companies is occupied by someone who’s Black — a CIBC director who lives in Chicago.

“A lot of these companies are going to lose great talent if they do not act, because quite frankly they need those people who are stuck in middle management,” Hall said in an interview with Bloomberg last month. “Once they start leaving in droves it’s going to create a huge void in the company that you just can’t ignore any more.”

The new organization leading the initiative is known as the Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism. In addition to Hall, the coalition is backed by CIBC chief executive officer Victor Dodig, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. CEO Prem Watsa, and Rola Dagher, president and CEO of Cisco Systems Canada.

Read', 'David Friendthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'David Friendthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"TORONTO - A plan to operate NHL game hubs in Edmonton and Toronto could draw hundreds of hockey players and staff to both Canadian cities, but business experts say their presence won’t give a huge boost to local economies.

While hundreds of people could be employed in positions relating to the games and hubs — such as security jobs, rink staff, food services and hotel housekeeping — the financial benefit of two bubble communities under tight seal would be “modest” at best, suggested Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.

“When you think of how many tourists would normally be in Toronto during peak tourist season, I’m quite sure this is less than one per cent,” he said.

“The reality is, it’s not going to move the needle.”

But Porter, a lifelong hockey fan, said he anticipates a “reasonably meaningful positive” morale boost to Canadian sports fans who’ve been eagerly anticipating players returning to the ice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The games are slated to start Aug. 1 with six Canadian teams qualifying for the 24-team resumption of play. No fans will be in the seats.

Edmonton and Toronto were confirmed as the NHL’s hub cities on Friday night.

“The fact that part of our world is getting back to some kind of normal will help reinforce the sense that things, generally, are moving in that direction and could help support the recovery,” Porter said.

The gradual comeback of major sporting events has drawn plenty of interest in recent weeks, with debates raging over the risks of putting players back into the games, even if spectators aren’t allowed in the facilities.

Further questions have been raised over whether rigorous testing is enough to prevent outbreaks within the isolated community, which could potentially throw the whole plan into a costly disarray.

Many of these factors make placing a value on hockey’s return especially difficult.

Michael Naraine, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said the largest amount of money is on the line at large corporations, which he said is driving the return of major sporting events.

“The primary revenue driver for sports is broadcasting,” said the assistant professor of digital sport management and marketing.

“They need television advertisers come back. The league itself needs to gain its revenue from NBC and Sportsnet here in Canada.”

Politicians have preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of a deal with the NHL.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney eagerly promoted Edmonton as the ultimate hub city for the hockey league, posting videos on Twitter that prominently featured the Rocky Mountains and other popular destinations in the province.

Naraine said those public expressions by leaders are more an attempt to “pander” to their constituents than actually drive any meaningful economic impact. He said this is especially the case in Edmonton.

“Having major events come to town allows them to beat their chests and say, ‘We exist. We’re on the map. Come look at us,’” he said.

“But the fact that the hub city will be in Edmonton is no different than whether the hub city would be in Toronto or Vancouver or elsewhere. It’s not going to significantly drive tourism all of a sudden.”

Patrick Rishe, a sports professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said he sees value in showcasing a lesser known Canadian city on broadcast television with “beauty shots” of the locale. He said it may also sit well with NHL executives.

“You never know,” he said. “Doing and serving a good deed for the league now, this could pay dividends down the road.”

Any semblance of a regular hockey season would be welcomed by Dana Parris, owner of the Lockeroom sports bar in Barrie, Ont.

Even though her business is over 100 kilometres away from downtown Toronto, she anticipates the excitement would reverberate to her customers.

“If we could have sports come back and we hit Stage 3 (of Ontario’s COVID reopening plan) around the same time, I will probably stop crying myself to sleep,” she said.

“If those two come together it’s just going to be the most beautiful thing.”

Read', 'Tom Maloneybloomberg', 'Tom Maloneybloombergsat.']",2020-07-11,"Elon Musk is now richer than Warren Buffett.

The fortune of Tesla Inc.’s chief executive officer rose by $6.1 billion (U.S.) on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after the carmaker’s stock surged 11 per cent. Musk is now the world’s seventh-richest person, also ahead of tech titans Larry Ellison and Sergey Brin.

The 49-year-old owns about a fifth of Tesla’s outstanding stock, which comprises the bulk of his $70.5 billion fortune. His majority ownership of closely held SpaceX accounts for about $15 billion.

Shares of the electric-car maker have risen 269 per cent this year. The company’s booming valuation helped Musk land a $595 million payday, making him the highest-paid CEO in the U.S.

Musk is the latest tech entrepreneur to rise above Buffett in the ranks of the world’s richest. Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft Corp. CEO, and Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Brin also have leapfrogged the Oracle of Omaha. And Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani surpassed Buffett this week.

Mike Novogratz, the longtime money manager who now runs digital currency investor Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., warned that valuations of technology companies are getting way too high and that small investors should get out of the market before it crashes.

“We are in irrational exuberance — this is a bubble,” he said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The economy is grinding, slowing down, we’re lurching in and out of COVID, yet the tech market makes new highs every day. That’s a classic speculative bubble.”

Surpassing Buffett may be especially sweet for Musk. In an interview in May, he told comedian Joe Rogan that he wasn’t “the biggest fan” of his fellow billionaire. “He’s trying to find out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean that’s kind of a boring job, if you ask me,” Musk said.

Buffett has also criticized Musk, saying last year that although Musk was “a remarkable guy,” he had “room for improvement” in behaving like a CEO, singling out his tweeting habits.

Buffett’s fortune dropped earlier this week when he donated $2.9 billion to charity. The 89-year-old has given away more than $37 billion of Berkshire Hathaway shares since 2006. The company’s stock performance has also underwhelmed recently.

Amazon had told employees to delete the popular video app TikTok from phones on which they use Amazon email, citing security risks from the China-owned app. That would have escalated the stakes for TikTok, which has been subject to national-security and geopolitical concerns. Amazon is the second-largest U.S. private employer after Walmart, with more than 840,000 employees worldwide. TikTok had said it did not understand Amazon’s concerns.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

Amazon has told employees to delete the popular video app TikTok from phones on which they use Amazon email, citing “security risks” from the China-owned app.

“The TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email,” the notice read, which was sent Friday around midday Eastern time, according to an employee who is not authorized to speak publicly. To retain mobile access to Amazon email, employees must delete the TikTok app by the end of the day.

Amazon workers are still allowed to use TikTok via a browser on a company-issued laptop.

Amazon is the second-largest U.S. private employer after Walmart, with more than 840,000 employees worldwide. Amazon did not reply to requests for comment.

In an emailed statement, TikTok said that Amazon did not notify it before sending the email. “We still do not understand their concerns,” it continued, adding that the company would welcome a dialogue to address Amazon’s issues.

Chinese internet giant ByteDance owns TikTok, which is designed for users outside of China, as well as a Chinese version called Douyin. Like YouTube, TikTok relies on its users for the videos that populate its app. It has a reputation for fun, goofy videos and is popular with young people, including millions of American users. But it has racked up concerns ranging from censorship of videos, including those critical of the Chinese government, the threat of sharing user data with Chinese officials to violating kids’ privacy.

TikTok has been trying to appease critics in the U.S. and distance itself from its Chinese roots, but finds itself caught in an increasingly sticky geopolitical web.

It recently named a new CEO, former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, which experts said could help it navigate U.S. regulators. And it is stopping operations in Hong Kong because of a new Chinese national security law that led Facebook, Google and Twitter to also stop providing user data to Hong Kong authorities.

But a top Trump administration official said this week that the government remains concerned about the national-security threat to the app’s millions of U.S. users. When Fox News TV host Laura Ingraham suggested that the U.S. ban Chinese social media apps, “especially TikTok,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “We’re certainly looking at it.”

Pompeo said the Trump administration has “worked on this very issue for a long time,” including its stance against Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE. The government has tried to convince allies to root Huawei out of telecom networks, saying the company is a national-security threat, with mixed success; Trump has also said he was willing to use Huawei as a bargaining chip in trade talks. Huawei has denied that it enables spying for the Chinese government.

“With respect to Chinese apps on people’s cellphones, I can assure you the United States will get this one right too,” Pompeo said, and added that if users downloaded the app their private information would be “in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”

A U.S. national-security agency has been reviewing ByteDance’s purchase of TikTok’s precursor, Musical.ly, while U.S. military branches banned the app from government-issued phones. Meanwhile, privacy groups say TikTok has been violating children’s privacy, even after the Federal Trade Commission fined the company in 2019 for collecting personal information from children without their parents’ consent.

Amazon is likely concerned about a Chinese-owned app’s access to employee data, said Susan Ariel Aaronson, a professor at George Washington University and a data governance and national-security expert. China, according to the U.S. government, regularly steals U.S. intellectual property.

Part of Amazon’s motivation with the ban may also be political, Aaronson said, since Amazon “doesn’t want to alienate the Trump administration.”

Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, are frequent targets of President Donald Trump. Bezos personally owns the Washington Post, which Trump has referred to as “fake news” whenever it publishes unfavourable stories about him. Last year, Amazon sued the U.S. government, saying that Trump’s “personal vendetta” against Amazon, Bezos and the Post, led it to lose a $10 billion (U.S.) cloud computing contract with the Pentagon to rival Microsoft. Meanwhile, federal regulators as well as Congress are pursuing antitrust investigations at Amazon as well as other tech giants.

TikTok has content-moderation policies, like any social network, but says its moderation team for the U.S. is led out of California and it doesn’t censor videos based on topics sensitive to China and would not, even if the Chinese government asked it to. As for sharing U.S. user data with the Chinese government, the company says it stores U.S. user data in the U.S. and Singapore, not China; that its data centres are outside of China; and it would not give the government access to U.S. user data even if asked.

Concerns about China are not limited to the U.S. India this month banned dozens of Chinese apps, including TikTok, because of tensions between the countries. India cited privacy concerns that threatened India’s sovereignty and security for the ban. India is one of TikTok’s largest markets and had previously briefly banned the app in 2019 because of worries about children and sexual content.

Amazon’s move on TikTok may foretell actions by other companies. “If we are concerned about TikTok, we should be concerned about thousands of other apps that collect, sell, and give access to our location data, contacts, and photos on our phones,” said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, in an email. “I would also expect other companies to take a closer look as to what apps are allowed on their employees’ phones.”

Joseph Pisani contributed to this report.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-11,"It is not America’s problem alone that it cannot seem to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

It’s Canada’s problem, too.

The range of potential harms to Canada include supply-chain disruptions and renewed American protectionist sanctions against Canadian industry.

That’s in addition to the hammer-blow the prolonged pandemic has already dealt to Canada’s vast tourism, hospitality and conventions sector, deprived of U.S. business and vacation travellers.

Americans getting sicker instead of healthier — opposite to what their northern neighbours have achieved — has so far not significantly diminished the roughly $1 billion in daily trade between the two countries.

But that changes if the “rocket-ship” economic recovery that U.S. President Donald Trump promised Americans last month fails to materialize, with U.S. elections just four months away.

A promising U.S. economic rebound from mid-April into June has stopped far short of full recovery. And some sectors, notably retail, are back in decline.

Fear of infection is keeping Americans out of stores that have reopened after lockdown. So is the lack of a second round of U.S. pandemic relief cheques, in sharp contrast to the continued flow of federal income supports in Canada and the European Union (EU).

Weakness in U.S. consumer sentiment will eventually inflict damage on Canadian online retail and business-to-business sales in the U.S. market. It will also harm Canadian firms doing business directly in the U.S., including Canadian banks, insurers, retailers and property developers.

If the stall-out in the U.S. economic recovery continues into the fall, the economic pain for Canada will spread from tourism and retailing into the Canadian manufacturing, resource and agricultural sectors.

Americans buy Western Canadian livestock, B.C. timber and almost every drop of Alberta oil. Demand and prices for each have already been weakened by the pandemic.

Economic conditions in both the U.S. and Canada are deeply worrisome.

The U.S. jobless rate in June was 11.1 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent just before the pandemic, and not far shy of the peak 11.9 per cent during the Great Recession of 2008-2010.

The Canadian jobless rate peaked at about 14 per cent in the second quarter, Bill Morneau, the federal finance minister, said this week. It is expected to fall back to pre-pandemic levels of about seven per cent by the end of next year.

The U.S. economy is forecast to shrink by about six per cent this year. Canada’s economy will shrink by 6.8 per cent, by the feds’ reckoning, before rebounding by about 5.5 per cent in 2021.

But Ottawa’s projections for a robust economic recovery are pinned on a strong U.S. rebound. A Canadian export-driven economy tied to the U.S. market will, of course, fail to reach those recovery targets if the U.S. pandemic continues to drain America of economic vigour.

In contrast to the pandemic progress made by many major economies, the U.S. continues to report record numbers of new COVID-19 cases.

Last month, Canada’s rolling seven-day average of daily new cases fell by 75 per cent.

In the U.S., it rose by 37 per cent, reaching all-time highs of 50,000 or more new daily cases this week. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel-laureate economist, pointed out last week, Arizona, population seven million, has been reporting more new daily cases than the entire EU, population 446 million.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infection-disease expert, warned this week that, at the current rate of growth in new U.S. cases, America could be reporting upward of 100,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that for every reported case of COVID-19, there probably are at least another 10 that have gone unreported. The U.S. already leads the world in reported COVID-19 cases and fatalities.

While many countries are preparing for an expected second wave of the virus, “We are still knee-deep in the first wave,” Fauci said.

It is troubling for Canada’s economic prospects that the Trump administration is in denial about America’s failed response to the pandemic.

White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said this week that “The world is looking at us as a leader in COVID-19.” Trump himself said this week that COVID-19 will “sort of just disappear.”

That isn’t the view in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, where COVID-19 appears to be raging out of control and hospitals are close to overcapacity with COVID-19 cases.

As to world opinion, a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations found that just two per cent of European respondents believe the U.S. has been “helpful” in the fight against COVID-19.

Given the resourcefulness of Americans, one has to believe conditions will improve, just as especially hard-hit jurisdictions including South Korea, Germany and New York City were able to stop the spread.

But for now, Canada needs to brace for potential disruptions in U.S. supply chains.

For example, Canadian grocers should be looking now for alternatives to California and Florida in citrus supplies. These are largely harvested in those U.S. states by migrant labour more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population. Otherwise, Canadians might be hit this winter with higher prices for oranges and other citrus products, and the economy will suffer a rise in food-related inflation.

We also need to brace for a new round of Trump protectionism. With his re-election prospects gloomy, Trump has returned to launching trade disputes. Their purpose is to deflect attention from the pandemic and to show concern about a faltering economy.

That too is a worry for Canada.

Coming into 2020, there was some hope among Canadian lumber producers and the U.S. homebuilders they supply that America’s long-standing punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber might finally be lifted.

Instead, the pandemic and Trump’s renewed protectionism have turned softwood lumber talks into dead letter. And the White House is musing about a renewed tariff assault on Canadian aluminum imports.

Canada is hardly the only target of Trump’s resurgent protectionism. His latest “America First” trade sanctions are also aimed at the EU as a whole, EU member Germany in particular, and Vietnam and other U.S. allies. All that against the backdrop of Trump’s trade war with China.

Even before the pandemic, U.S. trade disputes, since ramped up, were depressing global GDP growth.

“If the U.S. cannot get a handle on the virus, and if its leadership chooses a protectionist route to economic recovery, Canada’s return to normalcy will be that much harder,” Philippe Lagassé and Srdjan Vucetic, international affairs professors at Carleton University and the University of Ottawa, respectively, wrote recently.

If only a get-well card to America signed by Canadians would make a difference.

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Presssat.']",2020-07-11,"OTTAWA - The Trudeau Liberals’ fiscal update this week put a cost to all the emergency COVID-19 aid the federal treasury will dole out. It delivered some shocks: a gigantic deficit and a projection that the federal debt will top $1 trillion.

What is causing the federal deficit to hit $343.2 billion?

Late last year, the government forecast this year’s deficit at $28.1 billion. But the federal government is staring at a rapid drop in revenues due to the economic lockdown slashing the taxes people and businesses pay: that alone adds $81.3 billion to the deficit. Spending spiked by $236 billion for measures such as the $500-a-week emergency benefit for people whose work vaporized.

Combined, that borrowing will push the federal debt past $1 trillion by the end of the fiscal year.

Former parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page, in a post on Finances of the Nation, a website run by researchers and tax professionals, summed up what all that debt will mean for the government. He said future generations will pay for it through a mix of higher debt interest payments or taxes, “less fiscal room to address the next pandemic crisis or climate change,” or “less generous government programs.”

What’s the interest like on that debt? Can we afford it?

“Ironically, it’s not as hard as you think, thanks to record-low interest rates,” said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Dominion Lending Centres, a big mortgage company.

The government can borrow money for five years at less than 0.6 per cent interest, for 10 years at just slightly higher, and for 30 years at a touch over one per cent, she said, which makes the cost of carrying the debt less today than it was one year ago.

“It’s even less of a problem because the Bank of Canada is buying so much of it,” Cooper said of federal debt, referring to the $5 billion in federal bond purchases the bank is making weekly as a form of low-cost loans.

“So you have a buyer of last resort which will keep a lid on interest rates at least for the next year.”

The government calculates lower rates will save it $4 billion on debt charges this year. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday the government is going to increase its issuing of long-term bonds to 26 per cent from 14 per cent of offerings to capitalize on rates and help manage the debt.

Rates are eventually going to go up, though, and when they do, so will the amount taxpayers shell out on interest.

Are taxes going to have to go up?

Morneau rejected that idea for now, saying hiking taxes would cause more financial hardship. The New Democrats have asked for a wealth tax on the top one per cent, which the parliamentary budget officer calculated this week could net $5.6 billion.

Cooper said raising taxes while the economy is still recovering wouldn’t be wise because it would make Canada less competitive, which would make it more difficult to raise the necessary revenues to pay off the debt. That leaves another option, she said: Grow our way out of it.

How does that work?

The idea is as the economy grows, there will be more workers and companies paying taxes. The same debt, in raw dollars, is less of a burden on a bigger, more prosperous economy. The Liberals have favoured the “debt-to-GDP ratio” as a measure of the government’s fiscal health for exactly this reason.

In their fiscal snapshot, they predict that ratio will shoot up from 31 per cent last year to 49 per cent this year. Though that’s a big increase, the ratio peaked at just under 70 per cent in the mid-1990s.

To help growth along, government will need to spend on things like high-speed internet, Cooper said, or growing sectors like clean energy. Experts also note a need for greater government spending on child care to help mothers whose job losses have been greater, and returns to work slower, than fathers’ during the pandemic.

Even a best-case growth scenario may not be enough to keep the debt sustainable, said Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at Scotiabank, saying more “decisive action” is needed.

“If we don’t keep spending and we don’t get hit again like a depression type of growth scenario, then in theory we can grow out it, but that shouldn’t be enough,” she said.

What other actions could the government take?

Cutting spending is where most eyes will go, and Morneau promised another update or budget come the fall. Research suggests cutting spending, rather than raising taxes, is better at aiding growth out of a recession. It’s also less politically problematic than raising taxes, Young noted.

Tightening purse-strings too early could hamstring the Bank of Canada into keeping rates lower for longer, Young said, which would limit its ability to respond to whatever crisis comes next.

If spending is brought under control relatively soon, the debt should be sustainable, RBC chief economist Craig Wright and economist Colin Guldimann wrote in a report this week. If not, “the red ink could keep flowing,” highlighting the need for careful moves in the coming months.

The impact to our economies, livelihoods and collective well-being cannot be understated as we have seen the effects a global event can have on our local communities.

This interconnectedness reinforces the need for us to move forward, together, with a common goal. The pandemic can be a learning moment for us all.

While we were unprepared for a global crisis of this scale, there is another crisis we know is happening — climate change.

As we rebuild from the pandemic, we must do so in a way that takes climate change into consideration and builds on the progress we have made to achieve our global emission-reduction goals.

We have an opportunity to set ourselves on track towards a sustainable future for all.

But this future cannot be achieved without critically reflecting on how we live, work and play. More than 80 per cent of Canadians live in cities, and around the world cities account for 70 per cent of carbon emissions. Our ability to achieve a low-carbon economy rests on our ability to drastically reduce the impact our cities have on the environment. Rebuilding our post-pandemic world and making our cities smarter and more sustainable is an important first step.

The concept of a smart city — one that leverages technology to gather data that can be used to improve operations, efficiency and the overall experience for citizens — is not a new concept. But it has yet to be realized in a meaningful way across Canada. While individual cities have started to embrace smaller scale projects, collaboration between cities and across the country to create a connected smart city ecosystem will drive even greater impact on emission reductions.

To get there, we need to transform two major components of a smart city: the buildings that make up the city, and the infrastructure that supports, connects and powers it all. The digital transformation of buildings leads to increased efficiency and connected technology allows building managers to make intelligent decisions on energy consumption and optimize the buildings’ assets in real time.

Beyond making our buildings more energy efficient, the pandemic has caused a rethink in how we use these buildings. Smart, sustainable practices can, and should, be a part of redefining these spaces.

Office buildings are one clear example. While return to office efforts are underway, how we utilize buildings will be different, with remote working becoming a bigger part of the new work environment. Business owners and building managers must evaluate how to best use the space moving forward. Will they transform into multi-purpose spaces as companies look to consolidate real estate? Will there be an increasing need to understand when and how spaces are being used, to keep occupants safe? Smart technologies can provide clarity into many of these unknowns as we plan for post-pandemic building usage.

Industry reports cite that a smart building with integrated systems can see 30—50 per cent in energy savings. While these results are significant on their own, they become exponentially greater when you have large-scale adoption in buildings across a city.

Smart buildings play an important role in a low-carbon future. But our infrastructure must also be modernized and digitized. Our energy grids, for example, must meet our growing demand for power while supporting and incorporating new power generation, including renewables. Doing so will reduce our reliance on centralized energy producers and allow for small-scale power generation and storage technologies to offset the growing demand placed on utilities. Or in the instance of a major outage, provide power to critical infrastructure such as hospitals and airports that cannot afford downtime.

Truly smart cities need smart buildings and smart infrastructure to work in harmony and enable efficient and reliable energy consumption. Though many cities and communities may have been hesitant to implement what can feel like major projects, now is the time to explore, test and model these solutions. Among the many lessons that will be learned in the wake of the pandemic, one point is clear: we need leaders in business, industry and government to work together and equip themselves with the resources necessary to mitigate our other global crisis, climate change.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-06-27,"The stories emerging from long-term-care facilities across Ontario are nothing short of harrowing. Nearly half of COVID-19 deaths in Canada are linked to long-term care homes.

In a recent report on five nursing homes in Ontario, details emerged of elder abuse and neglect, unsanitary conditions and severe burnout among personal support workers (PSWs) in the throes of the pandemic.

But the challenges in the way Ontario cares for its seniors extend beyond recent months. PSWs in nursing homes feel chronically undervalued by the health-care system, receiving low pay for long hours and strenuous working conditions.

The Star asked students and recent graduates specializing in senior care and public policy what they see as solutions to Ontario’s nursing home crisis.

Lamia Aganagic, University of Toronto

We’re facing a big demographic challenge in Ontario. The number of seniors in need of care is expected to increase significantly by 2030. Provincial governments in particular are facing higher costs and spending on service provisions because we’re seeing an increasing number of seniors with one or more chronic conditions. You may find that patients are not only dealing with dementia and Alzheimer’s, but also a mobility impairment or mental illness. This all impacts the care they need to receive.

One way to alleviate the challenges is to look to virtual care; care that generally happens over the phone or through video. The Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN), which functions as a virtual-care network in Ontario, does this well — but the system could be expanded significantly.

Virtual care becomes especially useful when considering things like patient transfers at long-term care homes (LTC). Senior patients being transferred from an LTC home to the emergency department are at an increased risk of death because they’re exposed to a whole bunch of other things on the way, and they may end up in a state that’s worse than when they left. These transfers are often unnecessary. With virtual care, doctors could identify patients who need a consultation, then notify their regional hospital, helping to reduce unnecessary transfers. In this way, virtual care works as a kind of preventative measure by eliminating unnecessary transfers and the risks associated with them.

Sara Clemens, University of Toronto

I’ve worked as a nurse and as a health-care aide in long-term care facilities. I’ve worked as a director of care and I’ve worked in policy and research for LTC homes. Certainly, low staffing and lack of resources is a major concern for this sector. This has been a problem for decades, but it’s become especially obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We need to look at alternative models. Some of the recommendations for adequate staffing levels at these homes come from reports that are 20 years old. They’re outdated and don’t reflect our current reality. We’ve become accustomed to having fewer registered nurses in LTC homes, while we’ve seen acuity go up, meaning that people are coming into LTC homes with more illnesses, more medications and closer to death. So, although we’re seeing that individual residents need multiple people taking care of them, the number of registered nurses in these facilities have gone down.

Our government will feel the economic repercussions of this pandemic for a while, so we shouldn’t expect them to start pouring money into better funding for senior care. Instead we need to cost our solutions. We need to consider how many beds we can actually afford and then fund those beds at 100 per cent quality of care instead of underfunding more beds.

We need to look to robots and automation, and how they can be part of the solution. Our workers are overwhelmed physically and mentally. Automation that helps do certain aspects of their jobs — giving medication, assessing pain — will help staff infinitely. This way, we can stop tying quality of care to staffing levels and consider other factors that will help.

Meghan McMahon, University of Toronto

The pandemic has put a spotlight on the immediate and long-term problems facing LTC homes. There are at least three major issues we need to address in order to get back on track: pandemic preparedness, the regulatory framework and staffing levels, and investment in data and research.

We need to address pandemic preparedness in long-term care homes. We need to learn what went wrong in Ontario, what went right in other jurisdictions, and to have plans and the capacity in place to ensure the devastation that unfolded here doesn’t happen again. This means full-time pay and benefits for workers, PPE for all staff, capacity to isolate and cluster, and ways for family members to visit loved ones while maintaining safety in the home.

We also need to look closely at the legislation and regulatory frameworks that underpin this sector. We often hear criticism that senior care is the most heavily regulated sector — but it’s also underregulated in some ways. There are very few requirements, for example, on the supply and skill mix of staff in facilities. In Ontario, LTC homes are required to have a registered nurse on duty 24/7, but the rest of the staffing supply and skill mix is left to the individual facility to decide. Our staffing levels in Ontario are considerably lower than international recommendations, and this is in the context of a population that is elderly, frail and has increasingly complex care needs.

Lastly, we need to invest in data and research. We need data to help us understand what’s happening on the ground, which interventions are working for whom and where the gaps in quality care are. While we have publicly reported data on quality of care at LTC homes, we don’t have quality of life indicators. We don’t adequately capture things like resident experience or satisfaction with care. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on resident isolation has revealed the importance of assessing and monitoring these issues. If we don’t have this data, we’re hindered in our ability to design effective systems.

Research is needed to inform the design and implementation of LTC solutions, drawing on the evidence of what’s worked and what’s failed elsewhere. We have a talented health research community in Canada and their skills can be harnessed to help fix LTC homes in the future.

Aaron St. Pierre, Laurentian University

Irrespective of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are several major problems facing senior care in Ontario. One of the biggest has to do with staffing and recruitment; there aren’t enough people taking care of the elderly.

In Ontario, we have a minimum wage for PSWs that’s a few dollars higher than standard minimum wage. Plenty of PSWs make little more than those amounts. So that’s one huge barrier that dissuades people, especially young people, from pursuing a career in this area. Given the work PSWs have to do — taking care of people at their most vulnerable — they deserve to make much more.

Organizations across the sector also need to think about how they recruit. Going to universities and colleges, doing the leg work to bring in more young people, would help significantly. Nursing students and even PSW students are not always aware of the jobs that might be available to them. Going directly to these places, informing students of their job options, would help resolve some of these major staffing issues.",[]

Read', 'Joseph Hallfeature Writer', 'Feature Writer', 'Joseph Hall Is A Toronto-Based Reporter', 'Feature Writer For The Star. Reach Him On Email', 'Gjhall Thestar.Ca']",2020-06-25,"Pain fades. But trauma stays.

It follows us down roadways and sidewalks, into our schools and neighbourhoods — it changes the very infrastructure of our lives.

The legacy of social trauma left by COVID-19 will do this quite literally, experts say, shaping the way we plan and build Toronto and its surrounding regions over the coming decade.

“Overall what we have to do is get our minds around the fact that it’s not the ‘things’ that matter anymore, it’s the people,” says James McKellar, a real estate and infrastructure expert at York University’s Schulich School of Business.

“And we have to begin to understand that cities are for people and that we have done a terrible job in accommodating certain people,” McKellar says.

A more comforting, accommodating city, attuned to pedestrians and cyclists and less dependent on hurtling trains and beeping traffic, would be the best therapy for COVID-19’s trauma, McKellar and other city planning experts say.

It won’t be new-subway sexy.

Rather it means wider sidewalks, safer street signals and crossings, neighbourhoods filled in with “gentle development,” better parks and hundreds of additional kilometres of bike paths and lanes.

It will also mean the eradication or fundamental alteration of the shameful long-term-care facilities we offer our elderly — places whose human warehouse horrors and pitiful staffing strategies the virus so vividly exposed.

And all together — due to the need for closer, safer communities and the overcoming of crushing government debt that COVID-19 survival required — that means a scaling down of infrastructure projects and ideas as we move toward Toronto 2030.

“I’m not saying don’t build the transit and so forth, but let’s not assume that the big problems are going to be solved by big infrastructure,” McKellar says.

“In many ways, the problems are going to be solved by a lot of small things that just make the city more livable.”

This might mean something as simple as building more playgrounds, McKellar says.

Or, says Ryerson University’s Cherise Burda, it might mean something as radical as replacing a planned subway expansion with a far cheaper dedicated bus-route strategy; so-called bus rapid transit (BRT).

BRT provides buses with their own laneways, separate from those bearing automobile traffic.

“If we’re looking at limited resources (because of COVID-19 expenditures), there’s never been a better time to look at the business case for building transit infrastructure,” says Burda, head of Ryerson’s City Building Institute.

“And I think a really good example of that is the Scarborough subway. I know people don’t want to talk about that again, but that’s a $5-billion project,” she says.

Burda says that money would be better spent on building a vastly cheaper and longer bus rapid transit network — like the one that criss-crosses Ottawa — in Scarborough and other underserved areas of the city.

The three-stop Scarborough line could take 15 years to build; bus rapid transit routes could be moving before the decade is through, and provide faster transit along poorly served corridors like Jane St., Dufferin St., Steeles Ave. W. and Finch Ave E.

“And you could do all of that for less than the cost to build six kilometres of Scarborough subway,” Burda says.

She also says the city should more seriously pursue its existing cycling plan, updated last year, which would place every Toronto resident within one kilometre of a designated cycling path.

The University of Toronto’s Eric Miller, a planning and transportation expert, says many of the things on his list of infrastructure priorities would have been there pre-COVID-19, and that the virus has only highlighted their importance.

Like Burda, he would include far more buses, with underserved neighbourhoods in the city’s outskirts at the top of the list.

“We’ve always been so fixated on, ‘Let’s build the big subway, let’s talk about spending tens of billions of dollars,’ ” says Miller, director of U of T’s Transportation Research Institute.

“But the really big impact we could have on improving travel in this region ... is much better surface transit,” he says.

This would include in particular a far greater number of buses along existing roadways in the city’s suburban regions, running with traffic-signal priority to make them move more quickly, Miller says.

For people living some distance from bus stops, which tend to be on arterial roads in the suburbs, scheduled ride-sharing programs could take passengers the “first and last mile” of their daily commute, he says.

“The importance of transit has been highlighted by COVID-19, and we have this huge question of, ‘How do we move people if we can’t crowd them onto buses?’ ” Miller says.

He says expanded and faster bus service would allow people to more easily physically distance on the vehicles, and bring more equitable transit to areas where many of the essential workers who are bringing us through the pandemic live.

“And surface transit is something you can do ... in very short times,” Miller says.

“So over the next 10 years, we could dramatically improve how we deliver surface transit, particularly to places like Scarborough and Etobicoke, not to mention Mississauga and so forth.”

Miller’s infrastructure list for the next decade would also place decent, affordable housing near the top.

“We know we have a housing problem, certainly in the city of Toronto, more generally in the region,” he says. “And we talk about it, but we don’t do anything about it.”

The virus has only highlighted the perils of this inaction.

“In these COVID-19 days, where is the disease spreading? The disease spreads first of all where too many people have to ride buses (together), but also where too many people are overcrowded,” Miller says.

Packing large or multiple families into small apartments or houses is a key disease vector, Miller says.

And these tightly housed people are often among the essential workers who are lifting us through the current crisis.

“Hopefully we’ve come to appreciate how important, how essential these sorts of workers are — who we pay minimum wage and who we don’t orient our policies toward, whether it’s housing or transportation,” Miller says.

“COVID-19 is highlighting how important these things are and how inequitable in particular these things are.”

The inequities revealed by COVID-19 have been most stark and frightening in the region’s long-term-care homes, several of which have been decimated by illness and understaffing.

“It’s been a shambles clearly. The devastation that has occurred with COVID-19 in these homes is just heartbreaking, to say the least,” Miller says.

“Clearly that system is completely broken and needs complete reinvention,” he says.

The first order of business, Miller says, would be to shift the entire long-term-care system to the public sector, where much better oversight and wage and working conditions can be enforced.

On the infrastructure side, however, Burda says the homes must also shrink in size and be enfolded within local communities.

“Rather than warehousing seniors in big facilities in remote areas, we need to think about making them part of the neighbourhood,” she says.

“More facilities, better rooted in the neighbourhood, rather than bigger facilities far away.”

However it’s done, Miller says, better long-term care is a moral imperative.

“If nothing else changes five years from now, if we don’t have a vastly superior long-term-care system for the province, then shame on all of us, we have failed miserably,” he says.

Among other infrastructure considerations, McKellar says COVID-19 trauma has almost certainly ensured people will be more comfortable gathering outside rather than indoors for the foreseeable future.

And that means Toronto should launch European-style projects to reclaim roadways from cars — either permanently or periodically — in many parts or the city.

“What you find in Europe is that on a nice day a whole area of the road gets taken over by seating,” he says.

“We’ve already said the car gets about 50 per cent of the city and we get the rest. Well, we might not be able to give the car 50 per cent any more.”

A fluid transition from cars to patio seats on the roadways might also require getting rid of sidewalk curbs, as some European cities have done, McKellar says.

“We’ve chopped the city up and said, ‘Well, even if there are no cars on the road you can’t go on the road, it’s called jaywalking,’ ” he says.

“So we’re going to have to change our attitude toward the public environment and small things. Like, on every street, do we really want those big curbs is something we’ll have to decide.”

McKellar also sees the potential to bring amenities closer to the mental comfort of our homes through a better, more intense use of the city’s school sites.

“Another example I would use is the stupidity of school sites ... we have huge assets in the school systems,” he says, noting that many of these sites could accommodate far more city services.

“We’re still in silos, where we build a library, we build a school, we build a health centre. Why can’t we start to put those things together and make it convenient for people?”

Indeed, McKellar sees such integration as a partial solution to the long-term-care crisis — especially for facilities that offer retirement-home levels of care.

“Right now, the models that we use is old people go to old folks homes, children go to daycare centres,” he says.

“Well, my mother was at a home in Calgary where the daycare centre was in the seniors home, and it brought such life and joy to those seniors.”

Burda says neighbourhoods could also become more self-sufficient and livable by supporting locally focused infrastructure like cycling lanes and “gentle” lowrise development to fill in the city’s existing residential neighbourhoods.

She says Toronto should pursue sidewalk, bike route and development projects that would place everyday needs like groceries, medical care and schools within 15 minutes of every resident.

Small-bore infrastructure projects such as intersection and crosswalk improvements that make it easier and safer to travel on foot — as laid out in the city’s Vision Zero plan — would help in this quarter-hour goal, Burda says.

McKellar says a reluctance to build things like integrated school and library nodes or smaller-scale infrastructure was often based on a desire to maximize the economic stimulus that public works could provide.

“But let’s not use (that) excuse, let’s go back and use the infrastructure we have and make it more people friendly,” he says.

“And all the new infrastructure should exemplify new ways of thinking that put people back in the equation.”

Such smaller-scale infrastructure building would also be easier on a hugely depleted public purse, as governments climb out of the fiscal canyon that COVID-19 continues to dredge.

There is a huge reserve of private capital, especially within big pension funds and the like, that is eager to fund new for-profit infrastructure, McKellar says.

“For example, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is heavily investing in charging stations for electric vehicles,” he says.

“There is something that is going to have a huge environmental benefit if we can entice more and more people into it. Electric buses would be another one.”

Miller says the promotion of electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support them across the city and beyond would be a major step in the fight against climate change — an even more existential threat than COVID-19.

“We have to keep our eyes on what’s coming down the pike, and what’s coming down the pike is climate change,” he says of our infrastructure planning.

“We’ll be able to get our buses, but the buses may be underwater because the roads keep flooding.”

Private institutional capital could also flow into new and better data delivery if — as some expect — governments choose to regulate such systems, McKellar says.

“I think we’re coming to the point where we’re saying, ‘Shouldn’t this be a regulated utility?’ ” he says.

“And if it is a regulated utility, a pension fund would say, ‘That’s perfect for us, we’ll build a system and the government will set the rate.’ ”

Of course any infrastructure planning for the city and beyond depends on getting the virus under control.

And though people are optimistic that a vaccine or effective therapy will be found in the near future, COVID-19 could linger for years.

“Right now, we just don’t know,” McKellar says.",[]

For many, the prospect of living comfortably in the city’s downtown has become a pipe dream, especially for students who find themselves increasingly unable to afford the cost of living that accompanies life within city limits.

The Star asked four urban planning students to offer their solutions to Toronto’s housing crisis. One common theme connected their visions — housing must be seen as a human right accessible to all, and not as a commodity for developers to maximize profits.

As a kid growing up in co-operative housing in Cabbagetown, I always assumed I was living in a normal apartment building. I didn’t know what “co-operative housing” meant or how it was any different than any other type of housing. When I grew older and became more interested in urban planning, I realized that, partly, this was because of the democratic decision-making structure and investments put into the housing where I lived.

To improve housing in Toronto, governments need to provide housing affordability in perpetuity and invest more in the quality of life for residents. At the co-op where I grew up, our housing had summer day camps, field trips for Easter, Halloween parties and annual Pride parties. These kinds of housing models were developed and financed throughout the 1970s to 1990s, and show how innovative a model like this is for building mixed-income communities.

We can look to models like the one used in the city of Amsterdam for inspiration, where the city requires a high percentage of low-income and moderate-income housing to be included in every new development. Not only does this make the city more affordable, but it helps to remove the stigma often associated with affordable housing — it’s just a normal way of life that the government helps facilitate. It underscores the reality that housing is a human right.

The financialization of real estate and housing poses a big problem in Toronto. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, real estate investment trusts have increasingly pursued residential and commercial property to yield financial returns to their investors, rather than focus on providing adequate living conditions for their tenants. That’s why we’re seeing renovictions, rent hikes and other tactics designed to maximize profit, and that’s why the people who play a fundamental role in our society — essential workers, including taxi drivers, grocery store workers and other service providers — are being pushed outside the downtown core.

There’s no one strategy that will solve the affordability crisis — nothing’s a silver bullet. A multipronged approach is the only way to address this.

By adopting models like community land trusts, where non-profit organizations acquire and preserve land for community benefit, we can help bring down the high costs of housing. Land trusts remove property from the speculative market in perpetuity, so it can stay affordable. The recent collaboration between housing groups, the City of Toronto and developers in the Bloor-Dufferin neighbourhood could be an interesting model to adopt moving forward, as the developers have agreed to contribute several million dollars to an affordable-housing land trust. Partnerships like these can be used to secure permanent affordable housing as part of new development projects.

To understand what’s going on today, we need to look at Toronto’s affordability crisis with a broader lens and understand the history of urban planning and housing in Canada. Right now, we’re seeing the negative impacts of decades worth of defunding and divestment from federal and provincial governments throughout the 1980s and 1990s. If we think about Canada’s colonial history, including ongoing practices of settler colonialism, and how its planning resulted in racialized segregation, we can understand why there are two sides to Toronto — one that’s highly concentrated with low-income and racialized communities living in affordable housing complexes, and the other that’s full of well-off people living in higher-income neighbourhoods, most of whom aren’t impacted by the housing crisis we so often talk about.

This is why all three levels of government need to step in. We can’t have livable affordable housing without governments that are willing to help.

A lot of our public housing stock is in bad condition. Years of defunding and divestment have led to an endless backlog of repair and maintenance needs. If we want to create better affordable housing in Toronto, we need to make significant investments in repairing and maintaining those buildings.

We also have to build affordable housing in different areas of the city. Toronto is filled with concentrations of poverty, where low-income residents are kept in secluded parts of the city. The city can create mixed-income neighbourhoods that include lower-income housing with new development projects at greater depths of affordability. People who work in lower-paying jobs downtown shouldn’t have to commute from Etobicoke or Scarborough because they can’t afford rent downtown.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how different life can be in Toronto depending on where you live. The virus spreads through clusters of low-income neighbourhoods while higher-income residents in secluded neighbourhoods mostly avoid it.

Our governments create policies that suit those who can profit from housing. We’ve seen inclusionary zoning rolled back, and regulations around rent control removed. Now, younger people who can’t afford the downtown are forced into the suburbs, creating longer commute times and offering fewer amenities. Ultimately, housing in Toronto is seen as a commodity when, in reality, we should see it as a human right.

We can look to cities not too different from our own, like New York City, for new approaches to changing the way we think about housing. Its community land trusts, for instance, are community-owned, community-operated and take land off the speculative market. They function as non-profits: all rent goes into maintenance, repairs and similar necessities that benefit the tenants.

Though they’re largely community-run, we still need the city and all levels of government to fund initiatives like community land trusts. The government is particularly helpful for land acquisition costs and with reducing property taxes on these places. Of course, New York City has no shortage of housing problems, but the models it has adopted are ones we should adopt, too. And ideally, we should expand these projects significantly.",[]

Their family lives in Toronto’s High Park area, renting a place for $1,830 per month. They had to find it quickly — they were kicked out of their previous apartment when the landlord’s daughter needed a place to stay after university.

“(We) really struggled to find an apartment that fit our budget that could accommodate Jake being six-foot-two,” Amy says. “We ended up paying way more than we wanted, but we don’t plan to stay long.”

With no debts, they have dreams of buying a home outside the Greater Toronto Area to start their family. But recently Amy suffered health problems that prevented her from returning to work after the pregnancy.

Now, they live on a single income of $70,000 — earned by Jake who’s a software developer. “We live a very modest lifestyle, but things are still tight living on one income,” she says.

On top of the goal of buying a home within two to five years, the couple is also hoping they can start an Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) for their baby. They say that they’re not big spenders and make frugal day-to-day choices to boost their savings.

“We try to home cook as much as possible,” says Amy. Breakfast and dinner are almost always made at home. For lunches, Jake takes leftovers to work, but occasionally grabs a sandwich to go or heads to a restaurant with colleagues. Sometimes, with his stressful work schedule, he’ll opt for a snack from the vending machine.

At home, Amy’s schedule is also jam-packed. With the doctor’s checkups, taking the baby to free play groups, walking the dog and grabbing groceries, the errands can pile up.

On the weekend the couple have a bit more time to indulge their interests, such as geocaching — an outdoor activity using GPS to play hide-and-seek with containers marked in specific locations — and taking part in free community events with the baby.

The two want to move out of their expensive rental spot soon and hope a financial adviser can provide some clear direction on how to start.

We asked them to share everything they bought in a typical week:

The advice: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners, says it sounds like Jake and Amy are having a tough time financially with the decrease in income due to Amy’s health problem and the added stress of a new baby to provide for, coupled with a new, more expensive rental. Here’s his advice:

> Living outside the GTA could have a big impact on their cost of living. There are surrounding suburbs and towns with considerably lower real estate prices. The potential commute into the GTA is a real consideration, though. There’s a cost to that — both literal and figurative — especially when you’re raising a family.

> Amy’s health problems highlight a real risk for them. What happens if something prevents Jake from working? They’re paying health premiums, but don’t appear to have life or disability insurance — they should get on that.

> I’d also question the health premiums. They’re paying out of their bank accounts, so this makes me think it’s not a company or group plan, but rather an individual health insurance plan. I’d take a close look at what is actually being covered currently, and what could actually be covered based on the plan maximums.

> The RESP is a great idea for their little one. That said, given cash flow is tight, and their child isn’t even a year old, I’d maybe hold off for a while. RESPs provide 20 per cent government grants on your contributions up to $2,500 per year. But you can catch up on a full previous year in a future year.

> They may not have a car payment now, but they will eventually have to budget for a replacement. Especially if they move outside the GTA.

> Despite the common advice to start saving for retirement while you’re young, I’d really be focused on getting through these lean years with a newborn and hopefully getting Amy back to work and getting into a cheaper rental.

Overall, there are pros to the way they are living, Heath says. “Good on them for cutting costs with mostly home cooking. Their minimal spending on coffees and lunches will help keep their expenses low at a time when their cash flow is tight.”

The results: They actually spent more in the second week (but it was the holidays!) Spending in week 1: $611.16. Spending in week 2: $821.45.

What she thought: Amy and Jake say that despite spending more, they did “quite well” seeing as it was the holiday season — therefore gifts galore! “This week was a bit unusual for us leading into Christmastime with buying gifts for family, drinks for a Friendsmas party and extra gas for driving to our parents’ houses.”

Take-aways: Being a cautious pair, the couple says that Heath’s advice helped affirm several things they were already hoping to do. First, they’ve decided to cancel their health insurance after crunching the numbers. Also, following the advice, they’re holding off on the RESP contributions for the baby until they have more cash flow.

Another big change? They’ve moved up their timeline to leave Toronto. “We love it here, but it really doesn’t make financial sense to live here anymore, especially now that Jake has five years of post-university work experience and can apply to a wider range of jobs in less expensive cities,” Amy adds.

After doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, they say it was reassuring to find out that they’re doing a good job of limiting their spending. “It’s nice to have an expert affirm things that we felt in our gut.”",[]

With a bit of time and effort, you can be — and it will almost certainly lead to a stronger financial position. Here are five ways to become money smart:

Make a date with yourself every week to work on your finances

Financially literate people spend at least 20 minutes a week learning about money matters and staying on top of their finances. They read about wealth, meet with advisers, work on their budget and pay bills.

Whether they like the subject of money or not, immersing themselves in financial learning every week helps the financially literate stay on top of financial goals.

Carve out time every week to start learning about money. There are literally thousands of free resources online, and hundreds of documentaries to watch. Start with a search about how to save more money.

Investigate lenders before committing to one

In a recent survey conducted by Loans Canada, nearly 40 per cent of respondents — all of whom were already indebted — skipped out on comparing offers from lenders.

Unfortunately, loan stacking — having multiple loans from multiple vendors — tends to be a result of not being strategic about what you borrow for, and from which lender. And that stack of debt can be tough to handle efficiently.

Comparing loan terms, rates, frequency and amount of payments allows you to make an informed decision and gives you leverage to negotiate with competitive offers. And it’s fairly easy to do through online loan and rate comparison websites.

Work your budget

A 2019 Government of Canada financial capability survey found that Canadians who stick to a budget — about half of those surveyed — are better able to stay on top of their spending. People who budget also tend to have squirreled away enough savings for emergencies and retirement plans.

One of the biggest barriers that non-budgeters say gets in the way is a lack of time. There are, however, hundreds of digital tools to speed up the process compared to even a decade ago. And if you prefer to keep your banking separate from your budget, you could use a free Google budgeting template.

Keep a pulse on your credit score

Financially literate people keep an eagle eye on their credit score to prevent fraud and to monitor their progress toward improving it. Generally speaking, a score less than 600 is suboptimal with 900 being the highest. Paying bills on time and in full and reining in your credit cards is the best way to improve your credit score.

And there are plenty of free credit score tracking services like CreditKarma.

When it comes to your personal finances, never guess. There’s just too much at stake. If you don’t know what to do about your finances, or you are just unsure, get help.

Having low financial self-awareness is dangerous and generally leads to poor money decisions. Working with a professional, even if it’s just for the short-term, can help improve your financial self-awareness and increase your financial literacy.

Can they afford a home?","['Evelyn Kwong', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Starmon.', 'March', 'Min. Read', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Star', 'Toronto Star', 'Are You A Millennial Living In Toronto Or The Gta', 'Need Help With Saving Your Money', 'Be A Part Of', 'Millennialmoney']",2020-03-02,"Emily and Tom are both 26 years old. Emily, a registered nurse makes $69,000 a year, while Tom, an apprentice tradesman, makes $44,000. Their monthly spending adds up to around $6,000, and the $300 to $800 left over goes straight into paying off debt.

“We’re looking to buy a house ASAP,” Emily said. What’s the rush? The couple, who currently rent a home in Scarborough, just found out they’re expecting.

“Ideally we’d settle in Whitby, but our budget for homes is under $300,000,” she said. The two also say London is a good option to look at, but before real estate becomes a reality, Emily still has to pay off $12,000 in OSAP debt and Tom has to pay off $5,000 remaining of a consolidation loan from a fitness membership that went wrong.

“Hopefully we can pay it off by the middle of next year,” Emily said, adding they are eager to start their family life.

They’ve tried to be frugal to make their dreams a reality. In a typical workday, Emily and Tom pack a lunch. Emily will treat herself to a Starbucks drink three times a month while Tom buys a coffee and breakfast once a week. “Also, we both eat out from a fast-food restaurant once or twice a month.”

On the weekends, the two are typically homebodies unless they’re going to a friend’s house. Also for their date nights, they try to find ways to budget. “We never go out to drink, we go on dates maybe once every three months and typically spend just shy of $100 per date with food included.”

Their two largest monthly spends? $1,695 split between the two of them on rent, more than $700 on car insurance, about $550 on groceries and $400, which is non-negotiable, for charity.

On top of their more realistic goals, the couple is hoping to finally go on vacation for the first time. “We’d also like to go to either Disney World, Ireland, or the Caribbean for our first vacation sometime in the next few years,” Emily says.

We asked the couple to send in a sample of their weekly expenses for a #MillennialMoney expert to examine. Here’s what happened.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., has advice for the couple, who he says, has an exciting year ahead.

> It sounds like the home budget is pretty modest at $300,000. They will need a minimum 5% down payment or $15,000.

> As they are considering a home purchase, remember that with babies come changes in income and expenses. I’m sure some sort of a parental leave for one or both of them will reduce their combined income for a period of time. EI maternity and parental benefits will replace only a portion of their incomes.

> I would focus the extra $300 to $800 leftover cash each month on Tom’s consolidation loan. It is likely the interest rate is higher than Emily’s OSAP loan rate.

> Debt repayment may be a better option than investing given the interest rates they’re paying, especially given their time horizon for a home purchase seems short. It’s not wise taking risk to invest if you may need your money in a short period of time.

> One thing to consider while Emily is off work is she may have the opportunity to buy back service in her pension plan. This is often a good opportunity to take advantage of and she should consider it during or after her maternity leave.

> Having a baby is a good time to re-evaluate insurance coverage and estate planning. Both Emily and Tom may need more life insurance. If they don’t already have wills and powers of attorney, they should consider them in advance of their new addition to the family.

> It’s hard to criticize generous philanthropists, but this couple should consider whether an expected decrease in income and increase in expenses should cause them to reconsider their $400 per month in donations, even if it is just temporarily.

The results: They spent less. Spending in week 1: $2,262. Spending in week 2: $551.91.

What Emily thought: Compared to last week, the couple is proud of how little they spent. “We will save from there,” Emily said. Next goals: “We’d like to reduce spending on snacks and coffee.” Added bonus, Tom will no longer need to use the 407 toll to go to work as he did in week 2, which will mean more savings.

Take-aways: With help from the Millennial Money expert, now Emily and Tom have shifted into looking more seriously into how to buy a home. “We will likely have to rent to save up for a down payment and maybe will need to pay off debts before purchasing a house as well,” Emily said.

In addition to that, the two had already planned to transfer any child tax benefits into an RESP, so they were glad to hear this affirmed by the financial coach as the “best investment strategy.”

Despite the desperation to pay off debts, the couple agree their charitable contributions are still not debatable, and that they will continue to give just as much.

Instead, they’ve found different areas to save money. “Emily’s family lives here, and they have offered child care which would offset child care costs with her return to work,” Tom added.

Read', 'Elaine Smith Special To The Star', 'Elaine Smith Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star. Reach Her Via Email', 'Ersmithwriter Gmail.Com']",2020-07-07,"Nathan Scott and his fiancée, Dianna Yanchis, are thinking about leaving Liberty Village behind for a home in the suburbs that offers a bit of green space. Luckily, says Scott, 27, they had their mortgage approved in May before the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) announced changes to its rules for obtaining an insured mortgage.

“We have four months locked in,” said Scott. “If we don’t buy during that time, we’ll have to resubmit our paperwork and go through the process again. By then, CMHC’s changes will be in effect.”

Mortgage default insurance is mandatory in Canada for anyone making a down payment between five per cent and 19.99 per cent of a home’s purchase price.

CMHC, the federal Crown Corporation that is Canada’s largest underwriter for mortgage default insurance, announced June 4 that it was tightening its rules for obtaining it. The new rules, effective July 1, mean applicants must carry less debt (39 per cent of gross income vs. 44 per cent); will need a better credit score (680 vs. 600) and gross debt/total debt service ratios of 35 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively; and won’t be able to borrow money from a line of credit or elsewhere to make their down payment.

However, for the moment, the two private mortgage insurers, Genworth Financial and Canada Guaranty, have said they will not follow suit.

“We are fine credit-wise, because we have a pretty high score,” said Scott, “but we might get less money (in terms of the approved mortgage amount) if we have to reapply. Having the other two lenders say they won’t follow CMHC’s lead helps.”

Mortgage broker Jerome Trail, owner of the Mortgage Trail Inc. in Toronto, says there will be no impact on the individual borrower.

“When CMHC made the announcement, it was very dramatic, and there was a media storm within the industry,” Trail said. “Then the other two insurers said they were content with the current underwriters’ guidelines and had no plans to make changes, so it was a big flap about nothing.”

CMHC itself may see the biggest difference, Trail noted, because the major change in its required credit score to 680 from 600 will disqualify about 10 per cent of its usual applicants. A credit score of 580-669 is considered fair, according to Experian.com, and a score of 670-739 is considered good.

Philip Weir, mortgage broker and president of a Dominion Lending Centre in Vaughan, says CMHC’s recent rule tightening seems to be another obstacle for first-time home buyers, following the 2018 implementation of the stress test, which requires buyers to demonstrate that they can keep up with mortgage payments despite changing interest rates.

“The inability to use borrowed money for a down payment hurts young kids trying to get into the housing market,” Weir said. “Most lenders deal with all three insurers, so they will send the mortgage applications to the others.

“So far, so good — it has really affected nobody.”

Robert McLister, the mortgage editor at rates.ca, says the private insurers will get the non-CMHC compliant mortgages to handle and speculates that Genworth and Canada Guaranty could eventually charge higher insurance premiums for their flexibility regarding qualifications.

At present, however, “you as the borrower won’t even know what’s happening.”

McLister expects to see CMHC “take up to a 20 per cent hit on its mortgage business,” but noted that “insurers don’t only want all the castaways, so they (the two private insurers) may tighten their own rules.”

Calculating your scores

For prospective buyers, it’s helpful to be prepared by knowing your credit score and debt service ratio before applying for a mortgage.

Credit scores fall into a range from 300 to 850 and are determined by an algorithm using the information from an individual’s credit report, which includes whether bills are paid on time and how much credit card debt is carried by an individual. A credit score is used by lenders to decide who gets a loan, what the interest rate will be on that loan and an individual’s credit limit.

The two agencies that determine credit scores for Canadians are Equifax and TransUnion and they provide credit reports, scores and monitoring to consumers for a price. However, there are websites that offer a free credit score and credit report: Borrowell for Equifax and Credit Karma for TransUnion information.

Gross debt service (GDS) ratio and total debt service (TDS) ratio are the measurements used by mortgage insurers to determine if a borrower can manage monthly mortgage payments and repay borrowed money. The GDS informs the lender about the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward housing costs, while the TDS tells the lender at a glance what percentage of a prospective homeowner’s income is used to pay debts, including rent, credit card bills, child support and car loans. CMHC requires a GDS of 35 per cent or less and a TDS of 42 per cent or lower.

You can determine your GDS ratio by adding together your monthly rent/mortgage cost (principal only), the related interest, your property taxes and your heating costs and divide by your gross monthly income. For example, if you earn $12,000 in gross monthly income and pay $3,500 in rent and $100 for heat each month, your GDS is $4,000/$12,000 or 33 per cent.

Calculate your TDS by adding together your rent/mortgage principal, the related interest, your property taxes, your heat and other debt obligation and divide by your gross income. (You can calculate both ratios using monthly income or annual income.) For example, if your monthly mortgage payment is $3,500, your interest is $100, you pay an auto loan of $1,000 monthly and credit card payments of $400 monthly, your debt-to-income ratio is $5,000 ($3,500 + $100 + $1,000 + $400) divided by $12,000, or 42 per cent.

You can also use CMHC’s calculator.

Meanwhile, back in Liberty Village, Scott and his fiancée are hoping to find a dream home before their mortgage approval requires renewal.

“The prices are high and there still isn’t much to choose from,” he said. “We’re viewing the houses in person, wearing gloves and masks, because pictures can be misleading.

“It’s exciting to go out and see all of the homes. It will be an interesting summer, for sure.”",[]

Now she wants to buy a house to start a family — during a pandemic. Is it the right time?","['Evelyn Kwong', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Starmon.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Evelyn Kwongtoronto Star', 'Toronto Star', 'Are You A Millennial Living In Toronto Or The Gta', 'Need Help With Saving Your Money', 'Be A Part Of', 'Millennialmoney']",2020-07-06,"At 31, Tess has finally finished years of dental school and is pursuing her career as a dentist in Toronto — which offers the high yearly salary of $140,000 a year. She recognizes that it should be no problem saving up for a home with income like that, but currently her life is in transition.

“Last year my husband, Jin, moved to the U.S. to complete a one-year medical fellowship,” Tess says. This means that for now she’s on her own as she makes concrete savings plans for her future, which includes buying a home where they can settle and start a family soon.

At the moment, Tess is paying more than $2,300 on rent alone, and would like to start putting that money toward a real-estate investment.

“We would also like to start saving for retirement but have no idea where to begin,” Tess adds. She wrote in to Millennial Money to get some advice.

On a typical day, Tess has a quick breakfast at home before heading to work. Twice a week she grabs a latte from McCafe. “I try to bring lunch on most days,” Tess says. “Once a week I may pick up fast food from McDonald’s which is next to work for lunch.”

On the average weekend, prior to the COVID-19 restrictions, Tess would meet up with her friends once or twice, spending around $30 per meal. The rest of time off she spends doing errands like groceries and meal-prep for the week. Also, she’ll sneak in a yoga class or a workout once or twice.

Having lived in Toronto since 2015, Tess says she and her partner want to stay in the GTA to remain close to family. “We would love some help with saving our money and planning for our future.”

We asked Tess to share her daily expenditures to get a better idea of her financial habits.

The expert: Jason Heath, managing director at Objective Financial Partners Inc., lays down the advice for Tess.

She has pretty good cash flow with over $3,000 of estimated monthly savings potential, even after putting aside money for vacations. She has a generous $700 monthly travel budget. This is high for a 31-year-old, but with no debt, a paid-off car, and no kids, Tess is arguably at a good age and stage to have travel as a guilty pleasure.

Given her high income, Tess can really benefit from RRSP contributions. There is only so much money she can potentially take out of her RRSP for her goal of a down payment — the limit is $35,000 — but she’s in a 43 per cent marginal tax bracket, so contributing will save her $43 of tax for every $100 contributed.

Her savings potential means she should have enough cash flow to contribute to her RRSP and her TFSA, which she should definitely be building up. Tax-free growth and no restrictions on withdrawals make the TFSA a flexible savings tool in her case.

If her home-purchase time horizon is under five years, Tess should be careful about taking on too much stock-market risk with her investments.

Tess has high insurance costs: $633 per month. I’d be interested to know what coverage she has. She should have professional liability insurance. Personally, she should have disability and possibly critical-illness insurance. Life insurance is less important given that she has no dependents. Her disability coverage should ideally be the“own occupation” variety, so that if she cannot practise dentistry due to disability, her income will be replaced. The terms of a disability policy are really important for a dentist, to ensure the coverage can increase with their income over time and make inflationary adjustments during a disability.

Tess may have the opportunity to incorporate her dental practice at some point and establish a professional corporation. There are many tax, investment, insurance and estate-planning opportunities to consider for a young professional who can incorporate — it’s a great planning tool in the right circumstances.

One of Tess’ biggest challenges over time may be avoiding the lifestyle creep that can happen as her income increases during her career. Having a high income can often lead to more discretionary spending, and over time discretionary spending can turn into perceived necessity. Strategies like her budgeting and meal prepping will help her live below her means and balance living for today and saving for tomorrow.

Result: She spent less! Spending in Week 1: $3,045.99 Spending in Week 2: $870.96

How she thinks she did: Obviously, spending less is great, she says, but the biggest update came following the arrival of the pandemic, which brought her husband home early from his fellowship: they decided to go ahead and buy a house! “We’re excited to start this new chapter of our life!”

In doing the #MillennialMoney challenge, Tess was also able to see that her day-to-day spending was relatively reasonable compared to her income. There was also an extra $600 to $800 saved during lockdown restrictions: “There would be usually more extraneous expenses on entertainment and eating out,” Tess says.

Take-aways: Regarding longer-term advice, Tess’ main take-away from the money coach is to contribute more to her RRSPs. This, she says, will give her security for retirement now that she’s already gone ahead and purchased her home.

More specifically, Tess is leaving this exercise with a plan to look into financials to prepare for buying multiple vehicles, as she and her husband have bought a home outside the downtown core. “I need to look into investment options to take increased advantage of my TFSA and RRSP for the future.”

Final takeaway? COVID-19 has given her a new perspective. “COVID-19 has reiterated the importance of saving. Take advantage when cash flow is good to set aside an emergency fund,” she says.

The Charles-Fridlyand family is having a whale of a time in the above-ground swimming pool they bought online in April.

“We’re in there hours at a time and we laugh a lot,” Diana Fridlyand says of her husband and two young sons, noting that the daily dips help ease her pandemic stress, which “comes in waves.”

Anxiety and uncertainty over the coronavirus have sparked an urge to splurge as consumers look for ways to take the edge off, scooping up everything from $18 hand cream to $50,000 swim spas.

“My showroom is an empty bowling alley,” business owner Jennifer Gannon says of BonaVista Pools’ retail location in Leaside, where they sold more products in the first quarter of this year than all of last year.

“I hear people say, ‘I’m feeling COVish,’” referring to the effects of COVID-19 on mental health.

“Water is helping them cope,” Gannon said, citing its restorative and calming qualities.

Fridlyand, a senior manager for a communications company, says their spending, $299 plus tax, was based on her feeling “that everything would shut down” this summer. She’s caring for Aubrey Charles, six, and Bodie Charles, almost four, all day while working from home.

Husband Brent Charles attests to their pool’s value: “It’s been a lifesaver. A fantastic purchase.”

The 12-footer is big enough to accommodate everyone “and still fit a drink in your hand,” jokes the chef and owner of Rebel Merchant Catering Studio.

And the kids? “The first thing they ask is, ‘Can we go in the pool?’ That’s all they want to do.”

The early days of the outbreak and self-isolation saw a wave of spending sprees, according to a Credit Karma survey. More than a third of respondents said they’d made an impulse purchase because they felt anxious or stressed. Of those, nearly half said they were stress-spending at least once a week. Ten per cent had gone more than $1,000 over their budgets since sheltering in place.

Even the affluent — or perhaps especially the affluent — are indulging if online jewelry sales are anything to go by. Strong results this spring, reported by Sotheby’s and Christie’s auction houses, included a record-setting $1.34 million for a vintage Cartier bracelet sold by Sotheby’s.

Locally, swim spas — a hybrid of a small pool and big hot tub priced from $20,000 to $50,000 at BonaVista — “went off the charts” as customers diverted vacation funds to “create some comfort” at home, says Gannon, who owns the retail division of the family business. Troubled souls still hoping to be soothed this summer are out of luck, however, thanks to depleted stock.

Not so for patrons of Peterborough-area company Walton Wood Farm, where business owner Leslie Bradford-Scott is filling non-stop orders for personal-care products with names like “Week From Hell” and “Nurse’s Rescue.”

Two weeks after the lockdown set in, “We took off like a freight train,” says the entrepreneur, noting that e-commerce sales to consumers — primarily GTA residents — have jumped 300 per cent.

In one instance, two months’ worth of products geared to front-line workers, such as $18 hand cream and $13 shower therapy, sold out in six hours.

“We’re like the candy store of hand cream,” says Bradford-Scott, whose own experience as a stressed-out solo parent spawned her start-up six years ago.

She observes that the average pre-pandemic order was $59; now it’s $89. While people often buy stuff for their entire households, including kids and dogs, many purchases aren’t intended for self-pampering, she says.

“There’s a lot of gifting going on. You feel good when you give something that’s creating an emotional connection.”

One shopper bought $2,000 worth of lip balm for nurses and “gave it all to one hospital,” says Bradford-Scott. Another splurged on $800 worth of “Week From Hell” products.

The why behind the buy is often easily explained by the experts. Just the anticipation of a reward causes a dopamine spike that helps spark pleasure, U.S. neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky discovered years ago.

And as Rice University marketing professor Utpal Dholakia puts it: “Shopping offers a perfect avenue” to relieve anxiety or stress — “or at least divert our minds temporarily.”

Researchers call this “mood repair,” he told the Star in an email from Houston, Tex. But the short-term boost may be “counterbalanced by harmful longer-term effects for many people,” Dholakia cautions.

Impulse shopping can affect personal finances, create conflict with partners and family members and, in severe cases, even lead to compulsive shopping and hoarding, he says.

Extreme behaviours aside, Credit Karma’s Ken Lin isn’t surprised “that people are spending more money to cope with stress. Retail therapy is a real thing no matter who you are or where you live.”

Lin, CEO and founder of the personal finance website, says shopping can offer a two-for-one benefit by making you feel better and more in control. “That sense of control is super valuable, especially during a pandemic.”

But continuing to spend money you don’t have as a way of coping can be “dangerous,” especially if you rack up additional fees and interest on credit cards, he warns. “When you can, pay with cash or debit.”

Another financial pitfall associated with stress-spending is neglecting to put money into savings: “You could find yourself in a tough position when it comes time to pay for an unexpected bill or emergency.”

Lin advocates the “24-hour rule” wherein you “sleep on it” before buying something non-essential. If, after a day, you still think it’s worthwhile, “it’s less of an impulse buy.”

And he’s not about to throw cold water on purchases like the Charles-Fridlyand family’s. “If you have the extra cash … it’s OK to occasionally spend money on non-essential items.”

Reach Him Via Email']",2020-07-06,"When stocks are flying high, it’s easy to think you know more about investing than you really do.

Then, when you come up against challenging markets like we’ve seen since the pandemic struck, it can be an eye-opening learning experience from a tough teacher.

Here are five hard-won investing lessons derived from recent market events and earlier history.

1. An occasional stock market crash is a fact of investing life that you need to live with

The dramatic drop in stock prices starting in late February is a reminder that you always need to be prepared for market meltdowns. Unfortunately, while you know they will occur, you can’t reliably predict when. That means you can’t invest in stocks in the good times but then avoid the meltdowns.

In the 75 years since the end of the Second World War, there have been 12 stock market declines of 20 per cent or more, which is the common definition of a bear market. (My stock market statistics for this column reference the widely followed S&P 500 stock index, and data at yardeni.com and markets.businessinsider.com.)

While they all have a punishing impact, each bear market is different. The crash in February-March was fast and scary and driven by the pandemic — the S&P 500 fell 34 per cent in 33 days.

The plunge of 2007-2009 originated in excessive global lending (especially U.S. subprime mortgages) but then devastated an unprepared global banking system. In that case, stock prices fell 57 per cent over 17 months.

2. Markets are resilient and will reward the patient investor

After the alarming plunge in February and March, the S&P 500 rebounded more than 40 per cent in 2-1/2 months. That dramatic recovery made up most of the lost ground, although prices have subsequently faded a bit.

Does that mean that the recovery is on solid footing and stocks will continue on to new highs from here? No one knows. It’s also possible that a strong second wave of the pandemic could trigger another cliff-dive in stock prices. All you can say with confidence is that the world economy — and stocks with it — should recover in a sustained fashion at some point.

That means you may have to be patient. Consider what happened after the 2007-2009 market crash. After several false rallies, the stock market finally hit bottom on March 9, 2009. The recovery in the S&P 500 was rapid at first, rising more than 20 per cent in 10 trading days. But subsequent progress was uneven and it took a lengthy climb to get out of such a deep hole. It required roughly four years from March 2009 to March 2013 for stock prices to get back to the pre-crash high point. It continued to chug along, turning into one of the great bull markets of all time. In a period of just under 11 years up until February of this year, the S&P 500 grew by roughly 400 per cent.

3. Don’t let your emotions keep you from making smart investing decisions.

When markets move in dramatic fashion, our emotions encourage us to do precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time. When stocks are crashing and we’re feeling anxious, we’re tempted to bail and thus “sell low.” When stocks are soaring and we see lots of money being made, we’re tempted to load up and thus “buy high.” Unfortunately, the combination of “selling low” and “buying high” is a surefire way to achieve poor investment results.

The thing is, if you bail on stocks when they’re down, it’s really hard psychologically to buy back in. When stocks drop, it’s really easy to rationalize that you’ll sell for now and then buy back when the market “stabilizes.” That sets you up for what Tom Bradley, chair of Steadyhand Investment Funds Inc., calls the “toughest decision in investing.” Once you’ve been burned once, you’ll probably be extra cautious about buying back because you’d really hate to be burned a second time.

And timing your return to the market can be hard. You won’t be able to tell when stocks have hit bottom until well after the fact and prices don’t necessarily “stabilize” at a low point. If you mull over your repurchase decision for a few weeks, stock prices may have already advanced 10 or 20 per cent higher than the point at which you recently sold them, which makes repurchasing them a bitter pill to swallow.

On the flip side, the dramatic recovery in stocks from March to early June provided immediate relief to those investors who had the fortitude to hang on through the fierce down drop.

As the rebound gathered steam, an entirely different set of emotions was unleashed, mostly among a different set of investors. Those bullish emotions have encouraged investors to keep buying as prices rose higher. While prices haven’t fully recovered to the all-time market high point achieved in February, they nonetheless seem on the high side considering that we’re in the midst of a pandemic.

Legions of new day traders have suddenly jumped into the market, fuelling each other’s bullishness on social media, at times to extreme levels. They appeared to be responsible for some odd happenings, including a big upward spike in the stock price of newly bankrupt companies like Hertz, the car-rental company.

Most famous among the new day traders is Dave Portnoy, the founder of the Barstool Sports website with 1.5 million Twitter followers, who gleefully disses established investment experts like Warren Buffett and repeatedly proclaims “stocks only go up.” While such provocative statements may be more of a ploy for social media attention than sincere investing advice, it’s nonetheless a clear expression of bullish extremes.

4. Your adviser has had a golden opportunity to prove their value — or not

Financial advisers take a lot of heat these days for the fees they charge, often for good reason. But it’s challenging times like these that give great advisers a chance to shine and provide tremendous value that far exceeds their fees. Of course the opposite is true also. If your adviser hasn’t done a great job at helping you to get through this crisis, then it is probably time to consider taking your business elsewhere.

Here’s what your adviser should have done before the crash. When they set up your account, they should have made it clear that a market crash that is worse than what just happened is likely to occur at some unknown point in the future and warned you to be prepared for it. With that in mind, they should have helped you gauge your appetite for risk, then helped you to design a portfolio that would withstand a crash without the need to sell stocks at distressed prices. In subsequent conversations — especially when the market is flying high — they should have reminded you of those risks.

When the market crash happened, your adviser should have provided a calming presence, easing your anxieties and reminding you such an occurrence was anticipated. Furthermore, they should be able to show how your portfolio was designed to withstand such an event as long as you “stayed the course” and didn’t sell at distressed levels. They should also have broached the topic of rebalancing and possibly started helping you do so, although there is no one right rebalancing approach. If the market crash totally blindsided you and your portfolio was unprepared for it, then either your adviser did their best to educate you and you ignored them, or it’s time to take your portfolio elsewhere.

5. The everyday business world and the economy drive the stock market, but it isn’t a simple relationship

A lot of people were surprised that stock markets bounced back while the COVID-19 death toll rose and much of the global economy was shut down. On the face of it, it sure seems like a big disconnect.

While stock prices do in fact reflect an assessment of corporate prosperity, it’s important to realize it isn’t a simple relationship. The initial bounceback in stock prices came as the result of an improvement in market sentiment after dismal lows. That initial recovery in stock prices amounted to climbing up from the bottom of a deep pit.

Also, stock prices reflect investor expectations of corporate profitability years into the future. So, in effect, the stock market to a large extent is looking past the global shutdown to years of profits after the economy has recovered.

The catalyst for the bounce were actions by central banks and governments around the world to resuscitate the global economy with unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. That has encouraged markets to believe that the recession will be relatively short-lived and that the business recovery will be strong.

Of course, that doesn’t mean markets have got their expectations right or that market sentiment won’t change again for the worse. If there is a strong second wave of COVID-19, followed by a second global wave of shutdowns, then stock prices might plummet again. But don’t think that what you see in the headlines or the economy will necessarily be reflected in the stock market in a straightforward and direct way.

Read', 'Navneet Alangcontributing Columnist', 'Contributing Columnist', 'Navneet Alang Is A Toronto-Based Freelance Contributing Technology Columnist For The Star. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-04,"The thing about pandemics is that the disease in question ends up mirroring in society what the virus does to the body. COVID-19 has upset social norms, ravaged industries from hospitality to retail, and it even occasionally feels like a sort of delirium has set in.

There is, however, a lone exception: big tech. Far from suffering or being thrown into disarray, the digital giants that comprise so much of modern life seem to have only increased both their reach and wealth. The so-called FAAMG companies — the top-performing tech stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google — are almost universally near all-time highs, with three of those companies at or nearing market capitalizations of a trillion and a half dollars.

The stunning situation is a result of both the brutally effective business practices of tech’s biggest players, but also the unique situation of the pandemic. As those people who continued to work did so from home, tech became even more essential: meetings became video calls, collaborative efforts turned into online work, new web businesses sprang up overnight and everyone turned to apps to fill their most basic needs.

Far from simply benefiting from happenstance, though, big tech also used the moment to pounce. Facebook announced Rooms to capitalize on the rise of video conferencing and also to attempt to head off upstart Zoom. Microsoft added features to its Teams co-working software to better compete with Slack and others. Google finally made its Meet communication software free and schools quickly began to use it. And despite struggles with controversy, both Facebook and Amazon continued to see growth.

For the tech world, the pandemic produced something like the perfect storm. And that set of circumstances may well entrench the deep changes we’ve seen as it seems a post-COVID-19 world may accelerate the shift to, say, working from home, the increasing shift to online retail or the replacement of in-person business meetings with online ones.

The long and short of it is that as most sectors flailed, the dominant tech industry only got more dominant. The market crashed to its lows during the height of the coronavirus’s novelty in March but, since then, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index has risen more than 40 per cent, led of course by the FAAMG stocks.

Undoubtedly, much of this turn to tech during the pandemic is a simple function of how useful many tech products are. Separated from one another and a means of earning a living, digital tech’s capacity to connect people over distance, foster new forms of commerce and produce novel social behaviours, such as the Zoom happy hour, are vital and are a clear sign of why digital technology has so fundamentally altered the world: this is history-changing stuff.

But in becoming essential to modern life almost through sheer bigness alone, big tech also becomes inescapable. It is why it’s so easy to miss out on social or community engagement when you don’t have a Facebook account, so easy to be misinformed or behind the times without Twitter, and why any business without a serious online presence seems archaic.

Put another way, tech isn’t just a service or a product, but basic modern infrastructure. In the same way that the Industrial Age would have been impossible without assembly lines, roads, railways, distributed electricity and more, contemporary life is similarly unimaginable without the internet.

But imagine if a handful of companies on the coast of a solitary nation controlled most of the infrastructure of the world. It seems absurd and yet we aren’t that far away from precisely that situation. Facebook’s three core products — its main social network, plus Instagram and WhatsApp — are collectively used by well over half of people who are online in the world.

The pandemic thus revealed just how influential and centralized so much power is in the hands of big tech companies. Consider: when faced with the rapid spread of the virus, competitors Apple and Google took the unusual step of collaborating to build the capacity into their platforms for contact tracing apps to track the spread of the virus. That this was at all possible speaks to the utter dominance of those two companies’ products; nearly every smartphone on the planet runs on of those companies’ software.

That we have these technologies and that they can be put to good uses is clearly a boon. But that so few companies are so pervasive and have so much power should also be worrying. It seems we should ask ourselves if we are still willing to outsource so much of the infrastructure of modern life to a handful of companies on America’s west coast. After all, left unchecked, big tech is its own sort of virus: insidious, contagious and, past a certain point, nearly impossible to control.

Read', 'Ambarish Chandracontributors']",2020-07-04,"On a normal day in July almost a quarter of a million people would cross the border from the United States into Canada. These are not, of course, normal days.

The frontier between the United States and Canada, the longest border in the world, has now been closed to non-essential travel for more than three months. In April, entries by non-residents had fallen by 97 per cent compared to the previous year. At some point, Canada must decide when, and how, to reopen the border.

In general, economists favour fewer restrictions to travel, trade and commerce. Our own research on the U.S.-Canada border points to the benefits of facilitating cross-border travel. Consumers get access to a wider variety of goods and services at potentially lower cost supporting businesses providing those products. Back in normal times, we argued to the Senate that Canada should increase exemptions for cross-border travellers and encourage travel.

But this is the new normal. And while, COVID-19 infections appear to have declined to manageable levels in Canada, this is not the case in the U.S. where a modest decline has been replaced by a mid-June resurgence. COVID-19 cases are rising in 40 states. The surge is primarily driven by southern states, whose governors reopened before suppressing the spread of the virus. U.S. federal government inaction bears heavy responsibility as well.

In these circumstances, the only prudent option available to Canada is to indefinitely extend the closure of the border with the U.S. to non-essential travel until the U.S. can demonstrate that it has brought the virus under control.

The current chaos and the irresponsible behaviour by U.S. state and federal governments, as well as the widespread denial of the infection by regular people, means we cannot trust that their citizens will comply with quarantines or obey distancing and mask-wearing rules.

There are 50 million car trips across the U.S.-Canada border each year. According to our research, only five to 10 per cent of entries into Canada would fit the criteria for being essential or work-related. Each trip brings the possibility of infection, but trips have very different purposes, and therefore different benefits for the Canadian economy. There is no reason to believe that workers and leisure travellers are different in their likelihood of spreading infection. The key difference is that leisure travel can be delayed or diverted elsewhere without incurring an excessive burden. Tourist spending does bring economic benefits to regions such as Niagara Falls, but these benefits would be massively outweighed by the costs if, say, Toronto or Montreal have to undergo lockdowns again.

By contrast, Canada’s universities, hospitals and businesses desperately rely on a steady supply of specialized skilled foreign talent, just as our farms rely on seasonal foreign workers. Currently, many potential foreign workers are unable to apply for work permits due to the closure of Canadian consulates. Likewise, many Canadians are being kept apart from their families as permanent immigration for family reunification is suspended.

We cannot halt our regular immigration system forever. And those trips can be monitored, travellers tested and quarantined. By contrast, leisure travellers engaging in same-day slightly longer travel cannot feasibly be tested or quarantined.

Extending the ban on leisure travel will affect certain communities, and the government should consider compensating those mainly border towns that will be most affected. A silver lining is that Canadians will likely to reduce their own international travel due to the need to quarantine on return, and vacation at home boosting domestic tourism.

It is time for Canada to set a clear date on reopening for immigrating workers, family reunification, and regular (permanent) immigration, even as it extends the restrictions on non-essential travel indefinitely.

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter', 'Tess Kalinowski Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Real Estate For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-05-18,"House-hungry millennials could be forgiven for hoping that the silver lining in COVID-19’s economic rampage is an unexpected shot at the real estate market.

With home prices set to soar at the start of this year, many would-be buyers went into lockdown feeling priced out and discouraged by heated bidding wars and bully offers.

Then COVID-19 sent Greater Toronto Area home sales tumbling 69 per cent year over year in April. Some consumers still hanging on to their salaried jobs read it as a signal that the window of opportunity was opening.

On a year-over-year basis, home prices have stalled, with the average price rising only about $1,000 in April to $821,392. Still, that was down about $90,000 from February’s average price of $910,319.

While there are some opportunities in the COVID-19 housing market, experts warn those come with risk, and timing the low point is tricky for buyers. Even if this is a once-in-a-decade chance to step on the property ladder, it may be slipping away as the economy sputters back to life.

The Star asked six experts — two economists, three real estate brokers and a mortgage specialist — if post-pandemic conditions will be first-time-buyer friendly, and whether a recovery will quickly shut down those opportunities.

Here’s what they said:

“The bottom is not falling out of the market, but it’s a better time for a first-time buyer probably than we’ve seen since 2009,” said Andrew Harrild of Condos.ca.

The year opened with bidding wars galore and homes commonly selling for 10 per cent over list price. Then in mid-March, when open houses were cancelled and condo buildings banned real estate showings, there were probably deals to be had amid the uncertainty.

But the market has since stabilized.

“You’re even starting to see offer dates creeping back in, which is certainly an indication people are feeling a bit more confident,” Harrild said.

“You’re not seeing massive discounts off the list price but you are seeing 98 per cent of list or $10,000 or $20,000 under asking,” he said.

The flip side is there isn’t much to see. Listings were down 64 per cent in April compared to the same month last year, with short supply putting upward pressure on prices and signs of pent-up demand.

“There’s a bit of confidence coming into the market,” he said.

If you are looking for a bargain you’ve got to drill down to individual neighbourhood and housing category, said Zoocasa CEO Lauren Haw.

She warned that sales statistics are skewed by the low number of sales and the mix of available properties on the market.

“Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, things are quite different,” she said.

There could be more choices for those in the market for a downtown condo. That’s where some short-term rentals have migrated to the long-term-rental and resale markets. But there are few detached houses available in good school districts.

“April-May is your crown month for family homes in good school districts and they’re not for sale right now. I continue to think when those houses hit the market we’re going to see prices rise,” Haw said.

There is some real estate excitement in the 905 communities around Toronto and that is extending to cities such as Hamilton, Peterborough, Barrie, London and Kitchener-Waterloo, markets that were thriving before the pandemic.

Now that many people don’t see themselves going back to work at the office full-time, Haw predicted those secondary cities will likely remain buoyant.

“If I am only going to commute three days a week, of course I’m going to buy a detached house in a great neighbourhood in Kitchener,” she said. But home buyers will continue to want walkable downtown lifestyles with restaurants and entertainment nearby.

Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said there are bargains to be had with homes selling for less than they were in March. But, he said, “There is a risk premium for trading in any financial crisis and frankly it’s justified because there are so many unknowns.”

That benefit of a sale price that is 2 to 5 per cent lower looks more substantial when you consider prices had been expected to rise as much as 15 per cent this spring, he said.

Soper also warned that the window for those savings will close as the market returns to normal, and there are signs that is already happening, with traffic up 20 per cent year over year at the company’s listings website royallepage.ca and an uptick in virtual and guided showings.

“The longer you wait the less an opportunity there will be for a cheaper purchase,” he said.

“In any market correction, buyers are the earliest to react to a potential downturn and adjust their expectations lower as far as price goes. Sellers are the last in and the first out,” Soper said.

Their usual reaction is to take their house off the market or test the market to see if they can get what they want, not let the house go at a significant discount.

“It appears that the 905 is doing better than the 416 during this recovery,” Soper said. “It may be a combination of lower average price and lower density — probably a citizenry that is somewhat less concerned about leaving their homes to transact, particularly in housing,” he said.

David Macdonald, senior economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said he doubts few young adults 25 to 35 years are thinking about buying homes, with about 30 per cent having lost their jobs or the majority of their work hours since February.

“If you were in that age category and a third of your friends lost their jobs, you might be pretty reticent to take on a big mortgage because you might be next,” he said.

Several factors need to line up for buyers to take advantage of the recession, Macdonald said.

“You’ve got to be lucky enough to keep your job and we need to see big declines in house prices, which itself would be devastating to the economy because people would feel a lot poorer as a result of their houses being worth much less,” he said.

Macdonald said people who might have been saving for a house pre-COVID-19 are now likely more preoccupied with paying the rent.

“There may be people who benefit from this but in terms of allowing millennials en masse to buy single-detached homes in the GTA any time soon, I think that’s extraordinarily unlikely,” he said.

One sign the housing market could be quickly revived is that mortgage pre-approvals are beginning to pile up, said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.

“It feels like just before the spring market right now where there is a few purchases happening but not many, but it does feel like people are readying themselves to possibly buy in the next couple of months,” he said.

While part-time and hourly workers have suffered disproportionate job losses during the COVID-19 crisis, only about 10 per cent of full-time workers have lost their jobs, Laird said.

“Typically it wouldn’t be the part-time, hourly person who is looking at entering the real estate market,” he said. “It’s more typically those with longer-term, stable employment, and that group has not been nearly as badly affected,” he said.

Conference Board of Canada senior economist Robin Wiebe said there are competing factors that could hasten or slow recovery. But on balance, he said, Toronto housing fundamentals can likely sustain a comeback.

“One of the things that might go against a quick rebound in the housing market is that consumers in general are carrying high debts. Even though rates are low they may not be prepared to jump into the housing market — that’s not just young people, that’s people of all ages,” Wiebe said.

But population is a big driver of housing demand and there are reasons to think Toronto has pent-up demand based on Conference Board estimates that the city added 128,000 people last year, on top of 125,000 in 2018. That’s the equivalent of two Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA) according to the Statistics Canada definition of 100,000 people, he said.

Until the shutdown Toronto also enjoyed “red hot” employment growth, rising over 4 per cent last year, and interest rates are low and expected to stay that way for some time.

That has contributed to pent-up demand and a short supply of housing. Wiebe cited Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) statistics showing there were 209 completed and unoccupied (ownership, not rental) apartments in the Toronto CMA in April. The 20-year average is 630.

Experts who spoke to the Star stressed there are still a lot of unknowns about the road to recovery.

What happens if there is a second wave of COVID-19 infection in the fall?

“A brief second wave I believe the market could manage, and people will treat it like the aftershock of an earthquake. An extended or more damaging second wave would mean all bets are off for the economy and the housing market,” Soper said.",[]

The average selling price for homes also dipped 1.5 per cent to $819,665, according to a special mid-April market update released on Wednesday.

The board now expects home prices to finish out the year at 2019 levels, instead of the originally forecast $900,000 average.

Listing prices showed a similar drop in the first part of this month.

The board’s revised expectation takes into account a roaring 15 per cent year-over-year price gain in the first quarter. More recently though, COVID-19 restrictions have severely curtailed real estate activity, said board president Michael Collins.

“Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and, indeed, their own employment situations. On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction. In the condo market in particular, individual condo corporations have curtailed entry for non-residents,” he said in a news release.

The board forecasts a return to housing activity if public health restrictions loosen in the summer, leading to an acceleration of sales in the fall. Some price declines could appear into the second and third quarters of the year, however.

“But these declines will have less of an effect on the overall price for 2020 because the annual share of sales will also be much lower than normal,” said a news release.

New listings went the way of sales, plummeting 63.7 per cent to 3,843 in the Toronto region between April 1 and April 17, a period that is traditionally part of the housing market’s busiest season.

When buyers get back in the market, there will be a pent-up demand for homes, said TRREB chief market analyst Jason Mercer.

“Increasingly those buyers will be faced with the persistent lack of listings inventory that was a serious problem before the (onset) of COVID-19,” he said.

The market update shows that detached house prices have taken the biggest hit, declining 9.1 per cent to $1.26 million on average in the city of Toronto. There was a drop in the number of homes that sold in the city for more than $2 million, bringing down the overall average, says the real estate board.

Across the Toronto region, detached houses sold for 4.6 per cent less year over year, averaging $990,543.

Even condos, which have consistently increased in value, saw a drop in the average selling price of 1.8 per cent to $578,594 in the GTA and a 2.9 per cent decline to $617,246 inside Toronto’s borders.

Those units typically attract a lot of first-time buyers, who can wait for more certainty in the market, said the real estate board.

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-04-17,"Tenants who are sheltering in place during the coronavirus outbreak will likely face a softer rental market when the lockdown lifts, says the head of development-tracking market research firm Urbanation.

Shaun Hildebrand said that while construction has slowed, many residential building sites are still operating and will inject new supply into the rental market.

There are already signs of a shift in the Toronto area’s notoriously tight rental market, he said.

There were 7,200 units leased in the first quarter of 2020, a 16 per cent year over year increase. But there was a significant shift after March 16, Urbanation reports.

The year started with a 25 per cent year over year uptick in the number of Toronto-area lease transactions. But in the second half of March, rentals were 25 per cent below the same level the year before — down 39 per cent compared to the first half of the month.

The supply of rentals dropped only 7 per cent during the same period.

“That we saw some weakness in rents already, just two weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn, it just speaks to how quickly the market is starting to react,” said Hildebrand.

The changes represent a pretty dramatic shift and likely the beginning of what will be a pretty soft period for the rental market, he said.

Some 10,000 condos and 1,000 purpose-built rentals were expected to come on the market in the second quarter of this year, and while they will likely be delayed, most will be ready for occupancy later, said Hildebrand.

Residential construction sites are operating, albeit at a slower pace to allow for worker safety measures.

“On the demand side we have job losses, lower income, lower immigration. On the supply side we haven’t seen a lot of rental availability as yet but I think that will happen,” he said.

Job losses mean some tenants will move into roommate situations or back home. Hildebrand predicts fewer people will upgrade their apartment. But the introduction of new buildings means a large supply coming online at once and that can put downward pressure on rents.

Because most Toronto investment condos are owned by individuals rather than REITs or pension funds, those landlords will be motivated to rent their units and, because they bought at lower prices than condos sell for now, they will have some flexibility to lower their prices, he said.

Meanwhile, rental website PadMapper reported a 10 per cent drop in apartment searches between February and March.

Toronto remains the most expensive rental market in the country, according to PadMapper. The $2,250 average one-bedroom rent, was .9 per cent higher year over year in April. Two-bedroom rents rose 2.8 per cent to $2,950 in the same period.

Barrie had the fastest growing rents in the country, up 5 per cent year over year to an average $1,460.",[]

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-04-14,"Royal LePage is predicting that Toronto area home prices could still rise this year, despite the COVID-19 crisis.

In its first-quarter report, released Tuesday, the brokerage says that if the pandemic recedes by the end of second quarter, prices could jump up 1.5 per cent year-over-year, to $856,263 by the end of 2020.

However, if the lockdown continues to the end of August, the company expects house and condo prices will contract by 0.5 per cent year-over-year to $851,982.

Although Toronto’s housing market had a strong first-quarter, with aggregate resale prices rising 7.5 per cent year-over-year, that won’t be enough to compensate for the loss of eight to 12 weeks in the busy spring real estate season, said Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper.

About 22 per cent of sales typically occur in the first quarter of the year.

“We’re not anticipating an immediate recovery,” he said.

Even when the economy begins to move again, people will still be wary of each other and sellers will be more hesitant to allow strangers to tour their homes.

But once consumers feel more comfortable, Soper said economic stimulus, such as low interest rates, competition among lenders and softer prices, will kick-start the market.

The “swift and violent” impacts of COVID-19 have disproportionately hit younger and part-time workers across the province, groups less likely to be in the housing market, he said.

That’s why the real estate sector will be one of the prime lifters of the economy when health protocols are relaxed, just as it was following the global downturn in 2008 and 2009, said Soper.

“It was really the entry of the first-time buyer and the housing consumer that brought the Canadian economy back after the great recession,” he said.

Soper said it may appear as if real estate prices have plummeted when the country goes back to work. There will be headlines touting dramatically lower selling prices. But those will likely be a few distressed sellers accepting lower prices that lower the overall average.

There will also be some opportunities for buyers who might otherwise have been faced with competitive offers — something that was a growing concern in the heated market of the first part of the year.

“One of the really challenging things we saw coming in 2020 before the health crisis, was the psychology of multiple defeats where you put an offer in and you lose and you lose and you lose. Eventually people either drop out (of the market) in frustration or they overpay. We should see a lot less of that,” he said.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) had been forecasting a 10 per cent rise in GTA housing prices this year before the COVID-19 restrictions stopped showings and stalled all but necessary transactions. The board has suggested that it will have a better idea of where prices and sales are heading later this spring.

Royal LePage’s report says that Toronto’s outlook is relatively optimistic compared to the national picture. It projects that Canadian home prices could grow 1 per cent if the economy starts churning again by the end of June.

Read', 'Michael Lewisbusiness Reporter', 'Business Reporter']",2020-03-05,"Variable rate mortgage holders are the big winners from the Big Six banks’ moves to match the Bank of Canada’s 50 point reduction to its trendsetting interest rate.

According to rate comparison website RateSpy.com, variable rate customers will see rates drop by half a per cent for interest cost savings of roughly $500 per year for every $100,000 of mortgage.

Those with adjustable-rate mortgages will see monthly payments fall by about $24 per $100,000, while variable-rate customers will continue to make the same monthly payment but their portion directed to principal will rise while the amount paid in interest will fall. Home backed and regular lines of credit will drop as well.

All of this follows the Bank of Canada’s decision Wednesday to lower its overnight target rate by 50 basis points to 1.25 per cent — the lowest since the 2008 recession — due to fears of a deepening economic downturn caused by the coronavirus and after the U.S. Fed imposed an emergency 50-basis-point cut.

There had been expectations that the banks would not pass on the full BoC cut, but Canada’s largest bank, RBC, led the way Wednesday evening, announcing a 50-basis point reduction to 3.45 per cent for its prime rate effective Thursday, which is used to set the rate at which banks lend to customers with good credit.

The other big banks — Bank of Nova Scotia, TD-Canada Trust, CIBC and BMO followed suit with National Bank of Canada confirming Thursday that it will also lower its prime rate by 50 points to 3.45 per cent as of Friday.

Rob McLister, RateSpy.com’s founder, said the the lowest widely available variable rate will drop immediately to roughly 2.34 per cent from 2.84 per cent, while the 2.59 per cent rate for the lowest conventional five year fixed-rate mortgages will fall in the short term due the lower prime and downward movement in bond yields which normally signal falling mortgage rates. He said fixed rates will trend lower as economic data continues to soften, “but we’ll have to wait and see by how much.”

Many observers expect the Bank of Canada to announce another 25 point rate cut next month — possibly another quarter-point cut before the end of the year, which would bring Canada’s overnight rate to 0.75 per cent.

“The growing risk of COVID-19 to the outlook suggests that the Bank of Canada will follow today’s 50-bp cut in interest rates with an additional 25-bps cut in April,” said Stephen Brown of Capital Economics in a note. “Given lingering concerns that looser policy will boost an already red-hot housing market, however, we think the Bank is unlikely to go further than that.”",[]

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-02-25,"Condos are leading Toronto’s rising luxury real estate market, which is expected to make further gains this year thanks to a low supply of listings and the return of foreign buyers, according to a Royal LePage report released Tuesday.

Luxury condo prices climbed 7 per cent in the GTA in the 12 months ending Jan. 31, to a median price of $2.4 million. By comparison, high end houses, rose only 1.2 per cent to $3.6 million in the same period.

But Steven Green, a sales representative with Royal LePage Partners Realty, said he expects this year will see another jump in prices. He is predicting luxury condos to rise between 10 and 15 per cent in the next 12 months and houses to surge between 2.5 and 6 per cent.

The lack of new listings has continued to drive up prices this month, said Green. As an example, he cited a case last week where six competing offers drove the selling price of a condo near Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue up by 36 per cent beyond asking.

“There’s no supply, so there’s five people looking to buy the same kind of product right now because they had no chance of buying this one,” he said.

Green, who has several Hollywood names among his clientele, says Toronto’s luxury market is being fuelled by the return of foreign buyers since last summer.

Property buyers from Asia and the U.S. are attracted by the city’s vibrant culture and relative safety, and have adjusted to the non-resident buyers tax introduced in 2017. Prices also came down in some areas such as Bayview Avenue and York Mills Road

“They look at real estate differently than we do. We always wanted to buy a house on the quiet street. They have changed the market and pricing for some areas because they want to be buying on the major street or close to the major street because they want the action,” he said.

Prices look high to Torontonians but Green said, “We’re still undervalued for major cities around the world.”

Empty nesters are typically looking for condos in their old neighbourhoods. Condos sell in Toronto for about $1,000 per square foot, he said. Many buyers are purchasing less square footage than they might actually like but they are purchasing for the area.

“So many people are looking for 1,800 sq. ft.-plus and that’s hard to find,” said Green.

Many of those are in Yorkville, the St. Regis at Bay and Adelaide streets and the Ritz on Wellington St. W.

Among Canada’s major cities, Montreal saw the highest year-over-year price appreciation in its luxury market in the year leading to Jan. 31 with 8.5 per cent for both houses and condos. A dearth of listings is also pushing prices there, with homeowners hesitating to list for fear of not being able to find another suitable property, said Royal Lepage. The company is forecasting the median price of luxury homes there to grow by 5.5 per cent for houses and 5 per cent for condos.

The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board is predicting average Toronto home prices will rise by 10 per cent overall this year, including all houses and condos. Last year the average selling price of a resale home was 12 per cent higher year over year than 2018.

Royal LePage’s uses median home values in its different markets, in addition to company data and analytics from its sister company, RPS Real Property Solutions.

The report is based on GTA houses priced at about $3.15 million and up and condos valued at $1.7 million and higher. In Montreal, the luxury designation applies to houses costing about $1.3 million or more and condos at or above about $1.05 million.",[]

The industry lobby group says it represents 90 per cent of global marketing spending, or about $900 billion U.S. a year. About 40 per cent of companies are undecided.

Facebook has come under particular fire from organizations like the Anti-Defamation League, who say it isn’t doing enough to curb hate speech. A growing list of top tier brands, from Starbucks Corp. to PepsiCo Inc. said they will stop spending on the platform, which sent Facebook’s shares down eight per cent on Friday. Still, Facebook is well-insulated from a blue-chip revolt because most of its ad sales come from small- and-medium sized businesses.

Read', 'Lucas Shawbloomberg', 'Lucas Shawbloombergtue.']",2020-06-30,"Netflix Inc. will shift as much as $100 million U.S. to lenders that serve the Black community, making it the largest company yet to pledge cash to historically underfunded financial institutions.

The online TV giant will start by shifting $25 million into the Black Economic Development Initiative, a new fund that will invest in Black-owned financial institutions serving low-income communities, and $10 million to Hope Credit Union. Going forward, the company will steer two per cent of its cash on hand, which currently amounts to about $5 billion, to financial organizations that directly support African-American communities.

News of Netflix’s commitment sent shares of Black-owned banks soaring Tuesday. Carver Bancorp Inc. jumped as much as 173 per cent in New York trading and Broadway Financial Corp. gained as much as 83 per cent.

Large U.S. companies have rushed to show support for African Americans following the death of George Floyd, one of several Black people killed by police in the past few months. Many businesses and rich individuals have pledged money to civil rights causes, including Netflix chief executive officer Reed Hastings, who earmarked $120 million of his personal fortune to historically Black colleges and universities. But his company wanted to propose a solution that addresses more systemic causes of inequality.

Hope Credit Union serves more than 1.5 million people in states including Alabama and Louisiana, but it doesn’t have enough money to fully support the financial needs in its communities, according to its CEO, Bill Bynum.

“We are capital-starved, just like the people in the communities we serve,” Bynum said. “Having a global voice like Netflix say it’s important to invest in financial institutions like Hope is tremendously important, not just for the capital we will use to make mortgage loans and small business loans, but for what it says.”

One employee

Netflix executive Aaron Mitchell came up with the idea of shifting money into Black-owned banks following an April dinner with leaders from different under-represented groups. Netflix has been hosting these dinners since October in an effort to improve diversity at its highest levels and inform its top executives.

Mitchell pitched the idea to chief financial officer Spencer Neumann and began conducting research, reaching out to banks and reading “The Color of Money,” Mehrsa Baradaran’s book about the racial wealth gap. After Floyd’s death, he sent his proposal to Hastings, who expedited the project.

“I have talked to a lot of companies, but this is the first company that’s actually done something about it,” Baradaran said.

Netflix hopes the move will inspire other large U.S. companies to do the same, Neumann said. The streaming service has a small cash pile relative to Silicon Valley peers Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. If every company in the S&P 500 shifted just one per cent of its cash to Black-owned financial institutions, it would translate into more than $20 billion, Netflix said.

Netflix record

Netflix has a lot of work to do on its own. The company has no Black executives among its eight top officers, and added its first Black board member in 2018. It ranked toward the bottom of the pack last year among Hollywood studios in terms of hiring women directors, according to the Directors’ Guild of America.

But the guild ranked the company first in adding people of colour, part of the progress it has made since hiring Verna Myers as its head of diversity and inclusion in 2018. She aided programs such as Strong Black Lead, which highlights projects with African Americans in lead roles. Black employees now make up seven per cent of Netflix’s overall employee base, up from four per cent three years ago. The number of Black vice presidents has tripled to nine over the same span.

“We have been on this journey now for at least the last three years,” Mitchell said. “We still have lots of work to do, but we are making meaningful progress.”

Read', 'Kurt Wagnerbloomberg']",2020-06-26,"Facebook Inc. will begin labelling all posts that include information about voting with a link encouraging users to get facts from the company’s new voting hub, and expands its prohibition on advertising for hate speech.

The new policy on voting announced Friday by chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg means Facebook will label future posts from U.S President Donald Trump, and everyone else, about mail-in ballots or other voting-related issues, regardless of whether they contain misleading information. Facebook will funnel users to a voting information hub meant to provide facts from state authorities. Users will also be able to register to vote using this hub. Facebook has set a goal of helping register four million new voters before the 2020 U.S. election in November.

“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.

The social network has been criticized in recent weeks for allowing false or misleading voting information, including posts from Trump about mail-in ballots that Twitter Inc. flagged as inaccurate. Zuckerberg has said repeatedly that he doesn’t want to remove posts from elected officials, but would rather let users make up their minds about the content.

A number of civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Anti-Defamation League, are among those unhappy with Facebook’s history of allowing posts they say encourage voter suppression. Those groups have organized a Facebook advertising boycott for the month of July, and a number of well-known consumer brands are participating, including outdoor gear company Patagonia, Verizon Communications Inc. and Unilever.

Facebook will now prohibit ads that paint anyone from a certain race, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation as dangerous. The company will expand those policies to better protect immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers from ads that say these groups of people are inferior.

The company will also label posts that it keeps up even though they violate policies, if they come from a newsworthy source, such as the president. “We’ll allow people to share this content to condemn it, just like we do with other problematic content, because this is an important part of how we discuss what’s acceptable in our society — but we’ll add a prompt to tell people that the content they’re sharing may violate our policies,” Zuckerberg said.

Chief executive officer John Donahoe, a longtime Silicon Valley executive who took the helm at Nike in January, announced a new phase in its e-commerce push Thursday called the Consumer Direct Acceleration. He also sent employees a memo, first reported by the Complex website, saying that the changes would probably result in layoffs.

Nike confirmed that job cuts were coming in a statement Friday.

“Consumer Direct Acceleration is the next digitally empowered phase of our strategy,” the company said. “We are building a flatter, nimbler company and transforming Nike faster to define the marketplace of the future. We are shifting resources and creating capacity to reinvest in our highest potential areas, and we anticipate our realignment will likely result in a net loss of jobs.”

E-commerce sales were a bright spot for Nike last quarter, growing 75 per cent at a time when overall revenue plunged. Shipments to Nike’s wholesale customers were down almost 50 per cent in the period, leaving the company with excess inventory.

Unilever, whose many household brands include Dove soap, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Lipton tea, joins a growing list of companies that are boycotting Facebook for varying lengths of time, including Verizon Communications Inc., Patagonia Inc., VF Corp., North Face, Eddie Bauer and Recreational Equipment Inc.

“Based on the current polarization and the election that we are having in the U.S., there needs to be much more enforcement in the area of hate speech,” said Luis Di Como, Unilever’s executive vice president of global media, in an interview.

“Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,” the company said in a statement. Its Facebook ban also will cover Instagram.

The Facebook advertising boycott came after civil-rights groups including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP called on brands to pull ad spending from Facebook for July. The groups said the social-media giant hadn’t made enough progress enforcing its policies on hate speech and misinformation.

Twitter was not a target of the civil-rights group’s boycott call, but it has also come under scrutiny on Madison Avenue.

Representatives from Facebook and Twitter were unavailable for immediate comment

Facebook has taken some steps in recent years to better police its platforms, adding workers and developing new technology. That has resulted in the removal of hate speech and other objectionable content.

“We acknowledge the efforts of our partners, but there is much more to be done, especially in the areas of divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.,” Unilever said in the statement. “The complexities of the current cultural landscape have placed a renewed responsibility on brands to learn, respond and act to drive a trusted and safe digital ecosystem.”

Mr. Di Como said Unilever would like to see a reduction in the level of hate speech on the platforms and wants independent companies to measure and confirm that progress has been made.

Read', 'Molly Schuetzbloomberg', 'Molly Schuetzbloombergfri.']",2020-06-26,"When news broke last month that Amazon.com Inc. was interested in buying Zoox Inc., observers assumed the e-commerce giant was looking to automate its delivery fleet. After all, Amazon already invested in an electric truck maker and is a major buyer of everything from planes to diesel vehicles.

But in a statement on Friday confirming its acquisition of the autonomous vehicle startup, Amazon touted Zoox for its ride-hailing ambitions. Ride hailing? Amazon?

“You say, does it make sense?” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner vice president who tracks the auto industry. “Well, does it make sense that the package delivery company sells me streaming movies?”

Zoox is a corporate investment, not an acquisition to be folded into one of Amazon’s existing businesses, the company says. Aicha Evans, Zoox’s chief executive officer, and Jesse Levinson, co-founder and chief technology officer, will continue to lead the company as a standalone business.

“Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience,” said Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s worldwide retail business. “We’re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.”

Amazon’s corporate development team recently told bankers they wanted to look at any autonomous vehicle startup interested in selling, according to a person familiar with the situation, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.

Amazon shares were little changed Friday morning in New York, while Uber Technologies Inc. fell less than three per cent — in line with the overall market.

Terms of the deal, the latest indication of Amazon’s evolution from online bookseller to sprawling conglomerate, were not announced on Friday. But the Information reported earlier that Amazon would pay more than $1 billion U.S.

Autonomous vehicles have been a target of automakers, Silicon Valley giants and venture capital investors for years. But technical and regulatory hurdles have made getting self-driving cars and trucks on the road a longer slog than boosters had hoped.

Founded in 2014, Zoox had outsize ambition and financial backing. It aimed to not only build hardware and software capable of piloting cars, but to design autonomous taxis themselves.

The Foster City, Calif.-based startup wanted to build a fully driverless vehicle by this year. However, after a 2018 funding round that valued Zoox at $3.2 billion, the board voted to oust Tim Kentley-Klay as CEO. He criticized the move, saying directors were “optimizing for a little money in hand at the expense of profound progress.”

The company last year indicated it was seeking investors and potential strategic partners, a situation made more urgent by the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to layoffs that Zoox characterized as temporary.

In its statement, Amazon highlighted Zoox’s “ground-up vehicle” that “focuses on the ride-hailing customer.”

Despite its challenges, Zoox was one among a few independent companies working on credible autonomous vehicle technology, said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst. “Amazon is all of a sudden real close to being its own automaker,” he said.

The company could integrate future ride-hailing services into its Prime membership program, Ramsey added. And despite Amazon’s assertion that it was interested in Zoox because of its ambitions in ride-hailing — already a fiercely a contested market — Ramsey said Amazon would probably consider using the autonomous technology in delivery vehicles.

Bulking up in driverless technology represents an expansion of Amazon’s already sprawling interests in transportation and logistics. The company, which used to rely on delivery partners like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to move packages from its warehouses to customers, in the last several years has invested heavily in its own capacity to move goods, acquiring planes, vans and long-haul trailers.

Seattle-based Amazon has also invested in delivery drones — though it didn’t meet the goal CEO Jeff Bezos set of having them flying packages to customers by 2018 — as well as sidewalk-crawling robots and autonomous carts.

Last year, Amazon invested along with Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital in Aurora Innovation Inc., a self-driving startup led by the former heads of Google’s driverless car project and Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot team. The company has also backed Rivian Automotive Inc., the electric pickup and SUV maker, and emerged as its biggest buyer, pledging to acquire 100,000 delivery vans designed in partnership with Amazon.

Read', 'Josh Rubinbusiness Reporter', 'Business Reporter']",2020-07-10,"There may be a bidding war for the Toronto Star’s publisher, but we’ll have to wait a little longer to find out.

The deadline to formalize a second offer for the company is now Monday at 5 p.m., buying extra time for technology executive brothers Matthew and Tyler Proud and finance industry executive Neil Selfe to make their offer official. They will be competing with a $52 million offer made earlier by entrepreneurs Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett.

While the deadline had previously been reported to be Friday at 5 p.m., there was some disagreement over whether that was in fact the case and the deadline is now agreed to be on Monday, sources told the Star.

If the Proud and Selfe bid becomes official, Bitove and Rivett have five business days to match the new offer. To do so, they might have to go back to their lender: They were originally planning to finance the purchase with a $55-million loan from Canso Investment Counsel.

The Proud and Selfe bid, made through Canadian Modern Media Holdings Inc., also includes former Ontario finance minister and Ontario Liberal Party president Greg Sorbara.

Selfe’s firm Infor Financial Group is an underwriter for the IPO of legal software firm Dye & Durham Corp., where Matthew Proud is the CEO. Tyler Proud is CEO of technology company Avesdo Inc.

The team has not yet disclosed the source of its financing.

Both bids are still for less money than the $69 million in cash Torstar had on hand at the end of the first quarter. As of the end of first quarter, Torstar was debt free.

A July 21 meeting where shareholders are being asked to vote on NordStar’s offer is still scheduled to go ahead. Torstar’s board has previously said it recommends the NordStar bid, calling it “in the best interests of the company.”

The Proud brothers’ offer is worth 72 cents per share, while Bitove and Rivett’s offer is worth 63 cents per share. Bitove and Rivett initially offered 56.6 cents per share, but that offer was rejected by Torstar’s board. Their current offer was made public in late May after being recommended by the board.

Torstar shares closed at 71 cents per share Friday, down one cent on the day.

Bitove and Rivett have said they intend to take Torstar private. Former Ontario premier David Peterson is part of Bitove and Rivett’s bid.",[]

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-10,"CALGARY - Shaw Communications Inc.’s third-quarter revenue and profit were down from the same time last year due to COVID-19’s impact, but the cable and wireless company still beat expectations Friday.

Net income for the three months ended May 31 fell 18.9 per cent from the same time last year to $184 million or 35 cents per share. Revenue slipped 0.8 per cent to $1.31 billion.

But analysts had estimated just $152 million of profit and $1.26 billion of revenue according to Refinitiv, a financial data company.

“Overall, we delivered Q3 results that were ahead of our expectations,” chief executive Brad Shaw told analysts in a conference call.

“That having been said, COVID and its related challenges will be a part of our story for the foreseeable future.”

The company noted that, besides the pandemic, its customers have been affected by low commodity prices that have weighed heavily on its home province of Alberta.

Shaw said that 90 per cent of its Freedom stores were closed during the quarter due to COVID-19 lockdowns, affecting its ability to add subscribers and sell equipment such as smartphones.

Its Freedom Mobile wireless business added about 2,200 postpaid customers but lost 7,700 pre-paid subscribers. Its wireline business lost 5,100 internet subscribers and 22,000 video customers.

On the other hand, Freedom’s churn rate — which measures how many customers leave — was a company record low of 0.96 per cent.

At Shaw’s business services unit, revenue was similar to last year at $140 million, although it was down 2.8 per cent compared with the second quarter that ended in February..

Shaw Business primarily serves the small- and medium-sized market, and many of those customers temporarily suspended, cancelled or reduced their accounts due to pandemic closures.

The turn of events was disclosed Friday at the Quebec Superior Court.

Shareholders including the Texan fund TPG Capital, the Chinese firm Fosun and the Caisse de depot have presented a so-called stalking horse bid valued at about US$420 million.

The lenders have signalled that they intend to oppose the shareholder agreement, calling it “doomed to fail.”

A representative of monitor Ernst & Young told the court that it believes a negotiated agreement was the “optimal scenario for both parties.”

The creditors, who hold about US$1 billion in secured debt, have until Tuesday to submit their proposal to advisers of the company, which has been deprived of income since its 44 shows were cancelled mid-March because of COVID-19 and prompted the layoff of some 3,480 employees.

Details of the creditors’ proposal have not been released, but according to what has already been disclosed, the offer would maintain Cirque’s head office in Montreal and would not seek financial support from the Quebec government.

The lenders have already proposed a conversion of the guaranteed debt into shares.

Read', 'Aleksandra Saganthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Aleksandra Saganthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"Executives from three of Canada’s largest grocery chains were in communication before launchingand ending temporary wage increases for grocery store workers during COVID-19, but maintain their decisions were not co-ordinated.

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.’s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor’s move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

“Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,” said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

“The decision was our own.”

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a “courtesy email” to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw’s decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized “the news would be public immediately.”

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

“We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,” he said.

He called it “one factor among others” contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis’s email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn’t recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

“In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,” he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

“Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and ... did not inform our decisions.”

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he “wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.”

He said he would “absolutely not” characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

“What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,” he said in a statement.

“The executives all admitted to exchanging ‘courtesy emails’ and ‘courtesy calls’ on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee’s ruling on that.”

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-10,"VICTORIA - Statistics Canada’s labour force survey for June shows 118,000 people in B.C. found jobs and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 13 per cent.

Finance Minister Carol James said Friday the latest numbers paint a picture of cautious optimism with a long road ahead on B.C.’s path to recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gains in May and June bring back about 40 per cent of the total number of jobs lost since the start of the pandemic in February, when B.C.’s jobless rate was five per cent, she told a news conference.

The greatest losses have been in the service sector, but James said that’s also where jobs are being added as accommodation and food services accounted for half of last month’s gains.

Despite positive signs, James said thousands of people and businesses are still struggling, and net job losses stand at 235,000.

She said youth unemployment in particular stands out at 29.1 per cent, up slightly since May, while 45,000 young people did find jobs last month.

Women in B.C. are also more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, James said.

She said the high jobless rate in June reflects increased demand for jobs and confidence that people will have the opportunity to return to work once they start looking again.

James also mentioned the loss of international visitors in the tourism sector, particularly in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, as a factor.

Businesses are restarting cautiously, she added.

“They’re making sure that their employees are safe, they’re making sure their customers will be safe, and people are starting to see that confidence by going back to businesses.”

James is set to provide more information next week on the post-pandemic spending B.C. has made so far, as well as updated revenue and deficit forecasts.

B.C. health officials reported 25 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, as well as one additional death.

That brings the death toll to 187 among 3,053 people who have tested positive for the disease so far, Health Minister Adrian Dix and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a joint statement.

Of 187 active cases, 16 people were in hospital, and there were ongoing outbreaks at two long-term care or assisted living facilities and one acute care facility.

While there are no active community outbreaks, Dix and Henry said exposure is still happening.

“When spending more time with friends and family, whether that is close to home or on vacation elsewhere in the province, we remind all British Columbians to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others,” read their statement.

Read', 'Tess Kalinowskireal Estate Reporter', 'Real Estate Reporter']",2020-07-10,"Tarion Warranty Corp., the Ontario agency that provides new home warranties and regulates the builders of those homes, will have to deliver stronger consumer protections to regain the public’s confidence following scathing criticism of its failures to protect new homeowners, says its CEO Peter Balasubramanian.

His comments Friday came with the release of a plan detailing how the agency is addressing last year’s blistering report by Ontario’s auditor general.

“There is a theme in the AG’s report that there weren’t sufficient resources aimed at consumer services so I think that’s going to be an ongoing focus of the organization,” Balasubramanian said.

Eleven of 25 recommendations to correct those issues have been completed, including clearing a backlog of investigations into illegal building and homeowner complaints, he said. Eight recommendations will be completed by the end of this year and the remaining six recommendations will be addressed by the end of 2021.

Balasubramanian said one of Tarion’s priorities — making its claim process clearer — has not yet been completed although consultations on how to correct the problem have begun.

Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk found that between 2014 and 2018, nearly 10,000 consumer complaints about building defects failed to be addressed simply because forms weren’t submitted on time.

Tarion is looking at creating a grace period for those submissions but the provincial government’s COVID-19 emergency order has suspended those deadlines.

COVID-19 has also stopped in-person home inspections, said Balasubramanian.

In January, Tarion began consultations on interim measures to make its processes more effective and transparent, which included the introduction of a grace period for the deadline to submit some forms.

By the end of the year, Tarion expects to have third-party mediation in place for consumers who dispute its decisions.

Tarion has deployed more resources, invested in new technology and stepped up the quality control of its call centre, after the audit found consumers were being given inaccurate information on the phone.

Still in the works is a new targeted inspection program designed to look at homes still under construction. It’s also a way of addressing builders’ issues before they are repeated, said Balasubramanian.

“We’re not going to inspect every house that’s built but we’re going to try and target risk or claims experience so we can ensure we do it in a way that balances the cost and the benefit,” he said.

Although the government has ordered Tarion’s new executive and board compensation be public, Balasubramanian, who was chief operating officer before being named CEO, did not say what he is earning, only that it is less than his predecessor Howard Bogach who made $769,410 before he left the agency.

Executives will still receive bonuses, but they will be more in line with those of other public agencies, Balasubramanian said.

Consumers, who have complained for years that Tarion was more responsive to its builder members than new home purchasers, said Friday’s update lacks urgency and government oversight.

“It is unacceptable that a number of recommendations will take at least two years (from the date of the auditor’s report) to complete,” said Canadians for Properly Built Homes (CPBH), a non-profit group of homeowners that has been pushing for years for Tarion reform.

It remains unclear how many homeowner disputes have been resolved and how many were cases of homeowners, who simply gave up the fight to be compensated for builder defects.

“Tarion is a wealthy organization and it has ample financial capacity to hire additional resources such as consultants and/or part-time staff to expedite the implementation of these recommendations,” said CPBH in a statement.

It remains unclear when the province plans to activate the Home Construction Regulatory Authority it previously announced as a means to separate the warranty program from the building regulation functions of Tarion.

The government does not fund Tarion. It’s revenue comes from the licensing fees of more than 5,500 builders.",[]

The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 145.18 points at 15,713.82 for a gain of 117 points over the week.

Despite surging infections in parts of the U.S., hopeful news came from Gilean Sciences that its treatment remdesivir helped reduce the risk of mortality in patients.

And Canada’s unemployment rate fell in June, following a similar move in the U.S., as 952,900 jobs were added amid some economic reopenings.

“It’s just a day filled with a little bit of positive news and for now the glass — at least today, anyway — is half full,” said Allan Small, senior investment adviser at HollisWealth.

The market recovery has largely been spurred by the tech sector, which has been helped by people working from home and shopping online. But Friday’s boost in sentiment helped the banking and energy, he said.

In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 369.21 points at 25,075.30. The S&P 500 index was up 32.99 points at 3,185.04, while the Nasdaq composite was up 69.69 points to another record close of 10,617.44 and intraday record high of 10,622.35.

Nine of the 11 major sectors on the TSX were up, led by energy, health care and financials.

Energy gained 3.3 per cent on higher crude oil and natural gas prices.

The August crude contract was up 93 cents at US$40.55 per barrel and the August natural gas contract was up 2.6 cents at nearly US$1.81 per mmBTU.

Crude rose after the International Energy Agency boosted its 2020 demand forecast. That helped Canadian energy companies such as Enerplus Corp. and Vermilion Energy Inc. whose shares were up 8.9 and eight per cent respectively.

Canopy Growth Corp. climbed 8.1 per cent to propel the health care sector while shares of several Canadian banks rose in lockstep with gains in the U.S. banking sector. Laurentian Bank gained three per cent, the Bank of Montreal increased 2.7 per cent and the Bank of Nova Scotia rose 2.6 per cent.

Technology fell with Lightspeed POS Inc. and Blackberry Ltd. down three and 1.8 per cent respectively.

Materials dipped despite gains by forestry companies as gold prices slipped, but remained above US$1,800 an ounce and higher for a fifth-straight week.

While some analysts believe gold is appreciating over fears of inflation and as a result of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, Small is less hopeful about the precious metal.

“When fear is removed or at least when we do get some sort of vaccine in the fall hopefully, I would not be surprised to see gold, that fear premium come out of it.”

The Canadian dollar traded for 73.56 cents US compared with 73.77 cents US on Thursday.

North American stock markets have rallied sharply from March lows but need some sort of catalyst to get to “the next level” and regain all-time highs, said Small.

Read', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Jordan Pressthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"OTTAWA - Nearly one million more Canadians had jobs in June than a month earlier, Statistics Canada says, as businesses forced to close by the pandemic began to reopen and the country continued to recoup the steep losses over March and April.

Statistics Canada’s labour force survey released Friday showed 953,000 jobs were added last month, including 488,000 full-time and 465,000 part-time positions. The unemployment rate fell to 12.3 per cent after hitting a record-high of 13.7 per cent in May.

As in May, even though more people found jobs, more people were also looking for work as the labour force grew by about 786,000 after a gain of 491,000 in May, bringing it to within 443,000 of its pre-pandemic level.

Statistics Canada said the unemployment rate would have been 16.3 per cent had it included in unemployment counts those who wanted to work, but did not look for a job.

Job gains were made in every province, including by 378,000 in Ontario, marking the first increase since the COVID-19 shutdown, Statistics Canada said. It didn’t include any gains in Toronto as restrictions in that city loosened after the survey week.

Despite the good news, economist Jim Stanford said there remains a historic crisis in the job market with high unemployment and hundreds of thousands who have left the labour force altogether.

Also, gains nationally were not shared equally among groups, with women, youth and low-wage workers still slower to rebound, which Stanford said could be problematic if those jobs don’t ever come back.

“I worry about a coming second round of layoffs motivated not by health restrictions, but by companies deciding their businesses are going to be permanently smaller. So that would be qualitatively different and in a way worse,” said Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work in Vancouver.

“We aren’t remotely out of the woods yet, but this was a really encouraging step forward.”

Some three million jobs were lost over March and April due to the pandemic, and 2.5 million more had their hours and earnings slashed. By last month, some 3.1 million were affected by the pandemic, including 1.4 million who weren’t at work due to COVID-19.

Brendon Bernard, an economist at Indeed Canada, said recapturing jobs at the same pace in the coming months will be tougher.

“A lot of areas of the economy still aren’t running at full capacity,” Bernard said. “So while doors may be open and customers might be coming in, business hasn’t come back to normal.”

Despite the overall improvement, the oil and gas industry continues to struggle.

The PetroLMI Division of Energy Safety Canada says direct oil and gas employment fell by more than 6,700 positions in June compared with May, with about 70 per cent of the net job losses in Alberta.

Compared with a year earlier, employment in the oil and employment sector was down 17 per cent.

The overall job losses were unprecedented in speed and depth compared with previous recessions, Statistics Canada said, and the rebound to date sharper than previous downturns.

Ottawa’s response has been equally unprecedented: a deficit of at least $343.2 billion this fiscal year as the Trudeau Liberals dole out some $230 billion in emergency aid.

In June, 28.3 per cent of Canadians aged 15 to 69 reported receiving some form of federal aid since mid-March, Statistics Canada said. Meanwhile, the proportion of households reporting difficulty paying the bills dropped to 20.1 per cent in June from 22.5 per cent in May.

“Without the federal government being there to support Canadian workers, Canadian businesses and the Canadian provinces and territories, we would be in a bigger mess in this country right now,” Hassan Yussuff, president of the Canadian Labour Congress said in an interview this week.

The Bank of Canada and federal government believe the worst of the economic pain from the pandemic is behind the country, but Canada will face high unemployment and low growth until 2021.

In a statement, federal Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough touted the overall jobs numbers as a sign the government’s plan was working, before adding many Canadians still “face real challenges during this time.”

She and other ministers are now reshaping programs so fewer workers stay on the $80-billion emergency benefit, and more get tied to jobs through the $82-billion wage subsidy program.

“We understand the need for those emergency programs. We also understand as we reopen and recover, we have to move away from emergency programs and into stimulus and recovery,” said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

She said there are other issues to resolve around health and safety in the workplace, transit, and child care to help more Canadians get back to work.

In provinces where daycares reopened for children five and under, employment levels returned to pre-pandemic levels for fathers in June, but not for mothers. Similarly, mothers with children under 18 were more likely than fathers to work less than half their usual hours in June, Statistics Canada said.

Job gains have come at a faster clip for men. Their unemployment rate hit 12.1 per cent in June compared to 12.7 per cent for women. And the underutilization rate — which counts those who are unemployed, those who want a job but didn’t look for one, and those working less than half their usual hours — was 28.3 for women and 25.5 per cent for men.

Economist Armine Yalnizyan said the numbers underscore the need to provide child care as well as options for schooling in the fall so mothers can work.

The alternative, she said, could pull back any economic gains.

“It means that even if there are jobs, some women won’t be able to take them because there’s no way they can leave their kids,” said Yalnizyan, a fellow on the future of workers at the Atkinson Foundation.

“So we are looking at the potential for an economic depression instead of talking about paces of recovery and pivoting to building to better.”

The agency’s monthly jobs report released Friday says 28,900 more Manitobans were working in June compared with May, and May’s numbers had already jumped from April’s. Total employment by June had recovered to 93 per cent of what it was in February before the pandemic began — the second-highest rate among the provinces behind New Brunswick.

“We think it’s a very positive step in the right direction,” Finance Minister Scott Fielding said, noting the unemployment rate dropped to 10.1 per cent.

The numbers also show disparities: the employment rebound has been much lower for young people and low-wage earners across the country. Manitoba recorded the lowest youth unemployment rate in June, but it was still well above pre-pandemic normal at 19.3 per cent.

Fielding said the province may rejig some support programs for people who have lost work during the pandemic to target groups still lagging behind.

“If there’s an ability to move some of those (currently allocated) dollars around, we’ll absolutely want to do that to support Manitobans,” Fielding said.

Manitoba has one of the lowest COVID-19 caseloads among the provinces. It has recorded 325 confirmed or probable cases since the pandemic started and, on Friday, marked 10 consecutive days without a new case. Seven people have died, 314 have recovered and four cases remained active.

The low numbers allowed the province to move fairly quickly to reopen businesses, in stages, through May and June. With restaurants and bars allowed to reopen, subject to some capacity limits, the accommodation and food services industries led the province’s job growth.

The Opposition New Democrats said the Progressive Conservative government should not take credit for the job numbers, and that they are a natural result of the low COVID-19 case count.

The NDP also accused the government of making the situation worse by temporarily laying off some public-sector workers and forcing others to take unpaid days off in order to soften the pandemic’s effect on Manitoba’s finances.

“Imagine if all those people didn’t lose their jobs or didn’t have their paycheques cut, we would be so much further as an economy,” finance critic Mark Wasyliw said.

The provincial government initially predicted the pandemic would result in a $5-billion deficit this fiscal year, due to a combination of lower tax revenues and increased spending. It recently revised that to $2.9 billion, but cautioned the estimate could worsen if COVID-19 numbers rise again.

The new analysis compared late-stage trial data with real-world treatment. Gilead will present the findings at the Virtual COVID-19 Conference as part of the 23rd International AIDS Conference, the company said in a statement.

The comparative analysis released Friday showed the death rate for patients treated with remdesivir was 7.6 per cent at Day 14 compared with 12.5 per cent among patients not taking remdesivir. The analysis also found 74.4 per cent of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14, versus 59 per cent of patients receiving the standard of care alone.

Gilead shares gained 2.1 per cent to $76.25 (U.S.) at 9:34 a.m. on Friday in New York. So far this year, the stock has risen 17 per cent, largely powered by hopes that remdesivir will become a widely-adopted drug for treating COVID-19 around the world. Remdesivir was granted an emergency use authorization by U.S. regulators in May. A large trial found it sped recovery by about four days in hospitalized patients.

Foster City, California-based Gilead recently said it would charge U.S. hospitals roughly $3,120 for most patients who need remdesivir, picking a middle ground in a high-profile decision on cost.

The comparative analysis included 312 patients treated in a large, late-stage clinical trial, and a separate real-world study of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity who received standard of care in the same time-period.",[]

Read', 'The Canadian Press']",2020-07-10,"CALGARY - Shell Canada says the Quest carbon capture and storage project north of Edmonton has reached the milestone of five million tonnes of stored carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1.25 million cars.

It says the accomplishment was achieved ahead of schedule and has been attained at a lower cost than expected.

Quest opened in 2015 and cost about $1.35 billion, backed with $745 million from the Alberta government and $120 million from Ottawa.

Majority ownership of the project was sold to Calgary-based Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. in 2017, along with most of Shell’s Alberta oilsands assets, but Shell retained a 10 per cent interest and is still the operator.

It says the cost to operate Quest is about 35 per cent lower than what was forecast in 2015 and, if Quest were to be built today, it would cost about 30 per cent less.

Quest captures about one third of the CO2 emissions from the Shell-operated Scotford oilsands upgrader and transports it via a 65-kilometre pipeline to be stored more than two kilometres underground in a sandstone rock reservoir.

“Widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage is one of the key solutions the world needs right now to help solve the climate challenge,“ said Shell Canada president Michael Crothers.

Read', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'James Mccartenthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"WASHINGTON - A Canadian cabinet minister was among the guests waiting in the virtual wings of a recent Zoom panel when the moderator posed one last question to the chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, promising the discussion would “move to Canada” next.

Rep. Adam Schiff couldn’t resist: “We may all be moving to Canada soon,” he deadpanned.

But as a resurgent COVID-19 ravages the U.S., fuelled by cavalier openings in states like Florida and Texas and a White House determined to resurrect the economy at all costs, the red-alert status spreading across the continent’s lower half has more Canadians than ever ignoring America’s increasingly persistent knock.

An online poll by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies released this week found a whopping 86 per cent of respondents in Canada opposed to letting U.S. tourists north of the border, compared with 11 per cent who supported it. An Abacus Data poll out Friday found much the same thing.

And when Rep. Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat, updated his bipartisan call for a plan to reopen the border, the ensuing Twitter barrage of sarcasm, satire and outright anger belied Canada’s reputation as a bastion of civility, replete with memes of building walls, slamming doors and Bugs Bunny taking a handsaw to the 49th parallel.

Higgins took it all in stride.

“I don’t blame them for wanting us out of there,” the congressman said Friday of the Canadian reaction.

“I have an obligation to be honest, and I have an obligation to always keep trying. And if anything, what I hope will come from all of this is an appreciation for the tale of two neighbouring countries’ response to COVID-19: America’s has been deplorable, and the Canadian response has been fast, strong and united.”

When the outbreak first took hold in North America in March, Canada and the U.S. agreed to close their shared border to discretionary travel while allowing the movement of goods and essential workers to continue. That initial 30-day agreement has been extended three times now, and will surely be extended again before its next July 21 expiry date.

Since March, the U.S. has seen more than 3 million cases and 133,000 deaths, and the crisis is accelerating in states across the union. Florida is breaking records daily for new COVID-19 cases and deaths. In Arizona and Texas, one in four tests is coming back positive. Further north, states like Wisconsin and Michigan are seeing fresh spikes in their active caseloads. Hospitals are again rapidly nearing capacity.

In their letter last week to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Canada’s Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Higgins and 27 other members of Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, urged the two countries to stop kicking the can down the road and draft a detailed plan for the gradual reopening of the border.

“The continual 30-day extensions without a plan for how restrictions will be modified prolongs uncertainty for both communities and creates unnecessary tension as we approach each new expiration,” they wrote.

“We are asking that the United States and Canada immediately craft a comprehensive framework for phased reopening of the border based on objective metrics and accounting for the varied circumstances across border regions.”

That doesn’t mean throwing open the border to Americans, Higgins said. But it could mean redefining essential travel to include foreign property owners and people with business interests or family members on the other side, provided they wear masks and practice physical distancing.

“Never in our lifetime have we had a situation where the health of you and your family is dependent on your fellow citizens to do the right thing,” he said.

“A phased opening could expand the category of ‘essential traveller,’ but (include) certifying some way that you are adhering to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s protocol as it relates to stopping the spread of COVID-19.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a pro-trade conservative and longtime champion of Canada-U.S. ties, has been among those urging zero tolerance at the border until the crisis in the U.S. has passed — a position spokeswoman Ivana Yelich reiterated Friday.

“The premier has been clear: the border must remain closed to non-essential travel until the U.S. has made significant progress in containing COVID-19,” Yelich said. “The recent spike in the number of COVID cases in the U.S. is very concerning. As such, the premier will continue to support restrictions at the U.S. border beyond the July 21 deadline.”

The worsening public health situation in the U.S. has not diminished the importance of cross-border business travel, including face-to-face meetings or technical on-site visits, to the health of Canada’s economy, said Mark Agnew, director of international policy with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Despite the best efforts of both countries, the current border measures have been confusing for some, causing stress and delays even for those who have work permits that allow them to cross, Agnew said.

“It would be helpful for the government to set out the circumstances under which border measures will start to normalize, to enable companies to plan.”

Despite the political challenges the U.S. outbreak now poses for the federal Liberal government in Canada, it’s past time to start thinking about how to ease the border restrictions, said Laurie Trautman, director of the Border Policy Research Institute at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Wash.

“There is an immediate need to be more thoughtful and strategic about how our countries go about doing that,” Trautman said, floating the idea of wider family exemptions and allowing homeowners to visit their foreign properties.

In northern Washington state, law enforcement is growing concerned about the challenge of protecting vacant homes owned by Canadians, she added.

“Grandparents should be able to see their grandkids,” Trautman said. “Exempting these two groups from the restrictions would not ‘open up the floodgates’ and seem reasonable and empathetic to me.”

Barrick Niugini Ltd., the joint venture mine operator that is owned 47.5 per cent each by Canada’s Barrick Gold Corp. and partner Zijin Mining Group of China, suspended production in April and placed the mine on care and maintenance status.

Last month, it announced it would lay off 2,650 local mine workers by the end of July, making permanent temporary layoffs enacted when the government said it would not extend its special mining lease.

In May, Barrick Gold removed Porgera output from its overall 2020 production guidance, dropping it by about 200,000 ounces to between 4.6 and 5 million ounces.

In a news release, Barrick Niugini says the government’s decision to reject its lease extension application has resulted in financial damage to the company and in significant job losses and damage to the local, provincial and national economies of Papua New Guinea.

It says it is seeking to find a solution through the conciliation process to benefit the company and all stakeholders, but will also continue to pursue judicial review proceedings in the country’s national court.

Five per cent of Barrick Niugini is held by local landowners and the Enga provincial government.

Second Cup said in 2018 that it has more than 130 locations across Ontario that it plans to leverage to enter the cannabis space.

Second Cup has undergone a series of restructurings in recent years to try to increase its profits in the competitive Canadian coffee industry and hopes cannabis will help it regain market share.

The COVID-19 pandemic has delivered more troubles to Aegis, which had to temporarily suspend operations at 83 of its 244 Second Cup cafes and five of its 19 Bridgehead coffeehouses.

Wall Street futures were down slightly and Asian markets closed lower. European shares, however, edged up after official figures showed industrial production bounced back sharply in some countries.

Manufacturing jumped 22 per cent month-on-month in France in May, making up for the previous month’s fall. In Italy industrial production spiked 42 per cent during the same month.

The CAC 40 in France added 0.4 per cent to 4,938, while Frankfurt’s DAX gained 0.5 per cent to 12,548. The FTSE 100 in London gained 0.5 per cent to 6,079.

Beyond Europe, investors appeared more cautious, with futures for the benchmark S&P 500 and for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down 0.5 per cent.

In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.9 per cent to 3,383.32 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo shed 1.1 per cent to 22,290.81. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong retreated 1.8 per cent to 25,727.41.

The Kospi in Seoul lost 0.8 per cent to 2,140.25 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 declined 0.6 per cent at 5,919.20. India’s Sensex lost 0.3 per cent to 36,625.60. New Zealand, Jakarta and Bangkok retreated, while Singapore markets were closed.

“The market is concerned about the uptick in cases globally,” said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. in a report. “Money is funneling into perceived safe areas of the market like tech, which should hold up broader indexes to a degree.”

U.S. government data showed 1.3 million workers filed for unemployment claims last week. That is down from 1.4 million the prior week and a peak of nearly 6.9 million in late March.

The improvements have helped validate investors’ optimism that the economy can recover as anti-virus controls are relaxed. That helped the S&P 500 rebound to within 7 per cent of its record, after being down nearly 34 per cent.

But economists point to a troubling slowdown in the pace of such changes, including moderating declines in the four-week average of jobless claims.

Investors are worried that worsening infection levels in the populous U.S. states of Florida, Texas and California could derail a recovery. Some states are rolling back their reopenings, while others are ordering people arriving from hot spots to quarantine.

Other countries including Brazil and South Africa also report rising case totals. Australia’s populous state of Victoria closed its border with neighbouring New South Wales this week to contain an outbreak.

Read', 'Tiffany Karybloomberg', 'Tiffany Karybloombergfri.']",2020-07-10,"With the World Health Organization warning the globe’s 1.3 billion tobacco users are at higher risk during the global COVID-19 pandemic and in need of new tools to quit, it’s calling in the big guns: Johnson & Johnson, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

In a rare tie-up with the private sector, the WHO is launching with its partners a program that includes nicotine patches and artificial-intelligence-fuelled support to tackle both the physical and mental obstacles to quitting at once. Called the Access Initiative for Quitting Tobacco, the program will begin with a pilot in Jordan, which has some of the highest tobacco use rates in the world, the public health agency said, and will eventually be rolled out to other countries.

This partnership “will improve people’s health and save lives during COVID-19,” Dr. Ruediger Krech, director for health promotion at the WHO, said in an email. “Bringing together partners from the tech and pharmaceutical industries as well as our UN family is witness of what we can achieve when we work together both to end the pandemic and, moving forward, to build back better.”

Johnson & Johnson is providing the first batch of nicotine patches, while “Florence,” the AI-powered digital persona designed to help with the mental aspects of addiction, was developed and donated by New Zealand-based tech company Soul Machines. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud support the Soul Machines technology for its widespread use in this project. J&J has already donated 37,800 Nicorette patches worth about $750,000 (U.S.) to help more than 5,000 people in Jordan quit smoking.

For tobacco companies, the initiative comes at a time of heightened controversy over their products. Public health agencies have cautioned that smoking can make the coronavirus more severe. If the program’s a success, it could be a blow to sales of both cigarettes and the so-called reduced risk nicotine products that big companies have been positioning as safer products as their cigarette sales decline.

Dr. Maria Cristina Profili, a WHO representative to Jordan, said the partnership between the health agency and the private sector came about beginning in March, when the coronavirus was spreading around the world. Florence, the AI “digital health worker,” will be on the WHO’s site beginning Friday and can be accessed around the world, said Greg Cross, co-founder of Soul Machines.

“When it comes to quitting smoking, people become embarrassed about trying over and over again,” Cross said. “Digital people can be helpful because they remove the fear of human judgment.”

The AI tool is expected to work well in Jordan, where almost 50 per cent of the population is under age 25, Profili said. The government there has already moved to ban smoking in public places amid the pandemic.

Although around 60 per cent of tobacco users want to quit, only 30 per cent of them have access to tools that can help them do so, according to the health agency, which the U.S. is in the process of leaving as a member.

“Quitting is more urgent now than ever during the pandemic when smokers are more vulnerable to a severe case of COVID-19,” WHO spokeswoman Jaimie Guerra said. “These efforts will help respond to the ongoing pandemic.”

He said B.C.’s successful efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and the willingness of people to spend more time out in public leave him optimistic.

Horgan made the comments ahead of new job numbers due Friday and before next week’s provincial fiscal update.

The federal government’s fiscal update Wednesday forecast a deficit of more than $343 billion and up to two million people unemployed.

Horgan said Ottawa’s deficit figure is “staggering.”

“It’s incomprehensible for regular people. But that is July and we have many, many months ahead of us in the fiscal year, as well as many months ahead of us dealing with COVID-19.”

Despite the size of the federal deficit, Horgan said he will work to keep financial hurdles from standing in the way of B.C.’s recovery plans.

He said the number of passengers on transit and ferries is growing, and television and movie productions have restarted, as well as restaurants serving more customers.

“We’ve seen successes, more and more people are coming out of their homes participating in the economy, going to restaurants, shopping in retail outlets and participating, broadly speaking, in the restart of our economy,” Horgan said.

Last month, B.C.’s jobless rate was 13.4 per cent, with more than 350,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic.

B.C. announced the easing of more restrictions on businesses, recreation and travel last month in a gradual move to a third phase of its recovery plan.

The move permitted hotels, motels, spas, resorts, hostels, RV parks, provincial campgrounds and the film industry to resume operations after being shut down or restricted since March.

“People are adapting,” Horgan said. “People are finding ways to make do in this extraordinary time.”

The province announced 20 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday and no new deaths, bringing the total number of cases to 3,028.

Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the government is preparing a couple of contingency scenarios for a possible second wave of COVID-19 with data collected in British Columbia.

“The whole plan ... is making sure that we don’t ever have to go back to shutting everything down like we did in March,” she told a news conference.

Health officials know more about the virus now, so they can adapt the way the health-care system reacts, Henry said.

The Montreal-based company announced Thursday that it is sending notices to terminate the leases at the 124 stores to take effect in 30 days. The move would affect about half of its workforce of nearly 2,500, including all 366 employees in the United States.

It will also seek more favourable lease terms for the remaining 100 stores in Canada and may permanently shut additional locations if landlords are unwilling to negotiate suitable leases.

It had warned in mid-June that it could begin a formal restructuring depending on the outcome of its talks with landlords.

The company said at the time that it hadn’t paid rent on any of its stores for April, May and June.

The store closures are part of its restructuring plan after it obtained court protection from creditors under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act and Chapter 15 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

“With the upcoming closure of 124 unprofitable stores across North America, we are certainly making good progress in creating a stronger business model for the future and ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DavidsTea and our beloved brand,” company founder and interim CEO Herschel Segal said in a news release.

Chief financial officer Frank Zitella said that with the closure of “a significant number of money-losing stores” it will focus exclusively on e-commerce sale which had a penetration rate of close to 43 per cent in the market before COVID-19.

“All 100 remaining DavidsTea stores have been closed since March 17 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so until further notice,” he stated.

DavidsTea last month reported that it lost $23.2 million last year on $146.5 million in revenues. That includes a US$4.3 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter on US$54.8 million of revenues.

The move by DavidsTea comes three years after Starbucks announced the closure of all of its Teavana brand stores. The coffee giant acquired Teavana Holdings in 2012 for US$620 million.

Aritzia’s adjusted net loss was expected to be 25 cents per share on $108.5 million of revenues, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.

Despite the drop in overall revenues, e-commerce sales grew more than 150 per cent during the quarter.

Aritzia started a phased reopening of stores on May 7. Thirty had reopened by the end of the quarter and 89 as of July 9. Only seven, including four in Manhattan, remain closed.

Reopened stores have exceeded the company’s expectations so far, said Hill, noting the company is viewing the second quarter “with cautious optimism as we prepare for a period of recovery.”

During the first five weeks of the quarter, reopened stores have performed at 55 per cent to 65 per cent of last year’s revenue levels, he said, calling that “well above our initial expectations.”

“We don’t know what the new normal will hold until sometime next year.”

Aritzia’s net revenue for the first five weeks of the second quarter were down 25 per cent to 30 per cent compared with the same time last year, said chief financial officer Todd Ingledew.

E-commerce revenue remains strong, though growth has moderated since most of the company’s stores have reopened, he said, and is currently trending 50 per cent to 100 per cent higher than last year.

Aritzia plans to open five or six new stores and reposition three existing locations, primarily in the second half of the fiscal year. Half of the leases the company has signed were negotiated after the pandemic began and reflect what he called “compelling post-COVID financial terms.”

Aritzia will also open two pop-up locations in New York and Los Angeles this fall.

The real estate opportunity for Aritzia right now is “unprecedented,” said Hill, noting that the company is understored and many other retailers are shutting their bricks-and-mortar locations.

“More premier locations are becoming available and under increasingly compelling financial terms,” he said.

“So much so, it’s hard to determine at this point if our stores were more profitable prior to COVID-19 ... or our new stores will be more profitable as a result of new economics post COVID-19.”

Aritzia is also in a good position thanks to e-commerce growth to expand its product lines by offering different sizes, lengths and colours; as well as new categories, such as swim, intimates, bags, shoes and beauty, he said.

“While this has certainly been a difficult period, it has also been a period of learning and in creating opportunities that weren’t there for us previous to the pandemic.”

Read', 'Wealth Reporter', 'Work', 'Sara Mojtehedzadeh Is A Toronto-Based Reporter Covering Work', 'Wealth For The Star. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-07-09,"Hundreds of thousands of Ontarians are exposed to workplace carcinogens — but only a small fraction of those who get cancer on the job are ever compensated, a new expert report for provincial Ministry of Labour has found.

Poor to nonexistent tracking of occupational cancers in Ontario, “grossly inadequate” scientific capacity, and patchy training for primary caregivers frustrate efforts to prevent, identify, and compensate for the disease, the report says.

That leaves sick workers or their surviving families with little ability to fight their case at the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board — or prevent exposure in the first place.

“We need to have capacity to go out and truly investigate these clusters when they arise,” said Paul Demers, an occupational health expert who led the research and is the director of the Toronto-based Occupational Cancer Research Centre.

“But you need trained staff to do that and currently there isn’t capacity within either the ministry or the WSIB to conduct those investigations.”

Hundreds of thousands of workers in the province are exposed to “known or suspected” carcinogens on the job, the report says. Around 3,000 cancers diagnosed each year in Ontario are caused by workplace hazards; asbestos, diesel fuel, solar radiation and silica have the largest impact on the province’s cancer burden.

But the report found a significant gap between the true number of workers likely to have fallen ill due to workplace exposure, and the number filing for and receiving the compensation to which they are legally entitled.

The study found that the acceptance rate for cancer claims at the WSIB works out to 2.9 cases of occupational cancer per 100,000 workers — a significantly lower rate than other countries. In Germany, for example, the acceptance rate for workplace cancer claims is 15.1 per 100,000 workers.

“We are probably the best jurisdiction overall in Canada in terms of compensating cancer claims but it is still far from what I would hope it to be,” Demers said. “I would say no jurisdiction does great in North America.”

In Ontario, the study found a number of reasons for that. A significant issue is the lack of training for primary health-care providers “who often do not realize that a patient’s cancer may have been caused by exposures in the workplace,” the report says. As a result, many workers never file compensation claims.

“We spend a significant part of our lives at work,” said Demers. “It’s a big part of knowing what our health picture is.”

Ontario also maintains a “very limited” list of just five cancers deemed likely to have been caused by workplace exposure, the study adds. By contrast, New Zealand and Australia recognize some 13 cancers as being work-related — which makes it much easier for workers who fall ill with those diseases to get compensation.

Ontario has dismantled much of its scientific and investigative capacity for detecting and addressing occupational illness, the report found.

While the WSIB used to have an Industrial Disease Standards Panel to review evolving scientific evidence and a team of 10 dedicated research staff, it has now disbanded the panel and has a research staff of two. The board also funds scientific research centres (including the Occupational Cancer Research Centre) but “does not always take full advantage of their research expertise or their findings,” the study says.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labour stopped collecting exposure data in any meaningful way in the 1990s, according to the report.

“Although the Ministry continues to inspect workplaces and requires employers to collect measurements to ensure compliance with occupational exposure limits, copies of the results are not kept and have not been put into electronic form,” the study notes.

“The lack of information on exposure is a major challenge for all workplaces, but especially so for large, complex workplaces with a long history of exposure to carcinogens, such as the GE Peterborough complex.”

A Star investigation previously revealed GE Peterborough workers’ decades-long exposure to cancer-causing substances and their struggle to receive compensation for a range of often terminal illnesses.

“Occupational cancer has been in the news and there has been concern around whether it’s been properly compensated and recognized by the WSIB,” said Demers, who began the project in 2019 with the aim of addressing those concerns “in a more proactive way.”

In the past, change has often been driven by individuals fighting on behalf of deceased family members. For example, years of advocacy by Janice Martell, the daughter of an Elliot Lake miner who developed Parkinson’s disease after exposure to an aluminum dust called McIntyre powder, resulted in the WSIB recently recognizing a link between the powder and neurological disorders — after decades of denying claims for such illnesses.

Spokesperson Janet Deline said the ministry is now working with the WSIB “to review and consider the recommendations contained in the report.

“Occupational cancer, and its compensation, are issues our government takes very seriously, and will continue to address,” she said.

Christine Arnott, a spokesperson for the WSIB, said the “scientific research related to occupational disease, particularly cancer, continues to evolve.

“We thank Dr. Demers for conducting this important study. We are carefully reviewing the report and look forward to working with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development to consider and address the recommendations.”

The study also notes new and emerging hazards that should be addressed now to prevent a repeat of the past — particularly for those in precarious jobs like agricultural workers, who may not have an employer or union actively tracking toxic exposures.

“If they develop cancer it’s not going to be easy for them to identify what caused that cancer or to get the evidence necessary to file a claim,” said Demers.

The study makes a number of recommendations to tackle the gaps it identifies, including updating the list of cancers the province defines as “presumptively” work-related to “reflect the current state of scientific knowledge.”

It also recommends boosting scientific and research capacity, improving data collection, and implementing more robust occupational health education for medical students and doctors.",[]

Buick Encore, Envision, Enclave.

Maybe GM has run out of e-names, because here’s the Buick Encore GX.

Just a gussied-up Encore?

Nope.

They’re both built in South Korea, but don’t share a single nut.

Just the name.

Marketing people get paid way more to make these decisions than I do to question them...

GM calls the non-GX Encore a “subcompact” crossover, so the Encore GX, my tester, I guess becomes a “subcompact-plus” crossover.

It’s a millimetre-by-millimetre wheelbase difference business out there...

Encore GX starts at $26,098 for a front-drive “Preferred” trim level. My tester, a range-topping “Essence” which only comes with part-time selectable four-wheel drive, checked just about every option box and listed at $38,373.

It is built on a new platform, shared with Chevy’s recently launched Blazer.

It’s a handsome little thing, with a bit more character than the two-box concept of most in this class.

My tester sported a lovely “Dark Moon Blue Metallic” paint job with sparklies in it.

It’s equally handsome inside, with perforated leather seating surfaces, matte-black dash top to reduce reflections into the windshield, and also matte-finished metallic door handles and HVAC vents.

The photos here show what the dash looks like — well-designed, with clear gauges and a ton of choices for information displays.

As usual with modern cars, you’ll be months into ownership and still be discovering stuff.

My tester had all the nanny systems, but they’re easy to shut off if you don’t want them. I don’t.

Same for the head-up display.

Android Auto, Apple CarPlay and a Wi-Fi hot spot for up to seven devices highlight the high-techery.

Amazon’s Alexa is available if you’ve got a weekend to spend learning how to use it.

It isn’t quite “natural speech,” but it’s getting there.

Most minor controls are by the dreaded push buttons. At least radio volume and the HVAC system have proper round knobs so you can work them without taking your eyes off the road.

You’ll have lots of places to store stuff, with cup holders and cubby bins galore.

Allergy sufferers will rejoice over the air ionizer system which helps remove pollen and dust from the car.

The front seats are really short in cushion length, so if you like lots of thigh support, this might not be your car. I found it acceptable (I’m five-foot-10), but I didn’t take any long trips.

The main dimensional difference between Encore and Encore GX is wheelbase. This translates into decent rear seat legroom for two (three is a bit of a squeeze).

The rear seat-back split-folds one-third/two-thirds, and the front passenger seat can fold flat for added luggage-carrying flexibility.

The two-level trunk also has decent capacity.

A button on the driver’s door lets you open the power liftgate all the way, halfway (for those low apartment garage ceilings) or to shut it off altogether. Not sure why you’d want that.

The 1.3-litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine produces a modest 155 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m., but a healthy 174 lb.-ft. of torque, which peaks at a low 1,600 r.p.m. and stays pretty much at that level until 4,000.

It scores 9.0 l/100 km city, 8.0 l/100 km highway.

The lowest number I recorded was 8.1; interesting that this was a bit worse than the bigger Jeep Cherokee I tested immediately beforehand.

As they say, “your mileage may differ.”

Sometimes you get into a car, and it just feels right. Both Lady Leadfoot and myself felt this way about the Encore GX.

The engine feels surprisingly peppy with no marked turbo lag. That low peak torque peak r.p.m. number helps here.

It is also surprisingly quiet, not as raspy as most three-bangers.

It cruises at common (if not technically legal) highway speeds with ease.

The nine-speed autobox has a ratio for every purpose; drive gently and you might never see three grand...

You can switch to manual shift mode, but in a car like this, I’m not sure why you’d want to.

The ride is on the firm side by historical Buick standards, but I’ll take that every time.

The steering is light and precise, and the car’s small size makes it feel nimble.

The “AWD” button on the console locks the car into four-wheel drive mode; otherwise, it’s an on-demand deal.

Good weather during my test didn’t give me much chance to test this, but quick acceleration runs on a gravel road with and without the system engaged showed it can make a difference.

So, how does one choose from what must be a dozen smallish crossovers currently available?

They’ve all been market-researched to death, so all offer roughly the same features at similar prices.

Let me make that decision a bit tougher by recalling an old Buick ad slogan: “Wouldn’t you really rather have a Buick?”

In the case of the Encore GX, you just might.",[]

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Former Star Editor Who Is A Current Freelance Columnist. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-07-03,"I was driving out of my neighbourhood one day recently and, as I pulled onto a main road, a car followed me. I didn’t recognize it, or the driver. He seemed to be in a hurry and was right on my tail.

The main road passes a school. Although school’s been out for three months, there are still yellow flashing lights and a sign saying the speed limit had dropped from 50 km/h to 40 and, as I always (usually) follow the rules, I didn’t go faster than 40. Although there was room to pass, the guy behind me didn’t but hung right on my back bumper.

We passed through several traffic lights and finally pulled onto a ramp leading to Highway 403. Every step of the way, he was right there. And I mean right there. One false move and he’d have hit me. Even my wife noticed: “What’s his problem?” she wondered aloud.

Now, two paragraphs ago, I stated that I always follow the rules. I must admit that I sometimes take liberties. In this instance, while driving down the ramp to the 403, instead of accelerating slowly so that I’d be going the posted speed limit of 100 km/h when I reached the merge lane, I had the accelerator pedal down a little further so I was going — ahem — 120 when I pulled onto the highway.

And Mario Andretti behind me, obviously agitated that I hadn’t pulled completely off the road to let him past and was even closer than he’d been previously, just floored it and rocketed past me and across two more lanes of highway till he reached the HOV lane and by then he was going at least 140 and still had the hammer down.

“That boy’s got problems,” I thought, as I eased back to 100-110, like the goody two-shoes I am every time I’m on the highway.

Now, we’ve all had bad thoughts about other drivers. “What a jerk,” we think, or worse. But this time I thought I’d get a learned opinion about what’s really going on in the heads of people who almost seem out of control, or close to it, when it comes to driving.

So I called an old chum, a guy I went to university with way back when, who retired recently as a senior mental health professional with one of the 10 provinces. He requested anonymity, as he’s no longer on the job and doesn’t need the aggravation that controversy can sometimes bring, like: “Why did you put my name in the paper? Have you seen Twitter?”

So I asked him: “What is with these people, anyway?” And this is what he said:

“Your personality is formed in one of two ways, some of which is learned and some of which is hard-wired. It goes back to how you came into the world and how you react to certain stimuli.

“For instance, you can look at some children — line them up in the nursery — and there will be a flash of light or a loud noise. Some will be cool; they won’t react. Others will hear the same noise and they’ll be startled. They’ll start crying because their nervous system gets overloaded more easily.

“So, if you’re hard-wired like that and you’re in an environment that is unpredictable, that could intensify anger. In some cases, you can’t tolerate a lot of tension, which shows itself in different ways: impatience, hostility and aggression, which make people more vulnerable to losing control. Most of us have this in us but we have the self-control to put a stop to it.

“Learned behaviour, on the other hand, is something you’ve seen very early in your life. You see your dad do something and it makes an impression. Those early kinds of experiences are the ones that, unless there’s some sort of positive change, can really get set in.

“We know that during this whole COVID thing, there’s been a lot of stress. People’s tolerances are worn down. The personality vulnerabilities start to come to the fore a bit more. I’m thinking of a former client who was telling me he had to really watch himself and gauge where his anxiety levels were in order to not get into trouble with other people on the road and getting really angry and doing something that would put his family in risk. He wasn’t a road rager but he was able to realize that this was not the better part of who he was.”

I told him I wished more drivers had such insight. In fact, every morning when I listen to the accident reports on 680 News or CP24, I become convinced that most of them are caused by people who don’t have complete control of their emotions, like the guy who tailgated me for blocks and then just missed hitting the back of my truck when he blasted past and onto the 403.

Being on a roll, I continued by saying that I thought it was ludicrous that people are given a licence to drive when they are in their mid-teens and then never have to take another driving examination in their whole life. In fact, I said, people should have to be retested every five years and something should be added: much like people over 80 have to take a dementia test, that every-five-years driver’s exam should include a psychological test and those found to be a ticking time bomb should lose their licence until they go through counselling.

My friend paused, then said that a test makes sense theoretically but he’s not sure if it’s practical. “But it’s a perfectly reasonable question to ask,” he said. “It’s worth talking about and certainly would provoke a lot of thinking, a lot of discussion.”

To many people, that’s all they want to know about tires.

But both Michelin and Pirelli have used the same marketing slogan at various points in time:

“Your tires are the only parts of your car that actually touch the road.”

In other words, tires are not where you should compromise.

A chat last week with Chris Gelinas of OK Tire in Essex, Ont., brought up an issue I had not thought of.

“In these difficult COVID-19 times, when some people are afraid to even leave their homes,” he says, “many people have not got around to switching out their winter tires.”

Winter tires have a more pliable tread compound, designed to conform to varying road surfaces when the temperature dips below about 7 C. They’re not just “snow” tires anymore.

Gelinas points out that running winters all summer, especially in hot weather like we have experienced these past two weeks, could reduce their life by as much as 60 per cent.

By next winter, they’ll probably only be good to nail to your dock to keep your boat from getting scratched, so you’ll have to get new winters anyway.

Make the switch now, and save yourself money in the long run.

Like many businesses, Gelinas’s OK Tire store — officially, “Beau’s All Everything” — has adapted during the pandemic.

Service is by appointment only.

They allow fewer people in the store at any one time.

Each car is thoroughly disinfected before and after servicing.

Each technician wears a new pair of rubber gloves for each car.

They have also gone to an entirely no-touch, paperless billing system. Everything is done using laptops. They take photos of your tires to show you how they look.

“So,” Gelinas says, “don’t be afraid to call for an appointment!”

While these procedures were instituted due to COVID-19, they will likely be permanent because it’s just a better way of doing business.

One thing Gelinas is adamant about — you should check your tire pressures no less than once a month.

Not only might this save you from a calamity if a tire blows, it will improve your gas mileage.

“If the pressures are down by just 2 psi, it can cost you about four per cent in fuel consumption,” he says.

You should also keep an eye on tread depth. If you don’t have a proper tread gauge, a toonie makes a good option.

“Stick it between the tread blocks,” he says. “If the tread comes up to the bear’s paws on the ‘tails’ side of the coin, you’re good.

“If it only covers the silver part of the coin, you’re at about half tread depth, and performance will start to diminish.”

Our conversation went on to include a number of other tire-related issues which we don’t have space to cover here, including “all-season” tires (which I call “no-seasons” because they’re no good in summer and no good in winter either); the newer “all-weather” tires which earn the “green mountain” label and therefore qualify for a premium discount with some insurance companies; tire pressure monitoring systems; and which brands of tires are best (I like Michelins, he likes Toyos, but he will sell you almost any brand, because there is strong brand loyalty in tires).

But we agree on this — a little bit of preventive tire maintenance can make a huge difference.

Not only will it save you money, it will also reduce your chances of being involved in a serious crash.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-26,"Ford is bringing back the Mach 1 model designation on a Mustang after a 17-year hiatus.

First, this is a genuine “Mach” version of a genuine Mustang.

I still can’t believe Ford is using both of those fabled nameplates on a four-door electric truck.

Shame, shame, shame.

Don Frey, chief engineer on the original Mustang, would turn in his grave if he knew what to turn in it for.

The newest Mustang will be a real Mustang. It will be a 2021 model year car and goes on sale that spring.

Prices? Way too soon, but the car will be positioned between the Mustang GT (2020 price, $34,790) and the Shelby GT350 ($76,425).

Obviously a huge gap.

The Mustang Bullitt with which the Mach 1 shares some bits currently lists at $52,500, so my guess for the Mach 1 is somewhere north of that, probably high-50s.

By the way, no confirmation that the Bullitt edition will survive into 2021.

If you want one, it may already be too late.

During an online press conference, Tom Barnes, vehicle engineering manager for Mustang, and Jim Owens, Mustang and Shelby marketing manager, gave a group of Canadian journos some technical details of the new Mach 1.

A revised front end provides extra cooling for both engine and transmission. Some styling tricks like “go-faster” stripes bridge the gap to earlier generations.

As Owens noted, “Anything that bears this badge has to look right, it has to look to its heritage.”

Barnes added, “People who know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a Mach 1.’

“People who don’t know Mach 1 will say, ‘That’s a really cool car.’”

Revised trim inside includes a numbered serial plate.

Ford won’t say how many Mach 1s it’ll build, only that it is a “limited edition.”

I couldn’t even get them to say how many digits that serial number would contain...

Those planning to track the car will probably want to opt for the Recaro seats.

Barnes and Owens suggested “balance” is the key to the new Mach 1.

Their mantra is that Mach 1 will be “the pinnacle of Mustang 5.0-litre performance,” the “5.0-litre” caveat necessary because the 5.2-litre flat-plane-crankshaft Shelby GT350 and the supercharged 5.2-litre GT500 will outrun it.

That’s because Mach 1 gets essentially the same 5.0-litre V-8 engine as the Bullitt, providing 480 horsepower at 7,000 r.p.m. and and 420 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,600 r.p.m. Should be good for 0-100 km/h in the low- to mid-five-second range.

It will be mated to a six-speed Tremec manual gearbox, with rev-matching for smooth downshifting.

It also features the cool cue-ball shift knob.

Shiftless types can opt for a 10-speed automatic, which has been massaged for sportier on-road and on-track performance.

Suspension includes MagneRide dampers, still the best in the game in my view, and stiffer steering shaft, sway bars and front springs.

Bigger and better brakes are part of the deal.

19x9.5-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels are shod with Michelin PS4 tires.

A Handling Package, available only with the stick shift, brings even fatter wheels and tires, and a host of aerodynamic features which generate 150 per cent more downforce than Mustang GT when equipped with its comparable performance pack.

A rear subframe with stiffer bushings and a rear toe link lifted from the Shelby GT350 will further improve grip.

Underneath, a longer belly pan again aids aerodynamics.

The objective was to make the car fast on the track, but still ultimately “street-able.”

I’d love to tell you if they succeeded, but obviously, a virtual car launch can only tell us so much.

The Ford folks think this car is amazing. But then, they would, wouldn’t they?

I really liked the Bullitt, the GT350 and the GT500, so I imagine the Mach 1 won’t disappoint.

Can hardly wait to confirm that for you.",[]

Usually, at this time of year, I’m either at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park north of Bowmanville or at Oswego Speedway in New York state with side trips to Indianapolis and Montreal thrown in. I used to tell my friends that instead of a summer cottage, I had a standing reservation for Room 326 at the Best Western Captain’s Quarters in Oswego.

But because of COVID-19, CTMP has had to cancel all its spectator racing programs so far this year and, as of this moment, there will not be a Grand Prix du Canada. The Indianapolis 500 has been postponed until late August and there is still no supermodified racing at Oswego, but it doesn’t matter anyway because I can’t get across the border.

I was thinking about this the other day and I thought that my wife and I could drive down east to visit my sister in Nova Scotia, but then it struck me: Upper Canadians (and everybody else in the country, it seems) are persona non grata these days in the Maritimes.

Out west, I won’t find police at the borders telling me to get lost, but Canada is a huge place and if you meander, it will take you half your holiday to get to Vancouver and then you would have to beat it home to either go back to work or be ready if your employer should call.

Which leaves Ontario, and according to my good friend Bob Verwey, is there any place you’d rather be? “The great thing about the border being closed,” he was telling me the other day, “is that people can get to experience what Ontario has to offer.”

Now, as well as travelling to races during the summer, I have been on the road frequently the past two years to cover the unveilings of new cars. Anybody who’s spent as much time on planes and unfamiliar hotels as I have (and that includes the world-famous Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo) knows that you always pack hand wipes to give the TV remote a good cleaning, as well as the telephone receiver and the toilet seat.

Now, with all due respect to the hotels and motels in the cities and towns of Ontario, if I don’t trust places like the Hôtel de Paris to sanitize TV remotes when times are good, I’m not sure I would be too happy booking into any hotel in the midst of a pandemic.

But my pal Mr. Verwey reminded me that there is an alternative: people can take a motorhome holiday.

Full disclosure: Bob Verwey sells motorhomes and travel trailers, and rents them out, at Owasco RV Centre, east of Oshawa. He’s a former president of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, which is how I know him.

“You get a motorhome or trailer, it’s disinfected and you can keep it that way,” said Verwey, who also owns three car dealerships and a collision repair centre. “Nobody has to go in there except you and your family. You go into a motel and you think about the virus and who was in the room before you. Not with your motorhome.”

The RV salesman was quickly in full flight. “Some people worry that motorhomes are hard to drive. They’re not. Just get in and drive. All your stuff is in there. You have your plates, forks and knives — everything. You have your stove and fridge. You have your water on board, generators are on board. It’s like your cottage on wheels.

“I was in Florida, at an airport, taking a three-day course (Verwey has a plane and has to take a three-day refresher every year to satisfy insurance and other requirements). We took a motorhome and stayed right in the parking lot. We felt better doing that rather than booking into a motel.”

He said there are plenty of places to park a motorhome or trailer. “Walmart lets you stay in their parking lots because you’re probably going to do your food shopping there and buy other supplies. Truck stops are also free because you‘re going to fuel up. And there are rest stops on the sides of highways all over the province, so you just pull off the road and they all have a place for RVs.”

If you buy, prices for a new trailer that’s perfect for a family of four start at around $20,000. Class A motorhomes (the Taj Mahals of the motorhome set) can run from $140,000 to much higher — but remember: it’s like buying that cottage. If you want to rent, ask Owasco or dozens of other motorhome retailers around the province for a price list.

I’m stuck at home these days, but I’ve always wanted a motorhome. My wife? Not so much. Guess who’s still dreaming?",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-26,"A couple of years ago, I was having dinner with Bill Ford, executive chairman of his family business (name dropper...).

He said Ford could build a year’s run of F-Series pickup trucks — over a million units — and not build exactly the same truck twice.

They don’t, but it just shows the variation in this product line.

Wheelbase. Length. Box size and configuration. Rear- or four-wheel drive. Trim levels. A host of powertrain configurations. A pages-long option list.

My “King Ranch” tester is the pinnacle of the range, named after a huge ranch in Texas, where, not coincidentally, some 40 per cent of this model is sold.

It starts at $71,949; my tester was optioned to a whopping $83,769. The six-figure pickup truck is not far off...

Given that the base F-150 starts at $30,339 (and discounting is rampant among pickups), this is equivalent to the most expensive house in an inexpensive neighbourhood.

King Ranch comes only in the SuperCrew configuration, with a full rear seat, four big doors, the six-and-a-half-foot box and four-wheel drive.

Concerns were raised when this 13th-generation F-Series launched for the 2015 model year because of its aluminum body. Would it stand up? Could any body shop repair it?

But it’s still the bestselling vehicle in the game. Body shops have to adapt.

My tester had the FX4 off-road package, with electronic locking rear differential, hill descent control, skid plates, off-road front dampers and badging to let your neighbours know you paid more for your truck than they did for theirs.

It was painted a lovely sparkly blue, with King Ranch decals and logos all over the place, inside and out.

You might not think that tan leather upholstery would go with a blue exterior, but it seems to work.

The interior is well-executed, and the matte finish on top of the dash reduces reflections.

An eight-inch screen in front of the driver offers bright, clear tachometer and speedo, with smaller gauges for such as fuel level, coolant temperature and oil pressure in between.

Ford’s SYNC3 control system for SatNav et al. has a vastly faster-reacting touchscreen than earlier iterations, and voice recognition which will take some time to get used to, as these always do.

Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a Wi-Fi hot spot, USB outlets front and rear, and 110-volt outlets in the dash and in the pickup bed rank among the high-tech features.

Nice round knobs look after the lovely Bang & Olufsen sound system and the dual zone auto AirCon with its four massive dash vents.

The comfy front seats are 10-way power adjustable.

The three-seat rear bench features a fold-down centre console when just two are aboard.

The rear seat cushion lifts to create a floor-to-ceiling cargo area and reveal hidden under-seat storage.

Cup holders and cubby bins galore, and a massive multi-level centre console bin configurable to your personal taste.

Now, when a truck offers power deployable running boards, that’s a sign the truck is too big. But they did make it easier to clamber in and out.

You must stand back when these deploy to ensure they don’t “ankle” you (adapting the term “kneecap” for a lower portion of your leg).

My tester also had side steps behind the rear doors. Kick a lever and these pop out to ease climbing up to see what’s in the box. Unlike the running boards, these do not automatically retract, so make sure you do so before pulling away or you risk “ankling” pedestrians.

The tailgate has a fold-out step ladder to ease access into the bed, which features hooks and tie-down points everywhere. A wide range of accessories is available to aid hauling bikes, canoes, all sorts of kit.

My tester had the 3.5 litre twin-turbo V6, producing 375 horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque. To it was bolted Ford’s 10-speed automatic, which can be set to Normal, Tow/Haul, Snow/Wet, Eco and Sport modes, to optimize performance for each of those aptly-named settings.

The combination gives good performance, and with 10 ratios, you might never see 3,000 r.p.m. if you don’t push it too hard. This should result in decent real-world fuel consumption.

I left the truck in “4x2” mode because I didn’t do any off-roading, and enjoyed nice weather during my test.

In Canada, you will not be so lucky, so a knob on the dash lets you select “4x4 automatic,” which engages the front wheels as it deems necessary; “4x4 high,” which keeps you in “four-by” mode; and “4x4 low” for the really tough going.

My main complaint with the powertrain is the shifter. You must depress a button in the shift knob to release it from Park, but it’s much too easy to pull the lever all the way back to the “M” (for “manual”) position. Then you’ll stay in first gear until you manually select second. Or until you shove the lever one notch back into Drive, where it should have been in the first place. A stronger detent is needed.

Ride quality with the off-road suspension is a bit firm. Unless you’re planning some serious boonie bashing, I’d leave this box on the order form unchecked.

The steering is light, direct and communicative, and the truck is easy to manoeuvre.

But wow, is it big. The large turning circle makes it a handful in the Canadian Tire lot or a parking garage.

A lot of people have difficulty backing up with a trailer attached because you have to steer right to turn the trailer left. With Ford’s system, turn a knob on the dash left if you want to steer the trailer to the left.

Experienced trailer towers will be confused; newbies will love it.

The F-Series passes my side-view mirror adjustment test — you can crank them out far enough to eliminate the no-longer-blind-spots.

But this truck’s blind-spot warning system is actually somewhat relevant because it extends coverage to beside a trailer which might otherwise be hiding an approaching vehicle.

Sadly, like all Fords, it fails the ignition-off/lights-automatically-off test. Come on, people.

My tester included the “Technology” package, which brings the handy overhead 360-degree camera system, a pop-out washer to keep the front grille camera lens clean, and “active park assist” to guide you into a parking spot.

Normally I hate these things — didn’t you have to learn to park to get your licence?

But with a truck this big, you may need all the help you can get.

Oh, did I mention this truck is big?

The pickup truck market is the most brand-loyal in the industry. If you’re a Ford person, you won’t likely consider a Chevy or GMC, and vice versa.

My daughter Dr. Laura (the veterinarian) has always wanted a Ram 4x4. Diesel engine, of course.

Even she was impressed with the F-150 King Ranch.

I can hardly imagine higher praise.

“All-new” Ford F-150 reveal

In an online presentation earlier this week, Ford introduced what it is calling the “all-new” 2021 F-Series pickup truck, which will go on sale somewhere around the end of this year.

“All-new”?

Well, the 3.5-litre V-6 hybrid engine is new. The 10-speed automatic is now standard across the board. The infotainment system is now SYNC4 and is an in-house Ford product, replacing the BlackBerry QNX platform used previously.

The console-mounted shift lever can be folded down to allow deployment of a huge working surface for laptops and other gear.

Presumably not when you are driving.

Seats that fold flat into makeshift beds so you never have to go home.

More self-driving technologies — just what we need in a huge truck on our crowded highways.

A bunch of upgrades to the pickup box and to in-cab storage systems.

On-board electric power availability for work site or campsite equipment.

Oh yes, the available deployable running boards now go all the way to the back of the truck, eliminating the need for the side step-up assist thing I mention in the review of the 2020 F-Series elsewhere today.

Wow. Call the Nobel Prize committee.

Ford researches the daylights out of its truck customers. No doubt these will be useful modifications to this vehicle.

But, “all-new”?

More than a bit of a stretch.",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-19,"Normally, a new vehicle launch involves presentations by the designers, engineers and/or marketers, followed by a ride-and-drive so we can report our findings about what it’s like to our audiences.

In today’s COVID-19-ravaged environment, a group ride-and-drive is pretty much out of the question. So the product presentations have become virtual, using apps like Skype or Zoom. These allow us to learn about, hence report on, what the manufacturers think about their new babies.

But we can’t draw much in the way of our own conclusions because we can’t drive them.

Better than nothing?

Let’s see.

One such event was the recent virtual launch of the 2021 Nissan Rogue.

We were joined by Nissan executives Steve Milette (president), Scott Pak (senior manager, product planning), Marcel Guay (senior manager, marketing) and Adam Paterson (director, marketing).

The compact Rogue has been the MVP on Nissan’s team, leading the company’s sales since 2012.

The third generation will arrive in showrooms this fall.

Prices have not been announced, but given the ultracompetitive nature of this huge segment, they aren’t expected to be much different from the current range, which is $27,498 to $37,998.

Nissan is confident in the styling of the new truck. The “V-motion” grille, a motif seen on other recent Nissans, is perhaps the main differentiator in a field where, frankly, most people would have trouble telling one from another if you took the badges off.

Rogue is pretty much all-new. Increased use of ultra-high-strength steel (from 19 per cent of the body to 35 per cent), aluminum (hood, front fenders, door skins) and composites (tailgate) yield a body that’s 27 per cent stiffer. Yet the finished product weighs around 40 kilograms less, which is even more impressive when you consider the extra equipment on the new model.

The 2.5-litre four-cylinder engine, while the same size as before, is in fact a new engine, shared with Altima. It provides 181 horsepower and 181 lb.-ft. of torque.

The continuously variable transmission has been re-engineered to reduce internal friction by 29 per cent, which should improve fuel consumption.

A multi-link rear suspension should benefit both ride and handling.

Rogue offers front-drive models in the two lower trim levels (S and SV). Four-wheel drive is standard in Platinum, and available on the other two grades. It runs mainly as a front-driver, but can quickly send torque to the rear wheels as deemed necessary.

Classier-looking interiors offer more room. Nissan’s justly praised NASA-inspired “Zero Gravity” seats are now fitted front and rear.

Loads of storage spaces everywhere, and one-litre water bottles will even fit in the door pockets.

Although some in this class offer three rows of seating, Rogue remains a five-seater. Each of the rear seats has child safety seat attachment points.

The rear doors open 85 degrees, making the loading of stuff, kiddies and notably those child safety seats much easier.

Privacy shades are available for those rear seats, too — unheard of in this class.

The “divide and hide” trunk allows hiding your valuables. There’s even a spot back there for a 3.7-litre bottle of windshield washer fluid, apparently a Canada-only thing.

Nissan seems particularly proud of the 31.2 inches of total screen in the Platinum trim level in this car.

That’s 12.3 for the digital dashboard, nine for the central display and 10.8 for the head-up display, which of course doesn’t count for me because I always switch them off.

Three-zone AirCon (front left, front right, rear seat) helps everyone stay comfy.

Also available is a magic Bose 10-speaker sound system.

Nissan claims the focus in the inside was on quietness. Wind, road and engine noise have been handled with such as acoustic laminated glass, the stiffer body shell and a thicker insulation pad on the firewall.

Nissan’s nanny systems include emergency braking forward and backward, something called “cut-in” protection (somebody must drive on the 401).

With the PROPILOT Assist with Navi-Link in the Premium trim, an auto-resume in the cruise control system will re-accelerate the car even if it has been sitting for up to 30 seconds.

If you drive a lot in heavy traffic, you’re gonna love this.

Nissan pioneered the simulated overhead camera view, which makes parking in tight spots much easier.

Rogue has “tech” covered with a wireless phone charger, a Wi-Fi hot spot, four USB ports, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, standard on all trim levels.

Nissan will continue to aim Rogue at Toyota RAV-4 and Honda CR-V, which remain two of the bestselling vehicles in our market.

On paper, it looks like it will make a good case for itself.

When we get to drive it, we’ll be able to tell you if it has succeeded.",[]

When I was a teen in Niagara Falls, I sold men’s and boys’ clothing in summer at the long-gone Rosberg’s Dept. Store. The pay was good for a high school kid and I learned a lot of life lessons in that place.

I’ve mentioned him before, but a man who had a profound influence on my life was my manager, Morris (Mo) Feinberg. He’s the guy who said to me: “Remember, the customer comes first, even before your mother. And the customer is always right.”

I never forgot that.

When the pandemic struck, my local Ford store called and cancelled an appointment I’d made to have them give my truck the once-over and to change my tires from winter to summer. “We’ll be in touch when we’re open again,” the woman who’d called me said.

Two or three weeks ago, while driving past, I’d noticed they’d reopened. “They’ll call me and book an appointment,” I thought. “That’s what they’d said they’d do.”

About a week after that, I got a text: “Hey Norris, if you haven’t booked your vehicle in for service yet, this is just a friendly reminder to get in touch with us.”

“Gee,” I thought, “they called me to cancel and said they’d be in touch when they were back in business. They opened up and didn’t call me and now I have to call them.”

I called and made an appointment.

Now, pre-pandemic, if you took your vehicle in for servicing, you had a choice: you could wait or they would shuttle you home and pick you up when the job was done. Good customer service. But it’s a different world now. Nobody wants to get sick with COVID-19. When I arrived at my dealer’s, I had to park the truck, lock it and put the keys in an envelope that went through a slot. That was it. I was then on my own.

I don’t live dozens of kilometres away from that Ford store, but it’s a long walk. It’s a pain to take public transit because I would have to wait for a bus and then change to another to get to the street where I live. So I called a cab. (I always carry a mask, rubber gloves and sanitizer with me when I go out, so I felt safe.) And I had to call a cab to go back. And the tab for servicing, plus tire storage, an alignment and some brake work, plus labour and tax, came to just under $900.

When I saw the bill, I said to myself that for $900, they should have provided me with transportation, at the very least.

By coincidence, the very next day I got a call from a friend of mine who owns several auto dealerships in the GTA. He is suffering from serious Formula One withdrawal and wanted to talk about his addiction. Without telling him about my personal experience, I asked him what he did for customers coming in for service.

“We’ve cleared out our showrooms and put up some cubicles because social distancing is very important,” he said. “If someone can wait for their car, they can sit in there and read a book, or something. When they leave, we disinfect for the next guest. Meantime, if the work is going to take longer than a couple of hours, we call an Uber and send them home and then we Uber them back when their car is ready.”

“Ah, the difference in customer service,” I thought. “My friend owns dealerships and has concern; my Ford store is owned by a corporation, which doesn’t.”

If Mo Feinberg was still around, he’d have words with them.

There is another way, of course. What if you could have your car serviced at home? In your driveway, or parking place at your apartment or condo? The service people could come to you. And that’s where LubeVan Mobile Auto Services Inc. (lubevan.ca) came in. I had a fascinating chat this week with Ryan Dach, who founded the business, and Matthew Bingley, the president of the company that services vehicles in the GTA and Hamilton.

They — and there are other similar services out there, although not many — do everything that dealerships do so far as servicing your vehicle is concerned — oil, filters, latch lubrication, check all fluids, rotate your tires and so on. They will change your summer tires to winter and back again and will store the tires for you.

The big jobs — brakes, milky coolant that has to be drained — they don’t touch but will refer you to a proper shop if you don’t know of one. “Nobody should be doing anything surrounding coolant or antifreeze out in the street; it’s a very dangerous thing for the environment,” Dach said. “We want to be responsible in everything we do.”

And while their prices are slightly higher (example: oil and filter = $65 plus tax), they are not out of line and are worth it for the extra convenience.

Most important: I don’t have to worry about getting home because I never left.",[]

Just like my engineering class’s quarterly lunch meeting last week.

Why do I mention that?

Simply because it showed the advantages of using the internet to cyber-connect with like-minded people.

In our class meeting’s case, it allowed more of us to communicate with more of our classmates than a physical meeting would.

First, it enabled those who live far from Toronto to participate. Also, at a “physical” lunch, you’re pretty much chatting only with the three or four people seated closest to you. With the virtual setup, you have more flexibility and can cover more ground.

Likewise with the virtual Yorkville Exotic Car Show, which we have planned for Sunday, starting at 1 p.m. EDT.

You don’t have to be in the GTA to enjoy it, because you can view it live using Instagram.

Just search for the account @yorkvilleecs (for “Yorkville Exotic Car Show”) on Instagram. You can then pick up the live video, which will appear in the upper left-hand corner of the page. At least, that’s what I’ve been told! If you have any issues, find a teenager...

On this virtual show, we will have sessions with a wide variety of automotive experts.

Ron Fellows, one of Canada’s best-ever race car drivers, a member of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a recipient of the Order of Canada, will be showing you the new Corvette C8 from the fabulous Mosport circuit. (OK, it is officially “Canadian Tire Motorsports Park,” but it will always be “Mosport” to me.)

At press time, we were not sure whether Ron would be able to drive the car on the track on Sunday. He and I share at least one thing — we both have driven it, on a racetrack (the Spring Mountain circuit in Nevada where Ron runs his racing school). And we agree — it is beyond brilliant.

Speaking of brilliant, a Porsche 935, the twin-turbo purpose-built race car version of the 911, will be displayed by Steve Bortolotti, manager for Pfaff Motorsports. The 935 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race overall in 1979, and Steve will tell you how it did it.

Yours truly will be on the show, live from Legendary Motorcar Company in my hometown of Milton.

Among the vast array of fantastic cars that Legendary’s owner Peter Klutt has assembled is an extremely rare Ferrari F50 — one of just 399 ever built. I’ll give you a walk-around of this wonderful carbon-fibre-chassis car, the likes of which few car freaks will ever see in person.

Is it red? Does a bear ... well, never mind. Yes, it is “rosso corsa” — “racing red.”

I’m trying to figure out how to jump into it and drive it away. The fact that it’s on the second floor of Legendary poses a bit of an issue.

Vajid Khan is chair of Cars & Chai, a car club whose members apply their passion for fine cars to do good works in the community, such as delivering meals to front-line workers during this pandemic. He will feature his Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, a car you’re not likely to see often in the streets of — well, anywhere, actually.

Over the years, the Yorkville Exotic Car Show has raised money for Prostate Cancer Canada (PCC). Guys like cars. So do many women. But only guys get prostate cancer.

Phil Downe, the founder and chair of the show, notes that to date, the event has raised over $300,000 towards fighting this scourge. PCC is now a part of the Canadian Cancer Society, so the show’s beneficiary is now the CCC.

In these current times, it’s difficult to get much traction about any disease that isn’t COVID-19. But the fact remains that prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among Canadian men. And one of the most frustrating aspects of it is that to a considerable extent, it is treatable, often curable.

The key to either is early detection.

Adding to the frustration is that there is a test that helps determine if you are afflicted. The PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) test is a simple procedure that can give you that critical early warning sign.

The Yorkville Exotic Car Show on Father’s Day has particular significance for me.

First, I am a father — four kids, who are wonderful, thanks mainly to their mom.

Second, I obviously love cars. They are my passion, my livelihood.

Third, I’ve been with the Star for a while now, and the Star is the official media sponsor of the event.

And, I am in that age range, over the age of 60 (yes, I know, hard to believe...), which has to be most concerned about this disease.

Personally, I am on what my doctor calls “active surveillance” — no symptoms or other issues to worry about so far, but it’s a way of circumventing the ridiculous situation in Ontario that prostate cancer tests are otherwise not covered by OHIP.

All other provinces except British Columbia’s Medical Services Plan (MSP) cover them.

Why not Ontario and B.C.?

You will have to ask your MPP.

I mean, berate your MPP.

So especially if you are over the age of 40, doubly especially if there’s a history of prostate cancer in your family — get tested.

Women, encourage the men in your life — husbands, fathers, sons, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, just plain friends — to get tested.

Younger people, tell the older men in your lives — get tested.

It sometimes isn’t an easy subject to bring up. But it’s a lot easier than writing something nice to say at their funeral.

Did I mention — get tested?

True, there have been some issues raised about the efficacy of testing. False positives can sometimes lead to unnecessary treatment.

But it’s still the best weapon we have.

Also, depending on how old you are, the sad fact is that something else might get you before prostate cancer does; despite the advances of modern medical science, the death rate is still 100 per cent.

But there’s no point in checking out before your time is due.

So — get tested. And also be sure to join us Sunday at 1 p.m. on Instagram.

It’s gonna be fun!",[]

It might cost money, but it will be worth it. The insurance companies will love it, because they are sick and tired of being ripped off by the vultures out there. And Ford would likely win re-election in a walk because anybody (and there are many) who’s ever been taken to the cleaners by those outlaws will thank him with their votes.

I was driving down a ramp leading to the eastbound 401 the other day when a grey tow truck just blew past me. It was as if I was standing still. I knew immediately where he was going.

There had been a call for a tow truck further along the 401. And this guy was racing to get to the scene before other tow-truck drivers arrived.

To the winner would go the spoils.

Be assured, there are hundreds of tow-truck companies in Ontario that are honest. You can count among them those connected with the CAA. But there are still way too many crooks and unscrupulous people out there.

The “racing to the scene” I talked about two paragraphs ago is just the beginning. Those thieves are masters at taking advantage of emotionally upset motorists who’ve just been in a crash by hooking up the car (or cars) in question and taking them to the shop of a person with whom they’re in cahoots.

Although, because of legislation, the tow truck is required to post its rates, what unsuspecting motorists often aren’t ready for are hidden charges, like fees to hook up, to unhook and storage while they, or their insurance company, make arrangements to have the vehicle repaired. Which could mean another tow and a whole new set of charges.

Want to pay for the repairs yourself, so that your insurance doesn’t go up? Some body shops will give you an itemized bill, but not the one you’d been expecting. The damage and repair costs are often much higher than originally estimated.

These might seem like exaggerations, but they happen all the time.

The legislation I mentioned was set in motion in 2014 and finally became law in 2018. The laws are fine, so far as they go, but if you’re a crook, they don’t mean a lot. Those guys are professional liars (“I just called CAA on your behalf, sir, and they want you to know that, so as not to hold up traffic, it is OK for me to tow you. I will take you to a really good repair shop I know and they will look after reporting the collision for you”).

And you, as upset as you are, will probably say, “Yes, of course,” because if you said, “No,” they wouldn’t be in business long.

It never fails to amaze me that when there’s an accident on the highway you have the police, an ambulance service, a fire department and several tow trucks on scene. Three are public and the fourth is private. Why is that? Particularly when the evidence of skulduggery frequently committed by the fourth is so overwhelming.

That organized crime is involved is no longer in doubt. York Regional Police recently arrested 20 people and laid charges dealing with, among other things, murder, arson and threats in relation to a turf war and staging serious, multi-car crashes in order to file phoney insurance claims.

Rules and regulations rarely work. It’s up to municipalities to police the industry, but according to the CAA, fewer than 20 of more than 400 municipalities actually have laws clear enough to be enforced. Which means everywhere else is ripe for corruption. For instance, several Ottawa police officers were recently charged for receiving kickbacks from tow-truck drivers; Star investigations have found GTA officers to be involved in the same way.

The only way to clean up this mess is to eliminate the problem. Make tow trucks a division of policing, or EMS, or fire departments. The premier himself was quoted as saying after those 20 charges were laid that, “We’re coming for you and we’re going to catch you. The party’s over.”

This has been building for years and the time is now ripe to do something. Don’t just catch them, premier. Put them out of business. Make the industry a public service and be done with it.

Pros: Stunning interior; excellent ride/handling balance; strong, serene performance.

Cons: Shift lever must be fixed; may not have parking lot attendant cred; not much else.

If you are considering a luxury sedan and don’t give the Genesis G90 a look, you are either prejudiced, misled or uninformed.

The G90 at $89,750 can hold its own against anything.

Yes, Genesis is the upscale division of Hyundai.

Yes, it’s built in Korea.

But it has no shortage of international credentials. The head of the entire company and its design chief (Peter Schreyer) and chief engineer (Albert Biermann) are German. The four-wheel drive system is Canadian (Magna).

It would look as good in front of Monaco’s Hotel de Paris as it would in a Canadian Tire parking lot.

The G90 has been extensively upgraded for 2020. Virtually all the sheet metal except the doors has been changed.

The major visual differences are the massive new grille and unique 1.5-foot “G-Matrix” aluminum wheels.

This interior is swathed in top-quality quilted Nappa leather.

Gorgeous open-pore wood trim and matte-finished metal controls and accents are other highlights.

The front seat occupants get plush yet supportive thrones, 22-way adjustable for the driver, 16 for shotgun. If you can’t get comfy, you haven’t tried hard enough.

There’s plenty of space for four NBA stars, with room for a mascot in the middle rear seat. Unless the other two occupants fold the centre arm rest to gain access to their own HVAC and radio controls.

Rear-side and back window shades give added privacy.

The Thin Film Transistor LCD instrument cluster features tachometer and coolant temperature on the left, speedo and fuel level on the right.

In between, you can select from a wide range of displays.

The mid-dash 12.3-inch touchscreen is bright and clear.

The commands for the voice-activated control system for features such as SatNav seem more intuitive than most in my experience.

A set of push buttons and a rotating knob in the centre console allow access to even more functions. The most commonly used ones like sound system and HVAC are replicated with dedicated buttons so you don’t have to page through a dozen screens to find what you’re looking for.

It may take a while to learn all the touching, swiping, scrolling, pinching and zooming gestures, but I found it easier than many of this ilk.

A lovely analog clock sits proudly in the centre of the dash, and provides an educational opportunity for parents to teach their children what “clockwise” means.

The G90 has connectivity covered, with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and USB outlets all over the place.

The 5.0-litre naturally aspirated V-8 provides 520 horses and 383 lb.-ft. of torque. That latter value comes in at a high 5,000 r.p.m., but the eight-speed automatic provides enough flexibility that the car never feels undergunned.

Steering wheel shift paddles give G90 owners the opportunity to be a more active participant in the festivities.

Or not; it shifts fine by itself.

Magna’s contribution is the full-time four-wheel drive system that directs torque to whichever wheels can best utilize it.

It is rear-axle biased to provide what most customers perceive to be sportier handling.

Four drive modes tailor things like throttle response, transmission shift speed, suspension, steering effort and four-wheel drive traction distribution to suit.

“Eco,” “Comfort” and “Sport” settings are self-explanatory; “Custom” lets you select the combination that best suits your driving style.

The five-link front and rear suspensions deliver excellent ride, and a level of handling you might not expect from a large luxury sedan.

The car has all the so-called “safety” systems that customers seem to want.

Personally, I think people should learn how to drive so they can enjoy driving as much as we enthusiasts do.

The no-such-thing-as-a-blind-spot warning system is as usual pointless, although market research says people like it.

The G90 adds a camera view in the instrument cluster showing you what’s already visible in the side-view mirror, and adds a redundant level of complexity to that screen.

If you have to rely on the “lane following” system that automatically steers for you, you really should let someone else take the wheel.

It’s not that I hate technology. The overhead camera view makes parking in tight quarters much easier. Rear cross-traffic assist can see things you may not be able to see. The forward collision warning system can spot cyclists and pedestrians, which might not otherwise be visible.

Lead/follow cruise control can be a boon in heavy traffic.

The “Safe Exit Assist” system uses sensors to take a peek behind the car when someone opens a rear door, and sounds a chime if something is approaching.

The “Smart Trunk” enables hands-free operation to ease loading of bulky objects.

But the in-windshield head-up display is, as always, just distracting, and draws your eyes away from looking down the road.

I shut this off.

So should you.

On the road, a wide variety of sound deadening and isolating techniques and a rigid body structure contribute to a driving experience that can best be described as “serene.”

Crank up the terrific 900-watt 17-speaker Lexicon sound system and waft away.

The dual personality of the G90 is revealed when you select “Sport” mode. Every control responds more adroitly, the exhaust note is more aggressive and the big car turns into quite the athlete.

Again, the idea of an NBA star comes to mind. How do those giants move so fluidly?

Complaints?

Obviously, not many.

The most obvious (and it’s frankly inexcusable) is a shift lever that somebody thinks is better than PRNDL.

It isn’t.

To select Park in the G90, you have to push a separate button.

My question, as always, is — why?

Sorry; it’s just stupid, and there aren’t many stupid things in this car.

The bottom line is that this car performs, rides and handles as well as more famous luxury-branded cars, which can cost 50 to 100 per cent more.

You must ask yourself: Am I buying a performance car, or am I buying a badge?",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-06-05,"Like a lot of kids, Frank Stephenson started sketching when he was about five, growing up in his birthplace, Casablanca, Morocco.

“I remember my mother shoving me out of the house to get some fresh air, but all I wanted to do was draw,” he reminisced during an hour-long phone chat we shared, socially distanced by the several thousand kilometres between his office in London, England, and mine in Milton.

When he was 11 and living in Istanbul, he was walking through town with his dad. They came across a Ferrari Dino. “I stood there for 15 minutes, staring at that car. Dad finally had to lead me away, tears in my eyes.”

That’s when he decided he wanted to sketch only cars.

He’s been doing it ever since, in the process becoming one of the giants of the car design world.

Following high school and six years travelling around the world racing motorcycles (he still takes his bike out, but only on nice days), he decided to give car design a shot.

He applied and was accepted into the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.

“Just getting in there is tough,” he says. “If you graduate, you’re pretty much set for life. The school prepares you very well for the rigours of product design.”

Thirty students started the four-year program with him. Only six graduated.

His fellow alumni included Grant Larson, who designed the first Porsche Boxster, and Ken Okuyama, who did the Ferrari Enzo.

Heady company.

“When I was halfway through the program, Ford offered to pay for my schooling, which I was happy to accept. When I graduated, I started with them in their European design studio in Cologne, Germany.”

One of his first projects was the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The development of the three-level rear spoiler on the car, subsequently reduced to two, is the subject of one of his YouTube videos. Don’t miss it.

He subsequently worked for a number of companies, including BMW (where he did the X5 SUV, for which I guess I have to forgive him), Ferrari (FXX), Maserati (MC12) and McLaren (P1).

Unlike a lot of car-star designers, Frank also worked on “people’s cars.” The new MINI and the Fiat 500, the reimagining of two of the most iconic cars of the 20th century, both came about under his direction.

I first met Frank at the Paris Auto Show in 2000, where the featured unveiling was that new MINI.

He still bristles about how some commentators at the time viewed this car.

“I was really peed off ...” — about as close to swearing as he gets — “when people said it was a ‘retro’ design.

“Of the 15 designs that were proposed for the car,” he recalls, “some looked nothing at all like the original.

“I didn’t want to copy the old one, but didn’t want to throw away all aspects of it either. You need some sort of a family feeling, a link to the heritage, like the way we relate to our parents and grandparents.”

He talks about the “Golden Ratio,” the number 1.618, also known as “Phi.” This ratio is found in nature and in classic architecture such as the Parthenon in Athens.

He points out that great music also follows that ratio. Beethoven figured it out, and he was so deaf he thought he was a painter.

Not surprisingly then, this number is also found in the length-to-height ratio of the Minis, both old and new.

At last year’s “MINI Invasion,” a celebration of the original’s 60th anniversary, I had the rare opportunity to see both cars side by side. Not until then did I really notice how tiny the original was.

But I also could see certain features — wheels at the corners, short overhangs, “floating” roof and, most of all, those “golden ratio” proportions, which show the family resemblance Frank was seeking.

I can’t draw a straight line with a ruler, so I am always amazed how designers can toss a few lines on a piece of paper and BAM — there’s a car.

He has an idea for a book called “The Three Lines,” where he would take some of the iconic car designs of history and show how you can express them with just three strokes of a pencil.

“If you can draw a car in three lines, you pretty much have a good design,” he says. “The cars that don’t last have lines going all over the place. There’s too much going on.

“Some modern designs seem intended to shock, and they will age badly,” he believes.

One common concern about car design these days is that cars are all designed in a wind tunnel in search of better aerodynamics, hence, better fuel consumption. Won’t they all start looking even more alike than they already do?

Frank points out that what looks “aero” isn’t necessarily “aero.”

“We actually have more freedom now w/r/t aerodynamics than we did before,” he says. “Advances in computational fluid dynamics give us the opportunity to prove that a car that looks aerodynamic might not necessarily be so.

“New approaches to air flow give stylists more freedom than we thought we had.”

He also looks towards the animal kingdom for inspiration.

“Form doesn’t follow function,” he says, turning a design cliche on its head.

“Form IS function. I strive for natural shapes that don’t shock you, but are timeless.”

He likes the term “bio-mimicry.” Millions of years of evolution must have taught us something.

“The cheetah’s design has evolved to let it run fast. That’s how it survives. That’s the true test.”

He makes what sounds like quite a leap when he starts talking about warplanes.

“They are designed for one thing. They do it well.”

To him, that’s successful design.

Aviation is clearly another of this polymath’s interests. He has been working with a company which is developing a battery-powered aircraft that features VTOL — Vertical Takeoff and Landing.

Not much grass grows under Frank Stephenson’s feet.

He thinks a lot about how to stimulate creativity in children. Proportion seems to be innate in creative people, and everybody seems to have it when they are young. Does formal schooling turn that tap off?

“Kids are curious!” he marvels. “Somehow, we switch it off.”

Educators, take heed.

Frank Stephenson’s influence on car design is perhaps best reflected in a current web-based voting scheme, organized by whom, I have no idea. It purports to name the top car designer of all time.

From a list of 64 nominees which includes such as Harley Earl of General Motors who pretty much invented car design as a profession, Nuccio Bertone of the styling house that bears his name, and Peter Schreyer who brought European design ethic to Korea, Stephenson has reached “The Final Four.”

And, he is the only non-Italian in that quartet, the others being Giorgetto Giugiaro, Battista (Pinin) Farina and Leonardo Fioravanti.

Again, heady company.

I have no idea when or how the ultimate winner will be chosen.

If it were Frank Stephenson, I for one would not argue.",[]

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Retired Star Editor Who Continues To Write For Wheels Under Contract. He Reports On The Weekend S Motor Racing Each Monday At Wheels.Ca.']",2020-06-05,"There is a coronavirus threatening civilization, so the city of Toronto decided to fast-track the building of 40 more kilometres of bicycle lanes.

First things first, I guess.

This is, apparently, historic in that it is the biggest one-year expansion of the bike network in Toronto’s history. Just the sort of thing you slide through when people aren’t paying attention.

In any event, I wanted to double-check the facts for this column so I googled “bike lanes Toronto” and a local news site called Toronto.com popped up.

The main story was about the bike-lane expansion, but that wasn’t what caught my eye. Right across the top of Toronto.com was an ad for a 2020 Kia Sorento. Even better, in the shoulder of the story, was another ad for the same car. There wasn’t an ad for a bicycle anywhere on that page. Just car ads (there was another one at the bottom). Now we know which of these two modes of transportation pays the freight around here.

In any event, the story said — and I quote — that the bike lanes will make it easier for commuters to get to and from work during the COVID-19 crisis. Somebody should tell council that nobody is at work during the crisis, including them. They did this while holding a virtual meeting.

I imagine they got these brainwaves after reading stories that were in the Star recently. There was one that caught my eye in which urban designers imagine a car-free road network in post-pandemic Toronto.

This Freedom Ring Road would encircle the city and allow people in wheelchairs, or pushing baby carriages, or walking and cycling to visit the Brickworks on Bayview or attend an open-air yoga class in the middle of Queens Quay. All without fear of being hit by a car.

Will somebody please tell these people that this is not California. We live in Canada. Even in a good winter, it is either too cold to ride a bike or there is snow on the ground five months of the year. Sometimes six.

Yes, some people cycle 12 months a year. Not many, but some. At the Star, there are two that I know of; at the Globe, one guy not only cycled to work each and every day but he and his family always took a January vacation in a noninsulated cabin north of Kenora that didn’t have electricity. (They sure didn’t have to worry about black flies, did they? But the outdoor privy must have been something else.)

Downtown, in the old city of Toronto, is where the cyclists live. And there, within reason, is where there should be bike lanes everywhere. I say within reason because University Avenue south of Bloor is not a good reason. It will prove to be dangerous because it’s a major thoroughfare for traffic coming into and going out of Toronto.

It reminds me of one of the most famous thoroughfares in Europe, the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The Ontario legislature at Queen’s Park is about where the Arche de Triomphe would be. You can get over to Queen’s Park on crosswalks or at intersections; it’s virtually impossible to get to the Arch because it’s in the middle of a traffic circle.

Which reminds me: would the bicycle lobby quit saying things like, “We should be reducing or eliminating cars and car parking on our main boulevards, as is the case throughout Europe.” They say this knowing that not all that many GTA residents have been to Europe. I have. Many times, particularly in the last two years. Cars are everywhere. See my reference to the Champs-Élysées as just one example. And they park on those streets, too.

My take: Most on council forget that Toronto is a megacity. It is more than the Lake up to Bloor and Parliament in the east over to Bathurst. It’s the Rouge River to the 427 and north to the 407 (approx.) and if you’re living out there and working downtown you are not going to ride your bike. Nor are the people commuting in from Oakville and Whitby, or Kitchener and Peterborough. Those people are not Lance Armstrong; they ride the GO and the bus and subway and most of all they drive. That’s right. They drive.

When the pandemic wanes, and it will sooner or later, and the people who can’t work from home go back to the office, they will not be crazy about riding transit. Not for awhile, anyway. Which means they are going to be driving their cars. In fact, dealers are reporting that people are buying again. May sales were way up over April’s. And once they get used to driving those cars downtown again, it will be a long time before they give them up.

City Council has been living in a dream world for years. Times have been good and Toronto’s on top. It might not be, after the pandemic. Those folks would be wise to pay a little less attention to the bike lobby, which isn’t all that big, and a lot more to the car crowd, which is huge.",[]

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-29,"Before our civilization became threatened by the coronavirus, automakers liked to do new vehicle launches up big.

They would take guys like me, sometimes as many as 20 men and women, and fly us out to Newfoundland (Porsche) or Yukon (Subaru) or Utah (Mercedes) or New Mexico (Infiniti) and they would pull back the curtain and then have company experts explain what was new and exciting about whatever.

Then we would drive the new product around for a day or so before flying home.

That was then and this is now. Now is when the unveiling is virtual and, if we’re lucky, we later get to examine a car that’s sitting quietly in a display space in a company showroom. What’s missing, of course, is the drive, which is the really important part.

But giving the product the once-over is better than nothing and that was the case in recent days when I was invited to Toyota Canada headquarters to take a closer look at the new for 2021 Toyota Venza two-row crossover SUV, which will be at dealerships in August.

Right off the bat, let me say this is a fine-looking car and, although the one I sat in was a prototype, feels functional and comfortable.

There is room for five and the company says it will deliver sedan-style driving comfort along with SUV versatility. I spent much of my time the day I was there with Philippe Crowe, a Toyota product consultant, who showed me around the car and emphasized that the Venza is equivalent to the bestselling RAV4, but will be more upscale.

I came away convinced that the automaker is particularly pleased with five offerings: the hybrid powertrain, the car’s electronic all-wheel drive, the safety package, the entertainment and connectivity package and the coup de grâce: a panoramic glass roof.

The hybrid powertrain system (Hybrid System II) matches a 2.5-litre, four-cylinder engine with three electric motors that deliver 219 horsepower and a manufacturer-estimated 5.9 L/100 km in LE trim. (XLE and Limited are the other trims available in Canada.)

There are four driving modes: EV (which means the vehicle can be driven at low speed for a short distance using just the electric motors), ECO (which allows the driver to maximize mileage), Sport (arguably more fun to drive, but making that 5.9L/100 km fuel economy challenging) and Normal (for everyday driving).

Toyota is particularly proud of its Electronic On-Demand, All-Wheel Drive. Two front motors drive the front wheels and a rear-mounted electric motor powers the rear wheels. Torque distribution varies with road conditions.

Toyota Safety Sense (TSS 2.0) is a suite of safety systems that includes a pre-collision program with pedestrian detection and daytime bicycle detection.

Toyota’s cutting-edge entertainment and connectivity is an industry leader. Premium Audio with Remote is standard on XLE and Limited trims and features a 12.3-inch multimedia touchscreen that is almost at eye level and can be operated by either the driver or the front-seat passenger.

Audio Plus with Remote is standard on LE and includes an eight-inch touchscreen.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, as is Bluetooth. The six-speaker audio with four-channel amplifier is standard. The JBL Premium Audio System is optional, but has nine speakers, a rear subwoofer and 12-channel, 1,200-watt amp. Wow. The Star Gaze (which is trademarked) panoramic glass roof, a Toyota original, is sure not your average sunroof. It brightens the interior while reducing direct sunlight. The electrochromic glass technology lets drivers switch from transparent to frosted modes in, literally, a second.

Other features: 18-inch and 19-inch wheels are available, depending on trims; creature comforts include cupholders that can hold large drinks and door bottle holders that can handle 700 ml bottles. There’s 1,027 litres of cargo space behind the rear seat. There are eight airbags, including side-curtain airbags for both rows of seats. Traction control, an anti-lock braking system and Smart Stop Technology add to the vehicle’s safety. There are LED lights fore and aft. Side mirrors are attached to the door rather than the pillar to better match your line of sight. The rear-view mirror can be, well, a mirror or a screen fed by a rear-mounted camera.

The big selling point for Crowe, though, is the hybrid. “I really like the torque you get from the electric motors when all four wheels are empowered,” he said.

“And I enjoy the hybrid because I don’t have to stop for an hour to charge it like I would with a full electric. I can stop for five minutes and fill up the gas tank.”

Vinh Pham, manager of product planning for Toyota, agreed. “The intermediate SUV segment is growing,” he said. “The hybrid powertrain with the phenomenal fuel economy that it gets is exactly what the segment is looking for.”

Stephen Beatty, vice-president of sales and marketing, didn’t want to talk about pricing. “I won’t even put a number on it,” he said. “As always, we negotiate the price with Japan right up until the final minute.” But then he added: “This is RAV4-sized, the hybrid powertrain is from the RAV4, and there are more features ... ”

So go to Toyota.ca and click on “Build & Price” for the RAV4, which has an MSRP of around $32,000 on the low end up to $42,000. That should give you some idea of what the Venza will go for come August.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-29,"The first thing you have to do with respect to Kia’s Sportage is decide how to pronounce it.

Americans say “SPOR-tidge.”

Up here, it’s more likely to be “spor-TAHGE,” with the em-PHA-sis on the second syl-LAB-ble.

Also gives a distinctly French slant to it. Not surprising, given how well Kia does in Quebec.

The fourth-generation Sportage debuted three years ago. Fresh styling and added equipment highlight the changes for 2020.

Prices start at $25,795 for the front-wheel drive LX.

Even at that level, you get useful stuff like heated power side-view mirrors, heated front seats, Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, 12-volt outlets front and rear, two-level trunk with hidden storage and a backup camera with guidelines to ease those tricky reverses.

Another two grand gets you “Dynamax,” among the most clever four-wheel drive systems available.

A product of Canada’s own Magna International, Dynamax uses a series of sensors to automatically engage four-wheel drive when it can be helpful; otherwise, it stays in front-wheel drive to save fuel.

For that nasty cottage access road, you can lock the system into 4x4 mode.

The mid-range EX (4x4 only) at $31,695 brings a bunch of typically useless “driving aids” like “lane-keeping assist.”

(Um, how did you get your driver’s licence?)

And, of course, the “dumb key” fob system, which sadly is almost universal now.

More useful are the 10-way power seats and the heated leather-wrapped steering wheel. (Um again, when is our government going to make this mandatory?)

My EX tester listed at $37,995, which included the “Premium” package (the dreaded leather upholstery, pointless blind-spot warning system, the more useful dual-zone automatic air conditioning, and rear cross-traffic alert), and the “Tech” package (heated rear seats and cooled front ones, a lovely Harman/Kardon sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, and Kia’s UVO telematics system).

Add $200 for the “Modern Bronze” paint job, plus taxes, freight and A/C charge, and this vehicle will run you $40,080. If you think that’s a lot for a compact SUV, you haven’t been following the market.

The range-topper is the SX Turbo 4x4, which starts at $39,995, but I’ll focus on the one I drove.

Sportage is a handsome thing, given that the two-boxes-on-wheels concept doesn’t give designers much leeway.

One knock: the rear turn signals are way too low in the bumper. Given how many people are driving taller vehicles now, these really must be positioned higher.

That bronze paint gives a luxurious look, which continues inside, with good design executed in high-quality materials. The exception would be the matte black plastic panel for radio and HVAC controls, which looks decidedly low-rent.

The main instrument cluster is a paragon of design and legibility. Big round speedo and tach, with smaller gauges for fuel and coolant temperature nestled within.

The “UVO” touchscreen system is integrated cleanly into the dash, rather than appearing to have been glued on as an afterthought.

Many functions are controlled by buttons on the steering column spokes, some of which can only be changed when the car is in “Park.” Occasionally inconvenient; undoubtedly safer.

It will take some time to find out where all the functions are, but that’s true of any modern car. Lots of adjustability in the seat and steering wheel (reach and rake) to find a good driving position.

Lots of room, too, and real adults can fit in the back seat.

The rear seat-back release levers are down on the floor, rather than on the seat backs themselves, as is more common. The seat split-folds in one-third/two-thirds ratio.

As I do in my VW Golf wagon, I removed the rear-seat headrests when no one was riding back there, to improve rearward visibility.

Lots of cubby bins and cupholders throughout, for real-world driving. An open bin ahead of the shift lever handles miscellaneous debris and includes a USB outlet.

A touch of a button gives you the choice of three drive modes. “ECO” dampens throttle response and isn’t as quick to downshift on light throttle application to maximize economy.

“Sport” gives you the most spirited drive, and the seat side bolsters tighten up a little to give you added lateral support, rare indeed at this price point.

“Normal” splits the difference.

I’d need a month with this vehicle to determine if there is any measurable difference in fuel consumption using these different modes.

My guess: probably not.

The 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine (181 horsepower at 6,000 r.p.m.; 175 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 r.p.m.) gives decent performance. But its most remarkable characteristic is how quiet it is — not something you’d usually say about a large-displacement four-banger.

Some credit must go to the sound-deadening “acoustic” glass in the windshield.

The six-speed automatic transmission is properly transparent in operation, shifting seamlessly as needed.

The manual shift feature is backwards, as it is in so many cars. It must be back to upshift, forward to downshift. If I have to tell you why again, you shouldn’t be using it anyway.

Hard to know how much of the Sportage’s nimble handling is down to the trick four-wheel drive system, but it’s a delight, simply going where you point it. Some credit must also go to the Michelin Primacy tires, same ones I have on our Golf.

The steering is accurate and confidence-inspiring.

In sum, the Kia Sportage is a very capable vehicle, and seems to have all the stuff this market wants.

The challenge for Kia is getting people to consider it. This is one of the biggest segments in the Canadian marketplace, with maybe a dozen worthy contenders.

If sprightly handling and high-end features are at the top of your shopping list, Kia’s Sportage is worth a look, no matter how you pronounce it.

Pros: Sharp looks, inside and out; nimble handling; sophisticated four-wheel drive system.

Cons: Rear-turn signal lamps must be repositioned; one measly trim bit on the dashboard takes away from the high-class ambience; manual shift pattern just plain wrong.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-05-22,"Sir Stirling Moss, who went to that Big Pit Stop in the Sky a few weeks ago, was, in most people’s estimation — certainly mine — the best driver never to win a Formula One World Championship.

Actually in my view, he was the best driver ever. His record on the basis of wins versus starts is exceptional.

He came close to winning the F1 title a couple of times, notably in 1958.

During the Portuguese Grand Prix, Mike Hawthorn had spun and was facing the wrong way. He coasted downhill, bump-started the car, turned around and continued to finish second behind Moss.

After the race, the stewards disqualified Hawthorn because he had technically violated a rule about driving backwards on a track. Moss intervened on Hawthorn’s behalf, and the decision was reversed.

The extra points Hawthorn accumulated were enough at the end of the season to beat Moss for the championship.

I had the honour of meeting Sir Stirling a couple of times.

On the track, he was a “first is first, second is nowhere” type of guy; off the track, a nicer man you would never meet.

I witnessed another example of this duality at a vintage sports car event in Freeport Bahamas, back in 1986.

In the “Unlimited” sports car class, Moss was driving a late-1950s Aston Martin. It might have been the very car in which he had won races in Nassau during the Bahamas Speed Weeks back in the day; if not, it was a contemporary of those cars.

Not surprisingly, he was on pole for the first of two races for this class.

Qualifying second was a young man from Minneapolis named Steve Kline. He was in a 1957 “Echidna,” one of three Minnesota-built sports-racing cars constructed from various late-’50s Chevrolet bits, a “Devin” body, and a Chevy small-block V-8 engine.

After qualifying, the drivers were getting in some extra practice. Kline’s engine blew. He was going to miss the chance to race against the great (not-yet-Sir) Stirling Moss!

He roamed the paddock Friday evening, looking for someone who might have a spare Chevy V-8 for sale.

Lucky for him, he found one.

Not so lucky for him, the guy wanted $10,000.

“That’s a $2,000 engine!” Kline screamed.

“In Minneapolis on Monday morning, it’s a $2,000 engine,” came the reply.

“In Freeport, Bahamas, the Friday night before your race, it’s a $10,000 engine.”

Kline’s father was a Chevrolet dealer in Minneapolis. Those were halcyon days for Chevy dealers. Ten grand wasn’t exactly pocket change, but it wasn’t enough to keep Kline from his date with destiny.

His mechanics were up all night installing it.

Kline had no idea how good the engine was, but at least he’d see the green flag.

He even had a video camera — rare in those days — mounted to his roll bar so he would have a souvenir of the time he raced against Moss. Figuring he had no chance against this legend, the camera was pointed straight ahead.

The course in Freeport was a street circuit, tight and twisty, with a few long straights.

The last corner was a 90-degree left-hander, leading to the start/finish line.

The front row — Moss and Kline, with Moss on the inside — took that corner and headed toward the starter’s flag.

Kline heard Moss start to accelerate. He figured, “I better get on this.”

So he floored it.

Turns out, this engine had way more power than his own. His Echidna surged forward, and was at least 20 metres ahead of Moss as they took the start.

Normally in a situation like this, the starter would wave off the start and require another pace lap.

But what the heck — it’s vintage racing, a preliminary heat, we’re already behind schedule, Moss was surely going to pass him soon anyway.

Throw the flag — let’s go racing.

So Kline led into the first corner.

And every other one.

Moss did everything he could to pass Kline. Every corner, he’d feint one way, then the other.

But Kline was smooth, and had way more power.

Stirling Moss had been beaten by Steve Kline.

Hollywood would never dare write that script.

Of course, his video camera had caught none of this, since Moss was behind him.

I wasn’t at this event to cover the races per se, but I recognize a story when one smacks me in the face.

So I scrambled down to the paddock and met Kline as he climbed out of his car, his crew mobbing him.

He was higher than the proverbial kite.

I asked if he’d like to meet Mr. Moss.

“Um, ah, like, what, er ...” he stammered.

I took that as a “yes.”

So I walked him over to meet Stirling, who wouldn’t have known me from Adam.

But when I introduced him to Kline, he was very gracious.

As tough as he was on a race track, Stirling was always a gentleman off it.

Within moments, they were standing beside each other, the arms of their racing suits tied around their respective waists, just two drivers having a cold one after a hard race.

Somewhere I have photos of this moment. But that was back in the days of “prints.” (Readers under 20 years old, ask your grandparents ...).

I can’t find them anywhere.

At the post-race party that evening, Kline and Moss were chatting with the other drivers and fans. Moss was his usual gallant self, telling everyone that he had done everything he could to pass Kline, but the young man never put a wheel wrong, and he just couldn’t get past him.

“He drove a great race,” Moss said. “But tomorrow, I’m going to teach him lesson No. 2.”

Poor Kline lay awake all night staring at the ceiling, thinking, “I don’t even know what lesson No. 1 was ...”

In the feature race on Sunday, the grid positioning was the same — Moss on the inside of Row 1, Kline on the outside. But as they completed the left turn onto the straightaway towards the start line, Moss moved to his right, cutting Kline off and forcing him to lift.

Moss knew from the previous day’s race that the starter was going to throw the flag no matter what. He grabbed the lead, and Kline never had a chance from that point.

Lesson No. 2.

As it happened, Kline’s Echidna broke a U-joint on the last lap and had to limp home on the limited slip differential.

But what racer wouldn’t give his eye teeth to be 1-for-2 against Stirling Moss on any given weekend?

It was the best 10 grand he ever spent.

And just one of a thousand stories about Sir Stirling Moss.

We will not see his like again.

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-05-22,"I have pretty much stayed in my house since the first week of March. We got back from 10 days in Florida on March 4 and I turned on the TV to hear Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, suggest that anyone over 70 (check) with an underlying medical condition (check) should plan to stay inside and out of the line of COVID-19 fire for a minimum of four months.

Uh-oh, I thought.

The following Monday, I had to go to the Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga for a followup on my wrist that I’d managed to break in California last December (“How’s it feeling?” Fine. “You’re good to go.”) and the next day I had to meet my good friend Tim Miller of the Hamilton Spectator at a Denny’s in Oakville for breakfast.

That was the last time I ate out. By March 12, two days later, Canada had started to catch on. The prime minister went on television to tell people to “go home and stay home.” Friday, the country was hitting its stride with the health minister and the medical officer of health adding their voices and suddenly we were in lockdown.

So what do you do when you can’t go anywhere? How do you pass the time? I do a lot of writing for the Star and my own website, but there is still down time. I like to read and I have eclectic tastes: autobiographies of Brian Mulroney, Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, George W. Bush and Punch Imlach, for instance, and videos/DVDs on everything from the Second World War to the third season of Hill Street Blues.

But my primary focus is on all things automotive, with an emphasis on motorsport.

To start, there are DVDs: fact (“Indianapolis 500: the Sixties — a Decade of Change”) and fiction (“To Please A Lady,” starring Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck, about an Indianapolis driver who loses the big race on purpose to prove to his sweetheart that he’s learned there are more important things in life than winning).

There are several F1 documentaries (“Grand Prix: The Killer Years” is one; there are others) that you might watch once but are so grisly that once is enough. And then there is the acclaimed Netflix series “Formula 1: Drive to Survive,” and it really is stupendous. But I’ll tell you this: if I hear the Hass F1 team principal, Guenther Steiner, use the F-word one more time, I am going to scream. He is equivalent to the CEO of a multibillion-dollar corporation and he should show more discipline. I was going to use the word “class,” but I’m afraid he’s incapable of that. Prediction: as long as he’s around, that team is going nowhere.

Anyway, while I watch the occasional DVD, I prefer to crack a book. Here are eight that I’ve been reading since my self-imposed exile began. I’ve read them all previously, of course, so these are rereads. But they are so good I am enjoying every word.

WHEELS, by Arthur Hailey. Hailey was a prolific Canadian novelist whose shtick was researching a subject to death and then writing a story around it. His three most famous books were Hotel, Airport and Wheels. I must admit that of the three, Hotel was the most shocking because Hailey had no problem unveiling some rather unsavoury practices that were commonplace (at the time) in an industry that just about all of us, at one time or another, have utilized.

For Wheels, he spent months at a Detroit auto factory (thought to be the Ford Motor Co.) and while the story is pedestrian, the “reporting” was wonderful. This all took place before automation and the industry has been turned upside down since, but it was hot stuff at the time. He wrote that the worst cars to buy were the ones manufactured on Mondays and Fridays (because of assembly line absenteeism), and for several years afterward, every dealer in North America swore the cars in their showrooms were all built on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Fun stuff.

MON AMI MATE (the friendship of 1950s British racers Mike Hawthorne and Peter Collins), by Chris Nixon. In some circles (I emphasize: some circles), Formula One Grand Prix drivers are seen as being more cultured and sophisticated than their American counterparts. Stirling Moss vis-à-vis A.J. Foyt, for example. Read this incredible book by Nixon, though, and you quickly come to the conclusion that regardless of nationality or social standing, boys will be boys.

Collins, who married a Broadway actress, once exploded with rage when he learned that a South American woman with whom he’d had a brief affair (a.k.a. one-night stand) was pregnant, suggesting she should have taken precautions. (The #MeToo movement would have loved this guy.) Hawthorne was world champion (think about that: world champion) when he was killed in a street race with Rob Walker, an F1 team owner and a one-time columnist for Road and Track magazine.

Boyhood chums, both drove for Ferrari and then died violently within five months of each other, Collins in a Grand Prix at the Nurburgring and Hawthorne on a four-lane highway in England. An impressive read.

BLACK NOON, by Art Garner. May 30, 1964, was one of the worst days in the history of the Indianapolis 500. A California sports car champion named Dave MacDonald, who was a rookie at Indy, was driving an experimental car entered by off-road racer Mickey Thompson, when he lost control during the second lap and the ensuing carnage killed him, veteran Eddie Sachs and injured three other drivers, Johnny Rutherford, Ronnie Duman and Bobby Unser. Everything — and I mean everything — you would want to know about that day and those men is in this book.

WINNERS ARE DRIVEN, by Bobby Unser. Talking about Unser and “boys-will-be-boys,” he was one of the great practical jokers of all time. To this day, Foyt starts giggling when recalling some of Unser’s stunts. Lloyd Ruby tells this story.

“Bobby loved playing with M80s (a firecracker with the oomph of about a fifth of a stick of dynamite). Once we were at a Boy Scout banquet and he put one in a giant bowl of salad. The salad went everywhere. One time we checked into a motel and he was dropping M80s in the toilets, which didn’t help the plumbing. Then he’d start playing with the fire extinguishers out in the hall. Needless to say, we didn’t get invited back.”

At some point, Unser matured and wrote a great book on how to succeed in business and in life by applying the principles and strategies he used on the speedway. Globe and Mail columnist Harvey Schachter gave it a positive review. It’s worth reading because at some point we’ll all be able to leave the house and there might have to be a reset. This book could help.

IACOCCA: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, by Lee Iacocca. Never mind the pandemic. The worst thing that has happened to business, government and publishing has been the “executive committee,” or “inner cabinet.” Why? Because everybody insists on having their say and, as a result, it takes forever to get anything done.

Iacocca, either through force of personality or physical intimidation (yes, that existed in his time and, to an extent, still does) got things done. Ford and Chrysler Corp., particularly the latter, owe much of their success to his skill, expertise and chutzpah. What he said, went. We could use more like him.

THE AMERICAN MOTEL and THE AMERICAN DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT, both by Michael Karl Witzel. If you like “The Road,” you will love both of these books. No, they are not about Holiday Inns and McDonald’s drive-ins (although, did you know the early McDonald’s had carhops?), but how tents, trailers, cabins and eventually motels changed the face of travel in America.

And when the car was king, who had time to go home for dinner when all you had to do was pull into a hot dog-or-hamburger-to-go joint for nourishment? A good number of these places are found along the old Mother Road, Route 66. While we’re in lockdown, both those books are a great way to go on vacation without leaving your living room.

EVEL, by Leigh Montville. A great read about the rags-to-riches-to-rags-again daredevil Evel Knievel, who, over the course of his career, really did break every bone in his body — at least once. I was at Snake River Canyon for the Star in 1974, when Evel went into the river instead of over/across it and will never forget going to the airport in Twin Falls, Idaho (only the late Christie Blatchford and I thought to go out there), where he boarded his Learjet to fly over the jump site and vowed to “dip his wings in salute” to the canyon that had beaten him.

Little-known fact: the last jump before Snake River was over 15 Mack trucks in front of the Grandstand at that year’s 1974 Canadian National Exhibition. Great stuff.",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-15,"“Power corrupts,” said Lord Acton allegedly, and “absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

640 horsepower?

Colour me corrupted.

I just got out of the first 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S in the country. It was a German-spec car brought over for press demos.

Danke schön, Porsche.

Base list is $231,700 for the Coupé, $246,300 for the Cabriolet.

My coupé tester totalled $241,540, bolstered by a few options that included Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM — it wouldn’t be a Porsche feature without a three- or four-character acronym), a $1,720 hit which lowers the car by 10 mm and brings faster-reacting dampers for improved handling with less compromise in ride comfort.

Together with Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (sure, PDCC), which changes the antisway bar stiffness to reduce body roll in cornering, they further reduce the ride/handling tradeoff that has plagued suspension designers forever.

If you have to choose things like adaptive cruise control ($2,280), lane change assist ($1,200) and lane-keep assist ($1,390) as in my tester, maybe you’re not really ready for a car like this.

You are supposed to drive this car; it shouldn’t be driving you.

Visually, the car is hardly a stealth-mobile. The wider fenders, the unique front and rear fascias, the deployable rear spoiler, and most notably the massive wheels and tires (Pirelli P ZERO, 255/35ZR20 front, 315/30ZR21 rear) with huge brakes (420 mm rotors with no fewer than 10-piston calipers up front, 390 mm four-pots at the rear, painted bright yellow) tell you this is a serious car.

Still, compared to the GT3 RS, it’s relatively unadorned. It illustrates the simple beauty of the 911 shape, which has been remarkably unchanged over its nearly six decades of history.

The excellent fit and finish, the minor controls, the comfy and supportive front seats, the rear seats designed for circus acrobats, the trunk up front like an elephant, and the fact that you cannot see the engine at all, are similar to other 911s.

I’ll focus here on what makes the Turbo S version so different, so special.

The 3.8 litre twin-turbo flat six engine pumps those 640 horses and 590 lb.-ft. of torque through an updated PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe) double-clutch gearbox.

Fire it up, and the familiar flat-six exhaust growl greets you.

Pull away, and the first thing to strike you — it’s quick. Bloody quick.

Throttle response is RIGHT NOW.

I attempted some 0-100 km/h runs on a deserted stretch of dead-end road using the car’s built-in timer.

But I was so busy holding on, I couldn’t work the buttons fast enough.

These sprints looked drama-free from outside, because thanks to the various control systems there’s no wheel spin, just the bellow of the car as it disappears over the horizon.

Trust me: the factory-supplied time of 2.7 seconds is no lie.

Of course, at 100 km/h the car is just catching its breath, on its way to a theoretical top end of 330 km/h.

This makes the Turbo S one of the very fastest cars you can legally operate on Canadian roads.

OK, the “330 km/h” part is not so legal ...

What is most impressive is the continual improvement Porsche has made in reducing turbo lag. In this car there’s a continuous surge of power to the red line, upshift, and do it again.

As always, that PDK shifts seamlessly and immediately.

Sure, you can play with the shift paddles, but you won’t be able to beat the machine.

The shift lever is the same as in other new-generation 911s — forward for Reverse, back for Drive, push a button for Park. In other words, they should throw it out and go back to PRNDL — Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Low. That design ain’t broke; stop trying to fix it.

The steering is as precise as you’d expect from a Porsche, and offers what seems to be perfect weight.

The full-time four-wheel drive system is rear-axle biased, but can deliver up to 62 per cent of the torque to the front wheels if it deems it necessary to do so.

The torque vectoring system directs drive force to whichever wheel or wheels can best use it. Along with the electronically controlled limited slip rear differential, it will do its level best to keep you from becoming part of the scenery.

You have a choice of five drive modes via a round knob at the 5 o’clock position on the steering wheel, each of which tailors things like throttle response and transmission reaction to suit.

“Normal” is — you guessed it — for normal driving conditions.

“Sport” and “Sport Plus” up the performance ante in successive, predictable steps.

“Individual” allows you to choose various settings to your own taste. For example, I set everything to be as “sporty” as possible, but backed the suspension off to “Normal” to reduce harshness.

“Wet” actually measures how damp the road is via sensors in the front wheel wells, and adjusts the settings accordingly. I have tested this on other 911s, and it really works.

In “Sport” or “Sport Plus” modes, the PDK will let the engine rev until it hits the red line, but will not automatically upshift. It just chatters away on the red line. You after all are in the driver’s seat.

As you slow down, the PDK will stay in whichever gear you’ve selected until the revs drop too low, in which case it downshifts for you.

But as you re-accelerate to the max, it will again stay on that red line until you hit that right-side paddle.

The uprated suspension in the Turbo S does the business. Ride quality was actually not as harsh as I feared, although those ultralow aspect ratio tires set up a bit of bump-thump on sharp road irregularities, of which there is no shortage here in early spring.

A separate button on the dash allows you to firm up the dampers for even more control. It did make the suspension react more sharply, but frankly, it was difficult to evaluate their handling benefit under these less-than-perfectly-controlled test conditions.

Say, Porsche — when you and Mosport are ready, so am I ...

Porsches, especially the more powerful 911s, have a somewhat sinister reputation for tricky on-the-limit handling, what with all that engine weight hanging out aft of the rear axle.

That is pretty much a thing of the past.

Sure, if you shut off all the nanny systems and really ham-fist it, it might get a bit tail-happy.

But as hard as I dared drive this car on public roads, it remained resolutely stable.

Wish your way around that corner; it follows your bidding.

The car is equally adept at just cruising around, comfortable and tractable. Not the least bit fussy.

The satellite radio was not functioning in my car, and apparently there is no AM radio in Germany because all I could get was FM. Still, the Bose sound system was its usual excellent self.

Every advance in the 911’s development has expanded its bandwidth, with more performance at the sharp end, and more comfort at the other.

The Turbo S continues this tradition.

Unlike a lot of exotics, the Turbo S is a car you could live with, day to day, season to season.

Now, you have no doubt heard the old real estate adage that buying the cheapest house in a good neighbourhood is the best investment.

You can get a 911 that looks almost the same as the Turbo S for less than half its price.

But if you want the ultimate 911, you’ll just have to pony up.

One test drive and you will be making another call to your bank manager.

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-05-15,"In the late 1980s, Bernie Ecclestone, the little firebrand who was in the process of turning Formula One racing from a lucrative hobby into a multibillion-dollar business, had run out of patience with the Canadian Automobile Sport Clubs (CASC), which sanctioned all motor racing in the land, professional as well as amateur.

In Ecclestone’s mind, the CASC — an arm of the international motoring authority FIA — had botched negotiations with the country’s top two brewers, Labatt and Molson, over rights to sponsor the F1 Grand Prix of Canada, which — among other things — had resulted in the cancellation of the race in 1987.

Ecclestone had the ear of Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the FIA at the time, mainly because of the clout he carried as president of the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA). Without FOCA, there would be no Formula One.

He convinced Balestre (which wasn’t hard) that the amateur CASC had to go, to be replaced by a professional National Sporting Authority (ASN). Shortly after, the CASC was expelled from the FIA. Ecclestone then had Balestre put his pal, Benoit Mailloux, who was president of the FAQ (Federation de l’Automobile Quebec), in charge of all Canadian motorsport.

This did not go over well in many quarters, with critics suggesting the move was only good for the Grand Prix and not much else. In fact, rally drivers and teams were sufficiently concerned that they broke away to create the Canadian Association of Rallysport that would govern rallying.

In 1990, a company incorporated as ASN Canada FIA, took over from Mailloux, who was only too happy to hand over the keys to Roger Peart, president, and vice-president Paul B. Cooke. Peart and Cooke, through their ASN, then sanctioned road course and street racing for 30 years.

Late last year, they resigned from the FIA, a move that was unexpected. Yes, Peart was in his 80s and in ill health but Cooke, also in his 80s, had assumed the presidency and had not even hinted that he was going to throw in the towel. There was no succession plan either, so the resignation, which became official Dec. 31, left a void and a number of constituencies — 10, in total — rushed to fill it.

Several weeks ago, Jean Todt, president of the FIA, announced that Francois Dumontier, president and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Ron Fellows, retired racer and co-owner of what is now known as Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, operating as GDS (Groupe de Development Sportif), would head up the new ASN. This week, Fellows announced that the retired CEO of Canadian Tire, Stephen Wetmore, had agreed to be part of the executive team.

As was the case in the late 1980s and 1990, and which explains the previous eight paragraphs of background, this has not gone over well with many in the racing community, with some suggesting that, in the end, only the Grand Prix and perhaps CTMP will benefit.

As they say, its déjà vu all over again.

As was the case that led to the creation of CARS in 1990, the five racing regions in the country are currently split over these developments, with the presidents of two regions going so far as to write the FIA suggesting it not pay any attention to an application put forward by someone from a third region. Which is exactly the sort of behaviour that had Ecclestone rolling his eyes in the first place.

You’d think people would have learned.

The difficulty with volunteers, whether it’s a service club or a fundraising campaign or people administering motorsport in Canada, is that, often, competing agendas are at work and more than one person wants to be the boss. Professional organizations operate differently. You are on the team, or not. There are few grey areas.

At last count, there are nearly 250 ASNs in the world. Jean Todt, president of the FIA, has lots on the go at the moment, starting with the pandemic that has brought the world to its knees and including 70th anniversary celebrations of F1. I suggest he does not have a lot of time to worry about who is going to run racing in Canada and even after accepting recommendations from his vice-presidents and other advisers, he went with the guys he knew, which is pretty much how the real world works.

But in so doing, Todt went against the FIA’s Code of Conduct, which can be interpreted as saying that promoters can’t be part of ASNs. This is particularly bothersome to two of the people I talked to before sitting down to write this situational. They are Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame and a pioneer in motorsports medicine, and Michael Kaerne, national steward for the Grand Prix and a past president of the Canadian Association of Car Clubs (CACC), which governs motorsports in British Columbia.

Said Kaerne: “If you look at the FIA statutes, the ethics and the Code of Conduct statues, under 2.2, it specifically says that promoters may not be part of an ASN. They’ve gone against their own statutes. That in itself should be a red flag.”

Scully was not as forthcoming in his criticism but agreed there was a problem.

But according to vice-president Fellows, that shouldn’t be a concern because the regions will continue to run amateur racing as they always have while the commercial side will concentrate on attracting money — “Right now, there is no money. None” — in order to create a structure to build a ladder system for young Canadian racers to advance in the sport beyond karting.

So far as money is concerned, the previous ASN had no such problems when it set up shop in 1990.

“It was the best of times for racing in this country,” Fellows said. “You had three major homegrown series sponsoring three different categories of racing and one of the sponsors of one of those series (Imperial Tobacco) was also building a driver development program. There was plenty of money flowing and it was a much easier time for revenue for the sanctioning body.

“The issue with the new sanctioning body is that we’re at a low point and our ability to attract some commercial interest is part of the plan. That’s the way we can grow this. Having the sporting authority supported by licensing and a couple of sanctioning deals is not financially viable. There aren’t enough people in this country with racing licences to support that.”

For his part, Dumontier said it became apparent a year or two ago that the previous ASN would not be able to carry on much longer and so he contacted Fellows.

“It was clear that we were the two biggest in the sport and it was natural for us to be involved,” he said. “At some point we decided to put in our own application. I met Jean (Todt) at our event in Montreal in June (the Grand Prix) and then again in January in Paris. The FIA World Motorsport Council met in April and our application for a new ASN was accepted.”

Dumontier said, like Fellows, that they plan to let the regions administer amateur motorsports in their jurisdictions while the new ASN will concentrate on the commercial side. This, in turn, will let them work with the regions, “to go back to the grassroots.”

“As you know,” he said, “since we lost Player’s (Imperial Tobacco), it was never replaced so we have to try to create a ladder series to bring the young kids to perform on the larger stage. We are lucky enough to have two Canadian drivers in the F1 championship (Lance Stroll and Nicholas Latifi) and we know why that is (family money), so we have to create something for the young people who don’t have that level of support. It’s part of the vision that Ron and I have to grow the sport.”

To that end, Dumontier said he, Fellows and others on the executive board want to promote more international events in the country.

“There is nothing specific at the moment, but in my discussions with Jean Todt, Canada is seen as a country with a great racing tradition. The Grand Prix has been here for more than 50 years and Jean would like to see more international events in the country. I’m on the same page. We are going to work with the FIA to see what we can bring and where.”

Dumontier said that right from the beginning, “we said in our application to start an ASN that the regions have to be involved and we wanted to work with the regions. They had an application of their own (to start an ASN) but they had disagreements, primarily from one guy, from the western side of the country.”

That, of course, would be Michael Kaerne, who freely admits to being “a s- disturber. I had to ask the hard questions (of the previous ASN) because somebody had to do that.”

Kaerne, a former driver, mechanic, president of CACC and national steward for the Grand Prix, acknowledges that he undoubtedly browned off some of his counterparts across the country when he unilaterally incorporated a not-for-profit federal corporation, Motorsport Canada ASN, in order to apply for a new Canadian ASN.

But he is well connected with senior FIA officials and suggests the process — despite that letter of objection sent to the FIA by the leaders of two of the five regions — eventually came down to three applications: his, one from the U.K. (Gary O’Hare, who operates a racing school in the U.K and Quebec) and the Dumontier-Fellows bid. The one from the U.K. was subsequently rejected and Kaerne says that the World Motorsport Council “wanted Francois and I to try to work together.”

“So I got hold of Francois and he said that he’d have to talk to Ron and that he’d get back to me but he never did. So I tailored my proposal to include Francois as representative of all the motorsport promoters in Canada and sent that in. It turned out that Francois’ proposal was the only one put up for a vote.”

Kaerne thinks he knows what happened.

“Francois had been agitating for a new ASN for at least two years,” he said. “At Montreal last year, he made a deal with Jean Todt, who’s a friend of his, and so things kind of went from there.”

But there is a bad taste in some mouths.

“I don’t think WCMA (Manitoba and the Prairies), CACC (British Columbia) and, the last time I talked to them, Ontario (CASC-OR) are planning to join Francois’ ASN. ASQ (Quebec) will, because there is a connection there; we don’t know about ARMS (Atlantic Region Motor Sports, which was asked to comment for this story but declined after initially saying it would).

In the end, Kaerne doesn’t think amateur racing needs the new ASN.

“The thing about the regions,” he said, “is that we only need the FIA for international licenses, or to put on listed events (international races) and because we’re not the promoters of listed events, it’s not a real requirement. We have the same insurance policy as we got through (the previous) ASN Canada and we’ve done that individually.

“We haven’t heard anything from Francois in regards to his plans. He’s said previously that he would have a representative of the regions on his board but nothing’s been brought forward. The regions could keep things going; whether it would be as healthy or healthier is another question,” adding that despite the difficulties, there are advantages to being affiliated with the governing ASN, such as a financial payment for including FIA rules in regional regulations.

So there you have it. There’s more — much more — but I’m sure you get the picture. Scully, the doctor who got into motorsport in the 1960s when he went to Mosport Park for a race and was appalled at the lack of medical facilities (“There were none”) and subsequently founded the Ontario Race Physicians organization that, to this day, staffs motorsport events, said in an interview that he stands ready to chair a meeting in an effort to solve the impasse.

“I’ve been around Canadian racing a long time,” said the chairman of the Hall of Fame, “and served on medical commissions at the international level, and I can converse in both official languages. I have the skills to bring people together to reach a consensus (he’s a former president of the Ontario and Canadian Medical Associations) and I’m ready to answer an invitation to do that if one should be forthcoming.”

My take: Despite the hurt feelings, and the evidence of politics at play (as in, the fix might have been in), Francois Dumontier and Ron Fellows are the people who should run motorsport in Canada. The world has changed (no, I’m not talking about the pandemic) and a professional ASN is preferable to one composed of amateurs.

In order for motorsport in Canada to grow, not just in Ontario and Quebec but everywhere, a ladder system of both open and closed-wheel racing must be established and for that to happen you need money. Dumontier and Fellows, with the help of new member Wetmore, have a better chance of getting into boardrooms to pitch for it than just about anybody else involved in Canadian racing, Once upon a time the tobacco companies poured millions into the sport but that’s gone and has never been replaced. If anybody can raise it, these men can.

The proof will be in the pudding, of course. Everybody will be watching.

For Information About Automotive Trends', 'Careers']",2020-05-08,"The provincial government has given the green light for registered new-car dealerships in Ontario to reopen their sales, leasing and other departments to the public by appointment only.

The reopening of dealerships is welcome news to employees and customers across the province.

At the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association (TADA) introduced sweeping health and safety guidelines aimed at protecting service staff and customers.

The TADA released a comprehensive set of guidelines for the safe reopening of sales and other areas within a dealership. These guidelines were created in consultation with the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association and other provincial auto associations.

Each dealership will follow strict health and safety protocols for each department.

For sales departments, the following guidelines have been issued to all registered new-car dealerships in Ontario to ensure maximum safety for dealership employees and customers (these are highlights of the guidelines only):

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during a demo or test drive, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, accessories and trunk handle, will be disinfected. When cleaning is complete, the vehicle will be locked and recorded as disinfected.

A stringent appointment system to control customer flow will be implemented.

Each dealership will install signage indicating where customers are to proceed upon arrival.

When confirming appointments by phone, customers will be advised to not visit the dealership if they are exhibiting any symptoms associated with COVID-19. Upon arrival at the dealership, customers will also be advised of the safety measures in place to protect them, as well as staff. These may include restricted access to the showroom floor, the presence of hand-sanitizer stations, limited washroom access, etc.

Dealership staff at reception will be safely distanced from customers and have access to appropriate personal protective equipment.

Customers will be directed to sanitize their hands upon arrival, prior to meeting with any dealership staff.

A staff member will unlock a vehicle and keep the key on their person at all times.

Digital records will be kept of each vehicle presented to customers, including name, contact information, date, duration of entry and staff-member name.

All vehicles will be locked after each presentation and the key to the staff member responsible for cleaning and disinfecting keys.

All vehicle surfaces touched by the customer during the presentation will be disinfected, including keys, door handles, steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories and trunk handle.

Any employee(s) carrying out the evaluation of vehicles for potential trade will wear protective gloves throughout the process and observe proper handwashing protocols immediately upon completion of the evaluation.

For test drives, a series of protocols have been suggested for all salespeople which include, among other things, washing his/her hands prior to departing, advising the customer to do the same, taking a photo of the customer’s driver’s licence without touching the physical licence and choosing a disinfected vehicle OR ensuring the customer’s selected vehicle is properly disinfected prior to departing. Dealers will be following provincial social-distancing guidelines while they remain in place

Delivery of purchased vehicles will be done at the physical dealership, preferably in an outdoor location designated for this specific purpose. Dealership staff will ensure full sanitization of the vehicle interior, including steering wheel, gearshift, touchscreen, seatbelt buckles, accessories, as well as all door and trunk handles, prior to providing the customer with the keys. Keys will also be fully disinfected before presentation.

Dealership staff will maintain the recommended two-metre distance from the customer during the delivery process and must not enter the vehicle with the customer. A full demonstration of the vehicle’s features can be provided virtually, i.e. through online video, FaceTime, etc.

He Reviews Weekend Auto Racing Every Monday At Wheels.Ca.']",2020-05-08,"We’ve all heard, or read about, people who restore old cars as a hobby. In fact, we used to publish a popular feature here in Wheels called Eye Candy, in which people who’d either purchased an already-restored car or taken a few years to polish up a clunker got to show them off in the paper.

The ones who bought their restored automobiles might have received accolades, but they missed out on a lot: the challenge, the frustration, the expense and the time required to take on a restoration project. Most important, they also missed out on the fun of acquiring something that had seen better days and that they’d brought back to life and made sparkle.

The ones who opted to do the restorations themselves often admit to working in their spare time for five or 10 years to do a car. I want to introduce you today to a neighbour of mine in Mississauga who’s taken — wait for it — 35 years to return a 1968 Plymouth Barracuda fastback to its former, brand-new glory.

That’s three and a half decades.

His name is Todd Murray, he's 53 and the car he’s nuts about, and has devoted so much of his life to, is a two-door passenger car that was based initially on the 1959 Plymouth Valiant compact car but had evolved to boast Barracuda-specific sheet-metal styling and have its own range of models, including convertibles.

Murray bought his baby the year he turned 18 — 1985 — and finally finished it, literally, the other day. It’s licensed and insured and rarin’ to go. He planned to spend the summer this year going on cruises and to car shows in towns all over Ontario, but the coronavirus crisis has more or less put a damper on that.

But taking 35 years to do what he’s done shows he’s a man of patience, so the cruises and car shows can wait. A pretty laid-back guy, he’s OK with that.

Murray is single, has a 10-year-old daughter and works as a heating, air-conditioning and ventilation mechanic. He lives up the street from me in a two-storey, three-bedroom house with a one-car garage where he’s done much of the work on this car.

Read that again. He’s done much of the work on that car in a one-car garage. The ’Cuda is about six feet wide and the garage is nine feet, giving him about 18 inches on either side of his pride and joy to do much of the restoration work.

(Actually, it just hit me that maybe the reason it took him 35 years to do this is because he didn’t have a lot of room to manoeuvre inside that garage.)

Murray and two pals from his Oakville high school days, Paul Bouchard and Blake Dryden, are crazy about Barracudas and have all worked on each other’s cars at one time or another.

“In our spare time, we’ve gone to car shows over the years,” Murray said. “Pretty much every night of the week, there’s a car show you can go to. It’s a good night out.”

He said he doesn’t belong to a car club: “The three of us are kind of our own little club.”

Bouchard, who was visiting his friend the day I’d wandered over, owns a 1970 ’Cuda that’s blue, but if painted canary yellow would have fit right into the 1996-2001 TV series “Nash Bridges.”

“I remember the first episode I saw of that show,” Bouchard joked. “A woman committed suicide by jumping out of a highrise window and she landed right on the hood of the ’Cuda. I said, ‘Oh, no!’”

Murray said he inherited his love for cars from his father, the late Keith Murray. “My father was always a Mopar guy, and he had a bunch of old cars as I was growing up and he kind of piqued my interest,” he said. “I would always help him out, fixing his cars. He would do most of the timing and oil changes and everything right in our driveway, so I kinda got into it through him.”

Todd Murray said he actually owned two 1968 Barracudas before buying the one that’s in his garage now, but neither of the early cars was a keeper.

“I took parts off them to use on this one,” he said. “I stripped (the cars) down and saved all the parts and then Paul and Blake helped me when I started this project, which has really been an ongoing hobby.

“I bought this car in the spring when I was 18, and I’ve been working on it ever since. When we started, I was so meticulous that in order to do it right, the guys and I decided on what’s called a rotisserie restoration.”

(Which is when the car is totally disassembled. The frame is then placed on a car rotisserie so it can be turned and every nook and cranny on the car can be examined.)

“The whole car was stripped right down,” Murray said. “Every nut and bolt was taken out and either replaced or machined to be as good as new. We sandblasted the frame because the underside was in really bad shape. I had full quarter panels put on it.

“The fenders came from Portland, Ore. I have a friend who lives in Vancouver and he was into Barracudas, too, and he found me a set of fenders out there that were in, like, mint condition, original paint, so he bought them and shipped them to me. I went over to the train station and picked them up.”

Parts, as well as coming from his two previous ’Cudas and Oregon, were sourced at a huge midsummer car show held each year in Carlisle, Pa.

“That car show can take you three full days to go through,” he said. “We usually left Wednesday night or Thursday morning and the car show would start Friday morning and go to Sunday night, so we would camp out at the show. We would rough it — we slept in tents — but we had a lot of fun. We had to do a lot of searching for what we needed and then we’d bargain, which was always fun. We found tons of stuff for my car as well as Paul’s and Blake’s cars.”

He also bought a road sign, “Barracuda Blvd.,” that hangs in his garage. But back to the restoration.

“I did most of the mechanical work,” he said. “All of the chrome, which is brand new, and the reassembling was done in the garage, but I had a guy who did all the metal work for me — Paul’s car, too — and his name is Keith Sims, who’s probably one of the best metal guys around.

“Then I had to get the body done after that, to straighten it all back out, and painted (lime green), inside and out, and then I had to piece it all back together.”

This is where working in the small garage got tricky.

“There’s not a lot of room to move around in there,” he said. “It was a very tight fit, especially when I was trying not to scratch a new paint job. That’s why I wear track pants when I’m working around the car. No metal, like on jeans. Putting all the chrome back on it was definitely time-consuming. It’s been a labour of love, that’s for sure.”

I told him that I’d seen him zipping around a corner in our neighbourhood a few weeks ago and was wondering whether he was just out taking a quick spin and hoping not to run into the police. Turns out, as mentioned, the car is finished, licensed and insured, and this was to be the first summer he would drive it.

“There are still a couple of bugs to get out of it,” he said. “Steering-wise, it pulls a little to the right, so I have a guy that’s going to align the whole front end. All the parts up front are brand new, including the hub caps, which I will put on after the alignment, so it’s just a matter of setting it up properly. Other than that, it drives and rides real good.”

Murray said he’s restored the car to 1968 “factory spec,” so that means the seatbelts are just that: lap belts. There is no three-point harness in it like there is in 2020-model vehicles.

Murray doesn’t think that, after 35 years of tender, loving care, he would ever sell his ’Cuda. But would he restore another one?

“It would be pretty tough to do, money-wise,” he said. “I have between $65,000 and $70,000 invested in this one and that doesn’t count all of my labour. It’s an expensive hobby. Parts are expensive nowadays, too. You can probably buy just about anything for this car, unlike the scrounging around I had to do, but you would have to pay top price.

“Having said that, I think I’d like to buy one for my daughter Alyssa. I could fix it up for her; I have a lot of spare parts. I’m actually going to pick her up later today and take her for her first ride in it. She’s watched me work on it, so it will be a thrill for both of us.”

OK, the question I really wanted to ask was how fast this car could go. Murray sensed this and answered before I could ask it.

“This car has a 340-cubic-inch (5.6 L) small-block V-8 in it,” he said. “It has a four-barrel carburetor and it’s pretty quick. Lots of get up and go. Depending on the gear ratio you would run in the back, this one, factory, probably would do the quarter in around 14 seconds, That’s pretty good for a stock 340 car.

“When I first bought this car, it was painted white, and I took it to Cayuga (now Toronto Motorsports Park) a few times. I ran it down the strip. We went to the drag races there when we were younger. We had a lot of fun.”

Before I go, one other thing about this guy. Everything about this car is immaculate — just like his lawn and his flower beds. “Yes,” he said, “I really enjoy gardening. Maybe not as much as I do working on my car, but it’s close.”",[]

Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+. Four-door four/five-passenger super-sports sedan. Full-time four-wheel drive.

Price: Base — $177,500 (2020: $182,600). As tested $189,500.

Engine: 3982 cc V-8, dual overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, twin turbochargers.

Power/torque, horsepower / lb.-ft.: 630 @ 5,500 — 6,600 r.p.m. / 664 lb.-ft. @ 2,500 — 4,500 r.p.m.

Transport Canada fuel consumption, City/Highway, litres/100 km: 15.6 / 11.5. Premium fuel.

Competition: Audi RS7; BMW M Gran Coupé, Porsche Panamera Turbo S.

What’s best: Fabulous looks; fabulous performance; room for more than one friend.

What’s worst: That stupid shift lever, obviously; a couple of missteps in trim bits, inside and out; ride on the harsh side.

What’s interesting: Mercedes leaves no “model stone’’ unturned.

First thing you have to know about the Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4MATIC+ sedan is it bears little structural relationship to the Mercedes-AMG GT Coupé we tested a while back.

Gosh; you don’t think the similarity in the names is a deliberate attempt to fool the customer, do you?

Or the inattentive journalist?

Naw...

Second thing you have to know is this is a brilliant car, which in my view successfully bridges the gap between the all-out performance of its GT Coupé cousin and the E-Class family cars with which it shares some bones.

Third thing: I call this vehicle a sedan for one simple reason — it is a sedan.

What else would you call a car with four doors and four (optionally, five) seats?

Like other German manufacturers, Mercedes thinks that just because it has a sloping roofline and frameless side windows, although it does have a middle roof pillar, they can call this a coupé.

Not in my column. I write in English.

Labels be damned, this is a true AMG product, built at AMG’s facility in Affalterbach, and this body style is not available as a “normal” Mercedes.

My tester was actually a 2019 model, whose base list price was $177,500, and it topped out at $189,500. The 2020 model with a few extra bits of equipment starts at $182,600.

Chances are, your dealer won’t have many (any?) in stock. But you’d probably want to spec yours out anyway — the option list is endless.

The engine is the hottest locally available version of the corporate 4.0-litre twin-turbo V-8, producing 630 horsepower between 5,500 and 6,600 r.p.m., and 664 lb.-ft. of torque between 2,500 and 4,500 r.p.m. The signature of the sole engine assembler is on a plaque on the engine itself.

Interesting to note, this is actually more power than its allegedly more sporting cousin the AMG GT. Tobias Moers, head of AMG, told me at that car’s launch its dual-clutch transmission had a torque limitation the more powerful engine would exceed.

The GT S therefore uses Mercedes’ nine-speed automatic with the multi-plate clutch pack eliminating the sloppy starts that even the best torque-converter automatics can occasionally deliver, mounted up front behind the engine.

Suspension is the “AIRMATIC’’ system, with multi-chamber air springs and AMG’s adaptive dampers.

The “4MATIC+” part of the name means Mercedes’ full-time four-wheel-drive system, which automatically directs torque to whichever wheel can best use it.

The car is gorgeous, from the aggressive grille, slim LED headlights and subtle power bulges on the hood; through the smooth flanks with a subtle character line running the length of the car; to the slim tail lights and massive quad tailpipes and rear diffuser in the tail.

One harsh false note: the “vents” above the car’s nameplates on the sides just ahead of the front doors are fake. Shame.

At least the vents behind the rear wheels are real to allow air under the wheel arches to escape.

I was not initially a fan of matte paint finishes. The paint industry spent a century figuring out how to make cars shiny; now for an extra few grand you can make it look like someone painted it with a broom.

I’m starting to come around, because the “Designo Brilliant Blue Magno” looks terrific on this car. Another $2,500 from your piggy bank.

The interior is equally gorgeous, with real tree-wood (open-pore grey ash; $500), saddle-brown/black Nappa leather upholstery ($1,800) and top-quality materials everywhere, with the exception of the cover of the centre console in the rear seat, which is a cheap-looking bit of plastic. An odd oversight.

There are all sorts of features you will be discovering months after you take delivery.

Such as an interior colour lighting scheme that lets you choose the shade to suit your mood or taste.

And, the dash vents glow red or blue depending on whether warm or cool air is flowing through them.

The seats strike an excellent balance between the comfort required of a Grand Touring car and the lateral support needed for a car that handles this well.

The rear seat (two buckets or the optional three-seat bench) is actually habitable, provided occupants aren’t much taller than six feet. Your view of the outside world will be limited, however; the massive front-seat headrests take up most of the forward aspect, and the rear side windows are small triangles through which you must peek.

The dash and minor controls are a mix of the latest in Mercedes’ interior technology, with a couple of touches from the older-parts bin.

The twin screens on the dash provide a wide range of layouts depending on the selected driving mode. They are bright and readable, although it will take some time to know where every tidbit of information is located.

One of the “throwback” bits is the round knob on the centre console allowing selection of various functions. In some newer Mercedes models, this has been replaced with a touch pad hard enough to figure out when you’re standing still; when you are taking advantage of this car’s prodigious performance, it would be impossible, bordering on hazardous.

Some carmakers, with Mazda taking the lead, are starting to agree with me about this “just-touch-this” concept for the simple reason it is wrong.

Maybe when cars are driving themselves, you’ll have time to figure these things out. But then, why buy a car this much fun to drive yourself?

No Mercedes road test would be complete without my usual beef about the shift knob. Despite the German penchant for intelligence and logic, they continue to have Park selected by pushing a button instead of just shoving the shift lever full-forward.

Not only does this contravene 70-odd years of accepted practice for zero additional functionality, but it might be dangerous because it’s hard to get your finger on the button hidden under the shift knob itself.

Sorry; it’s just stupid.

That said, driving is what this car is all about, and it delivers.

Slam-you-back-into-the-seat levels of acceleration are a mere stab of the loud pedal away. Zero-100 km/h takes a tick over three seconds, at which point the car is barely clearing its throat.

A seamless upshift, and off you go to the red line again.

This auto-box is one of the most clever in the business, seemingly predicting what gear you’re going to need and selecting it for you. If you think you can do a better job (hint: you can’t), you can play with the steering column paddles, or that damnable shift knob.

Throttle response is about as quick as turbocharged engines get, a benefit of those turbos being nestled between the cylinder banks, close to the intake manifolds.

Even when you’re going about 70 or 80 km/h and hammer on the gas on a dry road, you can still get the traction control light to flash.

Fuel crisis? What fuel crisis? Gas is currently 80 cents a litre at my local self-serve...

Handling is outstanding, belying the car’s massive 2,000-kg-plus weight.

The steering is precise and perfectly weighted.

This car has Mercedes’ four-wheel steering — in-phase at higher speeds for more stability, counter-phase at low speeds for more agility. The fact that you absolutely cannot feel it working shows how well worked out it is.

As I mentioned in my review of the AMG GT coupé, Mercedes’ test drivers had the ability to shut this feature off (again, you can’t) and the car handled much better with it activated.

The optional Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires — same as on my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke although these are much bigger — provide astonishing levels of grip. From my personal Targa experience with this tire, they don’t abandon you if it starts to rain.

Several drive mode settings are available via a rotary knob on the steering wheel at about the four-o’clock position. Throttle response, transmission shift speed, ride height, suspension firmness, even the exhaust note, are all altered in fairly predictable ways for the “Comfort,” “Sport” and “Sport+” modes.

“Drift” mode lets you play full-on hooligan if you have an unlimited tire budget.

“Race” mode converts it into a rear-drive car. AMG suggests you limit this setting to track use.

Killjoys; it was not so long ago AMG didn’t build any four-wheel-drive cars because they were deemed insufficiently sporty to bear this hallowed nameplate.

You can also program and store your own preferred settings.

Even with the suspension set to Comfort, ride quality is definitely on the firm side. It’s a small price to pay for the grip.

So, is the Mercedes AMG GT S 4MATIC+ a luxury car? Is it a very fast GT car? Is it a thinly disguised race car?

I’d say yes, yes and yes.

Its closest competitor would be the Porsche Panamera Turbo. One advantage the Porsche offers is the station wagon (Sport Turismo) body style, which is even more capacious than the AMG’s.

But the AMG GT S is more hard-edged, more of a pure driver’s car.

This customer is surely going to own more than one car.

If (s)he wants some serious driving fun and can find three friends to share it with, this would be the one to choose.",[]

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-05-01,"During the Second World War, many Canadian businesses retooled their operations to manufacture war materials for the Allied countries.

Canada (and the world) is now fighting a much different type of war, and Canadian businesses have stepped up to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and necessary supplies for health-care professionals and other front-line workers.

Major auto manufacturers, in particular, are among the many industries that have made significant contributions to the fight against COVID-19. Auto manufacturers have leveraged their assembly plants, supply chain networks and expertise to provide face shields, ventilators and other items.

Although major auto manufacturers in North American have shut down production of automobiles, it is inspiring to see how quickly Ford and other manufacturers have pivoted from making vehicles to making medical supplies and equipment, and how our industry has rallied together during this difficult time.

The Ford Motor Company (the brand I represent), with support of Unifor Local 200, is producing face shields at its Windsor, Ont., engine plant and making them available to Ford dealers across Canada. Dealers are distributing the face shields to hospitals in their communities.

My dealership will receive a shipment of 100 face shields on May 4, which we will donate to Kirkland and District Hospital. We have requested more of these protective devices for a later date, which we plan to distribute locally.

In the U.S., Ford engineers are using their ingenuity and expertise to convert F-150 seat fans to manufacture much-needed respirators and ventilators. The company has teamed up with GE Healthcare and 3M to increase production of medical equipment and supplies.

Ford has a proud history of giving back to people and communities in need across Canada, and I am enormously proud to be a part of this company. (Other automakers have proud histories of providing support for communities at home and abroad as well.)

In 2016, the Ford Motor Company of Canada and Canadian Ford dealers donated more than $500,000 to the Red Cross for relief and recovery efforts related to the wildfires that impacted Fort McMurray and surrounding areas.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada has donated approximately 1,000 N95 ventilator masks, gloves, protective eyewear and sanitary boot protectors to four local hospitals. The company has used its production system expertise to streamline the design of the masks.

Toyota Canada is also working with InkSmith, a Canadian 3D printing company that is manufacturing face shields for medical workers.

GM Canada is preparing parts of the Oshawa, Ont., plant to produce face masks based on the GM production model already working in Michigan. The company plans to manufacture approximately one million masks per month, at cost, for the Canadian government with an estimated 50 employees supporting two shifts of production.

Some automakers have introduced relief programs and special financing arrangements to help customers affected by COVID-19.

For instance, Hyundai is offering existing finance and lease customers payment deferral options, and new customers have the option of a six-month deferral program on all new vehicles financed at a Hyundai dealership.

For Mazda customers whose leases are coming due but who are not “in a position to replace their vehicle at this time,” the automaker is offering lease extensions. Nissan Canada Finance will work with customers to discuss payment arrangements or deferments.

If you have a finance or lease concern about your vehicle, contact the finance arm of your respective auto brand. There is no common financial aid program in place in Canada; each automaker is handling financial concerns of customers on a case-by-case basis.

Next week, I’ll share some stories about how registered new-car dealerships, and the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, are partnering with businesses and agencies to provide assistance to front-line health-care professionals in their communities.",[]

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Former Toronto Star Editor Who Continues To Write For Wheels Under Contract. He Is An Inductee Of The Canadian Motorsport Hall Of Fame', 'A Member Of Its Board Of Directors.']",2020-05-01,"I have been inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame twice.

Not really — but allow me to explain.

Early in 1993, I received a press release from two guys I knew from racing, Gary Magwood and Lee Abrahamson, announcing the creation of the CMHF. As well, the release announced that the first gala induction dinner would be held at the Four Seasons Yorkville and feature John Surtees as guest speaker. It also announced the first group of inductees, headed by the late Gilles Villeneuve.

Now, I have always been very sensitive when it comes to the subject of auto racing. I’ve always felt there was a bias against oval-track racing and oval-track racers. This feeling might be misguided, but I’ve always felt that way. So, although I wasn’t surprised when I saw the rest of the names on the list of first-year inductees, all of whom are legends, I was bummed out because, as I expected, there was nary an oval-track racer on the list.

Never one to back down from a fight, I fired off a fax to Magwood. “Congratulations on the Hall of Fame and your first group of inductees,” I wrote. “But there is racing in this country other than road racing,” I continued, “and I consider the omission of the late Billy Foster, the first Canadian to qualify to race in the Indianapolis 500, to be a mistake.”

Magwood was, and remains, a very intuitive person. Fifteen minutes later, he faxed me back. “His name was just added to the list,” he said. (Editor’s note: Foster, of course, was not the first Canadian; he was the sixth, as the CMHF has since discovered.)

I attended that first induction gala — I sat at a table in the back with Jean Gauthier, former owner of Shannonville Motorsport Park — and moments before grace, Magwood approached me. “We couldn’t find anyone from the Foster family to be here,” he said, “so you’ll have to represent him,” which I was happy to do.

I accepted the induction honour on behalf of Foster, his family and “all oval racing drivers in Canada.” As luck would have it, I was able to make contact with Foster’s son, Billy Foster Jr., who was a police officer in Victoria, and presented him with the Hall of Fame medallion when we were both at the 1995 Molson Indy Vancouver.

So that was induction No. 1.

Induction No. 2 came in 2013 when I was welcomed into the Hall as the first journalist to be inducted. I was in a class with Diana Carter, John Magill, Nigel Mansell, Scott Maxwell and Paul Tracy. Pretty good company, if I do say so myself.

The reason I am writing about this today is because nominations are now open for the next induction ceremony, which will be held in downtown Toronto at the Canadian International AutoShow next February. And this is where everybody reading this comes in.

People frequently come up to me and say, “How come so-and-so isn’t in the Hall of Fame?” And I reply, “Probably because he/she hasn’t been nominated.” Let me explain.

It is not the job of the Motorsport Hall of Fame, or any other hall of fame, for that matter, to cherry pick who will be inducted. These are not “old boys’ clubs,” or shouldn’t be. Inductees are selected from people nominated by the public. In a media release this week, the CMHF said this:

“The CMHF honours and recognizes the achievements of individuals and institutions who have made outstanding contributions to Canadian motorsport as drivers, owners, team members, motorsport builders and significant contributors, as well as those who have distinguished themselves in a new media category.

“‘I look forward to seeing the nominations for this year. I do not envy the selection committee, which always has difficult choices to make,’ said the chairman of the board of directors, Dr. Hugh Scully.

“‘I urge everyone involved in motorsport — from team owners to drivers to fans — to nominate anyone who you feel has made a major contribution to motorsport in Canada, whether behind the wheel, from the owner’s box, on a timing stand, turning a wrench or holding a microphone.’

“As a general rule, inductees must be retired from competition for at least three years or, if still active, involved in motorsport for at least 25 years. Information about the nomination process, including the form, and submission requirements are available at CMHF.ca.”

OK, let me emphasize what Scully is saying about nominating someone. Road and street racing, for instance, could not happen without marshals. I know marshals who have flagged at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, the Molson/Honda Indy, the Grand Prix du Canada, the Grand Prix du Monaco and so on. Several could qualify for induction, but somebody has to nominate them.

I know a fellow who owns a speedway, who races sprint cars internationally, has won championships, has been named World of Outlaws promoter of the year not once but twice and is not in the Hall of Fame. Somebody has got to nominate that guy.

Now, two words of caution:

1) You can’t just send in the form and say something like, “Ronnie’s a really great guy and should be in the Hall of Fame,” or “Jeff’s been racing for 40 years and while he hasn’t been very successful, he should be in the Hall because everybody knows him.” Nominators (this means you) have to do the work of listing the contributions and the racing record of the person being nominated. You have to make the case. This is a Hall of Fame (emphasis on the fame).

2) Don’t get discouraged. Just because the person you nominated doesn’t make the cut this year, doesn’t mean he/she won’t be selected next year. Just keep sending in their nomination form, with documentation, and sooner or later, if worthy, they will probably make it.

I mean, how many years did it take for Dougie Gilmour to finally be named to the Hockey Hall of Fame?

Please think about this, and if you know of someone who merits consideration, please nominate them.

Two members of the Hall of Fame, François Dumontier and Ron Fellows, are now the two most powerful men in Canadian motorsport. The FIA announced this week that Dumontier is now the president of the National Sporting Authority in Canada (ASN) and Fellows is vice-president. They replace Paul Cooke and Roger Peart, who have retired. Dumontier is the owner and promoter of the Grand Prix du Canada and Fellows is co-owner of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park. More about all this at a later date.

BMW Andretti Motorsport’s Maximilian Guenther won the race Saturday in “Hong Kong,” with Envision Virgin Racing’s Nick Cassidy second and Pascal Wehrlein of Mahindra Racing third.

Now, gaming technology, which lends itself to auto racing better than any other sport, allows everyone involved in Formula Electric — teams, manufacturers, sponsors, drivers and fans — to take part in the live online races while raising funds for UNICEF, which will help keep children around the world safe, healthy and attending school online during the coronavirus crisis.

And that technology has also allowed the electric racing series to introduce a Pro-Am element to this promotion. Each race will have two separate grids, one made up of professional race drivers from the Formula E Championship and the other one filled by some of the fastest gamers in the world.

The carrot on the stick for the gamer champion will be a drive on a race weekend in a real Formula E car, once racing gets going again.

To keep this series as even as possible, drivers and gamers are competing using rFactor 2 software. The pro drivers all got simulators provided by Playseat, steering wheels and pedals from Fanatec and the latest gaming PCs, monitors, headphones and other peripherals from Asus.

The usual race points system is in play, but additional points are being awarded for pole position and fastest lap. Double points will also be on offer at the final race on June 13.

Now leading the championship as the result of his win on Saturday, Guenther punched the air as he got the checkered flag. “It wasn’t an easy race,” the German driver said moments after the event. “Even though it’s not the real world, we’re all competitive and we want to be at the front.”

Joshua Rogers, an Australian who earned $43,000 (U.S.) in 2019 competing in six gaming tournaments, won the Challenge Grid race.

You can watch the Race at Home Challenge every Saturday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT on FIAFormulaE.com. Play-by-play announcer Jack Nicholls is calling the action, Nicki Shields will be covering the pits and Dario Franchitti is doing colour and analysis.

Now, as luck would have it, I did an interview a week ago Thursday with Nissan drivers Sébastien Buemi and Oliver Rowland. Nissan is in the series to promote its Leaf electric car and its Nissan Intelligent Mobility, which is integrated technology designed to increase safety, comfort and control while driving.

And I say “as luck would have it” because I really didn’t know all that much about virtual racing, or this particular series, and those two drivers were only too happy to fill me in.

Buemi, of course, is a name most race fans would recognize. He is a former Formula One driver (Scuderia Toro Rosso — and he once did a commercial for the sponsoring energy drink Red Bull by driving his F1 car across a frozen lake in northern Quebec) who won the Formula E championship in 2015-16 (Formula Electric starts its season in the late fall and finishes in the spring) and holds most of the records in that series — poles, fastest laps and so on. He was driving when Nissan won its first race in the series, last year in New York. Rowland was rookie of the year last season.

One of the surprising things they both said was that it’s harder to drive a simulator than a real race car. For instance, Rowland said that he’s new to this and, “Instead of cues, like what you can feel and what you can see, all you’ve got is a screen. You have a feeling that you’re driving a very good lap and then you find that you’re not. Some of the more experienced guys (driving simulators) have a bit of a head start.”

Added Buemi: “You don’t get the same feedback; it’s not the same. Simulators have improved massively over the years, but they are still not the same as the real car.”

Buemi said he’s tried to make the best out of being quarantined. “I exercise in the mornings and afternoons, but I am enjoying spending time with my family, which I can’t do because I’m away a lot. My children are four and two, so it’s nice to be with them.”

Returning to the Race at Home Challenge, he said: “It’s not like real racing, but it’s better than nothing. Everybody is stuck at home, so clearly, you have something to watch and I’m very happy that Formula E has launched this.”

Rowland had one suggestion: “You practise all week and then qualifying is one lap, which is kind of nerve-wracking because you don’t want to make a mistake. Instead of practising for five days, I think it would be better if they didn’t give us the circuit until Saturday morning. Then we could practise for an hour and then qualify.”

Formula E donated 10,000 pounds sterling ($17,400 Canadian) to UNICEF and will do so at the conclusion of every race up to a total of 100,000 pounds ($174,000). Fans are encouraged to donate by clicking on the prompts at the official Formula E YouTube channel, Facebook page and Facebook Gaming site, Twitch channel and via @FIAFormulaE on Twitter.",[]

From the “if life hands you lemons” file, if you are stuck at home, here’s something that will help you pass the time and also do your car some good:

Clean it properly.

“Even with ‘shelter-at-home’ orders and physical distancing, many people rely on their vehicle to go to work or run errands. You might be surprised at the number of places your car can harbour germs and bacteria,” says Andrew Harkness, director of after-sales for Nissan Canada.

And you thought theft, crashes, flat tires, rust and mechanical breakdowns were the only car-related things you had to worry about!

I would start with a thorough exterior cleaning, probably at a coin-op, hand-held spray-wash facility. I never trust those rotating-bristle-brush systems, although they claim they do not harm the finish. Your call.

Perhaps needless to say, when using anything that might have been touched by anyone else, like the “wands” at the car wash, put new rubber gloves on before you get out of your car.

On your way home, stop at a drugstore to get some isopropyl alcohol (70 per cent alcohol) if you don’t already have some . The Public Health Agency of Canada says it is effective against COVID-19 .

Start with a general cleanup of the interior using a soft cloth — better still, a microfibre cloth — dampened with soap and water.

Next, use another clean cloth dampened with that isopropyl alcohol to disinfect anything you would touch.

Door handles inside and out, trunk/hatch/liftgate handles, key or key fob, steering wheel, seatbelt buckles, starter button if your car is plagued with one (small editorial comment there), gearshift lever or buttons, HVAC controls, radio/sound-system controls, lights, wipers, turn signals, cruise-control lever or buttons, four-way-flasher switch, rear-view mirror (make sure to get the back and sides of it, too), side-view mirrors or the controls thereof, centre stack, glove box and centre-console lid, parking-brake lever or control ...

Geez, when you think of all the bits in your car that you touch.

And anything else I might have missed.

Take particular care with the seatbelts themselves. Harsh cleaners can degrade the fibres in the belt fabric and affect the belts’ strength.

Another caveat applies to the infotainment screen if your vehicle is so-equipped. It is obviously a commonly touched surface, but again, avoid harsh cleaners. Screen wipes like you might use for your computer screens or camera lenses, or again, a soft cloth with soap and water, would be better.

If your car’s system has voice commands, you might consider learning how to use them.

Harkness also warns against using bleach, hydrogen peroxide, benzene, paint thinners or abrasive cleaners, which can damage interior surfaces and fabrics.

Ammonia-based cleaners can also damage the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint coatings on infotainment system screens.

Also be careful with leather upholstery. Many leather or leather-like fabrics have a protective coating, which may be damaged by frequent cleaning with alcohol.

An alternative is, again, good old soap and water, followed by a leather conditioner.

Hey, didn’t I warn you about leather? Cloth upholstery is always better!

In addition to wearing gloves during all this, you should do it in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.

“Using the right product and the right material will not only help you properly clean your vehicle, but also avoid damaging it,” Harkness says.

You should also make sure your car stays in top mechanical condition. Just like you, your car needs regular exercise. I’m even taking the 1977 AMC Hornet out for the occasional spin.

Ryan Fulkerson, director of new model engineering for Nissan North America, suggests keeping the battery charged, either by a short drive or with a trickle charger.

I would add to this suggestion that you make that “short” drive long enough for the car to get up to full working temperature. This will also make sure all the car’s fluids get to wherever they need to go, so keep those levels topped up.

And don’t just let it idle — that’s worse than letting it sit unused.

Fulkerson also notes that tires that aren’t driven on frequently can develop flat spots which can lead to premature and uneven wear.

You should also check your tire pressures weekly. You should do this virus or no virus, but I know most of you don’t. It’s particularly important in these times when you might not be driving your car as regularly.

We know this virus will eventually peter out. Performing these maintenance and cosmetic tasks will help ensure your car is ready to go when the world is once again ready for it.",[]

Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Norris Mcdonald Is A Former Star Editor Who Is A Current Freelance Columnist. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-04-25,"So, the other day, I’m talking to a guy named Bob Flotkoetter, who’s director of technology planning and research at Nissan North America’s Technical Centre in Farmington Hills, Mich. Like many people these days, predominantly white-collar people, he’s working at home.

And he’s not alone. That research and development tech centre employs roughly 1,200 people supporting the design and evolution of all Nissan and Infiniti vehicles produced in North America. To continue product development during this pandemic, 80 per cent of them are working, as they say, remotely.

Which is a subject near and dear to my heart and led to me asking questions.

I don’t know why, for instance, it took a pandemic to kick-start the movement to work from home. Yes, there are some people who will always have to go to “the office,” but many others can do what they do in a home office or in their dining room.

It can save them money on clothing, dry-cleaning (they can work in their jeans instead of a suit or dress), parking/transit expenses and lunch, and it would be great for the environment because less greenhouse gases would be produced by fewer cars on the roads.

If a company has to rent space, it could save money by cutting down on the amount needed. And rents could come down because landlords would want to fill that space.

I became aware of the potential back in 1994 when I was chair of the United Way campaign in Kingston and the Islands. We had a great year, a lot of fun, and we raised a lot of money. I’d go to, say, Novelis, or DuPont, or Goodyear over in Napanee, which were manufacturing facilities, and there’d be a good turnout and I’d do my shtick and the pledges would roll in.

But when I went to the OHIP building (the Ontario government of the day was big on decentralization), I received a shock. Not that many people had turned out for the kickoff breakfast.

“What’s going on?” I said to the person who was chair of the OHIP campaign. “Don’t worry,” she said. “We’ll reach our goal.” But I wanted to know more. “Where is everybody?” I asked. And this is what she said.

“Except for management, most of the employees are doing clerical work, processing claims. They can come to work here in the office, or they can work at home. About half like the discipline of the office, so they come here to work 8:30 till 4:30 and they are with us today.

“The other half are at home. As long as they maintain the average (of claims processed per hour), they can continue doing that. We work a 35-hour week. We have one woman who starts at midnight Sunday and she works straight through. Her ‘week’ is done at 11 o’clock Tuesday morning. I couldn’t do it, but it works for her.”

Remember, that was 1994. Things might have changed. But I thought that was terrific. It could work in any office setting, I thought. So I was delighted to hear Flotkoetter say that it’s working for the Nissan tech centre — he gave examples, which I’ll get to in a second — and might lead to a sea change as far as how workplaces in general are defined going forward.

Meantime, Nissan — like other automakers — is in business to build and sell cars and trucks and is not sitting idle.

“It’s the same mission for Nissan,” Flotkoetter said. “It’s just a different approach. We’re trying to push forward with product development and we’re trying to focus on the new models we’ll have coming out in the future. In order to do that, we all can’t just stop because we’re unable to be in the same place.”

Because of the COVID-19 crisis, Flotkoetter said, the company decided to shut down its operations and start to work remotely on March 13, beating the governor of Michigan to the punch by two days.

“For many engineers, that just meant bringing home their laptops. But for many on our team, the technicians working on the vehicles, working on wire harnesses, that sort of thing, they had to think about things from a different standpoint.”

He said there was one technician who was working on a wire-harness build. (A wire harness, or wiring harness, is made up of wire, terminals and connectors that relay electric power and other information from one end of the vehicle to the other.) “We needed to get these wire harnesses built so we could continue with our testing, so he pulled together the connectors, the pins, the crimping tools and all the documentation. He took it all with him on that Friday.

“The following Monday, when the ordinance from the state came to stay home, that technician was already prepared to do work. He went down into his basement, got an old dining room table that had wheels on it so he could move it around, and created his own workspace down there. He would check in with the engineers to make sure everything was on track, they would have periodic discussions and he could share videos of what he was working on.

“Those are things that are happening all over the organization; we’re just finding new ways to achieve the same mission.”

Another example: “You may have an engineer who took a test car home with him and he’s running into a problem. Now he can have a live Zoom meeting with another engineer who could be on the other side of the country. In real time, they are diagnosing and debugging together. This all came about because of this social distancing thing, but now it’s becoming more mainstream.

“This could be the wave of the future. I won’t always have to go down to the garage (in the Farmington Hills facility) or out to our facility in Arizona to investigate an issue and debug it. We can do it in real time using the technology that we have at our fingertips.”

Flotkoetter talked passionately about creativity, and how this pandemic might result in some innovative new products. For instance, he said Nissan’s rear-door alert came about after one of the engineers left a lasagna in the back seat. And “because of a plague, Sir Isaac Newton had to go back to his family’s farm. It was there that he developed his theories of gravity and motion.”

“When you have the opportunity to go outside your normal environment, you think of things differently. I think interesting innovations will come out of this.”

But the conversation kept returning to the challenges that working from home might bring.

“We’ve found that there’s a blurred line between home life and work life,” he said. “I’ve heard, ‘Dad, you’re working more hours,’ and I have been working more hours because there’s no shutting down, per se. When I’m at the office and my day ends, I can shut off my computer and go out to my car and drive home. Now, my work is here at home with me, so if there’s work to be done, I do it. I’ve heard that many of the engineers are working more hours as a result of that.”

Hmmm. Maybe. Perhaps they’re on the job, but I’m not sure they’d always be working.

Years ago, when I was writing a column, I decided I could write it from home; there was no reason to go into the office, except maybe to pick up my mail. If I applied discipline, I could be at my computer by 9, rattle off a masterpiece by noon and have the rest of the day to myself. Or so I thought.

So I would get up in the morning and get dressed. So far so good. Because I didn’t have to be anywhere, I would then have breakfast and read the morning paper. Sometimes I would dawdle. I would then sit down at the computer at 10, ready to go. But then — this being summer and the doors would be open with just the screen doors keeping out the bugs — I would hear the letter carrier come.

Naturally, I had to check the mail. And, also naturally, that would be the day Maclean’s magazine would arrive. So I would make a coffee and read Maclean’s. Then it would be noon and time for lunch and reruns of “I Love Lucy” and “Leave It To Beaver.” At 1 p.m., I would sit down at my computer and think that I would have an award winner done by 4.

Then I would hear a big truck squeak to a stop in front of my house. Two minutes later, there would be a knock at the door and my friend Fred, who worked for the city, would invite himself in for tea. At 3, after I got rid of him, I would sit down and start typing and then my pet cat Nigel, who I hadn’t seen all day, would be scratching at the door to be let in and naturally we’d have to have a reunion (he was the king of the forest, by the way, and frequently needed patching up) and by that time it would be 4 and people would start arriving home after working all day at their offices and getting lots done.

My deadline was 11 p.m. I would sit down at my computer at 9 and rattle off something run-of-the-mill and then swear to exert some self-discipline the next day when I would have to write another column, but I rarely did. My point is that my days started fairly early in the morning, but I often didn’t send in my column till late at night. And that is the danger, for some people, of working at home.

To get around that, Flotkoetter said, Nissan North America already has a virtual office policy in place and he thinks this shutdown might lead to some enhancements. “It’s a good opportunity for us to step back and reflect on how we’re doing our jobs, which could lead to some changes to that policy. I think we’re learning now what works, what are the major challenges, how we can improve the home office environment (he said Zoom has turned out to be a godsend to hold staff meetings) and I think we’ll take a hard look at that once we all get back together.”

Meantime, as he had throughout our conversation, Flotkoetter kept returning to the challenges presented by working remotely. “For instance, I don’t think that anybody would ever wish that we had more traffic in the Detroit area — which is plenty — but a lot of the testing we do depends on normal traffic flows. Right now, the roads are fairly empty, as you would expect, and this actually impacts our testing. Some of our features depend on traffic for us to evaluate how the features are performing.”

Flotkoetter said some of the engineers who work on radio and audio systems haven’t had any trouble taking their work home with them. “Usually, we do that in a lab environment, but now we have them doing it in their driveways,” he said.

“So, if you come across somebody sitting in their driveway with the sound turned up, it might not be that they’re listening to a last, favourite song before calling it a day. They are likely evaluating the audio system on that vehicle.”

He said this experience is going to be a good learning opportunity for all industries across the board.

“When you think how we’re using remote offices and virtual situations, I think this will provide us with a lot of learning that will help guide us in the future. This might ultimately change the way in which we do our business, going forward.”",[]

I was thinking about that expression and how it applies to the COVID-19 crisis, as rumours have been flying about police stopping and ticketing people just for driving.

As our understanding of COVID-19 to evolves, the internet has been a great source of information and connecting with others, but it is also a breeding ground for misinformation.

To help set the record straight, I asked Sgt. Kerry Schmidt of the highway safety division of the Ontario Provincial Police to provide clarity on these rumours.

Schmidt says that although road traffic volume has been greatly reduced in the past month, far too many drivers are taking advantage of the open roads to drive recklessly, which puts themselves, other motorists and the police at risk.

Reckless driving leads to more collisions and injuries and puts additional strain on hospitals that are already managing an influx of patients related to COVID-19.

Last weekend alone, 30 drivers in the GTA were stopped and their vehicles impounded and licences suspended for street racing and/or stunt driving. On average, 10 vehicles per day in Ontario are taken off the roads for speeding or stunt driving.

In Toronto, from March 15 to 30, police issued 35 per cent more speeding tickets than during the same two-week period last year. In York Region, tickets issued for stunt driving were up 60 per cent in March, compared to March 2019.

The message that Schmidt wants to share with the public is that drivers need to obey all traffic laws and public health guidelines. That means “slowing down and driving responsibly.” Schmidt stressed that the OPP will not take a break from enforcing public safety and traffic laws.

During this COVID-19 crisis, police (like everyone else) are trying to limit close contact with the public, which explains why police stations in Ontario are closed indefinitely (stations are accessible through phone and website). Police do not want to be a source of transmission of this disease or to be in contact with someone who may have COVID-19.

One of the most persistent rumours is that police are stopping drivers randomly and asking them where they live and to explain where they are going, and why, and ticketing vehicles that are carrying too many people.

According to Schmidt, that’s not true. At this time, there are no travel restrictions in place anywhere in the province, and no checkpoints. Nor are police ticketing cars with multiple passengers under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

However, Schmidt suggests that drivers listen to the recommendations of Public Health. but ignoring their recommendations is not an offence. He reiterated that Public Health has specific recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Drivers should understand that not only speeding and stunt driving are dangerous on the roads, but all types of reckless driving, including driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and distracted driving.

If there is a central message that Schmidt needs the public to understand, it is this: please slow down and use common sense. He says Ontario is still under a state of emergency and all citizens need to do their part to help flatten the curve.

“The job of the highway traffic division is to ensure the safety, security and protection of all Ontario citizens who are using the roadways,” Schmidt says. “It’s everyone’s job to obey the rules of the road and to follow the guidelines of health officials.”",[]

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Jim Kenzie Is A Toronto-Based Writer', 'A Freelance Contributor For The Star.']",2020-04-25,"AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND—Whatever good you have heard about New Zealand, it’s all true.

In fact, it’s understated.

Civilized.

Friendly people.

Gorgeous scenery.

And some fabulous roads on which to test a car, which Lady Leadfoot and I recently did.

Last week, we told you about the Kiwi Nissan Qashqai we drove.

Today, more about the roads and the driving culture here.

Each of the North and South Islands is worth more than the two weeks we had in total, so a brief summary will have to suffice.

We did the South Island by train.

But this is a car column, so North Island it is.

We started in Auckland, the country’s largest city. It must be beautiful beneath all the hoarding; it’s being torn to shreds in preparation for next year’s defence of the country’s America’s Cup yachting victory in 2017.

Lots of detours and road closures, so rather than drive, we walked everywhere.

New Zealand is basically a bunch of mostly dormant volcanoes, so it is very hilly. My “thunder thighs” soon turned to jelly.

Time to hit the road.

We spent much of our trip following the country’s main north-south highway, Highway 1.

Our Qashqai had SatNav — “Doris of the Dashboard” to use my Motoring TV cohort Graeme Fletcher’s classic phrase.

Back home, our SatNav would say, “Make a left turn, and follow 401.”

Here, they put the definite article in front of the road number, so it would say “Make a left turn left, and follow the 401.”

This SatNav added a twist. “Doris” would phrase an instruction in her charming accent, but with a slight hesitation: “Make a left ‘turn’ and follow ... The One ...”

Made it sound like a religious experience.

If you know anything about New Zealand at all, you might guess that its No. 1 industry is raising sheep.

No shortage of them, although recently, raising cattle has become increasingly important.

Based on our trip, my guess would be: manufacturing orange plastic traffic pylons, “30 km/h” speed limit signs for the construction zones, and the “TEMPORARY” signs that invariably accompany them.

To their credit, New Zealand drivers generally follow these strictures.

It is late summer here, so the old Canadian joke applies — there are two seasons, “winter” and “road construction” — so we saw lots of those signs.

New Zealand keeps its roads in pretty good condition, although given its latitude (Auckland’s is about the same “south” as San Francisco’s is “north”) they don’t have a lot of snow or frost heaves to worry about.

As noted last week, even their newly paved roads aren’t baby-bum smooth. As in England, they put some texture into the surface, presumably to provide more grip when the road is wet.

Given that you’re never much farther than 100 kilometres from the ocean, the weather can be changeable.

Instead of “If you don’t like the weather, wait 20 minutes,” they say, “If you don’t like the weather, look behind you.”

On most days, the forecast indicated a chance of rain. But weather people everywhere always say that, because if they’re wrong, everybody’s still happy.

Except farmers and forest firefighters.

Whatever, we had excellent weather for most of our stay.

Police presence on the roads wasn’t oppressive, although we did see a couple of cars pulled over, presumably for speeding.

There are occasional yahoos, usually in pickup trucks, driving with no concern for fellow road users.

But overall, their driving culture is like the rest of the country — again, civilized.

“Utes” are quite popular here. The car/pickup truck hybrids originated in Australia when a woman wrote to the head of Ford Australia in the early 1930s, saying their family needed something to take the pigs to market on Saturday and the family to church on Sunday, but could only afford one vehicle.

Some of you may remember such vehicles as the Chevrolet El Camino and Ford Ranchero? They’d be “utes.”

From Auckland, we headed north in the direction of “Ninety Mile Beach.”

Yes, New Zealand does use the metric system. So what’s with the “Mile” in that name?

The beach in fact is about 90 kilometres long. Sorry, I don’t have an answer for that ...

At first, we had planned to drive all the way to the top, to Mile 1. Then we figured, each mile of beach is pretty much the same as every other mile. Or kilometre.

It was still summer, but too chilly for a swim, so we turned back south, yes, following (dramatic pause ...) “ ... The One ...”

At Kaitaia, we veered west toward the Tasman Sea, then south on Highway 12 (Doris: “follow ... The Twelve ...”) so we could see the “Tane Mahuta,” which is a giant kauri tree, an endangered species in its native land.

It is some 45 metres tall, and is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,500 years old. Breathtaking to be in the presence of a living thing that old.

The tree was “discovered” (meaning, “stumbled upon by people of European descent”) in 1928 while “ ... The Twelve ...” was being built.

This road had the most optimistic speed limit I can recall. Extremely twisty two-laner, narrow to non-existent shoulders, tough sight lines.

100 km/h? Yikes.

Maybe this is why New Zealand has produced on a per capita basis a surprisingly large number of remarkable race car drivers over the years, such as Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme, Chris Amon and, more recently, Brendon Hartley.

We don’t have many three-lane roads in Canada anymore, but they’re popular here. Two lanes uphill, one lane downhill. Plenty of warning when they’re coming up, to discourage dicey passing.

But they make the same mistake most Canadian provinces do. They add a lane on the right for passing (they drive on the left, remember), which is as it should be.

However, when they shrink the road back to a single lane, they take away the driving lane forcing people to merge right.

That’s just stupid.

How can the “driving” lane ever disappear?

They should just swap their warning signs for ours and we’d both be correct.

Continuing southeast to Rotorua, the centre of both Maori culture and volcanic activity, with geysers spouting regularly.

We were tourists, so excuse us for taking in the tourist sights, such as a traditional Maori cultural performance and dinner, and the glow worm caves — millions of the little creatures, winking away at us.

They also have an exhibit for the kiwi, the universal symbol of New Zealand. These nocturnal flightless birds are extremely shy and hard to see even in captivity. Some patience on our part led to eventual success, but photography is not allowed, so you’ll have to take my word for it.

Down to Wellington, our detour to the South Island, then back north to Napier on the Atlantic (eastern) coast.

By this time, the effects of the “corona” virus, as it was still being called, were starting to take effect.

New Zealand’s rate of infection is still one of the lowest in the world, but hotel rooms and dinner reservations became easier to get as people were cancelling travel plans.

Our final touristy stop was Coromandel, which again was much quieter than usual.

The road to this town looks fine on the map. But the last 40 kilometres took about an hour and a half to cover.

Lady Leadfoot did her best not to gasp every time we came to a corner.

We were heading north and her seat was on the “ocean” side.

The road is narrow.

It was dark.

There were big trucks.

No guard rails for most of it.

The fact that I am writing this means we survived.

And we are still married.

The return trip the next day was even scarier. Not just because I was now on the “ocean” side, but because in broad daylight, I could see how narrow the road was.

And how big those trucks were.

By the time we got to Auckland, the airport was restricted to just passengers. Ours turned out to be the second-last Air Canada flight to leave the country.

Darn. Another month or two here could have worked.

So “Kia Ore,” a Maori expression which seems to cover everything from “HI!” to “Have a nice day.”

If you ever get the chance to go to New Zealand, take it.

I’m already counting my next three million Aeroplan miles.",[]

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-04-17,"In recent weeks, the media has hailed the efforts of front-line workers who are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic — the doctors, the nurses, the first responders, the retail employees, among others.

What is like to work on the front lines of this health crisis?

I recently asked Natalia Kusendova that very question. Kusendova is the MPP for the riding of Mississauga Centre, and the youngest female member of provincial Parliament.

Several weeks ago, she added the extra duties of her previous career and has taken up a role as a registered nurse in the emergency department at Etobicoke General Hospital, while continuing her duties as an MPP.

As Kusendova explains, returning to nursing at this time is no different than her reasoning for getting into politics: “I wanted to impact my community in a positive way,” she says.

Working in an emergency room during this health crisis does not strike fear into Kusendova’s heart. On the contrary, she is motivated and energized by the high level of professionalism and organization at her hospital, by the levels of co-operation among various levels of government, and by the support from individuals and businesses.

Hospitals like Etobicoke General have introduced safety measures and protocols to ensure that doctors, nurses, staff members and patients are protected and safeguarded at all times. The stream of COVID-19 patients (as opposed to potential surges) has not overtaxed the system and led to panic situations.

Kusendova realizes that people might be fearful about going to a hospital during the COVID-19 crisis, and she wants to reassure the public that hospitals are safe environments. There is currently an adequate supply of intensive-care beds and ventilators to accommodate the health-care needs of the public.

Kusendova believes that the province’s state of emergency (declared on March 16) has been a significant factor in limiting the number of COVID-19 cases. It bans people from gathering in public spaces and it outlaws events with gatherings of more than five people.

She reiterates that if you are having mild symptoms and suspect COVID-19, please call Telehealth first at 1-866-797-0000. If you are having moderate to severe symptoms like difficulty breathing or chest pain, please visit to an emergency room right away. People are urged not to visit an assessment centre unless they have been referred by a health-care professional.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the actions of citizens to self-isolate at home and obey the guidelines from public health officials. “These preventative actions by Ontarians have helped to thwart a surge in COVID-19 cases,” she says. “We are apart, but we are all in this together.”

She understands that people are anxious, stressed and fearful, but says it’s important to keep going and not give up. She advises people at home to utilize online tools and platforms to communicate with friends and loved ones.

Indeed, many Ontarians may be experiencing mental health issues in dealing with the isolation and uncertainties of their personal circumstances, in which case Kusendova recommends contacting health-care professionals for help (visit 211Ontario.ca).

Kusendova commends the province in providing emergency funding of up to $12 million to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports, and $2.6 million to hire new psychologists and other mental health workers to support Ontario Provincial Police personnel.

Kusendova is also encouraged by the level of support from businesses and individuals across the province. The provincial government recently launched the $50-million Ontario Together Fund, to help willing businesses provide essential medical supplies and equipment.

So far, the program, through its website, has received more than 14,000 submissions from local businesses to provide everything from gowns, coveralls and masks to face shields, testing equipment and other products/services.

On behalf of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, and all Ontarians, I applaud Kusendova and all of the front-line workers who are putting themselves at risk to keep us safe and to minimize the spread of this deadly disease.",[]
197,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/autos/opinion/2020/04/17/sir-stirling-moss-and-the-canadian-connection.html,Sir Stirling Moss and the Canadian Connection,"['Norris Mcdonald', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Starfri.', 'April', 'Min. Read', 'Norris Mcdonaldspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-17,"Sir Stirling Moss, who died last weekend at 90 following a long illness, was no stranger to Canada.

The man who was, arguably, the most famous racing driver of all time, married his first wife, Katharine (Katie) Stuart Molson, of the Molson beer family of Montreal, in October 1957.

And he was instrumental in the design of Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, née Mosport, when he suggested that a turn at the south end of the circuit not be a hairpin but a sweeping turn with two corners. As a result, turns 5A and 5B were named Moss Corner.

We know the first to be true; marriages are a matter of public record. But the second? Might it be a myth? Let’s examine the evidence.

In two official Mosport histories, one by Chuck McLaren and the second by the late Bob Brockington, it is written that Moss, in 1960, was visiting Toronto and saw plans for the track. While he liked the layout, which had been designed by Alan Bunting, with input from Ray Liddle, he did suggest that the single-radius carousel hairpin at the track’s south end be changed to a 90-degree right followed by another right leading to the back straight — 5A and 5B.

This information is also included in the history of the circuit that’s on the CTMP website. And none of the Canadian racing historians — John Wright, Bob Harrington — or retired racing drivers — Walt MacKay, Jim Bray, Ludwig Heimrath — I talked to, or heard from, this week said anything that would discount this.

But the late Len Coates, in a book he published in 1973, “Challenge: the story of Canadian road racing,” told a different story. A reception was held two days before the first Player’s 200 sports car race in 1961 and Moss and two other world-class drivers of the day, Olivier Gendebien and Jo Bonnier, were featured guests.

“When they were pressed to discuss Mosport’s weak points,” Coates wrote in his book, “Gendebien and Bonnier said Moss Corner was too slow and offered little challenge to car or driver. Said Gendebien: ‘You brake, go around and accelerate. It’s too slow.’

“Bonnier nodded in agreement and looked dubious when he was told that Moss himself had designed the corner. ‘It must have been a misunderstanding,’ he said. ‘Moss likes to go fast. It’s not his type of corner.’

“This sent the reporters scurrying to Moss and he denied that he ever made any suggestions about the corner.”

Which comes as a bit of a surprise. But who really knows? Most, if not all, of the original committee members are dead and everybody I talked to about this seemed quite surprised.

To further muddy the waters, Heimrath said that Moss was in Canada earlier, in 1959, and “working on the track then.” How could that be? Well, Moss was a member of the Molson family at that time and it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that the original group, who were looking for financing to build Mosport, might have pitched Molson’s. It’s part of the history of Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant that Labatt came through with the last chunk of cash needed to build that place, so why wouldn’t Molson have been approached to fund Mosport, in whole or in part?

Whatever, Heimrath, who won three Canadian driving championships, including his first in 1961, raced against Moss on several occasions and said he was the best. “If he decided he was going to do something, like pass you, there was nothing you could do about it,” he said. “And he was the nicest guy to talk to; I never heard him say a bad thing about another driver. He was a true gentleman,” said the Canadian legend, who’s mellowed in recent years.

MacKay, of Caledon, didn’t race against Moss in that first Player’s 200, but he did drive in a 40-lap Formula Jr. race that was on the same program and he won it in a Lotus 18. That evening, during an awards ceremony at the Flying Dutchman Motor Hotel in Bowmanville, Moss gave him a trophy and a cheque for $400, “which kept me going for the rest of the season — mostly to keep my ’55 Chevy tow car running.” MacKay was surprised that Moss might not have been involved in the Moss Corner design. “I never heard that,” he said.

Jim Bray of Brantford, who raced in the production sports car race that was held just before the main event, was lapped by Moss (who drove in several races that day), “and he gave me his customary wave as he drove past.” Bray said he met Moss years later at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England and Moss said, “You drove a Sprite in that race, didn’t you? I remember — you were a hooligan!” Bray said he didn’t mind the name that Moss had called him, he was just delighted that the legend remembered him. He also was — and remains — convinced that Sir Stirling had a hand in the redesign of his corner.

Other reminiscences:

Sid Priddle, who was handling media relations for one of the Player’s races at Mosport, was rushing to get Moss to CFTO-TV in then-Agincourt for an interview when he was pulled over on Ellesmere Road for speeding. “Who do you think you are?” the cop said. “Stirling Moss?” Priddle said he had to close the car window quickly before Sir Stirling started to give lip to the officer.

Nelson Hudes, a marketing assistant at Mosport, recalls being taken for a ride around the track by Moss in 1985 when Sir Stirling had come to Mosport to race a Cooper Formula Jr. in a Vintage Auto Racing Association of Canada (VARAC) support race during a Can-Am Series weekend. “Sir Stirling was driving, F. David Stone (marketing manager) was beside him in the front seat, F. David’s wife Janice was beside me in the back. We got to Moss Corner and — I’m not making this up — Stirling Moss spun the car. It was drizzling slightly but the track wasn’t wet. He just lost it. He was quick to say that he hadn’t done it on purpose, but we knew.”

John Wright, of Kitchener, who sent me the photo of Ed Leavens, Moss and Zsa Zsa Gabor in Las Vegas, said few Canadians knew that Leavens, a London, Ont., auto dealer who raced the sports cars he sold, was a frequent co-driver of Sir Stirling’s. Wrote Wright, in an email: “Ed and Moss were teammates in the late 1950s or early 1960s at a Bonneville Speed Event with the BMC team. Ed was to drive the Sprite streamliner and Moss the “Roaring Raindrop.” I can’t remember the details, but the team took some respite at Las Vegas and it was there that someone took this photo of Ed, Sir Stirling and Ms. Gabor. Ed told me that Zsa Zsa wasn’t much interested in him, but that she was really interested in Moss ... And that photo that Bob Harrington sent of Phil Hill and Moss has to be treasured. We are losing too many of our heroes these days — a reminder that life has a 100 per cent death rate!”

Stirling Moss was knighted by Prince Charles for Service to the Empire in March 2000. He won 212 of the 529 races he entered while driving 84 makes of cars, including Mercedes, Lotus, Vanwall, Porsches, Maseratis, Jaguars, Ferraris, Aston Martins, Listers and Coopers. Although he won 16 Grand Prix, he never won the world championship, but finished second four times in seven years of F1 competition and third place the other three times. His greatest victory, however, took place in Italy in the 1955 1,000-mile Mille Miglia for sports cars. With journalist Dennis Jenkinson navigating, they finished the race in 10 hours and seven minutes, which was described by Motor Trend magazine as the “most epic drive, ever.” Moss was in such a rhythm that he took his girlfriend for an all-night drive, stopping for breakfast in Munich and lunch in Stuttgart.

He was involved in two massive accidents, the first at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit during practice for the Belgian Grand Prix in 1960 and the second at Goodwood in England in 1962, which left him in a coma for a month. He retired following a private test session the following year in which he determined his skills were too diminished for him to compete for victories.

He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990. Being very patriotic, he was once quoted as saying, “Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign one.”

In the words of Bill Warner, of the Amelia Island Councours d’Elegance, “he was witty, charming, warm and accommodating.”

And a helluva race driver, too.

Now, a personal note.

When I got on the Globe and Mail in 1965, I was assigned to edit copy on what was called “the rim.” I worked alongside geniuses, men and women who had heads full of facts and figures that would come in handy when they’d be on deadline and have to insert something into a story to give it context and they’d be able to write it in because they didn’t have to look it up, they just knew.

One of those brilliant people was Jim Shuttleworth. We’d been kids in Kapuskasing back in the late 1940s, early ’50s. Jim had flaming red hair when he was young, earning him the schoolyard nickname “Woodpecker” after Woody, which was eventually shortened to “Pecker.”

So I’m on my second shift and they’re bringing me along slowly, which means I got to report for work early, and at 6 p.m., the late shift arrives. As they start to work, I look at these new (to me) faces and there, three chairs over, is none other than Jim Shuttleworth. “Hi Pecker,” I say, and Jim turns slowly toward me and his eyes widen behind the round glasses he’s wearing and he says these exact words: “Well, if I live and breath, if it’s not that scrawny, snotty, asthmatic kid from Kapuskasing, Norris McDonald. Does security know you’re in here? And put out that cigarette.”

Jim had graduated in journalism from Ryerson and although he was working in news at that time, his first love was sports and he was eventually able to live his dream when he was appointed assistant sports editor (at a time when the assistant ran the section, the editor being the manager).

He was with that paper for 31 years and he was one of the best. In a business that — at least, in those days — attracted a lot of people who really didn’t know what they wanted to do when they grew up, Jim knew who he was — and that was someone you could count on. The Globe benefited greatly from his presence.

James Robert Shuttleworth passed on March 21 at Nanaimo General Hospital in British Columbia, where he’d moved — with the Star’s Wendy Darroch, who died in 2009 — following his retirement as production editor of the Report on Business. He was in his 84th year and leaves his sons, Fraser and Geoffrey, and his sister, Mary Anne.

Read', 'Jim Kenziespecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star']",2020-04-17,"AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND—Three million Aeroplan miles, accumulated bringing the Automotive Truth to you from around the world.

My reward? Two freebie business-class tickets anywhere Air Canada flies.

You’re not going to use them for a weekend in Montreal.

So Auckland, New Zealand, it was, about as far away from Toronto as Air Canada goes, for myself and the ever-patient Lady Leadfoot.

A fortuitous reunion at last fall’s Los Angeles Auto Show with Stephen Lester, formerly managing director for INFINITI Canada and currently in that same position for Nissan Australia, led to him putting me in touch with John Manley, his counterpart for Nissan New Zealand.

John graciously offered a brand-new Nissan Qashqai for a two-week road test.

I’ll tell you about the car this week.

Next week, I’ll tell you a bit about driving Down Under.

The Qashqai they get in New Zealand is pretty much the same as ours — a compact crossover/SUV/station wagon.

Theirs are built in England, while ours come from Kyushu, Japan.

Our tester listed at $45,490 NZD, which would work out to about $38,670 Canadian.

Equalizing equipment levels and specs as best as I could figure, model for model, New Zealand Qashqais are about $3,000 more expensive than ours.

Our tester was their range-topping Ti model, roughly equivalent to our Platinum trim. It’s fully belled and whistled, including SatNav, leather and all the safety goodies, about which more later.

“Kiwi-qais” get essentially the same powertrain we do — a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine pushing out 106 kW (141 horsepower) at 6,000 r.p.m. and 200 Newton-metres (147 lb.-ft.) of torque at 4,400 r.p.m., working through a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

Qashqai is offered here only with front-wheel drive, which is available back home, but only in the lowest trim level, and very few are sold.

In Canada, Qashqai also offers a six-speed manual transmission, which is not available here.

Our tester was equipped with the same Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires as my Targa Newfoundland Nissan Juke NISMO RS Turbo. They were predictably brilliant.

Our car was painted a bright blue. “Vivid” is the paint name, and it’s appropriate. We saw a few other new Qashqais in this shade, and it works very well with the car’s shape.

The biggest difference between their Qashqais and ours is, obviously, theirs are right-hand drive.

I’ve driven RHD cars fairly frequently, so it was no biggie once I got reacclimated to looking up and to the left for the rear-view mirror instead of up and to the right.

You also must be careful making right-hand turns, especially in town, to ensure you don’t “wrong-slot.”

But it was new for Lady Leadfoot to be sitting “over there” without a steering wheel in her hands. Both of us sometimes started to open the wrong door when we got into the car.

Some right-hand-drive cars use the same steering column as left-hookers, and just move it over.

Others mirror-image the control stalks, keeping the turn-signal lever closest to the driver’s-side door — hence, backwards to ours, and so operated with the right hand.

Qashqai is one of the latter, so I occasionally would switch on the turn signal when it started to rain, or turn on the wipers to indicate a lane change. Fortunately, New Zealand drivers are generally very patient.

Also, all the minor controls you are used to working with your right hand — HVAC, SatNav, sound system, etc. — you have to work with your left. Unless you’re part of about 10 per cent of the population that’s left-handed, this is a bit of an issue.

Again, Lady Leadfoot to the rescue. She worked all those functions for us.

Targa New Zealand took place just the week before we got there; I wonder how Messieurs Lester and Manley would have reacted if I had arrived a week earlier and put the Qashqai through that? For sure, I would have needed to find a different navigator. And possibly another wife.

Driven sanely, the Qashqai felt big enough to be comfortable, and small enough to be easy to handle on New Zealand’s narrow roads and dense downtown traffic.

Nissan’s “zero gravity” seats were really put to the test, given we were covering several hundred klicks on some of our driving days. Never a problem — these are among the most comfortable and supportive seats you will find at any price.

Yes, as usual, I would have preferred they not be covered in leather, but I get that I’m in the tiny minority here.

Gasoline, like everything else down here, is expensive, typically around $2 NZD a litre ($1.67 CDN). One more reason, in addition to the topography and climate, that British Columbians would feel right at home here.

We got around 7.5 L/100 km in mixed city/highway driving, which I didn’t think was too bad, given the hilly country we were in most of the time. New Zealand is basically a bunch of volcanoes, most of which are thankfully dormant.

The engine is reasonably quiet and unobtrusive. It motivates the car well, keeping up with traffic and easily handling the aforementioned topography.

I’ve never had a problem with CVTs, although I know some people do. They just give you the optimum gear ratio for any driving situation, so what’s the big deal?

True, the exhaust note doesn’t rise and fall in step with road speed, and that takes a bit of getting used to. But think of the fuel you are saving.

Ride quality was fine — New Zealand roads aren’t always glass-smooth, so this was appreciated.

One thing I liked about our Qashqai that all too many cars get wrong — once you turn the headlights on (and, of course, all your lights should be on all the time), you can just leave the switch in that position. When you turn the car off, the lights go off, although you can set them to stay on for a short time to light your way to your front door.

Once again, I ask the question — why is there even a headlight switch in a car?

A note about Nissan’s safety kit. As always, I shut off most of the buzzers and beepers because I’d rather it be me paying attention, not just the car.

But one safety feature does do something I can’t do — provide a bird’s-eye view when I’m trying to navigate in tight quarters.

Nissan pioneered this technology, and it has evolved in the upper trim levels of Qashqai into the “Intelligent Around View Monitor.” This consists of a series of cameras, the views from which are somehow integrated to show the front, rear and both sides of the car, in addition to that “overhead” view, as you back into your parking space. (Of course you back in, don’t you?)

As I apparently never tire of telling you, whatever is beside you is always revealed in properly adjusted side-view mirrors, making those so-called blind-spot-warning systems completely irrelevant.

But unless you have a giraffe as a navigator — and for all of Lady Leadfoot’s many fine attributes, “giraffe-like” is not one of therm — this overhead view is very useful, and should save you many chipped alloy wheels, scratched fenders and dinged bumpers.

It appears real station wagons aren’t coming back any time soon, although you do see more of them here than you do back home.

Now, we didn’t really have to come to New Zealand to discover this fact. But Nissan’s Qashqai provides a roomy, comfortable, well-equipped and handy-to-drive alternative.

No matter which side of the road you drive on.",[]

Cliff Lafreniere Is President Of The Trillium Automobile Dealers Association']",2020-04-10,"In seeking to better understand the challenges that we are all facing, and looking for wisdom to cope with a strange new reality, I turned to someone who has lived through difficult times before.

Who better to proffer words of wisdom than Norris McDonald, editor emeritus of the Toronto Star’s Wheels section, and the first journalist ever to be inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame?

I spoke with Norris recently about the COVID-19 crisis and asked him to share any stories or wisdom that might be a benefit to readers.

If you know Norris at all, you know that he’s a great storyteller who is rarely at a loss for words. He is also an award-winning journalist who shows no signs of slowing down.

Norris recounted a story from his days working at the Kingston Whig-Standard.

It was the early 1980s, and Canada was in a deep recession. The owner/publisher of the Whig-Standard, Michael Davies, faced a crisis at the paper. Many newspapers and media companies were laying off staff left, right and centre.

Davies wanted to avoid layoffs, and so he called a meeting with his entire staff from all departments (sales, circulation, reporters, editors, pressmen).

More than 100 staff gathered at the Grand Theatre in Kingston. There, Davies told his staff that the paper needed to boost circulation by 1,000 in order to avoid layoffs. He asked everyone to pitch in.

It was an audacious goal.

The Whig-Standard was ridiculed by staff on some of the larger newspapers. Imagine asking reporters and pressman to knock on doors to sell subscriptions? Unheard of!

When staff finished their shifts at the paper, they would go home, change, and go out canvassing for subscriptions. They did what they had to do and, within two months, the Whig-Standard had reached its goal of 1,000 new subscribers. Layoffs were avoided.

This story sent a chill down my spine. An entire company understood the dire predicament the paper was in, and knew what was at stake. As Norris said, “We had to work together back then to save jobs; now we have to work together to save lives.”

A global pandemic is a far cry from an economic recession, but there is a lesson to be learned in Norris’s story of yesteryear that applies to the COVID-19 crisis today.

We all need to do our part to get through these difficult and stressful times.

The “stay home” message has been broadcast on every media platform for weeks now, and yet some people are still playing fast and loose with the laws. They are congregating in groups, visiting parks and shopping in person for non-essential items. In doing so, they are putting themselves and others at risk.

I am the first to admit that self-isolation is tough. Being alone, at home, is a huge imposition, and many people are struggling with it. But please — do your part to minimize the risk of spreading this awful disease. Just stay home.

On behalf of the Trillium Automobile Dealers Association, I would like to acknowledge the recent passing of Rod Campbell, a legend in the automotive world.

Norris wrote a moving tribute to Campbell in last week’s Toronto Star.

Early in his career, Campbell covered racing events and sold advertising for radio before launching his own motorsports marketing and event planning company. He sold his company in 1999.

Throughout his career, Campbell befriended many motorsports drivers and industry giants, including Jackie Stewart, Roger Penske and Walter Hayes.

He was known for his tireless work ethic, his infection enthusiasm and his boundless confidence.

Campbell was also a champion of auto shows around the world, especially the Canadian International AutoShow (Campbell’s nephew, Jason, is the general manager of the CIAS.)

Campbell left an impressive mark on the automotive world and on those who knew him personally or professionally. He will be missed by many.",[]

Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-04-10,"The Formula One Canadian Grand Prix was postponed this week because of the pandemic. Can the cancellation of the 2020 Honda Indy Toronto be far behind?

And what about racing at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, Shannonville, Jukasa Motor Speedway and other small speedways in southern Ontario?

The outlook is not good. I talked to a number of people in the industry in recent days and, while they all expressed optimism, the likelihood of racing wheels turning in front of large crowds this summer and fall is practically nil.

Barring a miracle — and I repeat: a miracle — there is no way the IndyCar race at Exhibition Place, the IMSA SportsCar weekend at CTMP, the NASCAR weekend at the same place in September and the Canadian Short Track Nationals at Jukasa (a.k.a. the Bubba Pollard benefit) can take place for the following reasons:

There is no indication the COVID-19 epidemic is slowing. The number of sick, dying and dead is increasing daily. All big events in Montreal and Toronto (which means the rest of Ontario and Quebec, too) are cancelled or postponed through June, which means the earliest racing could get going is July.

But don’t think for a second that everything would suddenly be back to normal. We wouldn’t want to think we’ve beaten this thing, only to have it come back because we got careless. We will be taking baby steps. In fact, the prime minister said as much Wednesday.

Ontario would have to rescind, or modify, the five-person limit on gatherings. And there could be other conditions. Speedways might have to restrict attendance and separate people in grandstands.

The Canada-U.S. border is closed to all but essential traffic. The IndyCar circus, the NASCAR trucks and IMSA sports cars are not essential. This border has never been closed before and it will take some time before it’s wide open again. Particularly with this particular president.

Let’s take a close look at the Honda Indy. It’s scheduled to be held July 10-12. It’s run on a temporary track, so the facility has to be built. City hall, which is closed at the moment, has to reopen and be up and running in order to issue the necessary permits. The border has to be open again. The province has to lift the restrictions on gatherings. If the all-clear is sounded on July 1 (which it won’t be, but we can dream), all of the above would have to be done in 10 days for the race to happen. I suggest that is impossible.

Then, you have to wonder if racers will be able to afford to go racing. I know of two well-known Canadian racers, one who competes in the NASCAR Pinty’s Series and the other is a Canadian motorcycle champion, who have lost their lucrative personal sponsorships. They got phone calls to say their deals were cancelled.

Not reduced. Nullified.

And then there are all the small-time stock car racers, or club-level road racers, who might have been promised $2,500 if they put “Bob Smith’s Garage,” or “Avenue Road Computer Repair” on the side of their cars. They won’t be getting anything now. (Can you imagine the uproar if it was discovered that people were using business bailout money to sponsor a race car?)

Racers have been known to beg and borrow (no, racers never steal ...) to get enough money to go racing, but that’s not even an option this time because just about everybody’s broke.

In the bigs, starting with Formula One and going down the line through IndyCar, NASCAR and the rest, the racing sanctioning bodies have all laid off staff, as have most teams. Drivers and team managers have all taken pay cuts — but will that be enough? Zak Brown, who runs McLaren, said the other day that as many as four F1 teams could go out of business if this calamity continues for any length of time.

And then there are the spectators. Millions of Canadians are surviving because the federal government is giving them money. And those who are lucky enough to still be employed are watching their pennies. There is not a lot of disposable income around, no matter how you look at the situation.

As a result, you can split racing fans into three groups: Group A, who will go to the races no matter what; Group B, who won’t be able to afford to go, and Group C, who won’t want to have anything to do with crowds. So right off, whether it’s the IndyCar race, or the NASCAR trucks at CTMP (assuming they are able to be held), two-thirds of the customer base won’t attend. In the words of one speedway manager I talked to this week, this would be like having a rainout a month in advance.

(Although we’re talking about racing here, this model could be applied to hockey and baseball and all the other big-league professional sports. There will be a huge financial reckoning and adjustment when this is over, that’s for sure.)

The one race that could happen would be the Grand Prix. Everybody in the circus comes from Europe, so there wouldn’t be a problem with the U.S. border. The Montreal Grand Prix circuit and infrastructure is in place year-round, so they could hold the race as late as Thanksgiving weekend in October. And Montreal could lean on the Quebec government to ease the gathering limit so that the city could receive an injection of much-needed economic activity. Like the Honda Indy in Toronto, the Grand Prix means hotel rooms and that industry in both cities desperately needs customers.

John Bondar, the new proprietor, with a partner, of Shannonville Motorsports Park, is one track operator who’s sounding seriously optimistic. That doesn’t mean CTMP is standing still. Following the cancellation of the traditional Victoria Day SpeedFest long weekend in May, they’ve been “planning backwards,” starting with the Chevy Silverado 250 NASCAR trucks race in September and coming back to the motorcycle weekend in August and the IMSA SportsCar Grand Prix in July, figuring the trucks might — might — have a chance of racing. And they have other contingency plans in the works, like invitational races or club racers mixed in with the professionals. If they can open for business, that is.

“We’re all suddenly experts on this thing,” Bondar said, talking about the pandemic. “Nobody can say for sure, but I think — hope — that July might be reasonable to plan for some on-track action (where he could run motorcycle races or club car events over, say, three days with the entry split into three groups of 40 max and no mothers or girlfriends or other crew allowed if — if — the gathering limits went back up to 50).

“I think the (COVID-19) numbers will start to come down at the end of April,” he said. “We then spend all of May watching them roll down further and then, to be on the safe side, we don’t do anything in June. We could go in July and I think if the province returns to a 50-person limit, I’ll be OK.

“The U.S. is a disaster. They are way behind us in getting a handle on this thing. So we want to keep the border closed till they’re out of the woods. That’s not good news for CTMP, whose headliners are Americans, or some of the speedways that have big races and need Americans to deepen the field. But the country can’t afford to take any chances.”

I have a friend who works in the automotive industry. I think he’s a genius.

We were talking about COVID-19 (what else?) and Pete says: “I see quite a few people walking around now with masks on. Good for them. But then I got thinking ... if you want many more people to wear a mask, put a sports logo on it. The Raptors, or TFC. Winner teams.

“If you’re an IndyCar fan, you could wear a mask with the IndyCar logo on it (see illustration). Or NASCAR or F1. Perhaps even the individual teams, or drivers.

“Look, one way or the other, they will run the Indy 500 this year. They moved it from May to August; I figure it will be held in late September or early October. Whenever, can you visualize a couple of hundred thousand people at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway wearing masks that have IndyCar on them? Or Penske Corp? Or the Indianapolis Speedway logo?

“By then the NFL will be going, too. People will want to get out to the games. They will go if they wear a mask with the Patriots or the Bears or the Colts logo. The Bills and so on.

“Wearing a mask is not cool. Wearing a mask with your favourite sports team on it would make it cool. It will get more people to wear masks and help flatten the curve.

“People are at home with time on their hands. They can sew their own. Some have 3D printers and can make them that way. With the internet and social media, people will pick up on this within hours.”

As I said, I think he’s a genius.

BMW 750Li xDrive. 4 doors, 4/5 passengers, full-size luxury sedan. Part-time automatic four-wheel drive.

Price: Base list — $126,900. As tested — $156,300.

Engine: 4.4-litre V-8, double overhead camshafts, four valves per cylinder, variable valve timing, twin turbocharged, direct injection.

Power/torque, horsepower / lb.-ft.: 523 @ 5,500 — 6,000 r.p.m. / 553 @ 1,600 — 4,600 r.p.m.

Fuel consumption, NRCan City/Highway, l/100 km: 14.5 / 9.9. Premium unleaded fuel.

Competition: Audi A8, Jaguar XJ, Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

What’s best: Excellent dynamics for such a large car; opulent interior; strong image.

What’s worst: As always, the digital dashboard borders on hopeless; shift pattern just plain wrong; run-flat tires still not ready for prime time.

What’s interesting: Under all the gloss, it’s still a BMW.

I had driven about 20 kilometres from BMW’s head office in Richmond Hill down the 404 to 401 westbound, heading home in a brand-new 750Li sedan.

Flipping the metaphorical coin, I chose the express lanes.

Almost immediately, I hit a massive pothole, which I think may have already collected a Volkswagen and a couple of motorcycles.

The loud “BANG” from the right front corner told me I had blown a tire — a fact almost immediately corroborated by a warning light on the dashboard.

I hate run-flat tires, because I don’t trust them to “run flat,” the ride quality is usually awful all the time and they don’t provide a spare I could change myself.

Not that there was any place to change the tire, because the 401’s shoulders there are about half a car wide.

I personally know people who have been killed in just such a situation. I was not about to join their ranks.

So I put on the four-ways and trundled along at 45 km/h until I could find a safe spot to pull off near the Avenue Road exit.

The owners manual suggested I contact the nearest BMW dealer or roadside assistance. I thought, what if I had been driving through Kapuskasing at 4 a.m.?

By sheer good luck, a CAA tow truck happened along. The driver stopped to see if I needed help and within minutes, the car was on his flatbed and we were headed back to BMW.

Triple YAY! for CAA.

I retrieved the car the next day, and so the story can continue.

This car starts at $126,900. My tester had a boatload of options, which brought the total to $156,300.

The updated 7 Series continues with several traditional BMW styling cues such as the twin-kidney grille and the “Hofmeister kink” — the forward kickback of the rear roof pillars.

Speaking over the years with BMW stylists, they always say such things are helpful in that they provide a guide as to how to start styling the car. But these things are also somewhat restrictive, limiting their creativity.

Still, it’s a handsome beast, and everyone will know which brand you chose.

Power is provided by a 4.4-litre, twin-turbocharged V-8 — the last two digits of BMW’s model designations stopped having any relationship to the engine’s displacement long ago.

It generates 523 horsepower from 5,500 to 6,000 r.p.m., and a flat torque “plateau” of 553 lb.-ft. from 1,800 to 4,600 r.p.m.

The turbos are nestled between the banks of the engine’s “vee” to minimize the path the compressed air must take to reach those hungry cylinders.

A hard stomp on the throttle is followed by a brief pause while the car decides it wants to go. Once it does, it really goes — 0 to 100 km/h takes a shade over four seconds, which is quick by any standard.

The stop-start function that saves a few droplets of fuel isn’t as smooth in operation as some such systems, causing a noticeable shake and grumble as the engine coughs back to life.

The eight-speed automatic transmission provides power to all four wheels as is deemed necessary to maintain traction, although it is primarily a rear-drive car, consistent with BMW’s hallowed traditions.

Sadly, the transmission is controlled by a shift lever that can only be described as stupid.

It looks like the normal PRNDL (Park Reverse Neutral Drive Low) setup that has governed autoboxes since approximately the dawn of time.

But it’s not.

To get Park, instead of shoving the lever full-forward, you have to hit a button on the lever itself.

To avoid the obvious issue — people not hitting this correctly, the car rolling away, the concomitant lawsuits — the car seems to automatically select Park when you open a door.

Great — more technology to go wrong in 10 years.

BMW is not alone on this — Mercedes and others do it, too. “Why?” remains the question.

Frankly, the best way to handle this is what Lincoln, GM, Honda and others have done. Nobody shifts gears any more, so just dispense with the shift lever altogether and use push buttons on the dashboard somewhere.

The centre console is the most expensive real estate in the world — use it for stuff that needs it.

The standard air suspension on the 7 provides an excellent ride — they have obviously addressed the ride-quality issues that used to plague run-flat-tire-equipped cars.

You can also raise the car about 50 millimetres to help negotiate steep parking lot ramps or rough roads. It only works for a short time and at low speeds, then automatically returns to normal.

“Comfort” or “Sport” driving programs provide predetermined settings for a variety of functions such as ride firmness, handling and transmission response.

A third option, “Individual,” allows you to set your own preferred combination of choices.

My tester had the optional four-wheel steering, which turns the rear wheels counter-phase at low speeds to make the car more manoeuvrable, and in-phase at higher speeds to improve response and stability. I found it impossible to feel the transition, so it must do its job well.

Handling has long been a BMW hallmark, and this car’s agility belies its size and weight.

The interior is lovely, beautifully finished from obviously high-quality materials that all appear to be authentic — if it looks like wood, metal or ceramic, it probably is.

There is loads of room everywhere, and about a million seat adjustments, so anyone should be able to find a comfortable and supportive seating position.

Included in that option list were a couple of “Executive” packages, bringing features such as ventilated seats with massage function for the fronts, window shades and a bunch of so-called “driving aids” like self-steering, which I find massively annoying.

It also included the damnable “Driving Assistant,” who kept asking what I wanted her to do.

“SHUT UP!” apparently is not in her vocabulary.

I eventually found her off button.

If this is the “Ultimate Driving Machine,” why would I not want to drive it myself?

I also shut off the heads-up display, which I always find more distracting than helpful.

As with any new car, it will take you some time to get used to the minor controls.

BMW was one of the first to “digitize” the driving experience, and those early attempts at the so-called “iDrive” system were beyond hopeless. We spent half an hour with a German engineer on an early 7 Series program some years ago. It took him that long to show us how to change a radio station, and it still took about seven steps.

Either we are getting used to these things or they are much better designed, or possibly both, because this one is easier to use.

Actually, it reminded me a bit of Audi’s MMI system. Touching one of several buttons arrayed around the central controller takes you to a submenu — rotate that central knob to select a function, then push that knob to activate your choice.

This all requires you to take your attention off the driving task — a theme I have pounded on regularly — as the entire concept is inherently flawed.

But we aren’t going back to proper knobs and levers any time soon. At least there has been progress in making these things less dangerous.

Apparently, in the real world, most people only use a handful of the available functions. Once you get used to whichever you want, it becomes second nature.

While I’m whining about the minor controls, I’ll toss in another of my pet peeves. When I tell a car I want the doors unlocked, I want them to stay unlocked. This car relocks them every time the car dips below about 15 km/h, then re-accelerates.

There may be some way to disable this feature, but I couldn’t find it. My own VW did this until my genius mechanic broke the code.

Hey, it’s my car — I want it to react the way I want it to react.

The back seat is huge, and you have the option of a pair of buckets or a three-seat bench.

The rear seat head rests restrict rearward visibility as they typically do, but you can and should fold them down when nobody is sitting back there.

I have owned — and raced — BMWs over the years. Even in their luxury cars, the handling prowess I came to love is still there in the big 7 Series.

It may be buried under a ton of high-techery the market seems to want, but if you can dig below that and/or learn to ignore it, you’ll discover a fine-driving car that honours the company’s long traditions.",[]

Born dirt-poor on the Saskatchewan Prairie to a Methodist preacher father and a stay-at-home mother of five, Campbell built a financial fortune through ambition, determination, self-promotion, talent and an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time.

From volunteering, initially, to promote races at Le Circuit-Mont Tremblant north of Montreal, to announcing at the first Formula One race held in Canada at Mosport Park in Ontario, Campbell parlayed friendships with important people he’d met along the way to land public-relations and marketing contracts with Stirling Moss, Jackie Stewart, the Can-Am Series, Formula One drivers George Eaton and Brett Lunger and F1 team owners Walter Wolf and Mo Nunn.

His personal Mount Everest moment of success came when he launched Campbell and Co. to handle motorsport program promotion and event planning for the Ford Motor Co. He sold it in 1999, making him, as he would say, wealthy.

“We were very poor when I was a boy,” he said. “As a result, I was extraordinarily ambitious. I was determined to succeed.”

This ambition and determination gave him the good life, which he loved. Sure, there were failures, but in the end, the good outcomes far outweighed the bad. He travelled the world, staying in the best hotels. He played on the best golf courses, hobnobbed with the captains of industry — Roger Penske, Edsel Ford, et al — ate the finest food and drank the finest wines. In short, he thoroughly enjoyed his success.

He had two marriages — one not so good, the second the best, which gave him the family he adored.

One time, with Sandra, the love of his life, they were driving along the Pacific coast and she casually mentioned she’d like to live in Malibu one day. So, he bought a six-acre lot and built her a mansion, complete with a three-hole golf course (which got him into trouble with environmentalists, who demanded he rip up the greens).

He was respected far and wide and liked by one and all (except maybe those California environmentalists). When word got around that he was ill and would die, the phone started ringing. Bernie Ecclestone was among the first to call. Bernie thanked him for what he’d done for Formula One. There were many others.

He knew everybody — Penske, Walter Hayes, Michael Kranefuss, Pat Patrick, Jack Roush. Former Ford CEO and president Jacques Nasser once told him that if he ever had an idea — and he had a million — all he had to do was call his secretary and he’d have him in his office in an hour.

He was respected for his integrity — people trusted him implicitly — and his internal optimism. It didn’t matter if it was trying to recover money from his F1 friend Wolf or organizing the Santa Claus parade in London, Ont., he was convinced everything would turn out all right.

Er, the Santa parade in London? Yup, it was a great success, that parade in 1959, particularly because Campbell convinced an old roommate, the singer Robert Goulet, to drive over from Toronto to be a celebrity guest.

It was in London that Campbell discovered what would be the secret to his success. “If you agree to do a job, and then do more than expected, you add value,” he once told me. “Added value has worked wonders for me.” And then he told me how it all came about.

He’d been in Europe, serving in the U.S. army (he’d gone to New York to study broadcasting, applied for a green card and, as a result, got drafted) and, once discharged, had gone looking for a job, which was easier said than done. He finally landed one selling ads for a radio station in London, for which he had zero experience. But one of his clients, Ed Leavens, sold sports cars.

“When I was in the service, I’d gone to the German Grand Prix. I was captivated by the sights, the sounds, the bravery of the drivers — I loved everything about it. So when I started selling radio ads to Ed Leavens, I found out he raced the cars he sold. I asked if I could go to the races with him.

“So we were at Harewood Acres and Ed won his race. I had a brainwave. I called the radio station and asked the sports guy if I could do a live hit and I reported that Ed Leavens of Leavens Motors had won the race. So I sold him ads and reported on his races and that was added value. I always tried to do that.”

From London, it was on to Montreal, where he continued to sell ads for radio and immersed himself in the local motorsport community. Once, he chartered an Air Canada plane (then Trans-Canada Airlines) to take 50 people to the Indianapolis 500. He asked Dick Irvin Jr., son of the legendary coach of the Canadiens who was doing sports on the CTV station there, to plug the trip so he could sell the last couple of tickets. Irvin said sure, but asked Campbell to appear on his late-night sportscast to do a report after the plane got back.

It was 1964, the year Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs were killed in a second-lap inferno following a crash that involved seven cars. Irvin was so impressed with Campbell’s reporting and on-camera demeanour that, soon after, he offered him a job reading sports on weekends.

In a short period, Campbell had learned the advertising business and was an on-air radio and TV sports personality. He finished his on-the-job journalism training by writing about racing and later editing Canada Track & Traffic magazine. It all stood him in good stead when he went into PR.

Now, I could write a book about Campbell — but that’s already been done. In 2015, Campbell financed his limited-circulation autobiography, “I’m Rod — An Incorrigible Optimist: My life in auto racing and public relations.” He hired award-winning motorsport reporter Pete Lyons to write it and I think it’s terrific. In fact, I thought a good editor could turn his story into a bestseller. I still do. Few people in this world have led the fascinating life that Campbell led, or enjoyed the successes.

Here are some of Campbell’s observations and conclusions about people and business, garnered either from conversations we had (we met for lunch during the Los Angeles Auto Show for years, as well as in Toronto) or from his book:

“Respect was the central focus of my life. I wanted the respect of my family and my peers. As we grow older, we all realize there isn’t a lot to hold (onto) in our senior years except for memories and relationships nurtured in a lifetime of chasing dreams.”

Campbell was thrilled when he was hired to promote Jackie Stewart and his sponsor, L&M cigarettes. It came about after the company was told to “get that Canadian guy to do it.”

“I had made sure he knew my work!” Campbell said of the fellow who’d recommended him. “That’s just part of being ambitious and making sure the right people know. And it still works today.”

His nephew, Jason Campbell, general manager of the Canadian International AutoShow, wrote a letter to his uncle in recent weeks:

“In Grade 11, when I was 16, I had a creative-writing assignment in school, and I remember one of my tasks was to write a short biography on someone of my choosing. Of course, I chose my uncle Rod. I remember sitting down for this formal interview with you. By then, you had built up Campbell and Co. and seemed to be going from strength to strength. I remember asking you the question, ‘What has been the key to your success?’ And I remember very clearly your answer — ‘Confidence! Confidence is critical.’ You’ve always been one to instil that confidence in others — to push the boundaries, to do things not done before and to do them better than anyone else. That lesson in life is one of the greatest you’ve passed on.”

On Eaton, the Canadian department-store heir — the family name is still on the Eaton Centre in downtown Toronto — who raced in the Can-Am Series and Formula One: “George had a lot of natural talent, but he didn’t want to work to develop it. I used to nag him, but he’d say, ‘Nah, I don’t need to test; I can drive fine.’ He really liked the idea of being in the spotlight in a dangerous sport. He liked the badge it gave him. But he really wasn’t serious about racing in itself.”

On Stewart: “I don’t remember races so much as I remember incidents. One big one blew up at the Mid-Ohio track. Jackie was on a safety crusade in those days. I’ll never forget when we got to Mid-Ohio (for a Can-Am race), there was this one giant tree sitting out 50 yards off the first turn. No barricades, no protection, just a big tree sitting there. Jackie starts, ‘What? What is this? It’s got to go.’”

On Wolf: “I have to say, much as I liked Walter, and enjoyed working for him, he was a little loosey-goosey about business. He agreed to pay me pretty well for the time, $120,000 for the year, but getting him to actually pay was another thing. I always had to chase him to collect it and finally he’d wire me something or hand me cash.”

That was in the book — but there was more to it than that. I have copies of several collection notices sent to Wolf on behalf of Campbell (part of the research for a book I’m working on) and I once asked Campbell about them. “It would take awhile,” he said, “but Walter would always come through. Those (collection notices) were more to get his attention. He’s still a good friend.”

On Campbell and Co., and his great friend Len Coates: “Len was a wonderful Canadian writer I’d gotten to know from my reporting and publishing days (Canada Track & Traffic). I wanted him to be an integral part of Campbell and Co., but he wasn’t as disciplined as I’d wanted him to be. He liked to work all night and I wanted him in the office during business hours. He wanted to go back to Toronto (Campbell and Co. was headquartered in Michigan) and I gave him 15 per cent of the company in stock in an effort to get him to stay. But he gave that up and left.”

Campbell and his wife remained personal friends of Coates’s up to his death several years ago. In co-operation with the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, they then established the Len Coates Awards, three bursaries for young journalists studying at Toronto’s Ryerson University, Coates’s alma mater.

Campbell attended the bursary luncheon at Ryerson last fall and took a moment to talk about his friend, but to also tell those in attendance that the bursaries would be funded in perpetuity but that because of his age, it would likely be his last trip to Toronto.

Ever since I learned he was ill and would die, I’ve wondered whether he had a premonition.

As expected, the tributes have poured in.

Mario Andretti sent out a tweet in answer to one by Campbell’s son-in-law, Townsend Bell, the Indianapolis 500 and sports-car driver: “I’m one of the fortunate to have known him well enough to call him a friend. I’ll miss him.”

Bell himself wrote: “Rod had an amazing 88 years and we are proud that he passed with so much universal love and respect. He died a very happy man. What more can any of us ask for?”

Said Kevin Kennedy, executive vice-president of what is now called Campbell Marketing and Communications: “He taught me so much about the business, including a philosophy of always going above and beyond for the clients and the people we work with.”

Coates’s brother, Bert, wrote: “Rod was a true gentleman and friend throughout the motorsports and automotive worlds. And he shared his abundant energy and intellect in support of many worthy causes.”

And Dr. Hugh Scully, chairman of the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, wrote: “Rod would call me personally on a regular basis to offer wise counsel as the Hall’s board of directors was restructured and we broadened our scope of inductions to include international and media contributors to motorsport in Canada. As time passes, we will all treasure and share happy memories about Rod as a man, a friend and a genuine builder of motorsport.”

On March 19, less than two weeks ago, Campbell sent me an email with his phone number and asked me to call. I knew he was ill and so I was expecting the worst. But after explaining what his death would entail — essentially an explanation of California law — we settled in to enjoy some reminiscences and we had a few laughs. He told me Stewart had called, as had Sir Jackie’s son, Paul. And others. And we gossiped about our mutual pal, Coates. And then it was over.

Said Campbell to me, Norris McDonald, around 12:30 p.m. Pacific time in Santa Monica, 3:30 p.m. my time in Mississauga:

“OK, I’m outta here. See ya on the other side.”

The eternal optimist was already making plans for his next adventure.

Despite the increase in the number of cases, it is reassuring to see that citizens and businesses are complying with the rules of law and heeding the advice from doctors and health-care professionals.

Amidst this uncertain and fearful time, I am encouraged by the actions that some people and companies are taking to provide additional assistance to those in need.

Most new-car dealerships have reduced their hours of operation and are offering essential service and virtual sales. Some dealers have closed their doors altogether until it is safe to open them again. If you want to know your dealership’s policies and procedures with regard to COVID-19, and how to address your automotive needs, visit their website.

Automotive manufacturers have also posted messages on their websites for their dealer networks and for the public. The message from Pierre Boutin, president and CEO of Volkswagen Canada, I found particularly inspiring in light of all the daily updates.

Boutin writes: “Please follow the recommendations of our health authorities, and do what you can to minimize risk. And remember, finding the time to smile is a powerful tool in moments like these.”

Boutin’s message underscores the importance of everyone doing his/her part in fighting this pandemic, and also remembering that we are all human and need to connect with our families, friends, colleagues and neighbours.

This is a defining time for Canadians. We are all in this crisis together, and together, we will fight it and emerge stronger as a country when it’s over.

Across the province, new-car dealerships are helping their communities by providing vehicles, health supplies and other resources.

The Owasco Group generously offered up to 70 RVs and trailers to the Oshawa and Ajax hospitals to support first responders who need ways to get to home and work. The group has a volunteer team to come in and help with this as soon as the call comes in.

The Drive Muskoka dealerships in Huntsville provided much-needed medical supplies to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation.

During this health crisis, many people may feel that their life has spun out of control, which could lead to anxiety and depression. This could be the result of a lack of structure in their lives — the normal, day-to-day activities that we need to feel fulfilled — as people are wondering what to do with their time.

Here are some suggestions for making the most of your spare time:

If you have health-related questions or are looking for health services, contact Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.

If you have a friend or family member who is feeling down, call them up and try to buoy their spirits. You could put a smile on someone’s face who really needs it. Make use of free online conferencing services, such as Zoom, Skype, FaceTime or Google Hangouts. (It’s the next best thing to being with a person.)

Reach Her Email At Publiced Thestar.Ca Or Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-06-29,"On this Canada Day weekend, a time to celebrate the diversity of our nation, do you see yourself mirrored in media?

Does the news and information you give your time to daily reflect your lived experience and the concerns of your community?

I wish I did not have to ask these questions. Unfortunately, the reality is that although it is 2019, Canadian media still too often miss the mark in representing the diverse communities we report on and for. Study after study in recent decades tell us that women, Indigenous people and persons of colour are underrepresented both in media coverage and in the newsrooms of our nation.

I am of two minds in telling you that the Star is taking steps within its newsroom to aim to better reflect the diversity of our community. On one hand, I am disheartened that this is still an issue, one I have been following closely for some 30 years; on the other hand, I am encouraged at the seriousness of the Star newsroom’s new efforts to broaden the voices in the news.

A newsroom-wide project we’ve dubbed “Mirrored in Media” launched last month with the goal of increasing the number of women quoted in the Star to 50 per cent — a significant increase from the 25-30 per cent reported through our own and outside tracking. This initiative also aims to increase the number of people of colour quoted in the Star with the goal of establishing a benchmark and creating far greater inclusivity in news coverage.

A newsroom task force of more than a dozen journalists (of which I am part) is working with senior editor Julie Carl, who is leading this initiative at the behest of editor Irene Gentle. Both of these journalists believe passionately in the need for more inclusive coverage of our community and aspire to create a newsroom that mirrors the diverse Canada of 2019.

This is a vital matter of reader trust and engagement. Indeed, one of the eight “indicators of trust” established by the global Trust Project of which the Star is a participant, is a commitment to diverse voices and perspectives.

“If readers see themselves on our pages, they are more likely to trust us and therefore read us,” Carl said in a news release announcing this initiative, which includes ongoing daily tracking of all sources quoted in the work produced by Star journalists and freelancers and all photos published in the Star.

This initiative is part of a global effort launched by an organization called United for News, in connection with the World Economic Forum. Through this project, participating newsrooms around the world have committed to take steps to increase the voices of women in the news to 50 per cent. This has long been a goal of Canada’s own Informed Opinions, a non-profit organization that works with Canadian newsrooms to amplify women’s voices to achieve gender balance in media by 2025. (Full disclosure: I am a member of the board of Informed Opinions.)

In signing on to the United for News challenge to monitor and increase the voices of women in the news, Gentle made clear that that does not go far enough for the Star. In this community, in this newsroom, she insisted, we must make equally strong efforts to increase our inclusion of diverse voices.

I am optimistic the Star might finally achieve some success on these important goals. Across the newsroom, many reporters are now tracking their own sources and looking to databases of diverse sources to help broaden the voices in their news reports. Shari Graydon, founder of Informed Opinions, recently conducted two workshops in the Star’s newsrooms to introduce our journalists to the organization’s “ExpertWomen” database of women across Canada who are prepared to speak to the media about their subjects of expertise.

I have long believed that the everyday decisions and choices of Star journalists made in reporting and presenting stories, opinions, photos and other news and information are the foundation of greater inclusivity in the Star’s coverage. To me, this is the key to success in this critical initiative.

And clearly, many reporters are taking this to heart: “It’s been interesting to track the results — it definitely makes me think about some of the ways I find sources for my own reporting and who I talk to,” said reporter Sherina Harris, who is working with Carl on the daily tracking efforts.

On this day to celebrate Canada, it is indeed well past time that all Canadians can see themselves mirrored in media.",[]

Reach Her Email At Publiced Thestar.Ca Or Follow Her On Twitter']",2019-06-14,"It is that time of year again when news organizations the world over examine closely what has become the most comprehensive and trusted source of global data on digital news and what its audiences think about their online news media.

The Digital News Report, an international survey done by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University, provides some good news — and of course, some not-so-good news too — about Canadians and their trust and engagement with the news.

The topline: While Canadians’ overall trust in news has dropped 6 percentage points in the past year, Canadians still rank fifth of 38 countries for media trust, with 52 per cent trusting in Canadian news overall and 59 per cent trusting the news they use.

Across all countries surveyed, the average level of trust in the news in general is down 2 percentage points to 42 per cent and less than half (49 per cent) trust the news media they themselves use. Trust in news reached via social media is lower still both in Canada and overall.

Canadians report a more positive view of our news media and its mission than those in most other countries around the world. A majority of the 2,055 Canadians who participated in the detailed survey conducted Jan. 17-Feb. 18, believe news organizations in Canada keep them up to date, (70 per cent); help them understand the news (60 per cent); and fulfil the journalistic watchdog role of monitoring powerful people (49 per cent).

Further, the report tells us, these positive assessments of the news may well be linked to higher trust in the news.

“Put simply, we find that people are more likely to trust the news if they feel it keeps them up to date with what’s happening, helps them understand it, and holds power to account,” the report tells us.

And, increasingly, Canadians are turning to trusted news brands to counter significant concern about misinformation online. The survey reports that 61 per cent of Canadians are concerned about their ability to sort out what is real and what is fake on the internet. As well, a majority (70 per cent) have taken steps to assure the credibility of their news, by checking information against several trusted sites and declining to share news they believe might be inaccurate.

The bad news: Only 9 per cent of Canadians indicate a willingness to pay for news — even the news they trust. Given the well-documented breakdown in the advertising revenue that traditionally supported serious news, this is a concern for most news organizations, including the Star, that are building their news subscription business to fund trusted public interest journalism.

Of concern also to the news business and to democracies that require informed civic engagement is a stronger trend around the world this year to “news avoidance.” More than half of Canadians say they actively avoid the news at least occasionally and more than a quarter admitted to being “worn out by the amount of news there is these days.”

“People say they avoid the news because it has a negative effect on their mood (58 per cent) or because they feel powerless to change events,” the report states.

This exhaustive report provides considerably more data to dig into, to think deeply about and perhaps, act on. Certainly, the Star newsroom is giving careful consideration to what more it can do to build greater trust with its audience. On trust, this survey ranks the Star ninth of 16 English-language news organizations with four broadcast outlets ranked in the top four.

While the trust scores are all close overall, this middle-of-the pack place is both puzzling and discouraging to me, given the extensive amount of work the Star has done to enhance reader trust. In the past year, the Star has participated in a global trust project that resulted in eight “trust indicators” being incorporated into our website content, including transparent labelling to make clear the difference between news and opinion, and journalism and paid content.

I know the Star takes seriously its commitment to accountability and transparency — the foundation of trustworthy news. Accuracy and fairness are core to our journalistic standards. So, what more can be done to encourage greater audience trust?

That is a serious and important question: I want to know what you think and will share your insights with the newsroom and our trust committee. Please tell us: What do you think would build greater trust in the Star’s digital content?",[]

On Tuesday, the Toronto Star announced it was formally a member of the Trust Project, a global collaboration between news organizations aimed at fostering greater reader trust.

Over the noon-hour that same day, members of the Star’s trust committee, formed more than a year ago to improve transparency of our journalism, held an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit. (Reddit is a discussion, rating and news aggregation website).

Here we present some edited highlights of the AMA, which saw more than two dozen questions from readers. Responses and questions have been cut for length and clarity. The full text of the AMA can be found on reddit.com.

Q. You set up a paywall on your site. How can you expect people to trust you? — UnoriginallyGeneric

A. Irene Gentle, Editor of the Toronto Star: Research has shown that Canadians are generally unaware of the financial challenges of the media industry ... At one point, advertising helped pay the bills of expensive journalism — and journalism is expensive. But Facebook and Google are taking up about three-quarters of the entire industry’s ad revenue. In other words, American tech giants are reaping the rewards of work done by Canadian media outlets, rather than the outlets actually doing the work. Also, good, responsible journalism is very expensive. It can take a reporter weeks at times to verify a key fact in a story. It looks, to the reader, like a sentence. But that sentence took multiple tools to verify and confirm.

Q. Journo student from St. Clair College here. How can we, as young journos, learn to get the public’s trust again? — cynicalPsionic

A. Diana Zlomislic, Investigative Reporter: As journalists, I think we all need to commit to being fair, impartial, accurate and transparent about our processes. When columnists provide opinion, it’s critical the reader or viewer knows that’s exactly what they’re getting. Diverse voices, even those we disagree with, are critical to free press. But the public needs to know there is a difference between opinion and reporting.

Q. With user commenting being cancelled, how do you know if parts of a story are not leaving out important details that you have overlooked? — GTA705

A. Robin Honderich, Senior Manager of Newsroom Audience Engagement: It’s always possible that a detail was missed in the production of any story. If this is the case, we provide many ways for readers to get in touch with us to let us know. Aside from our ‘contact us’ page, which provides a number of ways to get in touch but is not always easy to find, at the bottom of every article page ... is a Twitter link or email address for that staff member for extremely easy access.

Q. What are your thoughts on the era of the accusation of “fake news” that has become mainstream? Do you feel any news can be “fake” or is it all rooted in some degree of truth? — RationalSocialist

A. Brian Bradley, Digital Producer: I do believe in the big World Wide Web that some information can be “fake,” or at the very least, not corroborated, sourced, etc. The onus is on the news organization to follow practices that demonstrate the news is trusted. Is the story solid for sources, background?Who is the reporter, what have they reported? Is there an error-reporting system?

Q. I think that if you want to elicit trust in the reading public, you first need to hire writers who look like the city. Toronto is a city engulfed with multi cultures, different ethnicities. How many Black, Asian, South American writers do you have on your staff? — tuxman06

A. Angela Mullins, Managing Editor (StarMetro): You make a very good point and one we are incredibly cognizant of in our newsrooms across the country. I was largely responsible for hiring new staff in our Western Canada newsrooms earlier this year as part of the StarMetro expansion and I can assure you there was a tremendous amount of attention paid to diversity in all stripes from gender to ethnicity to race. The reporting and management staff are a microcosm of the cities in which they tell stories.

Q. What actions is the Star Trust taking to stop promoting and legitimizing those who are spreading false information? — kofclubs

A. Kenyon Wallace, Investigative Reporter: In becoming a member of the Trust Project, the Star is agreeing to follow specific disclosure standards about how we do our journalism. The Trust Project calls these standards Trust Indicators, which provide readers with information, such as mission statement, ownership structure, sources of funding, and journalistic standards.",[]

While I find some consolation in the fact that recent studies tell us that Canadians trust their news more than do news consumers in other parts of the world, the overall data on trust in journalism in Canada and beyond makes clear that serious news organizations such as the Star should not underestimate public skepticism about journalism.

Increasingly, in this time when misinformation can go viral across the internet and that vile f-word epithet (f— news) has been weaponized against journalists and news organizations, those of us who take journalistic responsibility seriously must take steps to show that we are real news.

To that end, the Star announced the good news this week that it is a partner in the Trust Project, a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism.

This project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster reader trust by helping to guide digital news audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found trusted sources amidst the noise and nonsense that can be found across the Internet and especially on social media. The project is funded by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Google, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Democracy Fund and the Markkula Foundation.

In becoming part of this initiative, the Star joins a group of global news organizations committed to incorporating “Trust Indicators” into all digital content. These indicators are key transparency standards for news and information that help readers recognize the commitments and expertise behind trustworthy journalism.

These include a new “About Us” page that states clearly the Star’s mission, its ownership structure, leadership team and its key ethical standards. You can now find a link to that page on every piece of content on thestar.com — as well as a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a highly visible means to report an error. As the Star’s transparency reporter Kenyon Wallace told you on Tuesday, these indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about our reporters that highlight their expertise and backgrounds.

What is trusted news? Across Torstar news organizations, we define trusted news as accurate, accountable and ethically produced. Being accurate means verifying information before sharing it – and correcting mistakes when they happen. Being accountable means being transparent and open about what we do and how we do it. Being ethical means producing news and information according to ethical standards as set out in Torstar’s recently updated Journalistic Standards Guide.

All these measures are key requirements for becoming part of the Trust Project. Its Trust Indicators are well-thought out signals for readers established by international news leaders following consultations with news audiences about what they believe makes journalism trustworthy. As Craig Newmark, one of the project’s funders told the Poynter Institute’s contributing editor David Beard in an interview this week, “News outlets want to make a statement, a credible statement, that they can be trusted. We need a Better Business Bureau, the equivalent of Consumer Reports (for journalism), but the first step is for a news outlet to come out credibly and say, ‘Hey, you can trust us’.”

While the work required to incorporate all of these trust indicators across all the Star’s digital content has been extensive in recent months, I think it also bears stating that the values that provide the foundation for these trust indicators are not new for the Star, a 126-year-old news organization that has put a high value on ethical journalism and accountability to its readers for many decades. For me, that is evidenced by the fact that the Star has had a public editor/ombudsman to respond to reader concerns about accuracy and ethics since 1972.

Still, given the current often nasty environment of online misinformation and mistrust in media throughout the world, it matters much that the Star do all it can to show you its strong commitment to delivering trusted news, information and content on all platforms.",[]

On Tuesday, the Star announced that it is formally a partner in the Trust Project, a global consortium of news organizations working together to improve trust in journalism. The project, led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman and hosted by Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, aims to foster trust by helping to guide audiences to reliable, credible news sources and making it clear to readers when they have found them.

With Tuesday’s announcement, the Star joins more than 30 other credible news companies, such as the Washington Post, the Economist and the Globe and Mail, participating in the Trust Project.

“We keep saying journalism matters but we weren’t showing how, or why, or what journalism actually is. That was the inspiration for our own trust project, which began in May 2017. And it was the inspiration for being part of this larger effort to be transparent and accountable on all kinds of fronts,” said Star Editor Irene Gentle.

Opinion | Public Editor: Readers need to distinguish news from opinion

The Star’s internal trust committee, an ongoing initiative made up of employees across Torstar, has overseen the creation of a dedicated Trust page, a larger glossary of Star news terms, new conventions on story labelling, and a weekly trust feature looking at the various ways the Star does its journalism.

“The Star has long had a very deep commitment to responsible, public service journalism. We have a public editor, independent from the newsroom for people to voice complaints to. We are part of National Newsmedia Council, an independent body that oversees and adjudicates journalism complaints. We have a code of conduct. We have ethical discussions on what we do and how we do it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. We know this but we weren’t telling our story,” said Gentle.

In the global Trust Project, participating media organizations agree to follow certain disclosure standards, known as Trust Indicators, developed by news executives around the world following dozens of interviews with readers that sought to discern what audiences value in news.

The indicators essentially present a variety of information about the publication that readers have said is important, such as ownership structure, executive makeup, mission statement, ethics, sources of funding, and journalistic standards and policies. The indicators also include clear labels to help readers better distinguish between news, opinion, analysis, and sponsored content, as well as biographical details about reporters that highlight their expertise and track records.

Participants also state any commitments to presenting more diverse perspectives, citations and references for published statements of fact, and information about why certain stories were pursued and by what means.

Lehrman likens the Trust Indicators for news to the equivalent of nutrition information.

“It’s like a nutrition label that you would get on a piece of news,” Lerhman said in an interview. “Maybe you care a lot about ethics. Maybe you care a lot about the author’s expertise. Maybe you care a lot about the organization as a whole. So, you will get all these pieces of information and you can make your own decisions about what news you want to trust.”

How does this all translate into what Star readers will experience? For starters, at the bottom of every article published on thestar.com, readers will now find links to three trust-related features: a more visible “Report an Error” button, a link to the Star’s journalistic standards guide and a link to the organization’s “About Us” page.

In recent months, the latter two features have undergone substantial revision overseen by Public Editor Kathy English.

Behind the scenes, the Star’s development team has been working on updating and standardizing internet markup language that will help the Trust Project’s tech partners — Google, Facebook, and Bing, to name just a few — better guide audiences to trusted sources.

210,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/08/03/whats-in-a-word.html,What’s in a word?,"['Kenyon Wallace', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterfri.', 'Aug.', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-08-03,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where every week we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism.

At the beginning of this year, as part of the Star’s ongoing transparency project, we published a feature looking at how our newsroom style committee strives to maintain a sensitive, clear and consistent presentation of content.

The article, which delved into the role of the style committee and its decisions on word usage, proved popular with readers. In light of that, we thought it would be fun — and, we hope, of value — to look at the reasoning behind why the Star has made certain style decisions about specific words.

The examples we have chosen for this feature are a sampling of words — some quirky, some contentious — from the Star Stylebook, a newsroom resource providing guidance on everything from spelling, capitalization and punctuation to the use of numbers, measurements and foreign words and phrases.

We sat down with Anthony Collins and Jon Ohayon, co-chairs of the Star’s style committee, to get the goods on who is winning the name game in one Toronto neighbourhood and whatever happened to that reliable staple, the good old hot dog.

Days of blunder: The Canadian Press, the national wire service that publishes a well-respected guide on style, prefers daylight time but Star style is daylight saving time, on the grounds that it’s more commonly used. Many say daylight savings time, but that’s less common than the singular. Daylight time is convenient in headlines, though — a useful fallback(ward) position.

Flipping the bird: Canadian Geographic magazine ruffled some feathers in 2016 when it proclaimed Perisoreus canadensis to be our “new national bird” but spelled its name the American way: gray jay. We knew that wouldn’t fly, so the Star used the Canadian spelling grey jay in our coverage, relying on the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for backup. The species was recently renamed the Canada jay, so patriotic birdwatchers and word watchers can both breathe easy.

To Beach his own: It’s a decades-old debate that may never be resolved: what to call the east-end Toronto neighbourhood by the lake. Many longtime residents insist on the singular form the Beach, but others swear it’s always been the Beaches.

The Beach won out in a 2006 neighbourhood poll and that’s the name that appears on street signs along Queen St. The Star planted its flag in the Beach camp, too, in 2009, when it created a neighbourhood map of Toronto with input from readers. You’ll still see “Beaches” in the Star: in quotes, for instance, or in the name of the federal/provincial riding, Beaches—East York. But when it’s our choice, we prefer the Beach.

Tweet science: Though we capitalize Twitter, we lowercase tweet as both a noun and a verb. In the early days, around 2008-09, our archives show we capitalized tweet quite often, as it seemed exotic.

Stuck on neutral: The Star stylebook advises writers to “use gender-neutral terms such as spokesperson, chair, camera operator, firefighter and letter carrier whenever possible.”

As with any style rule, there are always exceptions: words like actress, freshman and fisherman are still so common that they’re hard to avoid (and don’t get us started on ombudsman, which many insist is gender-neutral). On the other hand, firefighter and flight attendant are so widespread that their gendered antecedents are seldom heard now. In between are phrases like business person and humankind that will sound natural to some readers and drive others up the wall. Preferring gender-neutral terms may lead to accusations of political correctness run amok, but the language is constantly evolving, and what sounds odd or stilted today may soon be common parlance.

Voyage of the God damned: The Canadian Press’s two-word style seems a bit archaic: God damn/God damned. (There’s also a note that it should be used with discretion.) Star style — goddamn — seems much less jarring and less clunky as an adjective, though we also use it with discretion and it mainly appears in quotes. Readers often remind us that God should be capitalized, though in this common phrase, we disagree.

Mike dropped

The Star follows Canadian Press style on the abbreviation for microphone, which used to be mike. In 2015, it was changed to mic. The phenomenon of the mic drop would have looked bizarre in print as mike drop and mike drop is much less prevalent online.

How the sausage is made: CP’s longtime preference for spelling hotdog as one word didn’t pass mustard — er, muster — with some readers. It always looked a little strange to us, too. So we were glad when the CP Caps and Spelling guide recently changed its entry to hot dog — no doubt avoiding many future bunfights.",[]

Shortly after 10 p.m. last Sunday July 22, Inori Roy, a reporter in the Star’s radio room, noticed a trickle of posts on Twitter about unconfirmed reports of gunfire on the Danforth.

Within a few minutes, the trickle became a deluge. To find out more, she immediately called police, EMS and Toronto Fire Services, which told her they had received the first call at 10:04 p.m.

“The gravity of the situation really dawned on me when I heard the urgency in the voice of the paramedic I spoke to. He sounded like he was on the verge of panic, like there was as crisis,” said Roy. She ran over to the Star’s digital desk to alert editors, who instructed her to start writing a short story to be posted on thestar.com.

At the same time, Star photographer Richard Lautens had just returned to his home near the Danforth after a vacation in cottage country, when his two kids, who had gone out for dinner, came running in. They had just seen a string of police cars, sirens blaring, speeding down the Danforth.

Lautens grabbed his camera and started running. A few minutes later, at around 10:10 p.m., he was at Alexander the Great Parkette at the corner of Logan and Danforth Aves., where he saw paramedics administering first aid to two people lying on the ground. “It was just mayhem everywhere,” said Lautens. “Nobody knew what was going on.”

He snapped pictures of bystanders looking on in shock, of police interviewing witnesses and of paramedics loading victims on gurneys into ambulances. Using his phone as an internet hotspot, he quickly emailed the newsroom a couple of photos that could run with the initial story, which went online at 10:51 p.m. It reported that a man dressed in black had opened fire on the Danforth, injuring multiple people.

As the scale of the tragedy started to become clear, news editor Jason Paul, who was overseeing production at the Star that night, began making a plan to get reporters on the ground.

“As more eyewitness accounts came in, we wanted to be sensitive knowing that lives had been lost and others injured. We wanted to help readers understand what was happening but at the same time knowing this was a devastating situation for so many people,” said Paul.

He called breaking news editor Amit Shilton to discuss the unfolding situation. Shilton then started calling reporters who lived in the area of the shooting to see who could get to the scene and interview witnesses.

One of those reporters was David Rider, the Star’s city hall bureau chief, who was out walking his dog when he started hearing sirens and saw a police command vehicle heading north on Carlaw Ave. towards the Danforth. Shortly before midnight, Rider stationed himself outside the police cordon at that intersection and started interviewing people leaving the scene.

Shilton also reached Wendy Gillis, the Star’s crime reporter, who hopped in a cab and rushed to the other end of the cordon at Danforth and Broadview Ave. where she interviewed several witnesses. One of the first people she stopped on the street was an employee of the Second Cup near Chester subway station that had been a target of the gunman. The employee provided a detailed description of the shooter and recounted a shocking story of watching him fire his gun at the shop.

Back in the newsroom, digital producers Tanis Fowler and Priya Ramanujam kept the online news file updated throughout the night and started a liveblog which pulled in tweets from reporters on the scene and Roy in the radio room.

Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Gillis learned — thanks to a timely text message from a colleague — that Police Chief Mark Saunders and Mayor John Tory would be holding a press conference in just a few minutes at Danforth and Logan Aves. Gillis was about a kilometre away so she sprinted as fast as she could, arriving just as the chief and the mayor stepped up to the microphones.

Jenna Moon, the overnight radio room reporter, was also dispatched to the scene to gather colour and interview witnesses. She later met up with Gillis before heading to St. Michael’s Hospital to check on the status of victims.

Columnist Rosie DiManno also went to the scene and spoke to witnesses for a story she filed early that morning.

Sunday night’s front-page editor, Anthony Collins, stayed all night to combine the individual journalists’ reports into a comprehensive story covering as many aspects of the shooting as possible.

“At that point we were really leaning on the reporters to give us whatever kind of colour they could from the scene in order to take the story beyond a shorter police file, to really flesh out what happened,” said Paul, who also stayed at the Star throughout the night. “The goal was to set up a really great package — Rosie’s column and a thorough news story — that was available for readers in the morning.”",[]

This week, we look at how the Star’s wine critic, Carolyn Evans Hammond, responded to reader inquiries about why she reviews American wines in the midst of a trade war with the U.S.

Late last month, the Star’s wine reviewer, Carolyn Evans Hammond, wrote an article in which two of the five wines she recommended were American.

Her review happened to come at a time when the Canada-U.S. trade war was reaching a fever pitch as Canada prepared to slap retaliatory tariffs on imports from its southern neighbours.

Evans Hammond discovered that her recommendations of American wines did not sit well with some readers.

“I generally enjoy your Saturday columns in the Star, but in light of the current state of Canada/U.S. trade relations, I find it curious to find you recommending two out of five wines coming from the U.S. this week,” one reader wrote to her. “Surely, you have heard the gathering talk on boycotting U.S. wine (and many other products) coming from this side of the border in response to the bullying tactics from the U.S. regarding trade tariffs.”

“Surely there are enough great wines in the world that we do not need to promote those from the U.S. at this time. Is it possible for you to discontinue the review of U.S. wines?” asked another.

One reader stated bluntly: “It’s time to stop pushing America wines in your Star column.”

While Evans Hammond says she understands the concerns of these readers, she notes her job is to recommend wines based on value for money, relative to similar wines at that price point. And that means American wines are fair game, regardless of the political climate.

Have your say

“From my perspective, I can’t not include wines because I don’t agree with a political situation going on in a region. That’s a huge kettle of fish,” she said in an interview.

Evans Hammond says if she were to start taking a nationalist stance on her reviews, she would be doing a disservice to wine consumers and producers.

“As a wine columnist, I recommend wines from all over the world based on those that offer the best value for money within the context of a respective column. It is up to individual readers whether they want to buy American wines,” she said.

“What’s important to know is this: fierce global competition in winemaking is constantly pushing quality up and prices down, so it’s a very exciting time to be a wine enthusiast. With that in mind, I try hard to keep abreast of what’s out there and to recommend only the wines I think offer the very best value for money. Then, I give each wine I recommend a score out of 100 and qualify that score with a lengthy tasting note to communicate what makes the wine special.”

The Star’s public editor Kathy English said while the emails Evans Hammond received from readers were not unreasonable given the current trade situation between the U.S. and Canada, she stressed that columnists, including Evans Hammond, are fully within their remit to choose what they write about.

“Columnists have the prerogative and latitude here to select the topics they write about, and in the case of reviewers, to select the products they review,” said English. “There are no policy issues at play here whatsoever.”",[]

This week, we look at how three Star journalists created a unique multimedia feature around safe spaces in Toronto.

Asian Community AIDS Services, Chinatown. The Drake Hotel, West Queen West. Planned Parenthood, The Annex. The Palm House at Allan Gardens. Glad Day Bookshop in the Village. The 519 LGBTQ2S Community Centre.

Just some of the cherished safe spaces highlighted by 10 people in Toronto’s LGBTQ community interviewed for a multimedia feature by Star journalists Evy Kwong, Kelsey Wilson and Carlos Osorio.

The feature, published late last month just in time for the city’s annual Pride weekend, comprised text, video, audio and photographs to go inside the spaces identified by the interview subjects that give them a sense of sanctuary.

Kwong, a digital producer, says the idea for the project was formed in response to the tragic deaths of several members of Toronto’s LGBTQ community who police believe were murdered by alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

“Even though it had seemed that acceptance and inclusivity was progressing for the community, there was reason to feel more unsafe than ever,” Kwong explained in an interview. “We wanted to talk to a spectrum of people on where they felt sanctuary despite the news of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur. Where did these people feel they could be 100 per cent safe?”

With that question in mind, Kwong and colleagues Wilson, a video producer, and photographer Osorio, set out to find 10 people to talk openly about their safe spaces and identities.

It was a challenging task. With just four days before publication, the journalists had to track subjects down, meet them at various locations across the city, shoot video and collect audio, edit and type up interviews.

Kwong began by reaching out to friends in the LGBTQ community, who referred her to people they thought might want to speak about their experiences. She also reached out to more well known figures in the community such as city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam and Armand Digdoyo, an event producer, who also founded New Ho Queen, a collective highlighting the Asian queer community.

“We were in a rush, but I still wanted to ensure that we had an array of voices, because being LGBTQ is so much more than just the terms in the acronym, and we were blessed to have such enthusiastic response, even on a day’s notice,” Kwong said.

Meanwhile, Wilson and Osorio met with representatives of Pride Toronto to get feedback on the concept and to ensure they were properly representing the LGBTQ community. The response was a thumbs up.

When it came to photography, Osorio says he was aiming for “something bright and very in your face.” But he also wanted to hint at the tragedies faced by the LGBTQ community this year, so he added a dark edge around the frames of his photos to “show that all is still not well and that a bit of a cloud still hangs over this year’s Pride.”

Osorio added that a challenge for him was trying to keep the look of the photographs consistent while being in different locations.

A recurring dilemma the journalists encountered more than once during the course of their interviews was that some of their subjects told them they hadn’t fully “come out” to their families yet.

“Of course, we were immediately concerned about whether telling their stories could create lasting personal damage,” Wilson said. To address this, she says she and her colleagues were fully transparent with their subjects about what would be published.

“We wanted them to feel completely comfortable with their part in the finished product. These people are trusting you with deeply personal stories and you feel obligated to do them justice.”",[]

The Toronto Star’s running tally of the false claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump — compiled by Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale — is consistently among the most-read stories on thestar.com.

Dale’s list of Trump’s mistruths now numbers more than 1,800 since the real-estate tycoon became president.

Inspired by the popularity of Dale’s work, associate editor Lynn McAuley sought a way to assess the truthfulness of claims made by Canadian politicians.

A good place to start, she thought, was question period on Parliament Hill — a 45-minute session on weekdays in which Members of Parliament for Opposition parties pose questions to the governing party (MPs representing the government are also allowed to ask the odd question). Why not fact-check the claims made by Opposition parties in the framing of their questions, as well as the answers provided by the government, in order to get a sense of how honest our elected representatives are in the spotlight?

Each session is recorded in Hansard, the official transcript of Parliament.

Five days of question period in April and May were randomly chosen to be put under the microscope by Ottawa Bureau reporters Bruce Campion-Smith, Alex Ballingall, Alex Boutilier and Tonda MacCharles, along with reporters Brendan Kennedy and Marco Chown Oved in Toronto.

Question period can see upwards of 40 questions, producing some 9,000 words in one 45-minute session. That meant the team had to check about 45,000 words over the five days examined.

“We were helped that there was duplication from day to day as opposition parties hammered away at a particular topic, such as the carbon tax,” said Ottawa Bureau Chief Bruce Campion-Smith.

Every morning, a reporter in Ottawa shared the previous day’s question period transcript in a Google Doc, explained Kennedy. Subjects were divvied up randomly or according to previous experience or interest in a topic. Claims were assessed as true, false, a stretch or a dodge.

“We really sought to be fair in how we labelled questions and answers,” Campion-Smith said. “That meant a lot of research into a particular topic and evaluating the statements by MPs and cabinet ministers.”

To check the validity of MPs’ statements, the reporters consulted government budgets, parliamentary committee reports, statements by ministers and policies. In some cases, the reporters reached out to MPs’ offices to ask for the source of their information, and then sought verification through further research.

“The toughest claims to fact check were the vague or generalized assertions, and anything that was a borderline opinion,” Kennedy said. “If an MP stated an exact number, it was usually pretty easy to determine whether or not it was accurate. But if they said that something was ‘out of control’ or ‘chaotic,’ then it was a little trickier to make an assessment.”

For example, in a preamble to one of her questions on April 30, Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said that social programs across Canada are under “severe strain due to tens of thousands of unplanned immigrants” crossing the border illegally.

To check these claims, Kennedy searched news sources and government reports about social programs strained by an increase in irregular migrants. Only in Quebec, where most of the migrants arrived, and in Toronto, where many of them end up, did he find evidence of a strain on social services. To fortify this, he looked up the statistics for irregular border crossers and found that 93 per cent of the RCMP interceptions at the border since the beginning of 2017 have been in Quebec. In fact, seven provinces had a combined 21 irregular border crossings in all of 2017.

“Clearly, her claim that social programs were under severe strain ‘across Canada’ was false,” Kennedy said.

Overall, the reporters found that outright lies or false claims in question period were uncommon.

“However, that is offset by what we did find and that is the amount of dodges on the government side, the refusal to meaningfully answer a question,” Campion-Smith said. “The opposition parties are not blameless, either. On their side, there are a lot of exaggerations. So, I think people have a right to be cynical about the whole exercise when they say it’s largely driven by partisan motivations. But I think it’s also a very important part of our parliamentary democracy and the principle of holding a government to account.”

In the foreground, a black bicycle lies on its side in the middle of the road, its front wheel and handlebar bent into awkward angles. What looks like a black bag sits beside the bike. In the background, a few metres feet away, a flatbed truck sits motionless. Two police personnel stand nearby.

That’s a description of a photo published in the Toronto Star last week showing the scene on June 12 at the intersection of Bloor and St. George Sts., where Dalia Chako, 58, a grandmother who loved cycling, was hit and killed in a collision with a flatbed truck.

A disturbing image, to be sure, the publication of which was the subject of intense discussions among editors in the newsroom. There were other photos from the scene, all taken by Star photographer Lucas Oleniuk, that were even more graphic in nature that were under consideration. This week, we take a behind-the-scenes look at the factors editors considered when deciding which photo of this tragic event to publish.

Originally, in the afternoon on the day of the collision, the plan was to use a photo of the collision scene that showed a tarp lying beside the crushed bicycle. But that changed when photo assignment editor Tim Finlan flagged that the tarp was in fact covering the body of the victim. So began a discussion in the middle of the newsroom that grew to include more than half a dozen editors about whether the photo was too graphic to publish.

“On one side, we have to be really sensitive about using photos that show victims’ bodies, even if they are completely covered,” said Catherine Wallace, assistant managing editor of news. “It becomes so easy to imagine it could have been my mother or sister or friend who died in the accident. How would I feel if a picture of their body covered by a tarp was in the paper? It’s a question of dignity and respect.”

On the other hand, cycling deaths are a serious issue, one the city has been grappling with for years, Wallace noted.

“When there is a terrible accident like this one, we want people to pay attention. We want people to stop and think and say, ‘this can’t continue, things must change,’” she said. “Sometimes it’s important to be shocked and upset — for a newspaper to shock and upset people — and photographs are one of the best ways of doing that.”

As editors gathered around the photo desk to examine the image closely, they kept coming back to one question: was this the time to shock and upset people?

Oleniuk volunteered to return to the scene in an attempt to capture the gravitas of the situation without the body in frame.

The Star has chosen to publish photos depicting bodies in the past, such as the image of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, and the picture of the body of a teenage Haitian girl shot dead by police in 2010. Decisions to publish such images are made on a case-by-case basis.

Ultimately, Wallace and senior news editor Marie Sutherland decided, given the recent nature of the incident and the sensitivities mentioned above, it was not the right time. Instead, Oleniuk’s photo described above and pictured here — without the image of the body — was chosen for publication that day.

The next day, a different photo that showed the tarp over the body was published on thestar.com, with a story looking at the broader issue of cyclist safety on Toronto’s streets.

“The thing about the discussion that was so challenging, and I think the reason so many editors spontaneously joined in, is that there is no right or wrong answer in a situation like this. Both sides were right: It was a terrible personal tragedy, and it was also a symbol of a city-wide danger that we should all be paying more attention to,” Wallace said. “You can’t have hard and fast rules about photo use. You have to be open each time to considering the context. No two situations are ever, ever the same.”",[]

This week, we look at how the Star handles letters to the editor.

The famous American playwright Arthur Miller once said in 1961, “A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself.”

That’s a viewpoint held by many journalists today. And among the ways newspapers allow nations — or provinces or towns or neighbourhoods — to talk to themselves is through the oldest form of reader engagement: letters to the editor.

Letters to the editor allow readers to weigh in with their opinions, thoughts or reactions concerning any issues or events in the news. In the Toronto Star, reader letters are published at the back of the A section on Sundays and during the week, in the Insight section on Saturdays, and everyday on the Letters page, at thestar.com.

The Star receives about 25 letters per day, on average, that are suitable for publication. Most weekdays, a selection of between five and eight letters are published, while a larger number are printed on Saturdays, often focusing on the week’s biggest stories.

Letters that make it to publication are chosen by editors working with the Star’s editorial board, which works independently from the newsroom, led by editorial page editor Andrew Phillips. In addition to handling letters to the editor, the editorial board is responsible for daily editorials, opinion pieces by guest writers, and editorial cartoons.

“A good letter to the editor is timely, interesting and well-written. It focuses on the issues at hand,” Phillips said in an interview. “It’s also short — letters run from about 50 to 250 words, so a premium is placed on writers who can get to the point very quickly and express a clear view. A touch of humour helps a lot, too.”

A good letter also avoids certain things.

“We don’t like letters that are abusive, that engage in ad hominem attacks on other people, that mischaracterize the arguments of those the writer disagrees with, or are defamatory. We are happy to publish letters that oppose views expressed by Star editorials or columnists, but they must stick to the issues and avoid personal attacks,” said Phillips.

In addition, editors try to publish a representative sample of letters sent in. The Star tends to lean left in its editorial positions and more letters the paper receives are from that perspective than from the right, Phillips notes.

“We look for a range of subjects and views to keep the section lively,” he said.

Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have allowed people to express their opinions without the filter of a newspaper editorial board, and this has resulted in a decrease in the number of letters to the editor in recent years. Social media also provides the protection of anonymity, allowing some users to express all manner of thoughts behind a persona that may or may not be real.

That’s why the Star will not publish anonymous letters. In fact, the editorial board asks letter writers to disclose any conflicts of interest or involvement they may have with an issue on which they are weighing in.

“For example, a person writing to oppose a transit plan should disclose that they are president of a community group fighting the plan, if that’s the case,” said Phillips. “We read letters with an eye on this possibility, and if there’s a reason to suspect some kind of involvement by the writer we may query the writer or Google the name to see if anything relevant comes up.”

Crafting a compelling letter to the editor can also take more effort than sounding off on social media, so for those readers who have found their letters printed in the Star, it’s fair to say the editorial board found their comments articulate, thoughtful, or relevant.

“Nowadays readers have many other ways of expressing their views, especially through social media, but the traditional letter to the editor still remains important,” Phillips said. “And we certainly hope that readers will continue to send them in.”",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-06-08,"Covering an election is a massive undertaking for media organizations, involving reporters, columnists, photographers, editors, data analysts, designers and managers from across departments working together under tight deadlines.

Ontario election night on June 7 saw the Toronto Star newsroom in full throttle as staff worked to keep readers up-to-date on the latest numbers from the polls preparing articles for thestar.com and two print editions for the next day.

“We wanted to make sure that, digitally on the night and in print the next day, our audience could find the answers to all the questions they were asking — who was winning at the riding and provincial levels and the implications for constituents and for the province,” said the Star’s politics editor Jordan Himelfarb, who oversaw the coordination of election night coverage.

“It required finding a compelling way to present the results as they came in, highlighting the most interesting and consequential races, drawing out the storylines that defined the night and that gave final shape to the campaign, and providing analysis and commentary that put the flood of information in context.”

Reporters were dispatched to be with the leaders of the four main political parties: Queen’s Park reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy were with PC leader Doug Ford in Etobicoke and the NDP’s Andrea Horwath in Hamilton, respectively. On loan to the Queen’s Park team were Wendy Gillis, who was with the Liberals’ Kathleen Wynne in North York, and Tess Kalinowski, who was dispatched to Guelph to cover Green Party leader Mike Schreiner.

At the same time, Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie held down the fort at the Star’s office at the provincial legislature putting everything together for the main news story about the night’s results. Ontario politics columnist Martin Regg Cohn wrote from home.

That was in addition to more than 40 other reporters assigned to cover results in ridings across the GTA, some covering two ridings at the same time.

“What I was looking for was not only the facts, but also context and colour. Elections are obviously profoundly important democratic moments, with far-reaching consequences, but they are also, for both voters and political players, emotional, human things,” said Himelfarb.

For thestar.com, the main feature of the night was a seat counter and a colour-coded map of the province showing which party had taken each riding in real time, fed by data from the Canadian Press.

To keep stories as timely as possible, reporters were asked to file as soon as definitive results for their ridings were available. A team of editors then quickly polished the copy, wrote headlines, added photos, published the stories online and prepared them for print.

In total, more than 50 ridings were covered by the Star and Metroland publications, resulting in 63 articles, including individual riding stories, columns, editorials and a cartoon.

Thursday was Himelfarb’s first election night as politics editor and he admits that the logistical challenges were daunting. But he said his life was made easier by the huge team effort put forward by Star staff.

“Once the polls close and we’re inundated with results, you don’t have time to be daunted. The adrenaline carries you through.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-31,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Kate Carraway brings people’s stories from the dating scene to life.

There’s something about the Star’s weekly Dating Diaries, which allows contributors to recount their best, worst, and weirdest dates in their own words, that consistently intrigues Toronto Star readers.

The feature that dives into the GTA dating scene, by freelance writer Kate Carraway, is consistently one of the most popular offerings in the Life section of the paper and on thestar.com.

Regular readers of Dating Diaries are unlikely to forget the story recounted by a woman who, after several dates and feeling she was really connecting with a man, received unsolicited photos of an intimate part of his anatomy. Then there was the diary about a woman’s first sleepover. The next morning, while she was putting on her makeup in the bathroom, the guy went and did a number two in full view. This week, Carraway lets readers in on how she gets people to open up about the intimate details of their personal lives.

How did you become a go-to person for readers and their dating experiences?

I pitched Dating Diaries as a way to get the readers’ experiences directly into (now defunct weekly) The Grid and readers really responded. I think the appeal of the column is obvious — it’s provocative, it’s voyeuristic, it’s fun, it’s educational, it’s sad and happy and embarrassing and funny, and really a vehicle for empathy. It also gives diarists an opportunity to share some very personal moments outside of the usual context of their lives, where friends might judge or where they may not have the chance to revel in something amazing or weird that happened.

Can you explain your process for turning what people have told you into first-person narratives written in their voice?

The Diarists all provide an overview of the date, at first just a short one so I can assess it. Often people submit stories about relationships, rather than dates, or almost-but-not-quite dates, or dates in which there’s no emotional turn or surprise or interest, or that serve some kind of agenda. If a date and a diarist seem like a fit, I ask for the full story, and then I dig in. The asides they might not have thought of as interesting often become the most revealing elements of the Diary. It’s the most fun kind of excavation, for me. I just keep asking questions and clarifying the details, emotional logic, and the tick-tock of the date until it’s tightly packed into the Dating Diaries form. It needs to be cogent, but it needs to maintain the diarist’s voice and experience. Sometimes it’s easy and sometimes it’s excruciating.

How do you find the people you write about?

Usually, people come to me via datingdiariescontact@gmail.com. It’s really not hard to find great Diarists. Usually they are readers of the column already. Often Star readers and former daters recommend the column to friends who have had an especially interesting date. If I meet someone in real life who has a crazy story I always ask them to do a Diary for me. I love talking about my work so a lot of Diaries have come from my extended network, too.

Have you experienced any backlash, and if so, how did you deal with it?

There are definitely certain themes in the Diaries that emerge again and again. I hear a lot about what kinds of dating mistakes men and women make that are thought to be demonstrated by the column. I hear a lot from older people about how dating was different when they were young, and from people who are just now dating after a divorce, or later in life, and find online dating to be difficult to navigate. A lot of people don’t like it when the “rating” that the Dater has given their date doesn’t seem to match their experience.

Why do you think these kinds of stories resonate with people?

I think people are almost desperate for reality, or what the late Tom Wolfe called “status life:” the daily, quotidian details of our existence. Not the kind of shock-value content that is all over the internet and media, but genuine and honest real life. It’s becoming popular to talk about the value of vulnerability, and I think people are understanding that more and more, but in a practical sense it’s still risky to be truly vulnerable, socially and professionally and in relationships and maybe especially in dating.

Ultimately, what do you want people to take away from Dating Diaries?

I want people to feel like they’ve engaged with someone else’s life in a real and intimate way. I want people to see outside themselves and consider what life is like for someone else, even for a few minutes. I want people to be informed and entertained and to have an opinion about it.",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-24,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star is making its political endorsements more transparent.

It’s provincial election season in Ontario, and that means the editorial boards of newspapers across the province are studying the platforms of each party and keeping a close eye on their leaders in order to determine which candidate to endorse.

Political endorsements by newspapers, including the Star, are a long tradition in journalism, dating back more than a century.

Historically, the Star’s political endorsements have generally leaned left, in keeping with the newspaper’s alignment with the Atkinson principles, a set of progressive values named for former legendary publisher Joseph E. Atkinson. In the previous 14 federal elections between 1968 and 2015, for example, the Star endorsed the Liberals 10 times, the NDP twice and the Progressive Conservatives twice.

The Star’s editorial board, which operates independently from the newsroom, determines which party and candidate to endorse, but not without much scrutiny of the parties’ policies, vision, and the actions and temperament of their leaders.

“It’s part of our role to encourage debate and take a stand on the issues that matter to the community. We’re constantly giving our opinion on everything from subways to trade, so to remain silent on such a big choice as who should lead the province would be odd,” said editorial page editor Andrew Phillips.

He stressed, however, that a position taken by the editorial board doesn’t influence news coverage and an endorsement isn’t “telling” readers who to vote for.

“We’re just sharing our opinion as citizens and making an argument for that choice.”

That’s where editorial board meetings with the candidates come into play. Every election season, the Star invites the leaders of all the major parties to come to One Yonge St. and sit down with members of the editorial board, as well as journalists and editors from across departments. So far during this provincial election campaign, Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath have met with the board. PC Leader Doug Ford and Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne have been invited. Wynne will be here May 28 at 1 p.m. Email questions to electionquestions@thestar.ca.

The idea is to see how the leaders react to tough questioning and how they defend their positions.

“Leaders who rely too much on canned talking points don’t come across as very impressive,” said Phillips. “You want to see someone actively considering the arguments and responding intelligently when their positions are challenged. Leaders are going to have to deal with unexpected situations, and having a dozen journalists quiz you on your positions is a pretty good test of how well they’re going to be able to handle that.”

This year, the Star decided to increase transparency by live streaming these meetings on thestar.com. Readers are encouraged to send in questions, which the editorial board poses to the candidates.

For the editorial board meeting with Horwath, which took place last Wednesday over the noon hour, readers sent in more than 100 questions. Many questions covered the similar subjects, so the editorial board chose a few to represent readers’ main concerns.

“The live stream gives readers an opportunity to engage with whatever the politician is saying, and to respond, comment or ask more questions in real-time. The idea is to help readers feel they are involved in the conversation,” said the Star’s social media editor Evelyn Kwong, who relays reader questions to the editorial board.

Phillips notes that the live stream also invites readers into a key part of the way the Star’s editorial board examines the choices in the election campaign.

“Readers often wonder how we go about making up our minds on which party to support at the end of a campaign, and live streaming opens the doors on one of the main tools we use to decide — direct access to the party leaders,” he said.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-18,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Morgan Campbell approaches stories for his Sports Prism series.

A few weeks ago, sports reporter Morgan Campbell received a direct message through Twitter from a publicist representing Canadian boxer Adonis Stevenson. How would Campbell like a sit-down interview with the light-heavyweight world champion?

It was a chance to gain some insight into what was going on in Stevenson’s head before his high-profile bout against Badou Jack to defend his WBC light-heavyweight title at the Air Canada Centre on May 19.

The publicist hinted that the interview might touch on Stevenson’s past, so Campbell wanted to make clear that he would explore it. “Sounds like Adonis’ team has come to grips with the fact that at some point, people are going to write about the pimping and the jail time,” he wrote back.

When Stevenson was a teenager growing up in Montreal, he was a member of a gang that ran prostitutes and forced them to hand over their money. Gang members were eventually caught, and Stevenson went to prison for 18 months. While Quebec media have reported on Stevenson’s history with the law, it is lesser-known in Toronto.

The publicist agreed to set up the interview.

Campbell immediately thought the interview could be a good jumping-off point for a feature as part of his Sports Prism project, a weekly series on thestar.com and in the Toronto Star that explores the intersection of sports and other areas of society, such as health, race, science, and business. The idea is to use sports as a prism through which to view societal issues.

Topics covered since the series launched seven weeks ago include how African-Americans make up a small percentage of Major League Baseball players, how a new Canadian minor-league basketball circuit is attempting to develop a lucrative following, and how former NFL legend Eddie George sees the NCAA business model ripe for a makeover.

“For whatever reason, so many of us are addicted to sports. If that’s the starting point, I just look for ways to take advantage of that to tell a different kind of story,” said Campbell, who has been a full-time reporter at the Star for 14 years. “Sports are a good way to view these issues for the same reason that they put vitamins in gummy forms: it tastes better.”

For the story on Stevenson, Campbell felt the boxer’s past presented an opportunity to not only look at how Stevenson had changed his life, but also the lasting harm of misogyny and prostitution.

“The last thing we need in sports writing is another story about the redemption of a troubled athlete and how he’s redeemed because he’s good at sports. There are a lot of those stories and they’re not always true,” Campbell said, noting that in Stevenson’s case, the boxer had to undergo a lot of personal change before he could put himself in a position to excel in sports.

The challenge with this story, Campbell explained, was to address Stevenson’s past so as not to make it seem like his convictions were recent, while also being sensitive to the victims of these crimes.

“Prostitution is still here, and there are people who get out of the industry, but there is lasting harm,” he said.

That’s why Campbell reached out to advocates for sex workers and to shelter staff who could speak about the challenges of recovering from the trauma inflicted by pimps and gangs.

“You can talk about Stevenson’s personal evolution, but you also have to respect the fact that there were victims involved and they have scars from that time in their lives as well. I can’t tell one side of the story without the other,” he said. “To do it any other way does a disservice to everyone involved in the story, including Adonis Stevenson, and a disservice to the truth.”

On that score, Campbell views his role as a messenger whose job it is to convey full, unvarnished stories about people and issues impacting society.

“The best thing to do with unflattering news is to meet it head on,” he said. “If I write a puff piece about Stevenson, all I’ve done is sugar-coated some really unsavoury stuff about him, and kind of erected myself as a barrier between the audience’s understanding of who this person is, where he’s coming from, and what he is now.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-11,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Debra Yeo approaches her coverage of reality TV.

“If it bleeds, it leads” is a common expression in journalism credited to journalist Eric Pooley, who wrote the phrase in a 1989 New York Magazine piece entitled “Grins, Gore and Videotape — The Trouble with Local TV News.”

There’s no doubt that “bad” news often features prominently in coverage, and has done so throughout the history of journalism. But it’s also the case that not all news is bad news. Besides informing and educating readers, news can, and should, entertain. Editors at the Star make a deliberate attempt to balance the bad news with content that is lighthearted, fun, and entertaining.

Case in point: deputy entertainment editor Debra Yeo’s coverage of reality TV. Since 2004, Yeo has been bringing readers news, previews and opinions about wildly popular reality shows, such as The Voice, So You Think You Can Dance, and Survivor, among others. These days, she focuses on The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise as well as The Amazing Race Canada.

This week, we sat down with Yeo to find out how she brings a critical eye to the genre.

How do you view your role in covering these types of TV shows?

When it comes to The Bachelor franchise, in particular, I usually say I have a love-hate relationship with the shows. I am both a fan and a critic. When I recap episodes, I am reporting what happened but in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek way.

What do you say to critics who might view reality shows as something unworthy of coverage in a serious newspaper?

I say that they don’t have to watch the shows or read what I write. I know reality shows can be silly, but in my 33 years of practising journalism, I have had more response from readers about my Bachelor stories than anything else I have ever written. Reality shows can touch us in a genuinely emotional place. I have cried watching Bachelor proposals and Amazing Race eliminations, or performances on shows like American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. These shows also sometimes confront real-world issues. Think about Rachel Lindsay being the first Black Bachelorette a couple of seasons ago, or the scandal on Bachelor in Paradise when a sexual encounter between two contestants got out of hand. The woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it because she was blacked out on booze and prescription drugs. That raised the issue of consent since the woman involved said she couldn’t remember any of it, although I don’t think Warner Bros. dealt with it as thoroughly as they should have.

Reality TV is known for its sometimes-torqued drama, contrived social situations, and high emotion. How do these factors influence the way you cover shows?

That is where the love-hate relationship comes in. Take the most recent season of The Bachelor, for instance, in which ABC claimed to show unedited footage of Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumping his fiancée, Becca Kufrin. I found it cruel that the producers allowed Kufrin to be blindsided on camera and wrote about that.

What do you do to ensure you don't lose your sensitivity when covering these shows and the contestants, who, after all, are only human?

Every once in a while I have to step back and remind myself that even though the shows are formulaic and heavily produced, there are real people and emotions at play. Sure, some of the contestants sign up to get famous, but others are just ordinary men and women who want to find a wife or husband. The most powerful reminder of that was when I interviewed Brittany M., the “villain” on the most recent season of Bachelor Canada. I asked her why she hadn’t fought harder to clear her name with Bachelor Chris Leroux after the other contestants accused her of being mean to them, and she started to cry. In her real life, she prides herself on helping empower other women, so it really hurt her feelings that the other contestants thought she was out to get them. It was a reminder that, yes, make fun of the silly things people do and say on the shows, but try not to attack them as people.

You have a no-spoiler rule. How does this align with the Star’s desire to be transparent?

I try to come at these shows from the perspective of being just another viewer who happens to write about them. If I already know what happened, I won’t be writing the recaps from an honest place. There are instances where I do get advance knowledge, like when I attended a Women Tell All episode taping in Toronto, but even if I hadn’t signed a non-disclosure agreement, I wouldn’t have wanted to spoil the episode for other viewers. The same goes for the day I just spent shadowing The Amazing Race Canada.",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-05-04,"At the conclusion of a high-profile criminal trial, media outlets will often assign a reporter to write a “deep dive” piece looking at the characters involved, the police investigation and the evidence presented in court.

It’s a way to bring readers a more fullsome picture of the trajectory and drama of a case that daily reportage of a trial often does not allow.

In order to do this, reporters need access not only to the players — police, lawyers and relatives of victims and the accused — who can provide a human angle, but also to court records that clearly lay the case out, such as the application record (essentially a massive collection of evidence), exhibits from the preliminary hearing that didn’t come out at trial, and Information to Obtain a search warrant, if used by police.

Despite the open court principle — the idea that Canadian courts are presumptively open to the public — reporters often are forced to file an application before a judge in order to access what are already public documents. Star lawyers believe the proper interpretation of common-law suggests these documents should be made available to the public when requested, without having to take the onerous, time-consuming and expensive step of going before a judge.

But that’s just what reporter Amy Dempsey had to do recently while reporting on the disturbing story of the death of an entire Mississauga family — Bill Harrison, his wife Bridget Harrison, and their son, Caleb.

Improbable Cause: When a third member of this family died in the same house, police could no longer see it as a coincidence

Peel police — and no one else — probing their own missteps in Harrison family murders

Mississauga mom and her spouse found guilty of first-degree murder in killing of ex-husband

“I have no law degree, no legal training, but the Star cannot afford to hire a lawyer every single time we are denied documents — it is too common and too expensive,” she said.

Back in August 2013, Dempsey was assigned to write a weekend feature about the unusual and disturbing coincidence that all three members of the Harrison family had been found dead in the same Mississauga home between 2009 and 2013.

Up until Caleb’s death in the summer of 2013, neither Bill’s nor Bridget’s death had been ruled a homicide. But that changed shortly after police found evidence that suggested Caleb, a 40-year-old father of two, had been murdered.

For her first story, Dempsey told the story of the Harrison family’s custody battle with Melissa Merritt, Caleb’s ex-wife, and a series of unfortunate events that had befallen the family. That first story in 2013 had the headline, “Three deaths, one home, and a mystery — what happened to the Harrisons?”

Merritt and her common-law partner, Christopher Fattore, were later charged in all three deaths (though Merritt was not committed to stand trial on Bill’s death, while Fattore was committed to stand trial in all three.)

“If the allegations proved true, it meant that police, coroners and pathologists had somehow missed two homicides. How did that happen?” asked Dempsey. She was determined to find out. “This was more than a whodunit. It was a story of mistakes made by the authorities meant to protect us, and two potentially avoidable deaths.”

At the conclusion of the trial earlier this year, Fattore was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb and Bridget. He was found not guilty in Bill’s death. Merritt was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Caleb. A mistrial was declared on her charge in Bridget’s death after the jury could not reach a verdict. Both are appealing the guilty verdicts.

After the trial, Dempsey began work on what would become an 8,000-word feature called “Improbable Cause” published last month, that uncovered disturbing mistakes made by police, coroners and pathologists during their investigations into the deaths.

In order to tell the story fully, Dempsey needed access to records filed in court. But getting the records, which are public, would prove a challenge. First, she had to file an application in Brampton court and had to serve all interested parties — the court, the Crown, Merritt’s defence, Fattore’s defence, and a third party she can’t name due to a publication ban.

Then, once everyone had been served, Dempsey had to appear before a judge four times over a period of several weeks to make legal arguments before a decision was made.

Among the documents she found was a full transcript of Caleb Harrison’s 2010 police interview that took place hours after his mother’s body was discovered (the jury was presented with a significantly redacted version). The full transcript proved that the Harrison family had expressed concern about Merritt and Fattore from the day Bridget was killed. “I would ask where Melissa and Chris were, personally,” Caleb told the officer.

The documents also confirmed that no homicide detectives had investigated Bridget’s death, a fact that was only hinted at during trial.

The revelation of these and other details were only possible because Dempsey went to court — a step journalists might increasingly have to take.

“As financial challenges continue to confront media organizations, it’s important that more journalists go to court on their own, as Dempsey did, to argue for the release of records that serve the public interest,” said Bert Bruser, the Star’s newsroom lawyer.

It was 1:30 p.m. and reporter Jenna Moon was monitoring the Toronto police twitter account. As soon as she saw the tweet, she says, she knew this was big and immediately ran to alert her supervisor, Ed Tubb, an assignment editor on the Star’s breaking news team.

Tubb asked Moon to write a short article with what little information she had. While she did that, Patrick Ho, the rewrite editor on the digital team, began monitoring breaking news channels for the latest information, while the Star’s team of web editors prepared to push breaking news alerts on all of the Star’s digital platforms.

“They were all on the story within 30 seconds of seeing that tweet — there was a lot of controlled yelling in the newsroom,” recalled Tubb.

Moon’s first story on the incident explaining that police said there were between eight and 10 pedestrians struck by a white van was posted online at 1:41 p.m.

Tubb, fellow assignment editor Amber Shortt and their manager, breaking news/enterprise editor Amit Shilton, dispatched reporters Victoria Gibson and Tamar Harris to the scene.

“It’s tough in the first hour, when we don’t know yet know the extent of what’s happened. The first thing is to get reporters on the scene fast,” said Tubb.

In addition to those in the Star newsroom, Metroland and StarMetro reporters responded. Metroland’s Andrew Palamarchuk and Aaron D’Andrea, were among the first reporters on scene. One shaken witness who said he briefly followed the van told Palamarchuk: “This is not an accident.”

“You look back now and yes, it’s pretty obvious,” said Patrick Ho, who kept the breaking news story up-to-date online Monday. “But amid the first minutes of a developing story, we need to make sure. For all we know, without verification, it could have been a case of medical distress.”

At the south end of the 2.2-kilometre stretch of Yonge that had been cordoned off by police, Gibson and Harris interviewed witnesses and police officers, sending their files back to the Star and posting what they were learning on social media.

Star reporters Jesse McLean and Moira Welsh also went to the scene, walking south from Finch on sidestreets and behind buildings on Yonge, interviewing witnesses who were in shops and restaurants when the rampage began. Welsh spoke to a woman who worked in a restaurant close to Finch who gave her an account of a young woman lying on the sidewalk with two men performing CPR on her.

Star photographers René Johnston, Steve Russell and Lucas Oleniuk were dispatched to different areas of the scene. In Johnston’s case, he rushed to Yonge and Sheppard from another assignment at High Park. Coincidentally, Johnston knew that area of North York well because his grandfather used to live close by. Johnston raced on foot toward North York City Centre, which is just north of Mel Lastman Square, where according to initial reports several people had been hit. Sadly, this proved to be true.

Yonge St. had been closed to traffic, so to get close, Johnston entered the area from the west via Beecroft Road, which runs parallel to Yonge, and ran east to the Starbucks on the northeast corner of the square. From there, at 2:23 p.m., he snapped a photo of firefighters and police placing an orange tarp over the body of a victim. A single shoe and some items of clothing rest in the foreground. The picture ran as main art on the front page the next day.

Kathy English, the Star’s public editor, said that it is imperative the Star gets it right, even when news is breaking fast.

“In any breaking news situation, so much misinformation circulates,” English said. “There was a lot of speculation about terrorism. These are the kinds of situations where we have the opportunity to show the role of real news. We take that responsibility very seriously — giving readers facts, not rumours.”

As the team on the scene scrambled for information, the digital desk was in overdrive looking for photos on social media and keeping thestar.com and other platforms up-to-date. It was a difficult task given the abundance of unconfirmed information being reported on social media, and the fact that the number of dead and injured kept changing.

“We did our best to comb through social media, particularly Twitter to find photos we could use but that proved difficult,” said deputy digital editor Sabrina Melchiori. “An abundance of caution was necessary to avoid the spread of misinformation.”

About 5:30 p.m., CBS News reported that sources had identified the suspect in the rampage as Alek Minassian, 25, of Richmond Hill. As soon as she heard this, the Star’s social media producer, Evelyn Kwong, searched LinkedIn, found a profile she thought could be Minassian’s and saved his photo.

“We had a LinkedIn account with a guy that said he went to Seneca, but we didn’t have anybody who knew him who could confirm that his photo is him. That was the problem. We had both these things but no independent confirmation linking the two,” explained Shilton.

Reporter Harris was dispatched to Richmond Hill to see if she could locate Minassian’s home in an effort to confirm his identity. Meanwhile, crime reporter Wendy Gillis worked sources to confirm what the CBS network in the U.S. was reporting and that the photo from LinkedIn was in fact Minassian. Once it was confirmed, a breaking news alert email at 7:48 p.m. told Star readers that a police source had identified the suspect as Minassian.

In the evening, reporter Mitch Potter stitched together the main story, drawing in the work of 21 reporters.",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-04-20,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star covers breaking weather news.

Taped to the glass about halfway up a window in the Star’s radio room is a memo titled, “How to write a weather story.”

It’s a handy guide the Star’s radio room reporters turn to whenever apocalyptic weather hits the GTA, like last weekend when our surroundings became something that looked more like a scene from the Disney movie Frozen than crocus season. The guide, written by one of the Star’s digital producers Natasha Grzincic, lays out who to call in the event of bad weather, what websites and social media accounts to monitor, and when to update the story for the website. It also contains some general suggestions about writing style (conversational! It’s the weather after all!).

“The idea is to write about how the weather affects people, while making sure we are providing them with information that is accurate and up to date,” said Grzincic, who was in charge of thestar.com on Sunday.

The job of reporters who work in the radio room is to keep readers up-to-date on breaking news, including traffic problems, public transit delays or flight cancellations. Weather conditions can play a role in how the city runs, so it’s imperative Star reporters get information fast and get it right. The ice storm of April 14 and 15 provides an opportunity to take a look at how we do that.

It started on Saturday morning, before the real deluge of freezing rain and gusting winds arrived. Weekend staff reporters Tamar Harris and Ben Spurr were assigned the task of updating an existing Canadian Press wire story published on thestar.com that forecast the inclement weather. Harris checked with Environment Canada, which was warning that the ice storm could be “historic” in some parts of southern Ontario, and surveyed the websites and Twitter feeds of GTA universities and colleges to check for closures.

Spurr then updated the story with information the TTC had released about service changes as a result of the storm, and called Toronto Police and the Ontario Provincial Police for the latest updates on the number of collisions in the city. He reached out to Toronto Raptors owner Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment to confirm rumours that the tailgate party in Maple Leaf Square, also known as “Jurassic Park,” for that evening’s playoff game, would be cancelled.

Meanwhile, Star photographers Andrew Francis Wallace and Bernard Weil filed photos showing the effects of the storm.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alexandra Jones arrived for her shift, and immediately checked Environment Canada’s website to get an up-to-date forecast, and continued to check road conditions with police.

“At the start of my shift on Saturday, there had been over 200 collisions reported by the OPP. By the end of my shift, there were over 550,” she recalled.

When she finished work at midnight, Jones passed the file to radio room reporter Bryann Aguilar, who was working the overnight shift. Early Sunday morning, his updated story, which included warnings that freezing rain and heavy rain were headed Toronto’s way, was published online.

At around 9:30 a.m. Sunday, Annie Arnone, the morning radio room reporter, updated the story to include comments from a Toronto Police spokeswoman who urged the public to stay indoors if possible and to drive slowly if going out.

At 10:45 a.m., Mayor John Tory held a media briefing, during which he explained that many streets had not been plowed because of concerns that large amounts of slush on the sides of roads would increase the risk of flooding. This necessitated another update, with the mayor’s comments leading the story.

“I think I updated the same file six or seven times in one shift, which is crazy,” said Arnone.

During the day, photographers Weil and Rene Johnston braved the outdoors trying to capture numerous photos.

At 4 p.m., radio room reporter Alanna Rizza, arrived for her shift, and immediately started working on a round-up of the effects of the storm, including the number of vehicle collisions, TTC delays, flight cancellations and power outages.

“A challenge was that the number of people affected by the ice storm kept changing. Initially, we reported that about 7,000 customers in Toronto were without power, but that number kept growing throughout the evening,” Rizza said.

To keep on top of the power outages, Rizza monitored Toronto Hydro’s website, which provides regular updates through a map.

Barry Brimbecom, the assignment editor over the weekend, said the key to good weather coverage is ensuring readers have all the necessary information to plan their lives.

“We need to tell readers where the streetcar tracks are frozen, if their flight might be cancelled, or where the highways are closed,” he said. “We can help keep people safe, too. When the police are telling anyone who can that they should stay home, I want to know that — and the Star provides that link between them and our readers.”

This week, we look at how one Star reporter looking for an Ontario court file found roadblocks every where she turned.

Reporters who cover Ontario’s justice system have long lamented the lack of transparency they can encounter while navigating the courts.

Courts are supposed to be open to the public — and that includes bail hearings, trials and appeals, as well as records filed in cases. (While the courts are presumptively open, there are certain aspects of procedures that are subject to publication bans, it should be noted).

But whether it’s obtaining copies of documents, exhibits, or transcripts, the reporter’s job of keeping the public apprised of what goes on in our courtrooms can be a challenging, and often frustrating, task.

Case in point: reporter Tamar Harris’s recent trip to the Oshawa courthouse to cover the court appearance of two Durham Regional Police Service officers facing assault charges.

Cst. James Edward Scholtes and Cst. Thomas Broadfoot were each charged with assault causing bodily harm, obstruction of justice and obstructing a peace officer after they pulled over a vehicle in Oshawa on April 26, 2017. According to the Special Investigations Unit, an arm’s length agency which is called in to investigate reports of police involvement in deaths, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault, the officers arrested the 35-year-old passenger and took him to the police station. A short time later, the man was taken to hospital by ambulance suffering a serious injury.

Harris was dispatched to the Oshawa courthouse on March 22, 2018, when the lawyer for the officers was making a court appearance, in an effort to learn the name of the alleged victim (the SIU doesn’t typically release victims’ names).

Harris arrived at 9:30 a.m. and went straight to the courtroom to wait for the officers’ appearance. She was also hoping to see the court file in order to find out the name of the alleged victim. The case came before the judge two hours later, at 11:30 a.m., but went on recess shortly after. After the recess, Harris approached the court clerk and requested to see the file. The clerk said she’d have to wait until the next recess, as there wasn’t time to allow her to see the file.

Harris returned to her seat and waited through the next block of appearances by others charged with various offences unrelated to the police officers’ case. After these cases were heard, Harris again approached the clerk to ask to see the file, but was told she would have leave the courtroom immediately because the court was going on recess again. At this point, Harris had been at the courthouse for more than three hours.

“It’s essential to have the file on hand when writing the story,” Harris said in an interview. “Having that file means you have all the official information and can, perhaps most importantly, fact-check properly. Making sure we get a story right is the most important part of doing our job as journalists, and having that documentation is key to that.”

When the courtroom opened back up an hour later, Harris approached the clerk again with a request to see the file. This time, the clerk allowed her to see it, but only for about three minutes, as the judge was returning any moment. Luckily, that gave her just enough time to find the alleged victim’s name, but nothing else. She was told she would have to wait until the file was returned to the file room at the end of the day before she could get a paper copy.

Harris spent the next hour doing research and pulling files on other cases while she waited for the police officers’ file to be delivered to the file room. At around 4:30 p.m. she started to get worried, knowing that the file room closed half an hour later and the file still hadn’t been returned. At 5 p.m., the file room closed, and Harris wasn’t able to get a copy.

“I don’t think we should accept a system where a journalist can spend eight hours in a courthouse and not get a copy of the file they went there for,” Harris said. “In the end, it is detrimental to freedom of information if a public document is not publicly accessible.”

Brian Gray, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Attorney General, said the duties for court staff when Harris was there “were particularly lengthy that day as there were hundreds of matters addressed in the relevant courtroom.”

He said it was “unfortunate” that the file had not yet been returned to the administration office before it closed but that it was open for the reporter “to return to the court, or send a representative, to obtain a copy of the file the following morning.”",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-04-06,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star covered the recent Ontario budget while cut off from the outside world.

Readers will often come across the word “lockup” in media coverage of provincial and federal budgets, but it’s a term that is rarely explained.

In essence, a budget lockup is the government’s way of providing journalists with details in advance of the document becoming public when the Minister of Finance speaks to the House later that day, usually around 4 p.m. The idea is to give journalists time to review the budget, ask questions of bureaucrats, and write their stories before the embargo is lifted.

But here’s the catch. Because budgets contain information that could influence the financial markets, at least in theory, no details can be made public until after the markets close. That means no communication with people outside once the lockup begins.

This week we sat down with Queen’s Park Bureau Chief Robert Benzie to find out what it’s like inside the lockup and how journalists deal with the challenges of reporting on the budget’s contents — which impact all Ontarians — without the benefit of contact with the outside world.

This year’s budget document is over 300 pages. Given the huge amount of information it contains, how do you choose which aspects will be most relevant to readers?

While we have a budget sked before we enter the lockup, it evolves during the day. The Star’s Queen’s Park Bureau as well as beat reporters, editorial writers, and columnists are also part of our contingent. We annually enlist the assistance of a Scotiabank economist who helps us in deciphering the sometimes impenetrable numbers in the massive document. The first thing I do every year is read the finance minister’s speech to the Legislature, where we glean the themes of the budget. I bring my noise-cancelling headphones and a playlist of jazz pianist Bill Evans and repair to a quiet corner to read it closely. I am looking both for information and compelling quotes for the main budget story. That’s the overview of our coverage and contains elements that will be explored more deeply in the various sidebars. If it’s interesting enough to be noteworthy to each other it’s probably going to be useful information for Star readers.

Are there any budget lockups that were particularly memorable for you in your nearly 18 years of covering provincial politics?

Probably the most eventful budget of the approximately 30 federal and provincial lockups I have been at was in May 2014. There was a minority Liberal government at the time so Premier Kathleen Wynne needed support from either Tim Hudak’s Progressive Conservatives or Andrea Horwath’s New Democrats. While we knew the Conservatives would not back the Liberals’ fiscal plan, the NDP had propped up the minority Liberals in the 2012 and 2013 budgets. But in 2014, we learned — after getting into the lockup — that Horwath was skipping the traditional opposition leaders’ press conferences because the New Democrats were going to vote against the budget. That meant we were having an election. Luckily, our colleagues who had not yet entered the lockup knew this so that message could get to the Star newsroom. But we were marooned all day in an essentially meaningless lockup knowing we were being plunged into an election.

Given that you are forbidden to talk to anyone outside the lockup, can you give us a sense of how it works and who you can talk to?

We have the entire day to study the budget and have press conferences with the finance minister and the opposition leaders in the lockup. That is for the stories we publish when the embargo is lifted after the minister rises to address the Legislature. There are no phones allowed in the lockup so we are cut off from the outside world. We can query Ministry of Finance bureaucrats about aspects of the budget, but only on a not-for-attribution basis. All political questions are directed to politicians. They turn on the Wi-Fi at 4 p.m. so we can file our stories, but until then we are in an Internet-free Twilight Zone.

What’s it like in there? Is it utter chaos? Coffee cups everywhere? Do you talk to other media or does everyone keep to themselves?

There are around 150 journalists from nearly every major newspaper, wire service, TV network, radio station, and online outlet in the province. Each news organization has its own assigned table with its logo on it, equipped with electrical power bars and microphones for the press conferences. All of the budget documents and news releases are placed on your chair before you arrive at 8 a.m. It’s a very social place — it can be like old home week catching up with colleagues from different media outlets — but everyone is busy and has work to do so it’s seldom too distracting. Usually a hot meal is served — lasagna and roasted chicken are past favourites. There is lots of coffee and tea to keep us awake and large carafes of refreshing cucumber and lemon-infused water to keep us hydrated.",[]

This week, we look at how Freedom-of-Information legislation can allow governments to shield information from the public.

A great many public-interest stories that have appeared in the Toronto Star were the result of Freedom-of-Information requests made by journalists to government ministries, organizations and agencies.

Readers will often see phrases like “according to documents obtained through a Freedom-of-Information request,” or “documents uncovered through access-to-information legislation reveal ...” in stories about decisions our institutions make behind closed doors.

But what doesn’t get reported is the usually painstaking process journalists go through in an attempt to get the information. First they have to figure out exactly what to ask for. This is often followed by months-long — or sometimes years-long — delays and fights over the often high fees charged.

The high cost of accessing public records is a barrier to democracy, experts say

$32,000 and a 3-year wait: Star reporters share what it’s like trying to access public documents in Canada

Freedom-of-Information legislation gives members of the public who pay a $5 fee the right to ask municipal, provincial and federal governments for almost any kind information these institutions hold, with some exceptions. There are usually further fees for the time spent searching for the requests and making copies.

Requesters unhappy with the cost, the amount of time the request is taking, or the responsiveness of the government, can appeal to provincial and federal information and privacy commissioners for assistance. But this process can add months to an already slow process.

Journalists who use the system regularly have been complaining for years that the Freedom-of-Information system is broken, but little has been done by governments that has made it more accessible.

The recent travails of city hall reporter Jennifer Pagliaro, during her quest to uncover information from the City of Toronto about the controversial Scarborough subway extensions, show the lengths the media, as representatives of the public, have to go through to get information that is the property of the public.

In mid-2015, Pagliaro requested emails, memos, and other documents from the time council voted to scrap a light-rail line fully funded by the province to when council made the decision to build a subway instead.

“It’s so hard to get at the truth with issues like the Scarborough subway. There is so little evidence to justify building it and also a lot of misinformation. That makes it difficult to know if politicians are spending our money wisely,” Pagliaro said. “Are they doing it based on the facts or because of political motivations? Freedom of information laws are one of the ways we try to shed light on issues like a controversial subway project.”

City staff told Pagliaro that her request would cover thousands of emails and asked her to consider narrowing the requested search, which was for “Scarborough subway” and “Scarborough LRT.” She did not change her request. A month later, the city told Pagliaro its estimated fee for the information was $1,755, and that it needed a nine-month extension because staff whose records she had requested were too busy. (At the City of Toronto, staff whose records are requested must do their own searches, as opposed to Freedom-of-Information co-ordinators who do this at other government institutions.)

Pagliaro paid the $877.50 deposit (50 per cent of total fee estimate, as is required by law) but at the same time appealed the fee and the delay to the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario.

During the appeal process, the city lowered its fee estimate to $1,485 but requested an additional year to fulfil the request.

After nearly a year of back-and-forth discussions with the commissioner’s office and waiting for a resolution, the commissioner ruled the city could have four more months to respond to Pagliaro’s request and that the fee estimate was reasonable.

Despite that ruling, however, the final batch of records was delivered to Pagliaro two weeks late. In all, it took nearly two years to get all of the records requested.

Among the revelations contained in the records: Prior to council’s July 2013 vote to approve the multibillion-dollar Scarborough subway, former city planner Jennifer Keesmaat tried but failed to convince her colleagues behind-the-scenes that the fully-funded seven-stop light-rail line was still the best plan.

“It concerns me that a system purporting to be designed to allow access to public information was set up to be incredibly onerous on the person seeking that information,” Pagliaro said. “The result is often legislated secrecy.”

The Star’s managing editor Irene Gentle adds the issue is bad enough for members of the press, “But this system is meant for everyone. The government is asking citizens not used to the system to try to navigate it with months or years of delays, mounting costs and appeals. The cost is public information remaining secret. That’s a dangerous thing.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-03-16,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s Growing Pains series was conceived with the goal of presenting solutions to challenges that come with Toronto’s increasing density.

A North York school that students can see from their apartment balconies but can’t attend. A cluster of modern waterfront condos in Etobicoke surrounded by traffic-clogged roads. Cars, trucks, streetcars and buses competing for space along crawling downtown streets during rush hour.

These are just a few of the challenges of living in an increasingly crowded city that the Star has explored in its Growing Pains series — a weekly examination of the impacts density is having on our ability to live, work, play and get around in Toronto.

Spearheaded by Doug Cudmore, senior editor in beats, bureaus and columnists, the project grew out of a newsroom discussion involving several editors and reporters late last year about how the Star could highlight the city’s housing issues. Common themes emerged from the discussion, such as affordability and livability. But the team decided to focus on density, and how the city deals with it, as it is one of the issues that most impacts our quality of life.

The team decided to highlight how various Toronto neighbourhoods were being affected by increasing density — and ways to make things better.

But where to start? Various beat reporters, namely Education Reporter Andrea Gordon, Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr, Real Estate Reporter Tess Kalinowski and City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro were asked to help map out potential areas of coverage.

Former intern reporter Alex McKeen (now a reporter for Metro News in Vancouver), helped kick off the series with a story that delved into census data to identify areas that were intensifying rapidly. She compared the number of people per hectare in each census tract between 2011 and 2016. What she found was some neighbourhoods, such as Liberty Village and Humber Bay Shores, were intensifying at rates many times the city’s average. Her research culminated in a story earlier this month on how developments are popping up across the GTA, often without sufficient access to transit, parks and schools.

Cudmore says he believes a lot of the problems facing Toronto aren’t due to density per se, but rather the fact that the city has a tendency to address density in “easy, profitable” ways, such as building more housing, while pushing the harder planning challenges further into the future.

“Think of the great upheaval we felt this winter as the city closed King St. W. to through traffic,” Cudmore says. “We have to get those overstuffed streetcars through, in large part because we suddenly built a dense neighbourhood in Liberty Village, but we didn’t quite build the transit capacity to deal with them. That’s not likely just going to be a one-off.”

When it comes to figuring out which services need to be addressed, the team relies on beat reporters who have spent months or years building contacts and observing changes in their areas of coverage.

To show how density is impacting how we educate our children, Education Reporter Andrea Gordon delved deeper into the Yonge and Sheppard area, where residents had been complaining for years about how their kids couldn’t go to the most nearby school. She wanted to give a first-hand look at the situation, reporting earlier this month of children in a North York highrise condominium who can look out over McKee Public School next door but can’t attend. That’s because the school is at 110 per cent capacity (the school has doubled in size to almost 800 students in the last 10 years).

Transportation Reporter Ben Spurr knew residents of Etobicoke’s Humber Bay Shores, made up of modern condo towers close to Lake Ontario, had been advocating for a new GO Train station nearby. He wrote a story published last weekend on the need to help alleviate its roadways that are clogged with traffic every weekday morning due to a poorly planned transportation network.

“Issues like municipal zoning bylaws and appeals at the Ontario Municipal Board may sound boring on their face, but they have a dramatic effect on the daily lives of citizens,” Spurr says. “I think what we were trying to get at with this series is how small decisions taken — or not taken — by local leaders can snowball and create huge problems for residents years down the line. The local government then needs to go back in and try to fix a problem that wouldn’t have been nearly as severe if collectively we’d exercised some forethought in the first place.”

Cudmore echoes Spurr’s assessment.

“One of the goals of this series is to tie together a few strands of urban frustration and to show readers that they were related,” he said. “The other was to look for solutions and give them some air; for instance, Andrea’s piece spelled out clearly how funding regulations meant that some kids might never get a chance to go to their neighbourhood school. There are changes that can be made on those fronts.”

Cudmore stresses Growing Pains isn’t about NIMBYism or fighting density.

“It’s the opposite of that. But if we don’t address the details of density, it’s a change that might not last.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-03-09,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star spent more than two years attempting to confirm that Toronto police use the controversial Stingray cellphone data-catching device.

Two and a half years ago, an adjudicator for the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario upheld a decision by the Toronto Police Services Board to neither confirm nor deny that the force had acquired cellphone data-capturing devices known as IMSI catchers, or Stingrays.

That decision came following a Freedom-of-Information request made by an unidentified citizen in an attempt to find out if the police had purchased the technology.

In his ruling, Information and Privacy Commissioner adjudicator Donald Hale wrote the disclosure of this information “could reasonably be expected to reveal investigative techniques which are either in use or could likely be used in law enforcement.”

Four months later, in an interview with the Star, Ontario Privacy Commissioner Brian Beamish said it was not apparent to him that the public interest was given full consideration by the adjudicator. “Were we to have another appeal, I think it could lead to a different conclusion, let me put it that way,” Beamish said at the time.

That remarkable response prompted Star reporters Wendy Gillis, Kate Allen and Jayme Poisson to file their own Freedom-of-Information requests (later reduced to one) asking for confirmation of whether or not Toronto police use the technology.

This, despite the fact a Toronto police spokesperson had told the Star in 2015: “We do not use the Stingray technology and do not have one of the units.”

IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, or Stingrays, work by imitating cell towers thereby forcing phones within a certain range to connect to them. The devices are controversial because they are indiscriminate in targeting mobile phones. This means unique identifying cellphone data from innocent citizens in the vicinity of the police’s target is also collected.

“I think all three of us were picking up on the fact that there was this technology that police may — or may not — be using that could suck up a ton of personal data alongside the information they needed,” said Gillis in an interview. “It seemed unbelievable that they would be able to do this and not tell the public about it, meaning there could be no oversight or rights safeguards.”

But getting clarity would become a two-year saga for the reporters.

Police initially missed the 30-day deadline that institutions are given to process Freedom-of-Information requests, so the reporters appealed arguing a missed deadline was a “deemed refusal.”

The police eventually responded by saying no responsive records existed and closed the file.

The reporters appealed again, this time to the Information and Privacy Commissioner.

In the police response to the Commissioner, it was revealed that no electronic search had actually been conducted. The force had made inquiries with its legal, purchasing, telecom and intelligence departments and apparently confirmed that no records existed. However, they had not done an electronic search because they said they would get a “system error” resulting from too many hits, effectively crashing their computers, and that this would “unreasonably interfere with the operations of the police.”

The adjudicator called this justification “untenable” and ordered the police to do a further search.

The reporters then negotiated more narrow wording for their request with the Toronto police Freedom-of-Information co-ordinator in an attempt to speed up the process. This essentially reset the clock on the request, meaning police would be granted another 30 days to respond to the “new” request.

Finally, two years after their initial request, the reporters received an answer. Documents showed that Toronto police used the technology in five separate investigations since 2010.

The reporters published their findings on March 5. In the story, Mark Pugash, director of communications for Toronto police, was asked why police initially said they did not use the technology and did nothing to correct the record. He responded: “We should have.”

“Part of the problem is that secrecy begets secrecy. In this case, there was no established procedure or expectation that the public would be told about this,” said Gillis. “There is generally a lack of understanding about this tool, and what it is capable of — in part because we don’t know the extent to which it’s being used — that reduces the pressure on police to disclose this information in the first place.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-03-02,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how judicial red tape almost stymied reporting on two court appearances of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur.

When the Star learns about an individual charged by Ontario police with high-profile crimes, reporters will often contact the Ministry of the Attorney General, police and court record offices to find out if the accused has any prior convictions.

In the case of alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur, the Star did just that and learned from the ministry that in 2003, McArthur had been convicted of one count of assault causing bodily harm and one count of assault with a weapon in relation to an incident two years prior. He was handed a conditional sentence of two years less and day and put on probation for three years.

The Star reported this in January. In early February, legal affairs reporter Jacques Gallant asked the ministry if there were any audio recordings from McArthur’s 2003 case. Gallant was curious to know what arguments were made by McArthur’s lawyers, the Crown attorney prosecuting the case, and whether or not McArthur spoke in court.

That seemingly simple request began what was to become a convoluted and frustrating odyssey through red tape as Gallant attempted to report on the proceeding.

Initially, the Ministry of the Attorney General told Gallant that staff at Old City Hall courthouse could find no recordings related to McArthur from 2003. Then, a week later, on Feb. 16, the ministry emailed Gallant to say that in fact there were recordings — one from January 2003, in which McArthur entered a guilty plea, and one from April 2003 for McArthur’s sentencing hearing. To access them, Gallant would need permission from the presiding judge and a court order. He was told this is judicial policy for recordings made prior to April 15, 2013. Since then, the introduction of digital recording devices has made recorded in-court proceedings easier to share with the media.

A ministry spokesperson said the ministry “recognizes that Ontario’s court system is based on the fundamental principles of openness and accessibility.”

In this case, because the presiding judge had retired, Gallant had to ask the local administrative judge at Old City Hall for the order. That judge wasn’t available for another five days.

On Feb. 21, Gallant finally got his day in court to ask for the recordings. The judge didn’t know if there were any publication bans on the 2003 proceedings and delayed her decision while court staff checked.

Later that day, once it was confirmed there were no publication bans, the Crown said he could prepare a draft order that night for the judge to sign the following day.

On Feb. 22, Gallant was told he could go to the courthouse to listen to the tapes or receive copies. The option he chose would have to be specified on the court order. He asked the Crown for copies, figuring it would be more convenient, and signed an agreement that he would not disseminate the recordings or let anyone else listen to them.

At around 2:30 p.m. that day, Gallant got word his request had been granted. He jumped in a cab and raced to the court reporters’ office at Old City Hall. Once there, he had to wait half an hour while copies were made.

But instead of providing the recordings of the 2003 McArthur proceedings on CD, the court reporters’ office gave him two cassette tapes. Gallant would need a Sony BM-246, a special tape recorder used in court, to listen to them.

“It’s like this massive machine straight out of the ’80s. We certainly did not have one of those at the Star and I wasn’t really sure where we’d get one,” Gallant said.

Trying another approach, Gallant’s editor, Matt Carter, sent out a mass email to Star staff asking: “Does anyone in the newsroom have a standard, 1980s-style cassette player on hand? (Or in their car?)”

“Colleagues started coming forward with cassette players caked in dust that had literally been sitting on their desks for years,” said Gallant.

After about half an hour, a working cassette player was found. However, Gallant said the voices on the recordings sounded like chipmunks and were unintelligible.

By then it was 6 p.m., just three hours from deadline and editors were keen to get the story if there was compelling material on the recordings.

Free audio software found on the internet proved to be the ticket. It slowed the audio on the tapes so Gallant could understand what was said in court.

Gallant began furiously transcribing. By 8:30 p.m. he had filed a story about McArthur’s first court appearance in 2003. The story revealed, among other things, that McArthur himself went to police shortly after he attacked a man on Halloween 2001.

The next day, Feb. 23, Gallant transcribed the recording of McArthur’s second 2003 court appearance — the sentencing hearing. The tape revealed the Crown’s reasoning for wanting to bar McArthur from the Gay Village and stay away from sex workers. The story also included a quote from McArthur apologizing.

“Courts are supposed to be open to the public. Yet even as a journalist who regularly covers courts, it was very difficult to get access to these recordings,” Gallant said. “I can’t imagine what a member of the public would have to go through to get access to this kind of a record.”",[]

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-23,"This article is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s editorial cartoonists turn inspiration into art.

On the afternoon before Valentine’s Day, Theo Moudakis sat down at his desk in his home office and instead of drawing, as one might expect the Toronto Star’s editorial cartoonist to do, he started writing poetry.

“Roses are red, I’m serious, dude, slide over close, I wanna collude,” was one poem Moudakis came up with. Here’s another: “I forgot to buy candy and flowers, my sweet, I’ve got an idea, I’ll send you a tweet.”

If you haven’t guessed, these were just two of four poems featured in Moudakis’ “Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards” editorial cartoon published on Feb. 14. The first poem accompanies a drawing of Trump with his arm around a bare-chested Vladimir Putin, while the second is written above a picture of Trump on his mobile phone next to his wife, Melania Trump, who is giving her husband the death stare.

The cartoon, a sequel of sorts to Moudakis’ first Donald Trump Valentine’s Day Cards cartoon last year that featured a similar theme, is a recent favourite of the artist.

“No cheap shots, nothing nasty, just funny,” says Moudakis, who has been creating editorial cartoons for the Star since 2000. “And it got enough people upset without it turning into an actual controversy. The laugh is always the cartoonist’s most lethal weapon.”

Indeed, Moudakis says it’s better to be funny than controversial. “Controversy is overrated. You don’t really want the entire city mad at you. Getting a good laugh always makes for the best cartoon.”

That’s not to say some readers won’t find editorial cartoons controversial or distasteful. In fact, controversy can and does play an important role in editorial cartoons. As the Star’s public editor Kathy English wrote in a November 2014 column, “editorial cartoons are visual commentaries, intended to make a point and make us think. Quite often, the best of them also offend and even infuriate some readers.”

As a commentator, Moudakis, who contributes most of the Star’s editorial cartoons, which appear on the editorial page, has licence to not only express his opinions about any given topic, but also to poke fun at, mock, scorn, taunt, and tease his subjects. Politicians in particular have long found themselves ripe for skewering by the editorial cartoonist’s pen.

“In the end, cartoonists aren’t journalists. The rules are different for us. We’re the only ones at a newspaper who don’t deal in facts or fairness, but I make sure to spread the unfairness around evenly,” he says.

Where does Moudakis find inspiration? Keeping up-to-date on the latest news is half the battle. His days start early, usually around 5:30 a.m. with a scan of morning news shows, newspapers and websites. By 8 a.m., he’s at his desk sketching ideas by hand, trying out wording and refining the message he wants to send.

“This is the most challenging and really the most thrilling part of the day. There’s nothing like nailing a good idea,” says Moudakis, who quit art school to become a cartoonist.

When he has something he thinks has merit, Moudakis will run it by his boss, editorial page editor Andrew Phillips, for feedback. Moudakis will then draw the final version of the cartoon on paper with a marker, scan it into his computer, and colour it digitally. He’s normally finished by 2 p.m.

In the case of the Trump Valentine’s Day cartoon, however, he started a day early in order to come up with four good poems.

“The poems done, I was free to leisurely draw everything the next morning, including all that hand-lettering,” he says. “It was one of those cartoons that was an absolute joy to do from beginning to end.”

Patrick Corrigan, who usually contributes the Star’s Saturday editorial cartoon, has a similar process, and says he looks for storylines with long shelf lives, due to the fact that he works ahead a few days.

“Over the years I’ve become patient if an idea is slow in coming,” Corrigan explains. “It’s like finding a parking spot downtown. Sometimes you just gotta go ‘round the block a few times.”

Corrigan says he gravitates towards social issues, trends and local politics.

Last Saturday’s cartoon, for example, humorously combined two current news events — Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Party shakeup and the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games — to make an observation about the turmoil facing the PCs. The cartoon featured several skiers flying uncontrollably off a long “Ontario PC Jump.”

“I was trying to lend a satirical take on their hapless process, so it was a natural fit to show them flying head over heels off the Olympic ski jump,” says Corrigan, who first joined the Star in 1983 as a staff illustrator.

At the end of the day, the job of an editorial cartoonist, says Corrigan, is to speak truth to power in an irreverent, satirical fashion.

“In other words, we hope to make the deserving subject choke on their morning oatmeal when they open their paper.”

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-16,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s sports department handles the demands of covering the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

At 9:51 p.m. last Sunday, Toronto Star sports editor Dave Washburn watched as Canada clinched its first gold medal in the Pyeongchang Olympics.

Washburn immediately alerted the news desk of the monumental achievement — a gold medal in the figure skating team event.

Knowing that the Canadian team had a good chance of winning a medal, Washburn had earlier asked senior editors if a later print deadline was possible. Normally, the final print deadline on Sundays is 11 p.m., but this time Washburn was able to secure an extra half-hour.

At 10:10 p.m., columnist Rosie DiManno, on assignment in Pyeongchang, South Korea — where it was around noon the next day — filed a 1,000-word piece on how Patrick Chan’s and Gabrielle Daleman’s free skate performances lifted the Canadian team to the top of the podium.

DiManno’s story was quickly edited by the sports desk and sent online at 10:37 p.m. It was laid out for the newspaper and went to press at 11:12 p.m.

The adrenalin-fuelled rush to get the story in the paper is illustrative of the situations Washburn (working in Toronto) and his team in South Korea — columnists DiManno, Bruce Arthur and Dave Feschuk, along with reporter Kerry Gillespie and photographer Steve Russell — have faced daily as they work to keep Star readers up to date on the Games.

Keeping a close eye on developments and anticipating outcomes played a big role in ensuring the Canadian figure skating team’s gold medal made it into print.

“We knew on Saturday night the Canadian team was in prime position to win gold, but the expected end time was going to be right after our one and only Sunday print deadline,” said Washburn in an interview. “On Sunday night, we were able to push back the print deadline, which gave us an extra half-hour. When you’re dealing with tight deadlines and not knowing what can happen in the games, those extra minutes matter.”

Preparations for the games — getting accreditation for journalists, finding accommodations close to events and determining arrival and departure dates — started a year ago with the help of both the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Pyeongchang Olympic Committee.

To know which athletes to watch closely, the team focused on past performances and popularity. For example, the team knew figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir would be popular competitors given their history of medal wins and on-ice chemistry.

Washburn says he is also relying on the knowledge of beat reporter Gillespie, who covers amateur sports for the Star, in guiding the newspaper’s coverage. For example, Gillespie recommended following speedskater Kim Boutin, who took the bronze in the women’s 500 metres, and Alex Gough, who took the bronze in women’s singles luge.

“We want to make sure we’re at events when there’s a good chance of us hitting the podium,” Washburn said.

A few days before the Games began, Washburn started working overnight shifts. And since the opening ceremony, Star web editors have been working day and night to update thestar.com in real time.

The 14-hour time difference between South Korea and Toronto wreaks havoc with work hours and sleeping patterns for all involved in the coverage.

Print media, by its nature, is not as immediate as television, which affords opportunities to go behind the scenes of the drama to tell stories that aren’t suited to live TV.

“Our columnists are some of the best at that. Having the ability to make you chuckle, make you shed a tear perhaps — maybe even make you angry,” Washburn said.

For example, earlier this week, Arthur wrote an article about speedskater Ted-Jan Bloemen’s emotional response to his Olympic gold medal victory. In the crowd, his wife was also crying, but because she had just learned of the loss of a friend’s baby.

To extend the Star’s coverage, a few reporters in Toronto write a daily roundup of the quirkier goings-on at the Games — gleaned from wire services, Star reporter dispatches and photos. This is labelled “Olympic Notables” and is published on page 2 of the sports section each day. Topics have included the eating habits of athletes, funny or odd utterances by competitors and those covering them, and interesting fashion choices.

“We want to give our readers not only the latest Olympic news to the best of our ability, but also provide insight regarding athletes and events so that they come away from our coverage feeling like they have a better, fuller picture of what’s going on,” Washburn said.",[]
233,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/trust/2018/02/09/how-the-stars-queens-park-bureau-juggles-coverage-of-all-three-major-parties.html,How the Star's Queen's Park bureau juggles coverage of all three major parties,"['Kenyon Wallace', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporterfri.', 'Feb.', 'Min. Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-02-09,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau balances the demands of covering three major political parties.

Since Patrick Brown resigned as leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives over sexual misconduct allegations just over two weeks ago, the troubles facing the party have been top stories in the Toronto Star every day.

The upheaval rocking the official Opposition — which has also seen Rick Dykstra resign as party president in the face of sexual assault allegations, and investigations into suspect membership lists and questionable party spending in the Brown era — has made for a busy time for the Star’s Queen’s Park bureau.

Add to that the PC’s rush to elect a new leader ahead of this summer’s provincial election at a time when the sitting Liberals are set to table their 2018 budget, and readers might wonder how the bureau is able to juggle covering all three parties thoroughly and fairly.

“Adrenalin and caffeine help,” says Robert Benzie, the Queen’s Park bureau chief, who along with fellow reporters Rob Ferguson and Kristin Rushowy, and columnist Martin Regg Cohn, work to hold Ontario’s elected officials to account and keep the public informed.

In the race to replace Brown, each of the leadership hopefuls — Christine Elliott, Doug Ford and Caroline Mulroney — have their supporters and detractors keenly observing how much press their candidate is getting.

“Any one of them could be the next premier of Ontario, so we have to take them all very seriously,” said Benzie in an interview, noting that he strives for equal coverage of all candidates. “It’s early days yet, but for example, there’s a leadership debate next week and we will cover it. It doesn’t mean that every candidate will get exactly the same number of words in the story, but we try to give them equal time.”

The fact that all three leadership candidates have greater-than-usual name recognition hasn’t affected how the bureau is covering the leadership race, says Benzie, but it has generated intense reader interest.

“Christine Elliott is a known commodity given that this is her third run at the leadership, and her late husband, Jim Flaherty, ran twice before. Caroline Mulroney is the eldest child of a very famous Canadian political figure, and Doug Ford is a well-known Toronto councillor and brother to the late ex-mayor of Toronto Rob Ford,” he said. “So you have three big names in a race and that is always interesting.”

How does the bureau cope with balancing the demands of covering the PC party with the demands of covering the other two major political parties?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Liberals and the New Democrats have been content lately to go to ground and let the turmoil in the PC party, currently led by interim leader Vic Fedeli, consume the headlines.

“It’s an old political axiom that when your opponents are pouring gasoline on themselves and lighting a match, you stand back,” said Benzie. “I think Mr. Fedeli has done a good job in terms of making changes from the Brown era, but if you’re the Liberals or the New Democrats, you just want to say stand back, and let the Tories do their thing. Then, after the dust settles, come in and shoot the wounded.”

The Star’s trust committee periodically hears from readers who perceive the newspaper’s political coverage as biased in favour of the Liberals. Since 1987, the Star’s editorial board, which operates separately from the newsroom, has endorsed the Liberals in every provincial election, except in 1999 when the newspaper endorsed Howard Hampton’s NDP. But any suggestion that this affects how the newspaper’s Queen’s Park reporters do their jobs is nonsense, says Benzie.

“I used to work for the Toronto Sun and the National Post and I’m the same reporter that I was then. I didn’t care about the editorials at those outlets and I don’t care about the editorials at the Star,” he said.

Ferguson agreed: “I used to cover Queen’s Park for The Canadian Press during the last months of Bob Rae and the beginning of Mike Harris’s government. No one called me a Liberal hack back then.”

Ferguson points out that he spent all of September, October and November of last year covering two political corruption trials involving the Liberals — the byelection bribery trial in Sudbury and the gas plants trial in Toronto. He added the Star was one of the few media organizations to attend the gas plants trial every day.

Rushowy, who joined Queen’s Park a year-and-a-half ago, stressed that bureau reporters do their best to get voices from all three major parties in stories, as the parties all have elected representatives at Queen’s Park.

“We try to give readers as many viewpoints as possible,” she said.

At the end of the day, says Benzie, it would be detrimental to the Star’s ability to cover politics if any reporters were seen to be leaning toward any party.

“You don’t want anyone thinking you’re a Liberal or Tory or NDP hack, because then the other two parties won’t talk to you,” he said, adding he does not vote in any elections. “We take this place seriously and because we do, we are taken seriously.”

This week, we present highlights of the Star’s recent Ask Me Anything on Reddit.

One of the primary goals of the Toronto Star’s trust project, launched last May, is to be more transparent about how we do our journalism.

Hence the decision to hold an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) on Reddit, an online news aggregation and rating website where users can post content and discuss a wide array of topics.

Over a two-hour period last Tuesday, a group of Star reporters and editors responded to more than 60 questions from readers.

What follows is a sampling of the questions and answers from the AMA. Some have been shortened for space, but you can read the full text on reddit.com.

What is the top municipal story in Toronto that nobody’s talking about? — Zombie_John_Strachan

Columnist Edward Keenan: The thing about this question is that if I thought a story was the top one in the city, I’d be talking about it — and I assume the same goes for most editors and reporters. So finding the pressing issue everyone’s ignoring is hard, since we wouldn’t ignore it if we knew about it and thought it was very important. That said, I think that the dire lack of affordable housing in the city, and the desperate inability of Toronto Community Housing to fill the gap for the poorest in the city, remains an under-discussed story. It does get talked about, but it’s a crisis.

How does Daniel Dale stay sane going from covering Ford to covering Trump? — Knowitall99

Washington Bureau Chief Daniel Dale: It’s actually so much fun. Obviously exhausting and often ridiculous, but what more can you ask for as a journalist? The stories are both important and entertaining, you’re able to hold powerful people accountable, readership is super high, and you’re not putting yourself at physical risk the way journalists are in a war zone or disaster zone ... So there are moments when I just want to nap, but I mostly love it.

I’m very curious as to how you go about correcting an error that has already been published, and how often you see mistakes and how they’re handled. — RJJouranls

Public Editor Kathy English: Once we verify an error we correct on the platform the mistake was published on as promptly as is possible. The goal of a correction is to provide the correct information and make clear a mistake occurred. We logged about 1,100 corrections in print and online in 2017. Most of the mistakes are from online platforms.

What was it like last week at the Star when the Patrick Brown story broke so late in the evening? Are people woken up, called back from home, etc.? — LesterBePiercin

Queen’s Park Reporter Kris Rushowy: Our Queen’s Park bureau chief, Robert Benzie, was at home with his kids when he got a call about Brown’s 9:45 p.m. press conference, and raced over to the Legislature. He was up well into the night filing updates. Reporters don’t get a lot of wake-up calls, but when there is big news on our beats, we work — late nights, early mornings, holidays, you name it.

Do you have any strategic initiatives to avoid enabling loud-mouthed, extreme, populist election candidates by covering their shenanigans? We’ve seen this issue a lot with the Fords and Trumps of the world. — sunlightjunkieRiverdale

City Hall Reporter Jennifer Pagliaro: This is tough. Look at the Ford example. In 2010, Ford was a councillor known for politically incorrect statements on the council floor who few believed could ever be mayor. Our bureau chief, David Rider, was one of the first mainstream media reporters to start paying attention to his campaign and realize he had a base of support that could make him a contender. To me, that’s something our readers should know about … Turns out, he knew before many that Ford could win and he was right.

The Star seems to be working with the CBC more and more, especially for investigative projects. What are the benefits of working together? Do you think these partnerships will happen more frequently? — Soshane

Investigative Reporter Diana Zlomislic: In the past few years, we’ve actually been joining forces with more news media outlets across the world for big investigations like the Panama Papers. Reporter Robert Cribb and editor Lynn McAuley created our investigative co-production team as a way to share resources on big stories. This is the future, we think: news organizations working together more on large projects.

Just wanted to ask, directed broadly at all of you, if you think there’s a real future for young people looking to get into journalism? I’m in my final year of J-school now and I’m pretty disillusioned. — friendsfromgr8

Reporter Fatima Syed: I totally get the disillusionment but don’t let it overcome you! There are multiple opportunities in the industry right now for a young journalist, ranging from freelancing to stints at places like the Star. There are risks in everything but keep hustling. Pitch stories everywhere, apply to places like the Star who accept a wide range of interns of all levels of experience every year.

Things are definitely changing with people looking towards more digital stuff. The main takeaway is just learn as many skills as you can now as a young journalist ... It’s hard, and at times disheartening, but not impossible. Take it from a girl who applied three times before she got the Star internship.

What’s a story that you’ve published that went against your personal beliefs? — TorontoJD

Photographer Steve Russell: Wow, what a great question. I think we cover stories all the time that may go against my personal beliefs. It’s strange because sometimes covering a story or watching a story develop I might change my belief!

What is the role of print media in society in 2018? How do you envision the future of the Toronto Star 10 years from now? — SheerDumbLuck

Managing Editor Irene Gentle: In terms of news organizations like the Star, print is just one of the platforms we publish on. Its legacy is really the journalistic values it has ingrained in us — things like responsible reporting, checks and balances, such as our public editor, Kathy English, our membership in the national news-media council, and our daily talk about journalistic ethics as it pertains to news we cover … Now we take those same principles and apply them to the different platforms. We look to make a difference, to produce solid investigative and accountability journalism on many platforms … That is the how I see the Star in 10 years — the platform matters less than the work that is produced.

This week, we look at how the Star’s style committee strives to maintain a clear, consistent and sensitive presentation of content.

Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”? Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv? Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang? Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

These are just a few questions tackled recently by the Star’s style committee, whose role is to ensure consistency in editorial style across all Star platforms. (See how the committee dealt with these questions in the fact box at the end of this article).

Words are powerful, and that’s why members of the style committee, made up of editors and reporters, take their job seriously.

This involves being a resource for the newsroom, keeping the Star’s stylebook up to date with contemporary terms and conventions of usage, and weighing in on style-related questions and concerns raised by readers, often relayed by the public editor.

What does the word “style” mean in the context of the Star’s various platforms?

Anthony Collins, the Star’s style chief and co-chair of the style committee, describes style as a set of rules about the language the Star uses, encompassing everything from spelling and capitalization to how we treat numbers and measurements, and the word choices we make when we report on sensitive issues.

“Style is important because it makes our writing clearer, more accurate and more consistent, all of which promote trust in our journalism. It also ensures we’re up to date with language change, while being respectful of the communities we serve, and helps give the Star its distinctive voice,” said Collins in an interview.

Star style is informed by a broad range of sources, including The Canadian Press, which publishes both a stylebook and a capitalization and spelling guide that are used by various media outlets. Other considerations come from the developing use of terms or phrases by the public and feedback from readers.

Sometimes a style is adopted to make stories easier for readers to find. For example, the Star’s style guide uses the spelling Al Qaeda rather than al-Qaida because the first spelling is more common and makes our stories easier to find online.

Style decisions are also made by the newsroom’s top editors, such as in the move to use Daesh instead of ISIS, mainly because the Islamic State is considered neither Islamic nor a state.

Because of the Star’s broad readership, the newsroom is constantly trying to strike a balance between using language that is easily understood by most of our readers, and using terms that are considered up to date and respectful by specific communities, Collins said.

For example, last year, public editor Kathy English announced the Star had decided to capitalize “Indigenous” in all cases, and “Black” in reference to Black people, identity, culture and community. This came about after the style committee had received many passionate and thoughtful arguments in favour of making these changes as a mark of respect. The committee consulted widely with individuals and community groups and then rewrote two sections of the Star’s stylebook.

“I believe decisions as small as changes in newspaper style can have a major effect on marginalized communities and the way they’re seen,” Collins said. “Look at the way the conversation has changed around mental illness, for example. Not using ‘schizophrenic’ as a careless metaphor, or choosing to say ‘die by suicide’ instead of ‘commit suicide,’ can help lessen the stigma. Social justice is one of the Star’s guiding principles and I think our language use should reflect our philosophy.”

A hard-and-fast rule isn’t always the answer in many cases. For instance, Star style dictates that gender-neutral terms are preferred for occupations, such as firefighter and flight attendant, but the term “actress” is still used when it comes to award show nominations.

Then there’s the sheer practicality that comes with a clear and consistent style, says the Star’s style committee co-chair Jon Ohayon. If editors and reporters are confused about what terms and spellings to use, when to convert measurements to metric, or what currency to use, time can be wasted. A lack of consistency can also make it hard to find previous stories or photos in the Star’s archive or online — and also lead to an impression of carelessness.

“For example, it would look sloppy or ridiculous to have a headline that says ISIS on one story and one that says Daesh on another, or to have two different spellings of a city, country or person on the same page,” said Ohayon.

“Without style, we would be a mess and that leads to a loss of trust.”

What did the Star’s style committee decide?

1. Is Toronto’s new nickname “The 6ix,” “The Six,” or “The 6”?

In the Star, it’s The 6. We found that was the most common and clearest way to write it.

2. Is the capital of Ukraine spelled Kiev or Kyiv?

We follow The Canadian Press style (which adopts the Ukrainian rather than the Russian spelling). It’s Kyiv.

3. Are the 2018 Winter Olympics taking place in Pyeongchang or PyeongChang?

We follow The Canadian Press and The Associated Press and spell it Pyeongchang. Definitely not Pyongyang.

4. Does Toronto have an ombudsman, ombudswoman or ombudsperson when the office-holder is female?

It has an ombudsman, currently Susan Opler. Many offices use ombudsman as a gender-neutral term, derived from Swedish. The Star follows the preference of the office in question.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-01-19,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we look at how Opinions Editor Scott Colby curates a wide range of viewpoints from contributors across political, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Everyone has an opinion.

Scott Colby, the Star’s Opinions Editor, confronts this truism every day.

Colby will receive, on an average day, between 10 and 15 opinion pieces from members of the public covering a whole host of topics. Those hoping to get published run the gamut of the professional world, from politicians, academics, and economists, to lawyers, businesspeople, and health-care professionals. He also hears regularly from non-profit groups, agencies and students.

His job is to sort through the submissions, choosing pieces that provide readers with thoughtful commentary on public interest issues. And that’s in addition to handling opinion pieces from the Star’s regular staff and nonstaff columnists that appear on the page opposite the Editorials page.

This week we sat down with Colby, who’s been the Opinions Editor since May 2016 and an editor at the Star for 20 years, to find out how he presents a wide range of opinions on issues of the day.

How are the opinion pieces you edit, also known as “op-eds,” different from those written by Star columnists?

An op-ed is an old-fashioned name for an opinion piece, or column. Op-ed is an abbreviation of the phrase “opposite the editorial page.” Historically, newspapers publish an editorial page that is home to editorials, an editorial cartoon and letters. The opposite page of the same spread contains columns and other opinion pieces. An op-ed is no different from an opinion piece from a Star columnist in the sense that they are both articles of opinion on a timely topic. Columnists have the prestige of being a regular contributor whose writing and arguments are considered to be of a consistently high standard and they’ve earned the right to express their opinions in that paper up to three to four times a week. They also get a logo.

What makes a good op-ed in your opinion?

I tell people I am looking for three things in a good op-ed: the topic must be timely, it must be well written, and it must be well argued. There is a distinction to be made between well written and well argued. You can have a nicely written article that essentially doesn’t saying anything or make a point. Where I think many writers miss the mark is they don’t understand that an op-ed needs to have a thesis; it needs to be an argument about an issue. We are not looking for a press release in disguise.

How do you solicit op-eds and what do you look for?

When I solicit op-eds it’s because I’m looking for a commentary piece, or pieces, on a specific topic, such as NAFTA or Indigenous issues. In such cases, I am looking for an excellent writer and a person with expertise, or even a newsmaker directly involved in the issue. Soliciting op-eds can take quite a bit of time, which is a rare commodity these days. When I started this job, for example, I felt we needed to hear directly from Indigenous writers and leaders, as opposed to well-meaning supporters, so I reached out. We’ve published op-eds from Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, Grassy Narrows Chief Simon Fobister, and Indigenous academics at Trent University. We also want our Opinion page to reflect the changing demographic of the city and country, so having diverse voices is important. Like all mainstream media, we can do a better job, but we believe it is vital to publish diverse voices and we continually aspire to provide them for our readers.

Many of the opinion pieces the Star publishes express views that are counter to the newspaper’s more social-justice leanings. Is this deliberate, and if so, why?

We strongly believe the Opinion page needs to be an open-minded venue. It is an excellent forum for debating the important issues of the day. To be clear, we will never intentionally publish anything that is hateful, insulting or bigoted. But I frequently select commentary that I don’t necessarily agree with, or that puts forward an opinion that contradicts our own editorials. If the author makes a compelling case on a timely issue, it benefits everyone when we publish those views to contribute to the debate. It’s important to listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to understand where each side is coming from. When we can really listen and understand, hopefully we’ll learn something about their motivations, for instance, that might make us more sympathetic, or it might expose something less innocent that deserves scrutiny.

We are not interested in being an echo chamber where readers only listen to the people they agree with. I love it when we can publish a page that contains opposing views on the same topic, as long as both pieces are well written and well argued. For example, earlier this month we published two op-eds taking different stands on the minimum wage increase, one by Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and the other by Premier Kathleen Wynne.

What message do you have for those readers who may view the op-ed pages as a pulpit for politicians to spread positive PR messages about themselves?

We receive a lot of op-eds from politicians and we reject most of them on the basis that they are essentially glorified press releases. When it comes to op-eds, we hold politicians to a higher standard than the public. Their op-eds must be saying something new and adding to the understanding of an important issue. We are vigilant in preventing the Star’s opinion pages from becoming an extension of a politician’s PR department.

Read', 'Kenyon Wallaceinvestigative Reporter', 'Investigative Reporter']",2018-01-12,"This story is part of the Star’s trust initiative, where, every week, we take readers behind the scenes of our journalism. This week, we focus on how Jacques Gallant, the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, keeps tabs on what goes on in Ontario’s justice system.

There is an aphorism often quoted by lawyers and the journalists who cover legal proceedings: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.”

That saying, which originated more than 90 years ago from Gordon Hewart, lord chief justice of England, is constantly in the back of Jacques Gallant’s mind while he navigates the complex world of Ontario’s courts and tribunals.

As the Star’s Legal Affairs reporter, Gallant takes readers inside the justice system, highlighting precedent-setting cases and rulings that impact the public, and pointing out problems, such as delays in cases coming to trial.

To find stories, Gallant talks to lawyers and members of the public about cases they are involved in, checks with the various colleges that regulate health-related professions, such as the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, to find out which of their members are facing disciplinary hearings, and mines CanLii, a free online database containing most Canadian court decisions.

But keeping readers enlightened about the goings-on of our legal system relies on the assumption that the courts and tribunals are by default open to the public, as they should be. In practice, however, Gallant has found this is not always the case.

“The courts are supposed to be presumptively public, which means that anyone should be able to walk into a courthouse and request to view the file from a court case,” said Gallant.

But on numerous occasions, Gallant has encountered courts and tribunals that seem to have secrecy as their default setting — meaning Star readers, and by extension the public, aren’t able to get a full picture of what is going on in these public institutions.

“In my own experience, I’ve dealt with courthouse staff across the GTA who give me strange looks when they find out I’m not a lawyer, but rather a journalist,” Gallant said. “I’ve had to wait weeks to get access to even the most basic of court documents, known as ‘the information,’ which lists the charges an accused person is facing as well as their next court date.”

Indeed, early last year, the Star launched a legal challenge against the provincial government to end the secrecy surrounding the province’s tribunal system, which handles accusations around human rights abuses, police misconduct, and environmental offences. The Star’s case is ongoing.

Gallant said accessing court exhibits, even in cases that are no longer active and for which higher courts have ruled that exhibits should be public, is also often difficult.

“Documents such as these are crucial in order to accurately and fairly report on a legal matter,” he said.

Case in point: when reporting on the ongoing case of Dr. Javad Peirovy, a Toronto doctor found by the College of Physicians’ discipline committee to have sexually abused four female patients, and who is fighting in court to keep his medical licence, Gallant had trouble accessing documents related to the case.

In 2016, the discipline committee ruled to suspend Peirovy for six months, rather than revoke his licence. The college disagreed with this ruling, and appealed the decision by its own committee to the Divisional Court.

At the time, in order to provide readers with a full picture of the case, Gallant sought to obtain Peirovy’s arguments at Divisional Court for why Peirovy should retain his licence. As it turned out, this was not an easy task.

When Gallant asked the Divisional Court for Peirovy’s official response to the appeal, a court official told him the file was with the judges and could not be accessed.

So Gallant reached out to Peirovy’s lawyer, who would not provide the official response either.

Gallant then had to reach out to the Ministry of the Attorney General to make his case that the file should be made available to him. The ministry, in turn, contacted the court, and a few days later Gallant was told he could now view the file at the Divisional Court.

“If not for (the ministry’s intervention), I would not have been able to report a complete picture of the Peirovy case,” Gallant said.

The college ended up winning its appeal, but Peirovy then appealed to the Court of Appeal. A decision has yet to be released.

These types of situations — where public documents are not readily accessible to the public — discredit the legal system, Gallant said.

“For the Canadian justice system to retain its credibility, it needs to be open and transparent,” he said. “The public needs to be assured that the justice system is working, and reporters act as their representatives in court.”

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-09-29,"Do you have a clear understanding of what is news and what is opinion in the Star?

Perhaps this distinction is not totally evident to you. Based on many conversations with readers, it is clear to me that one of the key sources of misunderstanding about the Star and its journalism is a considerable measure of confusion about how to distinguish between news and opinion.

As a Star reader you have a right to know if what you are reading in the Star is news – verified information based in the impartial reporting of facts – or opinion – a column or editorial based on the personal interpretation and judgments of facts.

The Star’s statement of principles has long expressed this core value, stating that, “Sound practice demands a clear distinction for readers between news and opinion.

“All content that contains explicit opinion or personal interpretation should be clearly identified as opinion or analysis, as appropriate.”

While the Star has long strived to make this distinction clear in the newspaper through the use of various design elements (such as a columnist’s “logo”) intended to denote a piece of opinion journalism, my communications with readers over the past decade tell me these devices are often inadequate for those who don’t understand our design shorthand.

Further muddying these waters is the fact that “opinion” logos, which include a journalist’s photo, are sometimes used on news stories too. How is a reader supposed to distinguish news from opinion?

Discerning news from opinion within the Star’s digital world — on the website, mobile apps and social media postings – is even more of a challenge for readers. Here the Star too often falls short of its own principle. Many days, opinion columns expressing strong views about controversial issues are presented in a similar manner as news stories, within news sections of those digital platforms, with no signposts to indicate that what you are reading is not the news but in fact someone’s opinion about the news.

The clearest way to tell readers that an article represents a writer’s views is to label it as opinion. The Star is now taking steps to do a better job of this on all its platforms.

The Star’s trust initiative , launched in May to look into how the Star can foster greater reader trust and develop journalistic and technological tools to bridge the trust and media literacy gap, identified the need to differentiate news from opinion as a priority issue. This group spent much of the summer looking at how to more clearly and consistently signal to readers on all platforms — including the Star’s social media feeds — when articles are analysis or opinion.

I expect the Star will soon move forward on recommendations to provide stronger signposts to readers about whether they are reading news, analysis or opinion and also give readers clarity about the definitions of various sorts of content.

This is vital at this time of diminishing trust in journalism when the sheer volume of opinions and conjecture about the news can overwhelm the real reporting of verified information.

Indeed, as news organizations around the world grapple with a crisis of trust in journalism, the need to guide audiences to a clear understanding of how to distinguish news from opinion has emerged as a significant indicator of journalistic trust. Several ongoing global trust projects have fixed on the need to do a better job of this.

“One of the most common themes from users is that they are tired of blurred lines between fact and opinion,” Joy Mayer, head of the Trusting News Project, wrote recently in an article reporting on the project’s research into reader feedback on the credibility and trustworthiness of news.

The Trust Project at California’s Santa Clara University has identified the need for labels on content to identify news from opinion as a trust indicator. That project aims to create tools for readers to recognize trustworthy reporting and for platforms such as Google to identify and feature high quality journalism.

A working group of the California-based project has set out clear definitions for various types of content and recommends that news organizations be transparent in sharing those definitions with readers. Both its definitions and recommendation for transparency are aligned with the recommendations of the Star’s trust committee.

That group defines news as articles, “based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources…News reports do not incorporate the opinion of the author.”

Opinion articles “advocate for ideas and draw conclusions based on the author/producer’s interpretation of fact and data. Opinion pieces may include reported facts or quotes, but emphasize the author’s own thoughts, personal preferences and conclusions,” it states.

My opinion: these are smart recommendations critical for enhancing trust in journalism.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2018-01-19,"As the Star reported this week, the Toronto District School Board says it never discussed the implications of allowing an 11-year-old girl to speak to a barrage of reporters after she had made false allegations that her hijab had been cut.

It was “not part of the conversation,” TDSB spokesperson Ryan Bird told the Star on Tuesday.

In the interests of transparency, I think it only fair that the Star disclose that there was never any conversation in our newsroom about whether to publish the girl’s name and photographs of her taken at the school board.

The Star has no explicit policies on interviewing or identifying children. Its relatively vague guidelines on children are expressed in our standards manual in a section on privacy: “Children and teenagers — particularly those under the age of 16 who may not fully understand the implications of speaking to the media — command a special sensitivity,” it states.

Family offers ‘sincere apologies’ for 11-year-old girl’s false hijab-cutting story

TDSB did not discuss implications of letting 11-year-old face media over hijab story

Attack on girl wearing a hijab didn’t happen, police say. Why did TDSB let the 11-year-old face the cameras?

As well, it advises that photographers “should be sensitive when photographing children under 16 without permission of a parent or guardian.”

In practice, I know that the newsroom often debates and discusses issues related to children in the news and is particularly sensitive to this when children are victims of crime.

So why didn’t that conversation happen here in this case? Why was no consideration whatsoever given to the possibility of shielding this child’s identity from public view?

The answer is simple and, to me, understandable: This girl’s speaking before media at the school board offices, with school board officials and her mother present, provided sanction for the Star and other media outlets to identify her.

As editor Michael Cooke told me: “The girl was put forward by responsible and caring adults, including her mother. That was enough for me.”

Parental permission to identify children in the news is indeed a significant factor in any judgment call on this issue and is generally the standard stated in those ethics codes that provide specific guidelines on covering children, including Britain’s Editor’s Code of Practice.

In a statement to the media Wednesday, the family said it chose to make the story public, “horrified that there was such a perpetrator who may try to harm someone else.” The mother made clear that at that time, she too believed her daughter’s story. The family has declined the Star’s requests for interviews and expressed its “sincere apologies to every Canadian.”

After Toronto police reported Monday morning that investigators had determined the attack did not happen, the Star decided not to name the girl. I believe that is the right decision and further, that we should consider removing her name from last week’s news reports so this story is not connected to her online identity for the rest of her life. Whatever happened — and it would seem this child told quite a lie — we must remember that she is just a child.

Had that public event at the girl’s school — in effect, a press conference with her mother and her speaking to media — not occurred, it’s likely the initial story would have been limited to reporting what Toronto police had said in the news release that first alerted media to what then was presented as a shocking story for our community. That release, which did not provide the child’s name, reported that an 11-year-old girl was walking to school when she was approached from behind by a man who pulled the hood off her jacket and then cut her hijab with a pair of scissors.

“This is being investigated as a hate crime,” stated that news release, which also included a detailed description of the man.

While the girl’s story was found to be false, this was not “fake news” as some critics have charged. The breaking news reports were based on information from reliable sources: an official police news release about a hate crime investigation involving a child, and an invitation by the school board for the media to talk to the girl with her mother presiding. On the face of it — based on what those valid sources said at that time, and the rush to condemnation by politicians at all levels of government — this was real news.

And now that we know it is not true, all of the institutions involved — including the media — are left to ask ourselves what lessons can be learned here. For my part, I hope this sparks deeper conversation in the media about specific rules on covering and naming children in the digital age.

On that, I was alerted this week to a 2004 Journalism Studies article by Romayne Smith Fullerton, an associate professor at Western University’s Faculty of Information and Media Studies, entitled “Covering Kids: Are journalists guilty of exploiting children?” (Full disclosure: the faculty awarded me a teaching fellowship and I’m now teaching a graduate course on critical issues in media literacy.)

Smith Fullerton examines how media might better assure that children’s stories are told in a responsible, ethical manner and raises the uncomfortable idea that parents might not always know what is best for their children — or fully understand the implications — when it comes to putting them forward to the media.

As she states, in making a strong case that children deserve special care and attention by the media, “few journalists or media outlets rigorously or systematically consider what coverage may mean for children and very few have detailed protocols about interacting with minors.”

Smith Fullerton contends that the media should consider more rigorous consent protocols similar to those required by academic researchers who interview children. She acknowledges the difficulty of this for newsrooms, particularly in breaking news situations.

I agree that the detailed protocols demanded in academia are likely unworkable in the newsroom. But I am aligned with her greater point that “media outlets need to develop valid, respectful and specific procedures for covering children,” and we have some responsibility to make sure parents understand the implications of media coverage of their children.

Children are vulnerable sources and the implications of any news coverage involving them should always be part of the conversation.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-12-01,"Folks: This is Journalism 101 — be skeptical. “If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out,” states an age-old adage preached to generations of journalists.

Believe nothing at face value; verify what sources say; check and double check. That is what we call due diligence in journalism. This is a core value of the Star’s journalistic standards.

I am not the first journalist to say that the Washington Post provided journalists and readers at large alike with a textbook example this week of due diligence at work in journalism.

Call this the triumph of real reporting.

The Washington Post’s report about a woman who came to Post reporters with what turned out to be a fabricated story about having been impregnated when she was a teenager by Alabama’s Senate candidate Roy Moore, deserves all the accolades it has received for ultimately exposing a scheme to deceive and embarrass that news organization and, in so doing, showing why journalistic standards matter.

As the Post reported, a woman approached its reporters to share a dramatic story about an alleged affair with Moore that led to an abortion when she was 15. Had it been true, this would have indeed been big news.

Here is what bears understanding here. Real reporters do not simply publish what anyone tells them, no matter how dramatic the story presented. Real reporting demands that journalists always take steps to verify what sources tell them, check out the reliability of all sources, seek documentation to back up what sources tell them, ask questions, go back and ask more questions.

The Post reporters were straight with the woman about their fact-checking process, even as the woman pushed them to give their opinion about Moore and whether the story could bring down his candidacy.

In checking out the woman’s story, inconsistencies emerged. Further checking of public records and internet searches uncovered information indicating the woman quite likely worked for Project Veritas, an organization that aims to discredit journalists and mainstream media outlets by trying to trick them into publishing hoax stories and admitting to biased reporting.

But, here, the Post turned the tables and exposed the attempted sting with a first-rate investigative sting operation of its own, in which it confronted the woman with the facts while a hidden camera captured it all on video. Then, the Post published its tour de force report detailing its meticulous reporting about how it discovered the truth about the woman and Project Veritas.

That report also serves as a master class in the journalistic transparency today’s media environment demands. The Post explained its standards to readers, telling them why it had secretly photographed the woman and why it reported her previous off-the-record comments. “We always honour ‘off-the-record’ agreements when they’re entered into in good faith,” said Martin Baron, the Post’s executive editor. “But this so-called off-the-record conversation was the essence of a scheme to deceive and embarrass us. . . . We can’t honour an ‘off-the-record’ agreement that was solicited in maliciously bad faith.”

All of this was journalistic rigour writ large, a prime example of what reporters and editors at serious news organizations like the Star do daily in meeting the standards required by the law and our longstanding ethics policies. While it is disconcerting that individuals and organizations would seek to trick the media into publishing false information — and journalists quite rightly fear being taken in by such hoaxes — we believe that the strong standards of due diligence in which we hold our journalists provides significant protection against our publishing such blatantly bogus information.

“This is how good journalists do their jobs and how they don’t get taken in by hoaxes,” Jane Kirtley, a professor at the University of Minnesota and an expert in media law, said in an Associated Press report of the thwarted hoax. “It’s such an important lesson.”

Indeed, as Post writer Callum Borchers, who covers the intersection of media and politics, wrote this week, journalistic vetting — the essence of what we do — prevented a false claim from being published: “A Project Veritas plot designed to embarrass the media by exposing recklessness demonstrated the media’s care instead.”

In a world in which a previously unimaginable amount of misinformation and disinformation go viral every day, trustworthy journalism from journalists and news organizations that hold themselves to high professional standards and do the real work of reporting to verify facts matters more than ever.

The lessons learned here are important reminders for journalists and citizens alike: Just because someone says it’s true, does not make it so.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-09-15,"Journalism’s history of undercover reporting is fraught with contradiction.

On one hand, some of the most celebrated reporting of the past century or so resulted from courageous reporters who went undercover to expose injustices and wrongdoing.

On the other hand, is the fact that journalism’s core value is truth. How can lying to get a story be reconciled with that value?

Like so many ethical issues in journalism, this is not a black and white issue. Journalist’s first obligation is to seek truth and report it. But there are some circumstances when truth can only be discovered by means of deception. In such cases, the overriding value is the public interest.

Did the ends justify the means of the Star’s Sara Mojtehedzadeh going undercover for a month at Fiera Foods, one of Toronto’s largest industrial bakeries, to expose working conditions for precarious workers who rely on temp agencies to find work? In my view, this was most certainly justified.

The Star’s journalistic standards guide makes clear that undercover reporting is a tool of last resort, to be used following extensive consideration at the newsroom’s highest level: “Undercover reporting, photography and surveillance video should be used rarely and a case must be made that the story to be uncovered is of high public interest,” the policy states.

In practice, approval for undercover reporting is given only when reporters and senior editors have determined that the story could not be obtained by other means. Here, editor Michael Cooke and managing editor Irene Gentle made the judgment call to allow Mojtehedzadeh to go undercover. They concluded there was indeed no other way to get this information, and most important, that this was a story of strong public interest.

Mojtehedzadeh had spent many months investigating temp agencies, seeking information about injustices to some of our community’s most vulnerable workers. In reading through hundreds of Ministry of Labour reports and court documents on workers’ injuries she found numerous references to heath and safety violations at Fiera Foods Company and Marmora Freezing Corporation, one of its partner companies.

She also discovered three deaths had occurred at Fiera or in affiliated companies. The most recent happened last year when 23-year-old Amina Diaby, a refugee from Guinea on her first job in Canada, died when her hijab was pulled into a machine as she worked on an assembly line near the conveyer belt. Diaby was hired through a temp agency and had been working at Fiera Foods for two weeks.

“We looked at all of the information and concluded that my going undercover as a temp worker was the only way to get this story. We couldn’t just ask precarious temp workers to tell us what is happening inside the factory,” Mojtehedzadeh told me this week. “In past, I have had cases of temp workers who were fired for speaking up to the Star and I did not want to put anyone at risk of losing their job.

“All of the injury data and the deaths made it clear there was a strong public interest here in the health and safety of temp workers.”

Fiera Foods has also benefited from public funding, having received some $4.7 million dollars in government loans and grants. In response to questions from the Star, the company said that health and safety is a “core principle.”

Following publication of the Star's investigation, Fiera Foods this week was fined $300,000 after pleading guilty to charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act related to Diaby’s death. As well, the company told the Star it has hired auditors to examine its health and safety practices and temp agency contracts.

If you have not read this investigation by Mojtehedzadeh and Brendan Kennedy, who came into the project to provide further reporting, I hope you do so. Like many readers, I was stunned at what was revealed about the work conditions for these vulnerable workers, both through the undercover reporting and the more “classic” means of obtaining information.

Arguably, undercover reporting is itself a classic reporting technique. In the 2012 book, Undercover Reporting, the Truth about Deception, author Brooke Kroeger argues that undercover work embodies a central discipline of good reporting: “the ability to extract significant information or to create indelible, real-time descriptions of hard-to-penetrate institutions or social situations that deserve the public’s attention.”

The New York University journalism professor has compiled an online public database on undercover reporting that provides many example of outstanding undercover reporting (including some past Toronto Star investigations) and numerous thought-provoking articles about the ethics of journalistic deception.

Star editor Michael Cooke believes strongly that “undercover reporting has a long and noble history and is often courageous work that takes perseverance.

“Look no further than Nelly Bly,” he said, referring to the legendary reporter who went undercover as a patient in a New York insane asylum in the late 1800s.

“Her sensational account of the dreadful conditions and treatment of the patients got action, fast. So Bly made life better for the mentally ill,” Cooke said. “And that’s what it’s all about … trying to make life better.”

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-06-09,"An important reader question about trust in the Star: “I am curious what steps a journalist might take to verify what they are told by a confidential source. I can understand the need for confidential sources in the media, but, as a reader I generally put a little less faith in what is attributed to an anonymous source. How would you generally, decide if a source who wants to remain confidential is reliable?”

The Star’s policy on anonymity states that, “The public interest is best served when news sources are identified by their full names.” When that is not possible and confidential sources — individuals who are not named in the Star — are used in reporting information deemed to be of public interest, the Star’s reporters must take steps to determine the reliability of these sources. This is responsible reporting. In all cases, reporters, and most often their editors too, know the identities of sources granted anonymity in the Star.

Given the ongoing debate about the use of confidential sources in covering Donald Trump’s administration, I have asked the bureau chiefs of the Star’s three Canadian political bureaus to provide their insights on the reader’s question as it pertains to the Star’s political and government coverage. Here are their thoughtful responses.

Bruce Campion-Smith, Ottawa bureau chief

“First off, a confidential source is generally someone we know very well and have a track record with and built on a relationship usually over years. We’ve assured ourselves that they are in a position to know the information they are giving us and that they have a track record of playing straight. Remember the trust cuts both ways. Not only do we have to trust them but they have to trust us.

The source has to absolutely be in a position to know what they are talking about. No second-hand information or gossip. A bottom line is that any information gleaned this way must be fact-based. We don’t allow someone to anonymously trash another individual. That’s just a cheap shot.

Typically, our sources in Ottawa tend to be government officials who cannot speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the information they are passing. To be found out would put their job in jeopardy. These could be whistleblowers or other insiders whose information may reveal truths that the politicians are attempting to hide.

We have to be alert to the motives of the source in providing the information. Usually the passing of information works to their favour in some way too, perhaps by building profile of a story. But we need to do a gut check to understand their motives.”

Robert Benzie: Queen’s Park bureau chief

“In political reporting, granting anonymity to a source is often a necessity in order to get them to say anything beyond boilerplate talking points. As we have seen from The New York Times’ superb reporting on the current president, off-the-record sources are essential to understanding what is going on in the White House.

These people sometimes risk their jobs and reputations to speak to the Star. Yes, their motivations are not always altruistic — though we do hear from whistle-blowers in politics — but the insights can be invaluable. There are many important stories that would never have been exposed without allowing people to speak on background.

Toronto Star readers should trust the confidential sources they see in the Star because Toronto Star reporters do. I do think we need to explain in stories why we are giving sources the right to withhold their names.”

David Rider: City Hall bureau chief

“When thinking about whether to use a confidential source I consider whether the information is of sufficient public interest to justify giving somebody anonymity.

How trustworthy is the source? I never use a confidential source unless I know and trust them from past experience. Anybody who has steered me wrong in the past cannot be trusted with a cloak of anonymity.

Even if I trust them, what are their motivations? What they are saying might be true but I have to have a good sense of why they are doing it to feel comfortable with keeping their identity secret. For example, I will never quote an anonymous source throwing political muck at somebody else. I see this in print often and I cringe because that is essentially helping somebody be a vandal, taking shots without putting their name behind it.

Is there any way I can get the information without using a confidential source? If so, even if it means waiting a day or a two, I will wait.

I don’t pretend that I look at this checklist every time I consider use of a confidential source, but all these considerations go through my mind. People put themselves in peril trusting me to keep their identity confidential and readers trust the Star to provide them information that is reliable and important. I don’t take any of that lightly.”",[]

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2017-02-17,"There is nothing new about critical readers expressing their concerns about what they read in the Star in strong words. My in-box, and those of most other journalists here, is evidence of that.

What is new in recent weeks however is the fact some of those critics are increasingly hurling a new term of insult our way to express disdain about what they read in the Toronto Star: Fake News.

We are seeing this degrading label now in emails, in Facebook and Instagram comments and in tweets directed at the Star and its journalists.

“Go report some real news and stop contributing to fake news,” one such reader told Daniel Dale, the Star’s Washington correspondent.

“Sounds like an alternative fact to me. Fake news,” said a reader who disagreed with a report on road tolls written by David Rider, the Star’s City Hall bureau chief.

“More fake news from the Toronto Star. Sad,” said a reader critical of a Washington Post wire service report about President Donald Trump’s first week in office.

“Sadly, your biased, incorrect and fake news is the reason your newspaper is struggling,” another told me. “Readers want facts.”

Here are the facts: The charge of “fake news” is now being thrown at the mainstream media, by largely partisan critics, as an all-encompassing derisive epithet, largely devoid of its original, and accurate, meaning.

The new U.S. president and his followers have clearly co-opted these words in their campaign to delegitimize the press and discredit legitimate reporting that seeks to hold the new administration to account — as journalists should and must in upholding their responsibilities within a democracy.

Want more facts? Fake news is not news you happen to disagree with. And nor is it news from responsible news organizations that includes mistakes, made honestly and corrected honestly in line with the journalistic commitment to accuracy and fairness. Unfortunately, I have seen this insult used in regard to the Star’s journalism in both of these circumstances, in some cases from people I would have expected to know better, such as a university journalism professor and a former newspaper publisher.

While real fake news is a matter of legitimate concern, the distinction about what is and is not fake news matters much in this troubling time when we face an assault on truth and daily debate about facts and “alternative facts” in what is increasingly coming to be regarded as a “post-truth world.” Easy, derisive labels that allow critics to dismiss outright information they disagree with, or news reports they regard as substandard, seem to me to be dangerously reductive.

So, what is fake news?

To answer that accurately, we must look to Craig Silverman the Canadian journalist who first wrote about the phenomena of fake news for BuzzFeed News in November. Silverman, who has achieved global recognition for this important work, exposed the reality of fraudulent news, deliberately created and shared, largely on Facebook, to gain advertising dollars. Much of what he discovered was pro-Trump fake news that cast his opponent, Hillary Clinton, in a negative light with clearly false information.

Silverman’s reporting provided a fascinating look into the digital media universe and the ease with which wholly made-up “news” could be spread – and seemingly, believed. This “ecosystem” of fabricated information presented as serious news continues to be a significant concern in discerning the credibility of news sources.

But, almost as soon as the term “fake news” became part of our lexicon it was co-opted by Trump for his own ends, casting aspersions on the credibility of legitimate news organizations committed to ethical standards of journalism.

Who could forget Trump, during a televised press conference refusing to take a question from a CNN reporter, telling him, “You are fake news.” Or, his many tweets labeling the New York Times’ carefully sourced journalism as “fake news.” He was at it again this week, tweeting Thursday about “FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and ‘sources.’’’

Silverman is clear about how he defines fake news: “My definition of fake news has three criteria: it has to be 100-percent false – not a news article or partisan site that gets a few facts wrong; it has to be created consciously to be false; and there has to be an economic motive,” he said this week at an event at University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.

Silverman, now media editor of BuzzFeed News, is well aware that the term has been exploited by critics of legitimate news and will likely continue to be. “I think the term fake news has almost been rendered meaningless at this point,” he said.

Indeed. I have yet to see any validity in any of the “fake news” charges lobbed our way. While it should go without saying, I think it’s safe to say, the Toronto Star is not in the business of fake news. While this news organization’s work does sometimes fall short of its own journalistic standards, to suggest that the Star would deliberately publish false information is wrong. We don’t make stuff up.

And, that’s a fact.",[]
244,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2016/09/30/when-does-star-report-race-of-suspects-wanted-by-police-public-editor.html,When does Star report race of suspects wanted by police?: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Sept.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-09-30,"A reader’s good question about the Toronto Star’s reporting of the race of suspects wanted by police raised relevant points demanding further inquiry.

“I am curious about the application of the Toronto Star’s policy on naming the race of suspects,” the reader, who works in the field of human rights law, told me last week. “The description of yesterday’s sexual assault suspect does not mention his race (he appears to be white), in contrast with an earlier story identifying a suspect as black.

“Admittedly, I am more than curious – the ways in which race and suspects are reported can feed into stereotypes about race, propensity and crime,” said the woman, who preferred not to be named in this column.

She is right of course. The media’s depiction of race can have a significant impact on the perception of race in our community. Particularly when it comes to depictions of race and crime.

The Star has long decreed that “no reference, direct or indirect, should be made to a person’s race, colour or religion unless it is pertinent to the story.”

Our policy on racial references makes some exception in the case of a missing person or a criminal suspect at large. In such cases, the policy states, “there may be justification for identifying race or colour as part of a full description that provides as many details as possible. Avoid vague descriptions that serve no purpose.”

This reader pointed out two descriptions of suspects published recently in the Star. As she indicated, a Sept. 18 report of a man wanted for sexual assault made no reference to race in stating that, “The suspect, shown in a security camera picture, is described as about 25 to 35, 5-foot-9 to six feet tall, with medium build and brown hair. He was wearing a red gold shirt, navy blue shorts and brown thong sandals.”

On July 30 however, the Star published a report that did include the race of a suspect wanted in connection with a shooting in Christie Pits Park that left several people injured. “Police have released a photo of a suspect, who was participating in the fitness class, police say. He is described as a black man, 25 to 30-years-old, five-foot-eight to five-foot-nine with short cornrows that were visible from beneath his baseball cap.” The Star did not publish the full description of the man’s clothing, as provided by police, nor did it include the fact that police considered the suspect to be “armed and dangerous.”

The first article in the Star was accompanied by a photo of the suspect — clearly a white man. The second article did not include publication of the suspect photo released by police – likely because it was a blurry, poor quality image.

As I told this reader, generally, the descriptions of suspects published in the Star come directly from police news releases. Still, I told her, there is a strong need for the Star to be consistent about how it reports these sensitive matters, regardless of what information police provide to reporters.

The Toronto police force has its own policies on when it might include the race of suspects in its news releases.

“Our policy is clear: where we have a picture in which a suspect’s face is clearly visible we will not attach a racial descriptor to it,” spokesman Mark Pugash told me. “We want to go with the best possible evidence and a good clear photo is always best.

“If there is no clear picture, we will go with the description given to police by witnesses or victims,” Pugash said, adding that the security camera images of the suspect sought in the July 30 article did not provide a clear image of the suspect.

In such cases when photos are not available or of poor quality, police news releases may well state that a suspect is white, black, brown or use other racialized descriptors that could aid in a member of the public identifying the suspect. Indeed in looking through the archive of police news releases, you can find all such descriptions.

Like the Star, police policy calls for avoiding vague descriptions of suspects. “The information we put out has to enable someone to recognize someone,” Pugash said.

Of course, much of this is subjective. What police regard as a full description may not rise to the level required by the Star. The Star’s newsroom must always be aware of our own policy and values in determining whether there is justification in reporting the race of suspects and not automatically include such information simply because police have put it in a news release.

Certainly, as a news organization committed to equal dignity for all, the Star bears considerable responsibility to guard against reinforcing unfair racial stereotypes.",[]
245,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2016/04/22/accuracy-is-the-foundation-of-trust-public-editor.html,Accuracy is the foundation of trust: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'April', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-04-22,"On the walls of the Atkinson Foundation, two floors above the Toronto Star’s newsroom, hangs a painting that provides vivid evidence of this organization’s longtime commitment to credibility.

It depicts a Norman Rockwell-like idealized view of the newsroom of the “Evening Star” in 1899, when the legendary Joseph E. Atkinson was at the helm as publisher and proprietor. It shows about a dozen journalists – men in waistcoats, bowties and eyeshades – sitting at wooden tables, pencils in hand, with newspapers and books strewn about. A lone woman in a long dress, her hair in a topknot, walks among them carrying a stack of papers.

On the wall hangs a poster adorned with gold stars and words that proclaim the mission of “A Paper for the People”: “Brightness, Accuracy, Enterprise.”

I had an opportunity to see this piece of art only recently. Given my role for the past nine years as “guarantor of accuracy” on the many platforms on which the Star publishes these days, it delighted me so to see this image that paints a picture of the importance of accuracy all those 117 years ago, when Atkinson was building his newspaper.

I thought about it this week on reading a new study on what makes people trust and rely on the news. The central finding of this report, done by the U.S.-based Media Insight Project, a collaboration of the American Press Institute and the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, was unsurprising: Accuracy is the single most critical reason why people trust a news organization.

“Accuracy is the paramount principle of trust,” the study states. “Eighty-five per cent of Americans rate it as extremely or very important that news organizations get the facts right, higher than any other general principle.”

The study also found that transparency (defined as the idea that news organizations explain the way they gather and report the news) is very important to building trust. So to is “balance,” defined as “reporting that provides different views.” Readers also highly value timeliness (that a news report provide you with the latest news and information), and clarity (that a report be concise and gets to the point.)

Indeed, all of that does not sound a whole lot different from the imperative that the 1899 Evening Star provide brightness, accuracy and enterprise.

This study does reveal information important to today’s media business facing a revenue squeeze as advertisers spend more with digital giants such as Facebook and Google: When readers trust a news organization they “engage” with it in ways that matter to the future of the news business.

“Those news consumers especially concerned with trustworthiness are also the most likely to report that they take valuable actions — such as paying for news, spreading news to friends, and following the source on social platforms.

“Trust is an important differentiator for building an audience.”

While the report’s central thesis seems to me to be old news, there is much interesting research in the report about how audiences gauge the trustworthiness of news on new digital platforms, including websites, apps and social media.

It tells us that the rise of social media, in particular, has contributed to public distrust in media.

“When it comes to trust, many people who receive news from these social media platforms consume it with skepticism,” it says. “Social media news consumers do not generally trust the news they see there.”

I have been following media credibility studies since 1985 when I was a reporter for the Star sent to API for a professional development seminar. On our agenda that week was a then brand-new research report done by the American Society of Newspaper Editors titled, “Newspaper Credibility: Building Reader Trust: A National Study.”

I have never forgotten what I took away from that illuminating session: the reality that if journalists mess up such basics as spelling names correctly readers really do wonder what else we got wrong.

A multitude of studies have since made clear that the media has a deepening credibility problem. This report again finds low levels of confidence in all media.

As with many previous studies, it also points to a time-honored means of building trust: publishing corrections when we are wrong.

“Several people said that owning up to mistakes and drawing attention to errors or mistakes can show consumers that a source is accountable and dedicated to getting it right in the long term,” it states.

As “Kimberly,” one of the women interviewed for this report, stated, “We all make mistakes. If an outlet is wrong and is transparent about it and they screwed up, if they say I messed up and take ownership that makes me trust you more.”

Indeed, trust matters. Always has, and always will.",[]

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2016-03-11,"The Toronto Star has been more than a newspaper for some time, having evolved in the past 20 years from providing news on paper to become a multi-platform digital news and information organization.

The Star now publishes its content in the paper, on its website, thestar.com; on its new tablet app, Star Touch; and also on its mobile app. While not all content is always published on all these “platforms,” all content can potentially be published in any of these ways. That fact applies to articles written by staff and also to content submitted for publication by readers.

Given this reality of multi-platform publishing, I was quite surprised to receive three requests in recent weeks from readers seeking to have their published letters to the editor removed from the Star’s website. One of the letters was published in 2010, another in 2011 and the third, last month. All expressed views on matters of public concern.

Two of these readers contend that they did not know the letters they submitted for publication would not only be published in the Star’s print editions but also online. Now, they tell me, they do not want these letters — and their names — coming up in Google searches. One letter writer suggests that online publication of her letter violates her privacy rights.

While hardly a week goes by that someone does not ask the Star to make information about them that was published previously on our website disappear from the Internet, these recent requests to delete letters to the editor are a new twist.

The Star generally does not delete what it publishes online — what is known as “unpublishing.” Our policy is clear and firm: “The Star does not unpublish content from our websites or archives, except in some rare circumstances.” Those “rare circumstances” are generally legal reasons and always demand consultation with the Star’s editor, managing editor and newsroom lawyer.

Unpublishing for rare reasons is indeed rare: In nearly nine years in this role, I can count on one hand the number of times when we have removed published information.

Like most other news organizations, the Star’s unpublishing policy is rooted in the view that the website — our digital archive of what’s been published — is a matter of public record and that it is unethical to make content simply disappear because someone does not want to see an article in which they are named turn up in a Google search.

It is worth knowing also that in this time when news and information is shared widely on social media, commented on, and cached on the web, it is virtually impossible to make words or images disappear entirely from the digital realm.

Clearly the long lifespan and easy accessibility of digital news and information has created new issues for news organizations and sources. The Star has given this issue serious consideration. It does take steps to update online articles and correct any inaccuracies in a transparent way. If we report on people charged with crimes and those charges are later dropped or those named were acquitted, we will note the outcome of the charges in bold type at the top of the article, understanding that a report of a criminal charge is a grave concern to the person involved.

So what about these unusual requests to unpublish letters to the editor that were submitted – and signed — by readers eager to see their views expressed in the Star. Indeed, given that the Star publishes about 12 to 15 of more than 100 letters submitted each day, most readers see it as somewhat of a coup to have their letter selected for publication.

I have spoken about this with the Star’s letters editor and the editorial page editor who is responsible for the Letters page. We all agree we cannot see any valid grounds for unpublishing published letters.

While these people seeking to have their letters taken down may well have since altered their views as expressed in those letters, or, as one of them told us, faced some professional repercussions for having expressed political views, I don’t think the Star can simply make those letters disappear as if they were never published.

Nor can I accept the argument that those letters were submitted for publication in the newspaper and the Star did not make clear that they could be published online as well — or that this is some sort of privacy issue because explicit permission to publish online was not sought and given. Given that the Star has been publishing readers’ letters online for many years now and this news organization is publicly transparent that it publishes on many platforms, I cannot see the need to state this explicitly or obtain explicit approval.

Indeed, we operate in a multi-platform digital age in which publishing has long since moved beyond printing words on paper.",[]
247,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2015/10/02/the-shades-of-grey-of-journalism-ethics-public-editor.html,The shades of grey of journalism ethics: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'Oct.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2015-10-02,"In the days before a badly written book about a guy named Grey became a global bestseller, I would often refer to the “shades of grey” in journalistic ethics.

While one can’t go there these days without evoking smirks about the sexually explicit 50 Shades of Grey, the fact remains that many aspects of journalistic ethics are not a black and white matter.

And certainly the most intriguing and challenging ethical dilemmas of journalism often involve those many shades of grey.

My job, indeed that of all journalists, would be so much easier if journalistic standards and ethics were always a clear-cut matter of “Thou shalt do this, Thou shalt not do that.”

It is rarely that simple.

The reality of the complexity of journalism ethics in our ever-evolving digital era is the guiding principle of an important new ethics initiative presented last week at the annual Online News Association conference held in Los Angeles and attended by more than 2,000 journalists from across North America.

The “Build Your Own Ethics Code” project, led by veteran journalist Thomas Kent, standards editor of The Associated Press, involved more than 20 journalists working together for more than two years and soliciting input from many more journalists throughout North America.

The initiative is rooted in the premise that beyond a few fundamental and unassailable principles, journalistic ethics cannot be cast in stone and that policy and practice can — and does — vary across news organizations and among individual journalists.

That doesn’t mean anything goes. Or, that journalists should just make their own rules as they go along. After establishing four fixed points of journalistic values, the “BYO” ethics project provides a digital tool that guides journalists to customize their own codes of conduct based on a range of “building blocks” to consider in ethical decision-making.

First, the important fixed points of journalistic ethics. These are non-negotiable – indeed “black and white” fundamentals of all journalism, the core of every one of the dozens and dozens of journalistic standards code I have looked at in recent years.

These are:

Tell the truth. Journalists are honest, accurate, truthful and fair. We give people opportunity to respond to critical allegations, correct our errors, clearly distinguish fact from opinion in all content and “do not distort or fabricate facts, imagery, sound or data.”

Avoid conflicts of interest. Journalists avoid any conflict of interest that undermines our ability to report fairly. And, the ethics guide states, “disclose to your audience any unavoidable conflicts or situational factors that may validly affect your judgment of our credibility.”

Community. Respect our audiences and those we report about. The guide states: “Consider how your work and its permanence may affect the subjects of your reporting, your community and, since the Internet knows no boundaries, the larger world.”

Professional Conduct: Don’t plagiarize; keep your promises to sources, readers and your community.

Beyond those basics, the project encourages thought and discussion to determine where we stand as news organizations and as individual journalists on more than 40 specific issues including confidential sources, covering children and how we handle information gathered on social media.

“We started with the recognition that the journalism profession encompasses ever more people, philosophies and technologies,” Kent says. “There are many definitions these days of a ‘journalist,’ making it more important than ever for journalists to be clear about who they are and what they stand for.

“We believe the best hope for convincing all journalists to adopt and live by an ethics code is to give them ownership and flexibility in creating one.”

Steve Buttry, a Louisiana State University journalism professor and a well-travelled newsroom journalism trainer who was involved in the project from the outset, says the BYO code recognizes that journalists are rarely unanimous in our views on ethics policies and practice. He sees great value in the debate and discussion this new tool enables.

“As I’ve said many times, good ethical decisions don’t come from good rules but from many good conversations about ethics,” Buttry wrote in a recent blog post about the online ethics project.

While this initiative is geared to journalists, I think it is instructive for our audiences as well. It is well worth checking out to learn more about the many shades of grey of journalism ethics.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2014-01-24,"In journalism, the truth of images matters every bit as much as the truth of words.

Just as fabrication is the cardinal sin of those who write the news, manipulating pictures is the zero-tolerance transgression of those who photograph the news.

As a reader, you must know with all certainty that what you see published in the newspaper and online is indeed what the journalist’s camera saw.

This core ethic of photojournalism has been the subject of much discussion in newsrooms around the globe this week after The Associated Press announced it “severed ties” with a Pulitzer Prize-winning freelance photographer who digitally altered an image he captured in Syria last year.

As the Star reported Thursday, the AP said photographer Narciso Contreras told editors he manipulated a digital picture of a Syrian rebel fighter taken last September, using software to remove a colleague’s video camera from the lower left corner of the image.

While the Star is an AP client and uses its photos daily, it did not publish this photo.

Contreras was part of the AP team awarded a Pulitzer last year for powerful news images of the war in Syria. All of his photos have now been removed from AP’s publicly available archive.

While some judge the news service’s reaction to be overly harsh, arguing that the photo altering did not alter the meaning of the image, it was a clear violation of the AP’s ethics code regarding the truth and accuracy of images. And while I imagine it wasn’t easy to reveal this ethical breach to the world, the AP’s transparency and accountability here is commendable — a model for media organizations on owning up to journalistic lapses.

Taras Slawnych, the Star’s visuals editor, agreed totally with the AP’s call on this ethical transgression: “The Star would never do that to a news photo,” he told me. “The integrity of photos has to be there. If you cross that ethical line and alter what’s real in an image you lose credibility.”

The Star’s ethics policy holds our visual journalists (those who shoot still photos and video) to the same standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency as all other Star journalists. While the code says that digital manipulation is permissible to improve technical quality (colour, contrast and basic sharpening), it makes clear that “any alteration or enhancement that renders a photo inaccurate or misleading is forbidden.”

While news photos in the Star “document reality,” sometimes feature stories are accompanied by “photo illustrations” that take creative liberties with images. The Star’s policy stipulates these must be labelled as such so readers clearly understand the image has been constructed.

I have no doubt all of the Star’s staff photographers understand and hold true to this professional ethic. So too do the Star’s photo editors know that electronic manipulation of news photos is verboten.

But, given that the Star and news organizations everywhere increasingly publish photos obtained from many outside sources, including social media, “citizen journalists” and “handout photos” from sources, there’s greater need to ensure the authenticity of photos before publishing them.

“There is always a chance that a submitted photo is not truthful. We must take steps to verify and ask ‘is this image real, is it truthful?’” Slawnych said, noting that today’s electronic tools make altering images easier than ever.

So how do these standards square with the controversy over a handout real estate photo of a Mississauga mansion up for auction published recently in the Star? As Susan Pigg, the Star’s real estate reporter, wrote last week, the “show-stopping photo” was taken with a wide-angle lens that appears to double the length of the home’s cobblestone driveway. The photographer hired by the real estate agent also acknowledged to Pigg that the photo is a “blending” of a few different exposures to capture the home in its best light.

While such electronic manipulation is common practice in advertising and marketing, and also some magazines, it is not in line with the Star’s photo standards, Slawnych told me. Still, like Slawnych, I don’t have concerns of a significant lapse on the Star’s part here.

I think most readers will understand that handout MLS listing photos are advertising and marketing tools — not photojournalism — and what you see is rarely exactly what you get. As Pigg so aptly put it in her story about the photo controversy: “those glitzy real estate photos are meant to sell a dream, and a home.”

But, given that this photo was published in the Star’s news pages to illustrate a story about the auction of the monster home, I am concerned that there was no photo credit included to indicate it was a handout marketing photo. While this was an unintended omission, readers needed that to clearly understand this glossy image was a realtor’s photo intended to enhance reality.

For the Star, the reality is that both words and images must document truth, however unvarnished.",[]

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-09-06,"In journalism schools across Canada this week, many a freshman student will learn one of the foremost lessons of the J-school classroom: Get someone’s name wrong and you get a failing grade.

In the decade I taught at Ryerson University’s journalism school my students understood that no matter how brilliant their reporting and writing, if they messed up a name, they got an automatic F on that assignment. That’s a common policy of most journalism schools.

In the Star’s newsroom, we don’t hand out failing grades for misspelled, mixed-up names. But we do publish corrections.

If the Star gets a given or surname wrong, whether in the newspaper or online, we always correct. That is a fundamental undertaking of the Star’s corrections practice.

Getting names right has long been considered “the bedrock measure of accuracy” in journalism. Correcting when we make mistakes matters greatly both to those whose names we get wrong and to readers.

Every media credibility study I’ve looked at indicates that readers link credibility with basic accuracy and believe that getting names right is a significant indication of the overall accuracy of the journalist and the news organization.

We well know it’s a fact that if we get your name wrong you’ll wonder what else we got wrong. That’s why double-checking names must be the most basic of fact-checking for journalists.

But even the most careful journalists can make mistakes with names. Of 198 corrections published in the Star in the first half of this year, 58 were for wrong names. That’s 29 per cent of all corrections and tracking upward from last year when 100 of 415 newspaper corrections (just under 25 per cent) were for incorrect names.

We also made 316 online-only corrections in those six months, a great many for incorrect names.

I can’t imagine anyone here would disagree that’s too many incorrect names making it into the Star. Clearly, the Star could enhance its accuracy record considerably by making even more concerted efforts across the newsroom to ensure all first and last names are stated and spelled correctly.

I can assure you no journalist sets out to mangle someone’s name. A recent Canadian research study, “Verification as a Strategic Ritual: How journalists retrospectively describe processes for ensuring accuracy” found that the newspaper journalists interviewed about their methods of verifying information before publication all reported that they always took steps to ensure their subjects’ names were correct.

“An almost universal practice among participants is asking sources to spell their own name to ensure correct spelling, either at the beginning or the end of the interview,” stated the study published in February’s Journalism Practice.

As the study states, these journalists said they regarded an mistake in someone’s name as “a very visible error that can have implications for professional credibility.”

The Star’s error-tracking data leads me to two conclusions about how and why journalists get names wrong: Some do indeed fail in the basic requirement to verify the name and its spelling with the source. More often, they make mistakes when inputting names to their computers — your basic “typo” that’s subsequently not caught in their self-editing and the overall newsroom editing process.

Most mistakes in the Star start with writers. Our error data indicates that of the 198 corrections overall from January through June, 139 errors are classified as writing errors by reporters (100), columnists (19), freelance writers (16), editorial writers (2) and letter writers (2).

With newsroom restructuring resulting in fewer copy editors in the newsroom (and indeed in every newsroom throughout North America) there’s a strong case to be made that every writer must learn techniques to become their own best editor.

In coming weeks, I’ll be working with the newsroom to put together training sessions to help writers better catch their own errors and ensure that all writers have access to accuracy checklists. Such checklists have been proven to make a considerable difference in minimizing errors in names and other such basic facts. Simply reading our work back to ourselves doesn’t work in catching many errors — especially typos — because as Joseph T. Hallinan writes in Why We Make Mistakes, “By and large, we see what we expect to see.”

Whatever steps the newsroom and individual journalists take to minimize mistakes, some errors are inevitable given journalism’s deadline driven realities.

That’s why I make this pledge to you: If the Star gets your name wrong, we will publish a correction.",[]

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-04-19,"Writing recently about the unfairness of tax havens for the rich, freelance Op-Ed columnist Linda McQuaig cited an estimated $8-billion annual revenue loss to Canadians from tax havensLinda McQuaig cited an estimated $8-billion annual revenue loss to Canadians from tax havens.

McQuaig told you the number came from Canadians for Tax Fairness. What she didn’t tell you is that she is a member of that group’s advisory board.

Is that information that should be disclosed to readers? Is this a conflict of interest, as a reader who brought this to my attention suggested?

I don’t see a conflict issue here. McQuaig is a monthly opinion columnist for the Star, not a reporter. As such, she has wide latitude to express views informed by her own extensive expertise, interests and involvements.

Unlike news reporters who, according to the Star’s policy manual, must be seen to be “fair-minded fact-finders” and should not be “both actors and critics” on public issues, columnists — especially freelancers — have more leeway for involvement in public issues.

Still, there is a need for columnists and other Op-Ed writers to be transparent and make clear to readers any personal involvement in issues they write about.

Certainly McQuaig’s longtime interest in economic justice is no secret. A prolific author, she’s written nine books on politics and economics, including six national bestsellers. As her column credit note states, her most recent book, co-authored with Neil Brooks, is called The Trouble with Billionaires: How the Super-Rich Hijacked the World and How We Can Take It Back.

Nor, I am assured, was the writer attempting to hide her role with the tax fairness group. She simply overlooked mentioning her connection to the group that she is loosely affiliated with and in which she has no financial interest. And online the article linked to the organization’s website where McQuaig is listed as a member of the national advisory council.

Still, Editorial Page Editor Andrew Phillips decided the column should include some acknowledgement of McQuaig’s involvement with the group. To that end, the credit note at the end of the column has been amended to make that fact clear.

“Full disclosure is always best,” said Phillips, who like me does not regard this as a conflict issue. “If anything, adding a note here is an excess of caution.”

I think that was the right call. As was a similar call Phillips made this week for fuller disclosure on an online Op-Ed article exploring the Toronto casino debate written by Clyde W. Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth.

Barrow’s piece was critical of a University of Toronto, Martin Prosperity Institute study of the economic impact of a downtown casino in Toronto. Following a reader complaint that the article did not make clear Barrow’s past involvement with the casino industry, and upon further questioning of the author to determine the extent of any such involvement, the credit line on the article was amended to tell you: “He has conducted market feasibility studies for companies considering building casinos in New England.”

Op-Ed writers are not meant to be unbiased bystanders. They write to express informed views rooted in their own expertise and experience. They express their own views, not those of the news organization.

It is up to you to assess the positions put forth in Op-Ed pieces. But to do so, you must be given any relevant information that might help you gauge the credentials and biases of those given space to provide their perspectives on newsworthy public issues. The Star can’t know all the affiliations of all Op-Ed writers and expects them to disclose any interests they have in a subject.

“Op-ed writers aren’t supposed to be objective or to have no stake in the subjects they’re writing about,” Nicholas Goldberg, Los Angeles Times editorial page editor, said last fall in an interview with Media Matters, a media monitoring website.“When a writer does have a particular relationship to his subject that is not immediately apparent to the reader, it is important to disclose that so that the reader can evaluate the argument intelligently.”

Media Matters interviewed Goldberg and other U.S. editorial page editors after reporting that the Wall Street Journal had failed to disclose that 10 Op-Eds it published during the U.S. election campaign were written by advisers to presidential candidate Mitt Romney without any disclosure of that vital information.

A former New York Times editor called such an egregious failure to disclose “shameless.” Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, said: “Not disclosing is inexcusable.

“We are pretty careful here to disclose any affiliation,” he added.

Clearly, in this digital age of radical transparency, great care must be taken to assure the fullest disclosure possible.",[]
251,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2013/05/03/whats_fair_is_clearly_defined_at_star_public_editor.html,What’s fair is clearly defined at Star: Public Editor,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorfri.', 'May', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-05-03,"“What’s fair” may well be journalism’s eternal question, long the subject of academic conferences, scholarly articles and noble journalistic navel-gazing.

In the literature, “fairness in journalism” is generally an abstract notion, difficult to define; it is considered “complex,” “illusive,” “paradoxical,” “subjective.”

In the Star’s newsroom, what’s fair is neither abstract nor subjective. The core standard of fairness here is clear and concrete: any subject of potentially harmful factual allegations must be given opportunity to respond.

As Bert Bruser, the Star’s lawyer, tells some journalist in the newsroom almost every day, getting the other side is “the essence of fairness” in line with the legal requirements of responsible journalism as they have evolved in recent decades.

In last week’s column I told you about an egregious lapse of the Star’s standards of accuracy and fairness that resulted in the Star publishing false allegations about MPP Margarett Best. Proper due diligence was not done here.

While the reporter had attempted to reach Best, at no time did he state explicitly that he was working on a story that would report she was vacationing in Mexico while on medical leave from Queen’s Park. Had he done so, it’s quite likely he would have learned that was flat-out wrong and the Star would not have published the story.

In light of this serious lapse, the newsroom is taking steps to ensure that everyone fully understand due diligence and fairness. In coming weeks, Bruser, along with Kevin Donovan, the Star’s award-winning investigations editor, will lead mandatory training sessions for all reporters.

Donovan and his “I-team” are standard-bearers for the degree of due diligence fairness demands. Having talked extensively about this with him and Bruser, I expect many reporters have much to learn from them about the extent they must go to ensure they meet the standards of fairness laid down by the law and the Star’s policies.

I-team exposés of wrongdoing most often put their subjects in a negative light. But it is standard operating procedure for I-team reporters to make certain those subjects are given every opportunity to respond to harmful allegations before publication,

These reporters routinely make contact with the subjects of their investigations early in their reporting, often sending emails that lay out the explicit details of what they are looking into and what they hope to learn.

“Everyone is entitled to give their side of the story. I preach that on a daily basis,” Donovan told me this week. “Telling a person or organization about an allegation gives them the opportunity at the start to tell you that you have it wrong, partly wrong, or mostly right.

“Calling last minute doesn’t cut it. I often inform people or organizations on Day 1 of my investigation,” Donovan said. “People need to be told precisely what it is you are calling about.

“It is the fair and responsible thing to do.”

It is also the degree of diligence required to meet legal standards of fairness. Canada’s 2009 Supreme Court ruling on “responsible communication in the public interest” stipulates that “it is inherently unfair to publish defamatory allegations of fact without giving the target an opportunity to respond.”

That’s a clear definition of fairness, but not really new. As Bruser reminded me, this standard was expressed forcefully in law some three decades ago when the Toronto Sun lost a libel suit brought by then cabinet minister John Munro after the Sun reported wrongly that Munro had been involved in illegal stock trading.

Ontario Supreme Court Justice Mr. John Holland stated then that when “the paper has the goods on the person targeted in the story, it is basic and necessary that the person be confronted with the story so that his reaction be obtained.”

Justice Holland aptly pointed out that getting the other side could indeed cause a story to be “discarded,” preventing publication of an incorrect story. Certainly that would have happened with the Best story.

Through the years, Donovan, working closely with Bruser on many Star investigations, has come to understand the value of reaching out early to those he is investigating and being explicit about the allegations he is pursuing.

Doing so makes for “a better, more responsible, more solid story,” Donovan said.

In my books, that’s fairness in journalism.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2013-02-22,"By now, I would expect that all journalists invested in their future in journalism have let go of any silly notions that Twitter is merely a medium for sharing the trivial and the titillating.

That attitude is so 2010. Back then, when I wrote about “the Twitter transformation,” I told you that some news veterans were disdainful of the then relatively new digital tool that allows real-time sharing of information in 140 characters or less.

Certainly within the “twitterverse” you can still find the trivial (yes, some do still share what they ate for breakfast) and the titillating. And too much that is mean-spirited. But hasn’t that always been the case for any medium of communication?

For journalists and news organizations, Twitter is now a vital tool, especially when news breaks. It allows journalists to tell you almost instantaneously what we learn, whether on the scene or by connecting directly to participants and witnesses.

Yes, instant news does bring real risks of getting it wrong. I’ll get to that. But I do so believing Twitter is an important medium for journalism. What’s at issue is figuring out how to use it in a way that’s aligned with journalistic values of verification, accuracy and transparency.

These questions will be explored in Toronto next week in a “J-Talks” session, sponsored by the Canadian Journalism Foundation. Headlining the panel is Andy Carvin, NPR’s senior social media strategist and author of the recently released Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution. As the Star’s Michelle Shephard writes in today’s World Weekly section, Carvin became known as “the man who tweets revolutions” when he tweeted thousands of daily, first-hand, live reports from citizens at the heart of the Arab Spring.

The J-Talks session also features two other veteran journalists: digital pioneer Mathew Ingram, senior media writer for GigaOM, and Esther Enkin, the recently appointed ombudsman for CBC English services. I am moderating the session.

Entitled “The Twitter Effect: Is Journalism Still Able to Get it Right?” this panel came about in the aftermath of the Newtown shooting tragedy when much false information circulated within mainstream news websites and social media. Most egregious: many reported the wrong shooter, naming Ryan Lanza when it was actually his brother Adam. (Happily, due to the newsroom’s diligence, the Star did not report this erroneous information.)

Then, as was the case in just about any major breaking news story in recent years, many journalists and news organizations gave readers false information in the rush to report at Twitter speed. Sometimes that wrong stuff was reported on Twitter first, other times by mainstream means first. In all cases, it was amplified in the echo chambers of Twitter.

And each time, Twitter took the blame for the downfall of journalistic standards.

I think blaming this new medium is too simplistic.

Certainly journalists must figure out how to reconcile the conflict of reporting breaking stories in real time with the essential journalistic value of verification, which means “getting what happened down right.”

But, as the J-Talks panellists tell me, we need to do that within the reality that getting what happened down right when news breaks has always been somewhat messy.

Even when journalists reported for a daily news cycle, we understood the truth of the now clichéd statement that “news is the best available version of the truth.” In the chaos of reporting breaking news on deadline, that meant we sometimes didn’t have everything right when it came time to publish. We updated in next-day stories and published corrections.

Now that the news cycle never ends and Twitter can mean reporting on minute-to-minute deadlines, what should verification in journalism entail?

Does it mean telling you only what we know with absolute certainty? Or can it mean being transparent with you about what we are unsure about but trying to verify? Do we need a more effective corrections process for real-time news?

These are critical questions as journalism evolves and embraces new tools, particularly for legacy news organizations such as the Star where credibility matters much. Long-held standards of verification have served readers well here.

Those standards boil down to a simple dictum, still well worth a tweet for thought: “When in doubt, don’t report.”

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2012-02-10,"Duz acurit spelling mattur 2 U?

In this digital age of texting, tweeting and time-stressed journalism, has proper spelling gone the way of hot type?

As language evolves, should spelling too? Should the language of texting become common parlance? Are u ok with “1” for “won,” “L8r” for “later,” “UR” instead of “you’re”? A heart for “love?”

In a provocative essay published in this month’s Wired magazine, entitled “It’s Tyme to Let Luce” writer and professor Anne Trubek argues against the “outdated dogma” of standardized spelling. She contends it’s time to “loosen our idea of correct spelling.”

Language evolves, she said, “and spelling evolves, too, as we create new words, styles and guidelines.

“Consistent spelling was a great way to ensure clarity in the print era,” she said. “But with new technologies, the way that we write and read (and search and data-mine) is changing, and so must spelling.”

While Trubek presents a compelling argument for the “terrible mess” of the English language and its many inconsistencies in spellings, and tells us that the notion of consistent spelling is a “fairly recent invention” (albeit, an invention dating back at least to the 1770s), I can’t imagine the conventions of proper spelling disappearing from journalism any time soon.

Certainly, spelling does matter at the Star. Our readers remind us constantly that spelling matters.

Misspellings and typos in the newspaper and online can provoke more passionate reader indignation than just about any other journalistic transgression. Sometimes disproportionately so.

“You subject your readers to multiple spelling mistakes,” a reader recently told me in an email criticizing the Star for misspelling “anesthesiologist.”

“Your newspaper is supposed to be a model, not a source of mistakes which are careless and avoidable,” he wrote. “Journalism is not only about what you write but how you present it to the reader.

“This is totally unacceptable for any type of publication, spell checker or no spell checker.”

This week, a reader who identified himself as “a retired professor living in Portugal” emailed me about a Star sports blog in which the possessive “its” was misspelled as the contraction “it’s” three out of four times in the piece. Another reader wrote this week to point out that a reporter wrote “sighting” when she meant “citing.”

In recent weeks, readers have pointed out that the Star wrote about a movie “premier” instead of a “premiere” and referred to the “forward” of a book instead of the “foreword.”

Clearly homonyms — those words that sound the same, but have different meanings and spellings — are a challenge. To sometimes hilarious effect (not affect!), the Star has confused stationary and stationery, fazed and phased, principal and principle, aide and aid, pored and poured. These commonly misspelled words always need double-checking.

Is this just niggling nitpicking? Trubek believes the reason we have rules or rather, “arbitrary contrivances” governing spelling is simply “snobbery.” She argues that new technologies, such as smart phones and tablets, are “speeding the adoption of more casual forms of communication.”

But certainly people expect more from journalists than the casual newspeak of texts and 140-character tweets. As my son, 19, chided me in a message he texted in response to my hastily typed, error-ridden text message: “Nice grammar. I thought U were an editor.”

Media credibility studies consistently tell us that spelling errors erode journalism’s credibility. We know public trust depends on journalists getting the details right.

I don’t see how any journalist can buy into Trubek’s argument that correct spelling no longer matters.

As Mallary Jean Tenore of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies aptly concluded in an online report about Trubek’s essay, “journalists value accuracy.”

“We want to get our facts straight and spell words right — not just to avoid corrections but to offer as much clarity as possible to the reader,” she wrote.” Once you start using misspelled words — even if they’re commonly accepted in the world of text messages and instant messages — you lose a segment of your audience that may not be as familiar with these words. “

Even Wired published a rebuttal to Trubek’s piece written by one of its own copy editors.

“What exactly is it about digital media that demands the abolition of spelling rules?” Lee Simmons wrote. “Are we saying that professional news sites should spell words in any way that strikes their mood or fancy?”

In her essay, Trubek asks: “Who shud tell us how to spel?” answering with, “Let’s make our own rules.”

But she also seems to undermine her own thesis: “Standardized spelling enables readers to understand writing, to aid communication and ensure clarity. Period.”

Indeed. That’s why accurate spelling matters.

Does spelling still matter to you? Log on to my new Toronto Star public editor Facebook page and let’s discuss.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2012-01-27,"The news from the town of Whitchurch-Stouffville, headlined in the top spot of the breaking news lineup on thestar.com’s home page Tuesday morning, declared: “Town council votes itself 43 per cent raise.”

Almost immediately, online commenters began to weigh in on news about the controversial pay hike debated for months throughout the town: “They have got to be kidding, a 43% raise,” said one. Echoed another, “What were they thinking, taking 43%.”

Not long after, reporter Kate Allen, who had filed this news to the web in haste, realized she had erred and misunderstood the actual numbers councillors had voted on. In fact, it was an 18.6 per cent raise for councillors and 16 per cent for the mayor. Allen informed her editor, Dave Beer, and the online story was changed. So too was the “updated” home page headline, which now told a different story altogether: “Whitchurch-Stouffville councillors back down on massive pay raise.”

If incorrect information is published online and subsequently changed, did a mistake actually occur? Should readers be told what was initially wrong? Or, in the digital news universe, do updates replace corrections?

Reader Val Dodge, who read the two online versions of the Star’s report — and sent me screen shots of both — told me he was “disturbed” the Star had not acknowledged the original error.

“I think it is incumbent upon the Star to openly acknowledge online errors, especially ones as egregious as this one,” Dodge said. “It may be acceptable to silently fix a misspelled word or misplaced punctuation, but silently changing a headline so that it means the exact opposite of its original wording is far beyond what I would consider acceptable.”

This reader is correct. What happened here was not acceptable.

The Star’s accuracy and corrections policy applies to all content on all platforms. It says that errors, in print or online, must be corrected clearly, promptly and prominently. It also states, “Building trust in the digital world demands that the Star is seen to be transparent.”

In this case, readers needed to be clearly informed in an online correction that the first report was wrong. As David Cash, CAO and town manager of Whitchurch-Stouffville, said in an email: “The town is very concerned about this error as it immediately generated a number of comments on the website that left people with incorrect information, which further perpetuated the error.”

I knew nothing of this until I received Dodge’s email. The original story had been changed in the newsroom and the public editor’s office was not informed — as we should have been.

For almost 40 years now, since the creation of its “Bureau of Accuracy” the Star’s public editor (long titled the ombudsman) has had responsibility for determining and publishing daily corrections.

Like much else that is necessarily changing as newspapers evolve to become fully digital, the Star’s centralized print-centric corrections process must also evolve to reflect the reality of 24/7 publishing in which every journalist in the newsroom can easily amend/fix/update/correct/publish online content.

Digital content is published, updated and amended (necessarily) around the clock. That means everyone in the newsroom must take responsibility for ensuring that the Star is as vigorous about correcting and acknowledging online errors as we have long been in print.

Star Editor Michael Cooke sent a note to the newsroom this week to make this clear to all.

In recent months, I’ve grown increasingly concerned about the Star’s level of transparency about online errors, having come across far too many examples of the newsroom “fixing” stories without acknowledging mistakes.

I know no one likes making mistakes. And certainly, some journalists are reluctant to own up to errors. But we owe it to our readers to be clear about what we’ve corrected online, lest we create confusion about what is accurate.

Not all journalists agree. Some contend that mistakes online are rectified when a story is republished with corrected information. They suggest that the very ease of online publishing means there is little more need for actual corrections that tell readers what was first wrong.

That’s not the view of reputable news organizations that understand the vital importance of credibility. I’ve spent considerable time learning about online corrections policies of various newsrooms around the world including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, NPR and the BBC.

The New York Times strives to correct and acknowledge online errors regardless of how little time the inaccurate information was online. “The policy is to correct and be transparent about what was corrected when an error is made regardless of whether it’s been online for five seconds, five minutes or five hours,” public editor Arthur Brisbane told an ombudsman conference last spring.

All the organizations I consulted share the conviction that transparency demands we should not “scrub” digital content, that is, just fix it and hope no one notices.

Because, of course, someone always notices.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2011-01-28,"Among the more comical mistakes published in the Star recently was a typo that transposed two letters in a word to turn the “marital bed” into the “martial bed.”

Many readers wondered if there was some sort of Freudian slip in misspelling “marital” as “martial” in the first paragraph of a Jan 18 article about the perils of adultery in the marriage bed.

“The bed they practised their martial arts in? Bed for a court martial? I can't believe an editor let THAT one slip by!” commented W.J.R. Halyn.

Why do journalists make such silly mistakes? How indeed does an error that jumps out at readers slip through the Star’s editing process?

In search of greater insight and understanding into these persistent reader questions, I turned to two recently published books that delve deeply into the psychology and philosophy of our innate fallibility: Why We Make Mistakes, by Joseph T. Hallinan, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist, and Being Wrong, by Kathryn Schulz, also an award-winning journalist.

Though neither of these journalists writes specifically about media errors, their compelling insights into the nature of human error help explain how mistakes are made and why being wrong is inevitable in any endeavour in which mere mortals are involved.

Journalists are well aware that typos, grammar gaffes, misspellings and inaccuracies mar a news organization’s credibility and annoy its readers. I know that most writers take great care to double-check their work and editors aim to catch errors before they are published.

But, who among us — journalist or reader — has not had the experience of checking our work and missing our mistakes?

Hallinan, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, tells us this is the human condition. His cites research indicating that even the most careful readers do not read every single letter, in every single word, in every single sentence.

That reality helps explains an error in his former newspaper that referred to a competition of British jesters who would be riding on unicorns. In fact, as the Journal’s subsequent correction noted, the clowns were to ride unicycles.

“For anyone interested in mistakes, the corrections columns of newspapers often make delicious reading,” he notes.

Unicorn, unicycle, marital, martial. All too often, it is all the same to the human eye.

“It’s tempting to attribute mistakes like this to simple carelessness,” Hallinan writes. The reality is more complex however. Most people skim and miss some details.

And, he adds, “the more skilled we are, the more likely we are to skim.” That explains why even highly skilled editors miss mistakes.

“We see only what we expect to see,” Hallinan says. “Overlooked mistakes are so common that researchers have given them their own designation: they are called ‘proofreader’s errors’

“These humdrum errors reveal some interesting quirks about the way human perception works. Perception, above all, is economical. We notice some things and not others.”

As well, as something becomes more familiar we tend to notice less, not more and “we come to see things not as they are but as (we assume) they ought to be.

“We are blinded by the effects of habit and hubris and hobbled by a poor understanding of our own limitations. We don’t see all that we observe, and yet we sometimes ‘see’ things we don’t know we’ve seen.”

Schulz expresses a similar idea about how we look but do not see in Being Wrong, an engaging philosophical examination of the inevitability of human error.

“To be blind without realizing our blindness is, figuratively the situation all of us are in when we are in error,” she writes.

If this is so, should we simply give up and accept the inevitability of what readers perceive to be journalistic carelessness?

Of course not. While typos rooted in human error may indeed be somewhat inevitable in any publication, we can aim to minimize them. Both of these writers contend we must understand our innate fallibility to devise better methods to see clearly and catch our mistakes.

“It helps to second-guess, to play devil’s advocate with yourself,” Hallinan writes. “We all think we are above average. In this conceit lies the seeds of many mistakes.”

Hallinan points to professions such a pilots and anesthesiologists that have minimized life-threatening “human error” by devising checklists that acknowledge the possibility of mistakes and enhance awareness of what can go wrong.

Similar measures in newsrooms include accuracy checklists and production systems that assure all copy is read over by fresh eyes before publication. The reality is that such measures are often skipped in the rush to deadline and mistakes make it into print.

To minimize human error, Schulz suggests we need to be humble and know that what can go wrong often will go wrong: “If we want to try to eradicate error, we have to start by assuming that it is inevitable.”

Indeed, mistakes happen.

Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2010-05-01,"“How did Céline Dion’s backyard merit a front-page photo,” reader Michelle Guilmette asked this week. “Is there nothing else newsworthy out there?”

The day before, reader Bill Archibald emailed to inquire why the Star had devoted time and space to the story of Ludwig the cat who went missing at Pearson airport. Why, he asked, is a lost cat news?

In any given week, readers of the Star are apt to ask some variation of the essential questions at the heart of those emails: What is news? Who decides what the Star pays attention to — and what it ignores. What runs on Page 1 and on the home page of thestar.com?

Readers are quick to weigh in on what the Star covers as well as what it doesn’t cover.

I often hear from those of you who are disappointed that the Star did not cover an event in which you have a particular interest. For example, this week a reader wondered why he could not find news about the Princess Patricia’s Regiment anniversary celebrations in the Star.

Another longtime reader, a 70-year-old man who told me he was sexually abused in his childhood, wrote an impassioned letter imploring the Star to provide more coverage of the serious questions raised in the final report (released last December) of Ontario’s public inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Cornwall.

The Oxford Canadian Dictionary defines news as “information about important or interesting recent events.” There’s broad scope in that for judgment about what is “important” — information you need to know — and what is “interesting” — stuff you might want to know.

Deciding what’s news is the core work of the media. As the renowned journalist and media critic Walter Lippman once said: “All the reporters in the world, working all the hours of the day, could not witness all the happenings in the world.”

Journalism is, by necessity, the art of selection, of deciding what matters and how to present that to audiences. While the Internet and the emergence of “citizen journalism” and social media have made it easier to connect and communicate within our global village, leading some to argue that journalism’s role as a “gatekeeper” is not necessary, there’s a case to be made that the barrage of accessible information makes the editor’s job of selection more vital.

The Star’s senior editors strive to provide a mix of what they believe readers need to know and what you might want to know. Clearly, on any given day, their news judgment won’t be in accord with that of all readers — or even all Star journalists. “Why is that news?” is a sentiment as apt to be expressed in the newsroom as in the public editor’s email box.

Indeed, such was the case with Thursday’s Page 1 play of Céline Dion’s $20 million new estate. For my part, I’m with reader Keung Lui who wrote: “I am happy for Céline and her 8-year-old son that they could afford a $20 million play house. But is this so-called news worth the front page of the Toronto Star? Don’t you have some real and more important news to report?”

How do journalists decide what is news? Is news simply determined by an editor’s whim, as expressed by the oft-cited cliché of the powerful editor who declares, “News is what I say it is.”

Textbook definitions of news that aim to teach aspiring journalists how to develop “news judgment” are of little practical use in the daily, and increasingly online, hourly, fray of deciding what’s news. For example, few editors ever consciously consider what one text tells us: “News is information about a break from the normal flow of events, an interruption in the unexpected” (practical translation: Dog bites man: not news. Man bites dog: news).

Stanley Walker, the famous editor of the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune defined news as the three W’s — “women, wampum and wrongdoing” (practical translation: sex, money and crime). That’s sexist, to be sure. How far off is it, though? Consider how those universal elements figure in many important and interesting news stories.

Journalism textbooks define the factors of newsworthiness as the impact of information on citizens, whether conflict and controversy are involved, timeliness, the prominence of those involved and proximity to the audience.

Novelty and oddity also factor in. Many successful editors, striving to appeal to readers, have long defined news as that which makes a reader say, “Gee whiz!”

For most journalists, deciding what’s news is instinctive, rooted in experience and their perceptions of what readers want. Practical factors such as space, reporting resources, the mix of hard news and softer features, the number of events competing for attention, as well as the availability of compelling photos to illustrate the news, are also at play.

All these theories aside, there is one overriding consideration that helps explain the daily puzzle of what is news: What’s newsworthy on a “slow news day” is far different than what you’ll read when a natural disaster happens or a parliamentary scandal breaks.

It’s a safe bet that Céline Dion’s water-park would not have made such a splash on the day a tsunami struck or there was a tidal wave of earth-shaking news.

257,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/opinion/public_editor/2009/11/07/english_in_defence_of_the_right_to_offend.html,English: In defence of the right to offend,"['Kathy English', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editorsat.', 'Nov.', 'Min. Read', 'Kathy Englishpublic Editor', 'Public Editor']",2009-11-07,"C olumnists occupy a privileged perch in journalism, having the freedom to express their opinions on issues that matter to them.

The considerable distinction between news reporting and columnists' opinions in the Star is often not clear to readers, however. That's sometimes because the Star doesn't clearly indicate when an article is an opinion column. But there's also much misunderstanding about the scope of Star columnists.

Simply put, news is the unbiased, fair reporting of facts, gathered and verified by reporters. Columns are expressions of opinions about facts.

Among the most frequent subjects of complaint to the public editor's office is that some columnist or another at the Star is ""biased,"" ""unobjective"" or ""unfair."" The reality is that opinion columnists can indeed be biased, unobjective and yes, sometimes, unfair.

That's the nature of opinion journalism. Opinion columns are a columnist's arguments for a particular point of view. And vigorous argument is not necessarily fair and balanced, as you should expect the news to be.

As Clark Hoyt, public editor of The New York Times, told me in an email discussion about whether public editors should weigh in on the fairness of opinion columns: ""I think it is virtually impossible to judge the `fairness' of arguments made by a newspaper or those it licenses to offer their own opinions.

""Argument is almost by definition unfair, in the sense that one marshalls facts to support a conclusion, emphasizing some and de-emphasizing or ignoring others. Someone who disagrees with the conclusion almost always thinks that has been done unfairly.""

Columnists at the Star have wide latitude in articulating their opinions and the manner in which they express their views – however outrageous those views may seem to some. If I had a loonie for every time a reader told me he or she considered an opinion column in the Star to be ""unfair"" or ""offensive,"" I could escape dreary November and be sunning on the Mediterranean right now.

Instead, I'm in Montreal today, attending the annual conference of the Canadian Media Lawyers Association, also called Ad IDEM – Advocates in Defence of Expression in the Media. I tell you this because the core mission of this organization – standing up for the Charter right of freedom of expression given to all Canadians – is at the heart of a newspaper columnist's right to express opinions that some may find offensive.

As Justice Ian Binnie said in last year's Supreme Court ruling on fair comment: ""We live in a free country where people have as much right to express outrageous and ridiculous opinions as moderate ones. ... Public controversy can be a rough trade and the law needs to accommodate its requirements.""

Star columnists are guided by these legal freedoms, which include the obligation that opinions expressed in columns be based on fact. Like all journalists, opinion columnists must also abide by laws regarding libel and hate speech.

Columnists speak for themselves, not the newspaper (the views of the Star are expressed on the editorial page). That doesn't mean ""anything goes.""

The Star's columnists are subject to editorial oversight and this news organization's ethical standards. It's not unusual for columnists to alter what they have to say, or the manner in which they say it, at the behest of astute editors offering wise second thought.

Still, I'm often asked: ""Why did the editor let that in the paper?""

My answer: Generally, editors give columnists wide latitude in expressing their personal opinions in recognition both of the right to freedom of expression and journalistic traditions of what makes for a compelling column.

As Poets, Pundits and Wits, a collection of newspaper columns, tells us, columnizing is a ""self-indulgent"" occupation, and columnists have licence to be ""rude, reckless, silly and prejudiced.""

That same view was expressed by the recently deceased William Safire in a note to the New York Times' A.M. Rosenthal when Rosenthal became a columnist: ""As you cultivate the garden of controversy, burn the bridges of objectivity. Show me an even-handed columnist and I'll show you an odds-on favourite soporific.""

It's the right and the role – arguably, even the responsibility – of columnists to poke and provoke, enrage and offend. In doing so, the best columnists can make us think and reach our own conclusions about issues that matter to us.

Readers often ask me to weigh in on the ""fairness"" of opinion columns. I don't think it's fair to offer my opinion on a columnist's opinion. I do tell these readers that they have the right to express dissenting opinions through letters to the editor or online comments.

Certainly, I don't always agree with the opinions published in the Star.

But, as a defender of the right to free expression, I must defend the right to offend.

Read', 'Leanne Delapspecial To The Star', 'Special To The Star', 'Leanne Delap Is A Toronto-Based Freelance Contributor For The Star', 'The Kit. Reach Her Via Email', 'Leannedelap Hotmail.Com']",2020-07-10,"Celebrities were a harmless, shiny distraction in the Before time, when showing off was still cool.

They were lifestyle deities gorging the Instagram beast on images of their private jets, lavish vacations and endless wardrobes. Then came the pandemic and celebrities in lockdown were suddenly just like us — albeit with more square footage and luxury amenities.

At first, that made the stars feel closer, more relatable. We watched the real-time dissolve of the Vaseline lens through which celebrities have presented themselves and their carefully branded images. We got to peek at their living rooms and visible roots, as sweats and masks became the new OOTD (outfit of the day, of course). Celebrity quarantine couples Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, and Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello seemed to have the paparazzi on speed dial to capture all the mundane coffee-run and dog-walking domesticity. Gigi Hadid’s and Zayn Malik’s lockdown pregnancy reveal qualified as major news, wiping the cringey Gal Gadot “Imagine” video off the radar.

“What happened to the reality stars? Well, every single major star in the world became a reality star,” says Roz Weston, co-host of Global’s “ET Canada” and morning co-host on Kiss 92.5, about the effect of the pandemic on celebrity newsgathering. “People were only used to seeing high-budget stars fake the ‘quote-unquote’ reality.”

The socially distanced celeb interviews Weston has been getting, he says, are “unfiltered, breaking rules that were never meant to be broken. Nobody would ever get to sit ‘alone’ with Sam Smith in his kitchen, talking about his nan. These are fantastic moments with people and I’ve been really shocked at the openness.”

That said, the Zoom cameras are carefully pointed away from the gold faucets, he adds: “Nobody wants you to know how rich they really are.”

Time and belief were suspended at first, in a blur punctuated by snippets of adorableness: Ina Garten posing with a giant martini for breakfast; Stanley Tucci’s viral Negroni tutorials; and fun celebrity moms Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner reading stories to children. Rihanna was in early with major giving through her family foundation and, to the delight of everyone, she enthusiastically joined in on virtual dance parties. Influencers, including Kylie Jenner at the behest of the U.S. Surgeon General, talked up public health responsibility with their followers.

But then, as the weeks dragged on, and our own financial worries and creeping unease grew, things began to rankle.

Madonna’s “COVID is the great equalizer” bathtub videos went clunk. We started to resent the sliver of pool cabana in the background and the exclusive retreats, such as the one in Wyoming where Kanye West, who made a surprise announcement of a 2020 presidential run, has a compound. Tucked away from the rising virus tide in L.A., his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, posted a tone-deaf pic last week bragging about her herd of 14 Friesian horses: you know, the ones with the extra long, extra silky manes. The post was greeted with a flurry of “People are dying, Kim” and “Please, Kim, I’m LITERALLY poor.”

Without the usual insulated layers of handlers and entourage, stars can and do get it wrong. The system had already been changing, Weston says. “Shows like ours used to be the only place for celebrities to promote their projects or to address their scandals. Now social media is a direct pipeline. That said, they are giving us lots of content that way right now, by both making mistakes and getting it right.”

To follow the whiplash, it is first necessary to decode the confusing climate of call-out and cancel culture fomented by social media. In looking at the effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on celebrity culture, it’s necessary to consider also the long-term, mood-altering effect of the Black Lives Matter movement on the entertainment industry.

The protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis highlighted the economic and social inequities laid bare by the quarantine. The pandemic will end, but the BLM movement is a turning point. Thus we have an entertainment universe that had to make two sharp pivots in a row.

Sonia Beeksma moved from Vancouver in January to take up a post as an entertainment reporter on CTV’s “eTalk.” She says everyone is watching which celebrities are using their platforms to speak up politically, especially throughout the Black Lives Matter movement. “There is a change in the way people operate now, people are choosing a completely different path; something happened within their core: it is very powerful right now.”

Elaine “Lainey” Lui is a co-host on “eTalk,” as well as a host on CTV’s “The Social” and founder of the popular website Lainey Gossip, launched in 2003. “ I do agree that especially during this time where we are collectively protesting injustice and anti-Black racism, there is space to be candid in terms of self-reflection,” she said. “When it is done right and well, it can be very effective and necessary. Allyship is not perfect. But in those mistakes, we are exposing vulnerability and humanity.”

The pundits are not immune to the whiplash of call-out culture: Lui’s colleague at “eTalk,” Ben Mulroney, stepped aside from co-hosting to make room for more diverse voices in the aftermath of his wife Jessica’s white-privilege scandal. Lui herself made her own amends for decades-old Lainey Gossip posts from the early 2000s (including one about Janet Jackson calling her outfit “ghetto”). In her blog and on “The Social,” she stated: “Those posts were racist, they were misogynistic, they were homophobic, they were transphobic, they were shameful. I am so sorry.”

The online mood has sharply shifted and social media is no longer a celebrity playground for inducing envy or pitching products mindlessly. Lesser mortals have been eaten alive by the fires of social media, but the Kardashians have until now created an impermeable shield around themselves. They are still relevant in the business world: Kim Kardashian-West inked a recent deal with Coty to take her makeup empire to billion-dollar valuation, moments after husband West announced a 10-year megadeal with the Gap for a Yeezy collaboration.

The Kardashian way has been the opposite of vulnerability. The reality royal family had been notably quiet in the first three months of quarantine and revolution, tooling down their massive promotional machines to a tread-water setting, a.k.a. a smattering of thirst-trap bikini shots by the pool. There was a brief scandal around Kylie Jenner’s downgrade from billionaire by Forbes. Then there was Khloe Kardashian’s perplexingly “changed” face; her face did look dramatically different, launching a flurry of speculation by plastic surgery pundits.

The Kardashian-Jenner machine invented the prevailing modalities of modern fame: bod-revealing, made-for-Instagram photo shoots; attention-grabbing romantic sagas, sex tapes and cheating scandals; fluffed-up feuds within the family and with other celebrities. The clan created an entire aspirational beauty and fashion esthetic (and the products to get the look at home). One day, we will look back at the decade from 2010 till the start of the pandemic and a Kardashian-bot will come up on Google.

But won’t we somehow be essentially changed by this moment? Post-pandemic, after so much death and fear and reckoning, with the economic fallout and the lasting effects of prolonged isolation, amid the clamour for social justice: if we are different on the inside, won’t we want to look different on the outside, too?

The backlash may have started to reflect this. Actress and activist Jameela Jamil called out Kardashian-West recently over another throwback the personality posted of herself in an extreme waist-training corset by couturier Mr Pearl that she had worn to the 2019 Met Gala. A year later, the unnatural ideal it represented feels hopelessly out of sync.

Jamil, who heads an anti-body-shaming campaign called @i_weigh, has been all over the Kardashians for years for their promotion of an “impossible” body image and the negative effects that has on regular women and girls. Jamil switched advocacy tactics this time, saying that Kardashian-West was “just so harmed and deluded into thinking this is what SHE needs to look like to be special and beautiful and she’s spilling it out onto her following.”

By bringing in sympathy for Kardashian, Jamil wisely tried to change the timbre of the conversation, but until Kardashian-West and her sisters accept the responsibility of their outsized influence on their followers, the effort may fall on tone-deaf ears.

As other stars heed collective pressure to be more thoughtful in this time of all-around reckoning, will the Kardashian fame-shield hold? Resistance is futile, says Weston. “From certain people, we accept the esthetics are fixed. For Kim Kardashian-West, the esthetics are her entire world,” he says. “I don’t think she needed to show up ‘undone’ on social (during the pandemic) to prove, ‘Oh my God I’m just like you!’”

Beeksma says it’s all about business for the famous family. “We all know they are not in this business to change the world for the better. The train the Kardashians are on, they are businesswomen, they are their brand.” She is practical about their reach, though. “Their esthetic seems to be waning … But let’s be honest, they have millions and millions of followers, so someone wants that content.”

Weston thinks some of the flashier lifestyles of the rich and famous will come back sooner, rather than later. “It’s all about escapism. Guilty pleasures are important: we can’t worry all the time.”

“As for reality stars, I can’t say (the phenomenon) is ever gonna go away,” says Lui. “Nor do I want it to! When lockdown ends and red carpets can be walked again and premieres attended again, I don’t know that we can say the trend of flaunt is over.

“I will say — and this is not a defence of celebrity — the illusion of Hollywood, the lure from the very beginning, the reason superstars exist, is that they live in our imaginations in a world of fantasy, a land of dreams and fairy tales.”

We want them to live there, says Lui. “I’m in the business because I never want them to go away, not only because I think art and culture is necessary but because, through celebrities, we learn about ourselves.”

Athleisure and sneaker culture are appealing, especially while we are all at home, but “red carpets will absolutely happen again. And if it takes too long, celebrities will start wearing cocktail gowns to the grocery store,” she says.

The show, after all, must go on.

Read', 'Olivia Hornthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Olivia Hornthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"When Ellie Goulding finally finished promoting her 2015 album, “Delirium,” the exhausted British pop singer and songwriter took a step back to enjoy time at home. The break, tacked onto the long tail of “Delirium,” amounted to a five-year gap between LPs — an eternity for an in-demand artist, particularly one who delivered her first three records in roughly the same span.

She began preparing to re-enter the spotlight after getting married last fall. “I was super fit, I had a good routine and I thought, now is really the right time for me, mentally, to take this on again,” she said. The pandemic, of course, foiled her plans.

Goulding, 33, has spent the past few months sequestered in a cottage just outside Oxford with her husband, art dealer Caspar Jopling. Preparing to release her new album, “Brightest Blue,” on July 17 has consisted largely of nerve-racking livestreams with shoddy Wi-Fi and existential questions about the future of her industry. “I’m worried that people are going to get used to seeing their favourite artists at home and they’re not going to want to go back to music venues,” she said.

She’s still eager to bring fans “Brightest Blue,” an album that shows Goulding’s range, bouncing between feature-laden pop-radio fodder and softer, more inward-facing ballads. Even more varied is her list of 10 cultural must-haves, which brings together mementos from her grunge days with recent film festival darlings and, of course, Kate Bush.

Goulding broke from her routines of practising yoga, writing and honing her air-guitar skills to chat about her picks over Zoom. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

1. “Kalimankou Denkou,” by the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir

Someone played it in a studio session and I was immediately transfixed. It was a cathartic thing where it kind of took over my body. I’m inspired by so many different singers, but this felt much deeper than that — like the first time I heard Björk, or Lisa Gerrard in Dead Can Dance, or Cocteau Twins. I thought I knew how a choir was supposed to sound, traditionally. And then this is a whole other technique of singing. It’s just otherworldly and I like anything that makes me feel like I’m not on this planet.

2. “Kate Bush Radio” on Spotify

I’ve always been a fan of Kate Bush, since I was a teenager. I think she was doing something that no one else was doing at the time, when she was making songs like “Running Up That Hill” and even earlier than that: writing these weird ballads that might not have made much sense.

I said “Kate Bush Radio” because I can’t deny that I’m an avid user of music streaming platforms. Why wouldn’t I be? It’s just the most incredible playlist of female artists: Caroline Polachek from Chairlift, Roísín Murphy, Cocteau Twins, Weyes Blood. I love Weyes Blood so much. “Seven Words” is one of my favourite songs of all time. Joni Mitchell, PJ Harvey, Björk. I don’t think you can get better than that.

3. “Two Thousand and Seventeen,” by Four Tet

Four Tet’s been the vibe for quarantine. We put this song on a couple of weeks ago when we went for our first long drive, once we were allowed to go to beauty spots. There was something kind of strange and apocalyptic about driving through the mountains on the first day that we were allowed to go beyond our house and our village. The song just has this sense of unknowing and mysteriousness to it.

4. “Rage Against the Machine,” from Rage Against the Machine

I first heard Rage when I went to my sister’s boyfriend’s house. He was in a band and his brother was in a band, and I fell madly in love with his brother. That was the first time I wanted to play guitar, when I heard Tom Morello playing on “Know Your Enemy.” All my friends had gotten into a grunge phase of Nirvana and Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, and I went a bit further. I got called a goth quite a lot because I had this long black hair and I had my lip pierced. And, no, Nirvana wasn’t enough for me; I needed something more political.

I could win in an air-guitar competition if it was Rage Against the Machine. I promise you. I can’t play them, but I can air guitar the (expletive) out of them.

5. “Capernaum”

This is one of those films where you have to confront every single reality of it — as opposed to last night, when I was watching “Sleepless in Seattle” by myself, drinking Prosecco. This one I watched on a recommendation that I saw online; I think maybe it was Cate Blanchett talking about it. All I knew was that it was based in Lebanon, that it was a female director and that it was about a kid that wanted to sue his parents for giving him life. That’s all I needed to want to watch it.

God, it’s a beautiful film. It makes you forget every single tiny inconvenience in your life. It makes you sad, but it puts a fire in you, makes you want to be a bit more of an activist — and I think it’s really important to watch those things.

6. “Pain and Glory”

I’ve always loved (Pedro) Almodovar’s films. There’s always such an honesty to the characters and you really get to know them in quite an intimate way. But also they’re kind of quirky and dark-humoured, and entertaining enough for you to not be put off by how dark the themes can be. I pick up so many ideas from them.

7. Yung Pueblo

I am careful about who I follow (on social media). That’s not to say I only follow things that I know I will like, because I think that can be quite dangerous, but I do try to follow things that keep my brain in the right place for songwriting. So, for example, (poet and author) Yung Pueblo: he always just bloody knows what to say. He’s preoccupied with the idea that you find love in yourself first before you find love with someone else. “True power is living the realization that you are your own healer, hero and leader.” I very much believe in that.

8. “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys,” by Viv Albertine

She just has such an interesting life. She was one of the first punk rockers and had to endure so many other egotistical male-fronted punk bands. She was around them all: Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious, and members of the Clash like Paul Simonon — who, weirdly, is my next-door neighbour. She talks about how sexy he is and so, any time he walks out of his door, I start blushing because I think about her describing him in the book.

I love the idea of ’70s London. My dad was in a punk band and my mom was a bit of a punk, so I’m fascinated by that era. But also, “music, music, music; boys, boys, boys; clothes, clothes, clothes” — that is me, really.

9. “Climate Justice,” by Mary Robinson

I work for the UN as an environmental goodwill ambassador. I talk a lot about climate change to my fans. A lot of people say, “What can I read? How can I learn about this? I want to know more.” I would say this is a really great book to start.

It talks about how she went around the world to understand the people at the forefront of climate change. Basically, the poorest people in the world are the ones that are affected the most and those communities are the ones doing the most about it, which is just very ironic to me.

10. “Untitled” by Julie Mehretu

This is one of the first serious pieces of art I bought. I have a small kitchen and it’s kind of the focal point of the room. She uses graphic techniques and layers parts of maps. It ends up being this mystical, magical map of somewhere.",[]

Read', 'Ashley Spencerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Ashley Spencerthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Two years ago, Michele Morrone was working as a gardener in a tiny northern Italian village. Newly divorced, broke and severely depressed, he had given up on his TV acting career after being repeatedly told that he was too attractive for the roles on offer.

“In Italy, if you’re a good-looking guy you’re not an actor,” he said matter-of-factly. “You’re just someone good-looking.”

But after five months toiling alongside cows and chickens, he got a call from his agent that a team of Polish filmmakers wanted to offer him the role of a Mafia boss in the erotic thriller “365 Days,” a part that required someone Italian and very good-looking.

“I woke up, called my gardening boss and said: ‘I’m not coming in today. My stomach doesn’t feel good,’” the 29-year-old father of two recalled. He boarded a plane to Poland and his life hasn’t been the same since.

Despite a zero per cent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “365 Days,” directed by Barbara Bialowas and Tomasz Mandes, quickly became a viral sensation when it arrived on Netflix worldwide June 7, following a successful theatrical run in Poland and a limited British release earlier this year.

Scripted in English with occasional subtitled Polish and Italian, the dicey plot clearly didn’t deter viewers: the Sicilian Mafia boss Massimo (Morrone) kidnaps the unsuspecting Laura (Polish newcomer Anna-Maria Sieklucka) and gives her one year to fall in love with him before he’ll free her from his palatial lair.

Amid a growing backlash, critics say it glorifies rape culture and Stockholm syndrome. Fans say it’s been unfairly maligned. What isn’t in dispute is that nearly a month after its streaming debut and with seemingly no promotion, the film remains among Netflix’s Top 10 most watched titles in the United States and other countries, including Australia, Britain, Brazil, France, Spain and India.

Based on the first in a bestselling trilogy of Polish novels by Blanka Lipinska, “365 Days” leans heavily into travel porn, wealth porn and soft-core actual porn, apparently an appealing combination in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis when many viewers have been at home for months on end.

“In a way, it was almost custom-made for pandemic viewing: beautiful people having exotic sex in opulent settings,” said Caetlin Benson-Allott, an associate professor at Georgetown University and an expert on movie viewing habits.

There’s plenty of (simulated) carnality to ogle in the film’s 114 minutes. And since Netflix defines a view as watching a mere two minutes of a title, it’s impossible to know if a majority of viewers watched the full movie or skipped to the more tantalizing scenes.

Teenagers on TikTok were some of the first to spread word of “365 Days” by filming themselves reacting to the sex scenes with a mix of shock and admiration. “I did not expect this kind of movie to be on Netflix; maybe, like, late-night HBO,” Noah Holifield, an 18-year-old Chicagoan whose reaction video has more than 2.6 million views, said in an interview.

Some joke that they too would like to be kidnapped by Massimo, and his catchphrase “Are you lost, baby girl?” is now a meme set to music in which the users eagerly respond, “Yes, daddy!”

Some of the criticism of “365 Days” echoes that of the “50 Shades of Grey” trilogy, another campy book-to-movie slice of erotica featuring a wealthy, powerful man and BDSM. Benson-Allott said the outright dismissal of both franchises was the byproduct of the United States being “still a very puritanical country in a lot of ways.”

“We frown on pornography and judge people for enjoying erotic fiction,” she added.

But it’s hard to ignore that the entire premise of “365 Days” is problematic. Variety’s review blasted the film’s “two flavours of misogyny” and its suggestion “that consent can be obtained retroactively,” while the feminist website Jezebel lamented “how quickly depraved abduction turns to cookie-cutter fairy tale.”

In an open letter to Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings, made public July 2, Welsh singer Duffy — who earlier this year opened up about her own experience being drugged, kidnapped and raped — asked the platform to remove the title, writing, “This should not be anyone’s idea of entertainment, nor should it be described as such, or be commercialized in this manner.”

The streaming service wouldn’t comment for this article, while Morrone emphasized that the story was pure fantasy and that he “would never encourage or want anyone to fall in love with their captor in real life.”

But Goali Saedi Bocci, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Psychology Today, warned against dismissing the issues on the basis of fiction.

“There is clearly quite a bit of misunderstanding about sexual consent and assault” in real life, Bocci said, “and such films only continue to muddy the waters.” The danger is that men and women “can be victims of sexual assault, rape, molestation and not even recognize it as such.

“We have to be extra cautious of the media we consume because, like it or not, these things get into our subconscious,” she said.

Still, the film has racked up fans, as evidenced by Morrone’s Instagram account, which has skyrocketed from fewer than 200,000 followers in January to more than seven million at the end of June. On a night out while visiting Berlin, he was mobbed by German teenagers clamouring for selfies. It’s an unexpected turn for the son of a construction worker and housekeeper who paints, dances (he was a runner-up on the 2016 season of Italy’s “Dancing With the Stars”), plays guitar, sings and writes his own extremely personal music, like a song about his 2018 divorce from Lebanese fashion designer Rouba Saadeh.

After four of his tracks were featured in “365 Days,” Universal Music Group signed him to a global record deal and he’s working on a second album while fielding scripts from Hollywood and Europe. But first, with “365 Days” ending on a cliffhanger and two books still to go in the series, he’ll soon reprise his career-making role in a sequel that will film when pandemic restrictions are lifted.

He teased, “The story is going to be very, very interesting.”

Read', 'Derrick Bryson Taylorthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Derrick Bryson Taylorthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-10,"Netflix announced Thursday that “The Crown,” its hit drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, would film a sixth and final season, months after saying the series would come to a close with Season 5.

Peter Morgan, the writer and creator of “The Crown,” said that the possibility of a reversal was raised during the show’s planning process.

“As we started to discuss the story lines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons,” Morgan said in a statement. “To be clear, Series 6 will not bring us any closer to present day — it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail.”

In January, Morgan said that the show’s fifth season was the “perfect time and place to stop” and that Netflix and Sony supported him in the decision.

The show debuted in 2016, with Claire Foy playing a young, newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II in the first two seasons, and focused on the early years of the monarch’s reign and her family’s drama during those years.

In November, Netflix released the third season, starring Olivia Colman as the queen in the 1960s and ’70s. The season follows the queen as she navigates Britain’s political and economic issues, as well as numerous problems with family members, including her two eldest children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

A release date has not yet been announced for the fourth season, which will again feature Colman as the queen, and revisit her reign through Margaret Thatcher’s premiership and Prince Charles’ relationship with Princess Diana. Colman will then pass the crown to Imelda Staunton for the fifth season.

The streaming service announced last week that in the fifth instalment Lesley Manville would take over the role of Princess Margaret, who was played in the first two seasons by Vanessa Kirby, and by Helena Bonham Carter in the third and fourth.

“We can’t wait for audiences to see the upcoming fourth season,” said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix, “and we’re proud to support Peter’s vision and the phenomenal cast and crew for a sixth and final season.”

She said in a statement that the show was “raising the bar” for each new season.

With its high-profile cast, precise period detail and gilded settings, “The Crown” has also drawn steep bills. It has cost Netflix nearly $150 million (U.S.), about twice as much as the royal family costs British tax payers each year.

Morgan compared the production process to making a movie, as opposed to a serialized drama. Before the pandemic, a team of researchers convened at Morgan’s home once a week, helping weave together story lines for script meetings with documents, transcripts and press clippings they had collected.

There is an expectation to “deliver TV on an annual basis,” he said. “But what we’re making now is feature-film-quality stuff, and no one ever expected you to make 10 feature films a year — because you’d die.”",[]

John Travolta’s front yard has an airstrip suitable for Boeing. Lady Gaga has a bowling alley. Michael Jordan has an infinity pool with floating grass island. Paris Hilton’s $300,000 doghouse is bigger than my semi. Celine Dion once had a water park with twin slides. Kim Kardashian has a walk-in fridge.

Imagine getting lost while searching for mayo.

But there are exceptions to every rule. Some celebrities are so down to earth, they do not covet a spire in the sky. Some are so comfortable in their own skin, they do not yearn for a petting zoo. Some are free spirits who feel no urge to flaunt the trappings of material excess, especially during a pandemic.

Why, some have no problem using a bathroom that would make a hobo gag.

Demi Moore has a new podcast, “Dirty Diana.” The six-part scripted drama is described as a “show for all of us who are craving connection and searching for a new kind of erotica.” If that’s your thing, you weirdo, the podcast starts Monday.

To plug the project, Moore recently shared two photos on Instagram. And now I’m finding it hard to care about this fictional Diana. I’m too distracted by the real Dirty Demi.

In the snaps, Moore is wearing headphones and army boots. She is plopped on a shabby, floral-print sofa unfit for the Queen’s servants. Based on the MacBook and tablet script display, this is her podcasting studio. But hang on. A few feet away, in the background, is that a toilet? Does this lavatory have wall-to-wall shag carpeting, circa 1976, in the shade of excrement? Is the faucet cabinet cluttered with products and creepy dolls and what appears to be a plastic severed hand holding a sun hat?

Or is that a mushroom lamp? All I know is the serial killer vibe is strong.

But not as strong as the gross energy.

Broadloom in the restroom? That’s not retro decor — it’s a germ factory. A life-sized Joan of Arc statue staring down as you soak in the tub? That’s just spooky. Why does this bathroom have a door to the outside? Why is there a toy monkey squished into the tacky bricks? And when Bruce Willis was in lockdown with his ex a few months back, did he sit on that toilet and talk to that plush simian?

The train is leaving the station. Yippee-ki-yay, little monkey.

This is not a place to do your business — it’s the stuff of nightmares and cognitive dissonance.

Live and let live, that’s my motto. But today I’m changing it to: MAKE A DECISION. Dirty Demi? Make a decision: living room or bathroom? It can’t be both because that’s disgusting. Look at yourself. You’re wearing cropped overalls and podcasting with a beaming smile a few feet away from where someone just did No. 2. Do you think Bill Gates built Microsoft with his elbow on a urinal? How are we supposed to listen to “Dirty Diana” when we know it rumbled to life inside a biohazard lab?

Did Ashton Kutcher get all of the interior design books and ceramic tile in the divorce? Are your dining chairs bidets? Are your bookshelves lined with Charmin? Do you sleep in a shower stall? Does the family room have a beach towel nailed to the wall instead of a flat-screen TV?

Now that Netflix has rebooted “Unsolved Mysteries,” it should investigate these photos.

Dirty Demi is podcasting from a carpeted washroom. That’s like woodworking in the kitchen or doing jumping jacks on the roof. Am I overreacting? Probably! But I’m a germaphobe smack dab in the middle of a pandemic and seeing dated upholstery hug the base of a crapper is giving me the heebie-jeebies. You know what else? On the sink, I see a tube of moisturizer. I see a bottle of alkaline artesian water imported from New Zealand. BUT I DON’T SEE ANY SOAP!

I swear to God, if I knew Moore’s address in Idaho, I’d board a plane in my haz-mat suit and go rescue that MacBook, perched on a makeshift basket stand atop a rustic coffee table in the haze of a million filthy microbes. Poor laptop. Then I’d line Moore and her daughters against the garage and hose them down with Purell. Then I’d board up that podcasting loo and put a Porta Potty in the driveway.

Read', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"For years, Godfred Addai-Nyamekye felt like he was alone in his trauma after being a victim of police violence in Calgary.

“Three years ago, four years ago, I was in the wilderness, screaming by myself,” Addai-Nyamekye says in a phone interview.

As Addai-Nyamekye explains in the documentary “Above the Law,” debuting Saturday on “CBC Docs POV” and CBC Gem, police officers in the city unlawfully detained him when his car got stuck in the snow in December 2013.

He says they drove him to a remote location and abandoned him in minus 28 Celsius weather in the middle of the night.

After calling 911 for help, Addai-Nyamekye says he was Tasered and assaulted by a constable who chided him for calling the emergency line.

He was left in so much pain he could barely stand and with post-traumatic stress disorder that continues to this day.

Addai-Nyamekye was charged with assaulting a police officer in the incident but was later acquitted after a judge saw video, taken from a police helicopter, showing him being beaten and dragged while handcuffed through the snow by an officer.

He got no compensation, but amid the release of the documentary and a global movement against systemic racism and police brutality, he says he’s happy to finally see some attention on cases like his.

“It’s about time that we let Canadians know that these kind of issues are out here, police brutality is out here, injustice is out here, discrimination: everything is out here,” says Addai-Nyamekye, who was born in Ghana.

“Whatever issues are in the States are out here. And it’s about time that we sit back and look at all these issues, and we address them.”

“Above the Law” explores three cases of excessive force involving the Calgary Police Service, including that of Anthony Heffernan, who was Tasered and shot to death by an officer during a wellness check in a hotel room in March 2015.

The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) initially found there were grounds to charge the officer with a criminal offence, but the Crown later determined a conviction was unlikely and no charges would be laid.

Also featured is the May 2015 arrest of the late Daniel Haworth, whose family says he suffered brain damage from being punched and thrown to the ground while handcuffed. Haworth died of a drug overdose several months later.

Const. Trevor Lindsay, the same officer involved in Addai-Nyamekye’s case, was convicted of aggravated assault on Haworth in June 2019.

According to the filmmakers, Lindsay spent two and a half years on relief from duty with pay while he was awaiting trial. He is now relieved from duty without pay and remains free while he awaits sentencing. He’s expected to appeal his conviction.

“I think in Canada, for a very long time we’ve been acting under the presumption that these are American problems,” says Marc Serpa Francoeur, who co-directed the documentary with Robinder Uppal.

“We’re so inundated with American media and films, and we watch American court cases, all this stuff, but I don’t think we look internally enough.”

Serpa Francoeur says they embarked on the film five years ago and looked into systemic policing issues and accountability mechanisms on the force and on a provincial level.

But he notes: “These problems are not endemic to Calgary.”

“We need to have confidence that officers are being held to account by what is required of them on a legislative level by the Police Act, what is required of them by criminal law,” Serpa Francoeur says.

“There are too many instances where you’re looking at a lot of double standard.”

Addai-Nyamekye has launched several formal complaints about his case, and a lawsuit against Lindsay, the other officers and the Crown prosecutors — none of which have been resolved.

He wonders what his fate would have been if the helicopter had not been around to shoot video that exonerated him.

Addai-Nyamekye wants to see police including Lindsay be held accountable for their actions, and members of the force to undergo more training than the current period of six months.

“I want to see more transparency in that police force,” he says. “I want to see a more multicultural police force, not just white.”

Before the incident, Addai-Nyamekye was a “go-getter” with no health issues, he says.

But after, he faced hefty legal and therapy bills, and was unable to work. He wound up homeless, sleeping on friends’ couches, for six months.

“It’s been a terrible journey, in terms of going back to the scene and having all these bad memories come back, flashbacks and PTSD,” Addai-Nyamekye says.

But he’s hopeful the documentary will shed some light on police brutality and injustices.

And he feels a duty to talk publicly about his experience.

“I’m a victim and I’m a living testimony,” Addai-Nyamekye says. “If I don’t speak up, who else is going to speak up?”

Read', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Andrew Daltonthe Associated Pressfri.']",2020-07-10,"Authorities planned Friday to renew the search for “Glee” star Naya Rivera, who is believed to have drowned in a Southern California lake while boating with her four-year-old son.

Rivera, 33, disappeared after renting the pontoon boat for three hours Wednesday afternoon and taking it out on Lake Piru in Ventura County, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday.

The lake an hour’s drive from Los Angeles was searched by dozens of people, most of them divers, with help from helicopters, drones and all-terrain vehicles. The search to recover Rivera’s body continued into the night Thursday before ending for that day.

The area where the boat was found is about nine metres deep. Murky waters heavy with plants made it difficult for divers to see more than about a foot ahead of them, sheriff’s Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said Thursday.

“If the body is entangled on something beneath the water, it may never come back up,” Donoghue said.

Rivera played Santana Lopez, a singing cheerleader in 113 episodes of the musical-comedy “Glee,” which aired on Fox from 2009 until 2015. She also had recurring roles on “The Bernie Mac Show” and “The Royal Family.”

Rivera, a Los Angeles resident, had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, Donoghue said.

Surveillance video taken at about 1 p.m. Wednesday shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.

When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn’t, according to a sheriff’s office statement.

The boy was wearing a life vest and another life-jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera’s purse and identification.

Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.

The boy, Rivera’s son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.

She called the boy, her only child, “my greatest success, and I will never do any better than him” in her 2016 memoir “Sorry Not Sorry.”

The most recent tweet on Rivera’s account, from Tuesday, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.

It appeared increasingly likely she would become the third major cast member from the show to die in their 30s.

Co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.

Cory Monteith, one of the show’s leads, died at 31 in 2013 from a toxic mix of alcohol and heroin.

Rivera was engaged to rapper Big Sean in 2013, but their relationship ended a year later. The pair met on Twitter and collaborated musically, with the rapper appearing on Rivera’s debut single “Sorry.” She married Dorsey a few months later.",[]

Animation crew works from home to finish ‘Ron’s Gone Wrong’

Hanging under blankets for audio soundproofing and working around patchy home Wi-Fi, a London animation studio is following the British motto of “keep calm and carry on” during the coronavirus pandemic to complete its first feature film in time for Disney’s planned release early next year.

Some 270 crew members have been working from home on “Ron’s Gone Wrong” in a reimagined production process that Locksmith co-founder Sarah Smith calls a logistical “nightmare.”

Most of the crew is remotely connecting to their office workspaces for digital modelling, rigging, animation and lighting. Editors then assemble the remote work, in some cases with temporarily out-of-sync audio.

“Looking at the stuff in edit was the hardest thing because it was out of sync and with your brain trying to figure out the fine timing of an edit, which in animation is super precise,” Smith said.

Locksmith had been in production on the film for more than two years before the pandemic hit.

The film is set in a world in which talking robots have become children’s best friends. For one 11-year-old boy, things don’t go according to plan when his bot malfunctions.

Voice actors have been unable to record in formal studios during the lockdown. The lead child star had to tell his grandfather to turn off the television and his mother to go offline to conserve home internet bandwidth for a remote recording session, Smith said.",[]

Capturing history: Everyday snapshots tell the story of Canada’s LGBTQ people

Toronto’s culture is nothing without Black artists. But the predominantly white art world is part of the obstacle

As one of the few Black theatre leaders in Toronto, for Weyni Mengesha systemic racism is nothing new",[]
273,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2020/07/09/the-chicks-are-done-caring-what-people-think.html,The Chicks are done caring what people think,"['Amanda Hess', 'Ahamanda Hessthe New York Timesthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Amanda Hessthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Amanda Hessthe New York Timesthu.']",2020-07-09,"The women formerly known as the Dixie Chicks have survived the good old boys of country music, a legal battle with their record label, a feud with a president and arguably the first attempted cancellation of the internet era.

As they plotted their comeback — writing their first album together in 14 years — they decided to have a little bit of fun with their reputation. So they called up restaurants across America with menu items named after the band.

The Chicks — they dropped the “Dixie” last month — huddled around the phone as their producer, Jack Antonoff, quizzed establishments about the conceptual underpinnings of their Dixie Chicken sandwiches, with their “unapologetically spicy” mayonnaises and “controversial” sauces. “They’re known for hating men,” one hostess explained. Antonoff asked her if he would be safer ordering a lunch associated with jingoistic country star Toby Keith instead.

“The Toby Keith sandwich,” the Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines, 45, said, “had a glowing description.”

When the Chicks retell the story of the great sandwich prank, they are thousands of kilometres apart — Maines patched into a Zoom call from Los Angeles, Martie Maguire from Austin, Texas, and Emily Strayer from San Antonio — but they are speaking as one, piling onto one another’s sentences and leaning close into their webcams, as if they’re all drawing from some central power source.

It has been 17 years since their lives blew up and now they have sufficient distance from what they call “the incident” that they can peer down at the wreckage and laugh. By the time they get to Keith, Strayer and Maguire are softly giggling and Maines is tossing her head back, scream-laughing.

In 2003, if you’ve forgotten, U.S. troops invaded Iraq and Maines offhandedly told a London audience, “We’re ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.” The comment sparked a country radio boycott, album-burning rallies and a squabble with Keith, who staged concerts in front of an oversize doctored photo of Maines embracing Saddam Hussein. The Chicks appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly nude, with some of the names they’d been called printed on their bodies.

“The incident” also presaged the coming tide of celebrity activism, social-media cancellation and political harassment campaigns. But even as they were cast out of Nashville, Tenn., the Chicks entered the pop stratosphere and, within a few years, they were the stars of a redemptive documentary, winners of a Grammy sweep and keepers of a kind of superpower — what Maines calls “a true ability to not care.”

For 14 years, they cared so little about the music industry that America’s bestselling female band of all time did not release any albums of new songs. They had made “Taking the Long Way,” the smash 2006 album that rebutted their smearing by country music, inside a pressure cooker.

“The stakes were so high,” Strayer, 47, said. “This song had to be perfect; this line had to be just so.” When it was over, “I was tired,” Maines said. “I just wanted to raise my kids.”

In the years since, the Chicks dabbled in side projects: Maines released a solo album, “Mother,” and Strayer and Maguire wrote two albums together as the Court Yard Hounds. It was as if, by scattering their powers, they were working in a kind of stealth mode, making music under the pop radar. When I asked Strayer what was different about playing without Maines, she joked: “Probably the success of it.”

There’s just something spellbinding about these three women singing as one. Their harmony is totemic; it is a sonic representation of sisterhood. (It helps that Strayer and Maguire are actually sisters.) In an industry that’s never really loved them or defended them, they became a testament to female self-reliance. They move with the energy of witches who could not be burned. If you were already a fan of the Chicks, the incident made you love them harder, seeding their pop-feminist anthems with real-life gravitas.

In the time that the Chicks have been gone, they have not been forgotten. They have become a touchstone for some of the biggest women in pop: when Beyoncé played her stomping “Lemonade” track “Daddy Lessons” at the 2016 Country Music Association Awards, the Chicks were right behind her, drawling “Texas.” And when Taylor Swift needed backup on her hyper-emotional “Lover” ballad “Soon You’ll Get Better,” she leaned on the voices of the Chicks.

When “Gaslighter” was released in March, it sent fans scrambling to decode its seemingly autobiographical clues. One particularly evocative line — “Boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat” — instantly converted Chicks supporters into a squad of maritime sleuths. They noted that the Chicks had written the album, also called “Gaslighter,” as Maines weathered a stormy divorce from her estranged husband — an estranged husband who just so happened to have possessed a boat, the Nautalee, named after his wife.

Last summer, Maines’ ex petitioned a court to hand over the songs, arguing that they could violate a confidentiality clause in the couple’s pre-nuptial agreement. The music was saved — “Gaslighter” will be released on July 17 — but since the divorce was settled in December, the Chicks have been markedly silent on any real-life sources of inspiration for the album. Their lyrics, however, are talking. On a salty bop called “Tights on My Boat,” Maines further clarifies the ship situation: “You can tell the girl who left her tights on my boat that she can have you now.”

Before “Gaslighter,” Maines was mired in an uninspiring songwriting period — “Mother” was mostly covers — but suddenly she had much to say. “I was going through a lot of things personally, so I had a lot to write about,” she said.

The Chicks had envisioned making the album with a kitchen-sink approach, using a rotating cast of producers, but “I was raw,” Maines said. “It was too hard for me to reveal myself to a lot of different people.” Once the Chicks invited Antonoff into the studio, he so disarmed the three of them that they asked him to shepherd the rest of the album.

Maines first encountered Antonoff years earlier, at Howard Stern’s star-bloated 60th birthday party. Antonoff, a fixture of indie-guy bands like Steel Train, fun. and Bleachers, has also become an unlikely collaborator to pop’s biggest female artists, including Lorde and Lana Del Rey. At the party, as Barbara Walters mingled with Robert Downey Jr., Antonoff was most excited “to see a Dixie Chick in the wild,” he said in a phone interview.

Maines visited Antonoff’s studio a couple of times and, in 2018, she introduced him to the other Chicks over breakfast in the restaurant of the Sunset Tower Hotel. “He was a nerd,” Maguire, 50, said. “Is he fashionable because he’s willing to go so retro ’80s? Or is he just really out of touch? It was cute.” Antonoff possessed a little-brother energy that fit easily into the sisterhood. With Antonoff, Maguire said, “we felt comfortable sharing our dirty laundry.”

Their first studio session together quickly produced “Gaslighter” and the Chicks immediately decided to follow that sound. Maines was going to fly to Hawaii for a three-week vacation, but she refashioned it into a work trip. The Chicks assembled a menagerie of instruments and children and jetted off to Kauai, with Antonoff and recording engineer Laura Sisk in tow.

On the island, they wrote over the sounds of pouring rain and screaming roosters. They had to shut off the booming air conditioner to record, so they played drenched in sweat, like marathoners. In their downtime, they shopped for ukuleles, swam in caves and ate flavoured ice.

As they worked, “Laura and I were also sort of on a family vacation” with the Chicks and their broods, Antonoff said. One minute, they’d all be eating barbecue in cowboy hats and novelty T-shirts, and the next, “we’d be combing through these heartbreaking lyrics about betrayal and grief.”

At the beginning of their career, the Chicks were doubly dismissed. They felt marginalized in music because they were a country act and marginalized within country because they were women. “They accepted us because we made them a lot of money, but they didn’t get us or like us,” Maines said, joking of the Sony chairman: “We didn’t get invited to Tommy Mottola’s wedding.”

When “Wide Open Spaces” went platinum for Sony in 1998, “I had this dream,” Maines said. “You’d hear all these stories of, like, the cast of ‘Frasier’ all getting cars,” she explained, and when Christmas rolled around she eagerly opened the package from her record company to find an array of scented soaps. “Our contract was so piddly,” Maines said. “I was calling our manager, like, ‘Why can’t they at least send us a TV? They make TVs.’”

“Well,” Maines said, “the big TVs did arrive.”

When the group announced its name change last month, casting Dixie from their lives for good, supportive fans jockeyed for attention with conservative commentators on Twitter, who lashed out with an almost programmatic outrage. The Chicks staged dramatic readings of the most absurd takes over Zoom.

“I used to care way too much what people thought,” Strayer said. “I really have a don’t-give-a-(expletive) part to me now, which I didn’t have before.” That time when it was actually risky for an artist to make a political statement: it seems so long ago. “I criticize the president,” Maines said, and here her voice lifted into her trademark Texas howl: “Every single day!”",[]

When the isolation rules loosened, Thompson immediately thought of playing the tune “Ashokan Farewell” with her friend.

Widely known as the theme from the Ken Burn’s Civil War documentary, “Ashokan Farewell” was written in 1982 by American folk musician Jay Ungar as a goodnight/farewell waltz, played at the end of the annual Ashokan Fiddle & Dance Camps run by Ungar and his wife. The tune, which Ungar describes as a “song of longing and loss,” felt very apt for these times.

Thompson and Chun thank him for allowing them to share this performance of his tune.

Warner Bros. Television, the CW and Berlanti Productions have cast Javicia Leslie as the new series lead of “Batwoman.”

Leslie will portray Ryan Wilder, described as “likable, messy, a little goofy and untamed,” who will take over the Bat-mantle from Kate Kane, who was Ruby Rose’s iteration of the vigilante hero.

Leslie will be the first Black actress to portray Batwoman in a live-action production and Ryan will be the first Black Bat-character in any medium.

“I am extremely proud to be the first Black actress to play the iconic role of Batwoman on television and, as a bisexual woman, I am honoured to join this groundbreaking show, which has been such a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community,” Leslie said in a statement.

Rose quite “Batwoman” in May, just days after the first season finale aired.

When the show premiered last fall, it became the first superhero series with a lesbian title character. Ryan is also an out lesbian.

“Batwoman” Season 2 is slated to premiere in January.

Zendaya and John David Washington made a movie despite COVID-19

The internet has been in a state of euphoria upon learning that a new movie starring Zendaya and John David Washington was filmed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, Zendaya shared a black-and-white still from the film, titled “Malcolm & Marie,” which sees her character gazing into the eyes of Washington’s. According to Deadline, the project was shot by “Euphoria” showrunner Sam Levinson between June 17 and July 2 at the Caterpillar House in Carmel, Calif.

The cast and a small crew followed a doctor- and union-approved safety protocol involving multiple COVID-19 tests and a strict two-week quarantine period in Monterey.

During the shoot, no more than a dozen people were allowed on set at any given time, and temperature checks were administered at the beginning and end of each day. To limit contact, the actors were in charge of costuming and attaching microphones to themselves, only interacting with crew members wearing personal protective equipment.

Lady A sues Lady A for right to use same name

How’s this for a twist? Lady Antebellum changed its name to Lady A to avoid associations with slavery and now it’s suing the Black artist who has been using the name Lady A for decades.

The band filed a trademark lawsuit in Nashville Wednesday over Anita White’s “attempt to enforce purported trademark rights in a mark that Plaintiffs have held for more than a decade.” The group also says White demanded $10 million (U.S.).

Band members Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley and David Haywood and their company, Lady A Entertainment, are seeking a declaratory judgment that would allow them to use the name without infringing on any of White’s trademark rights. They are not seeking any monetary damages, according to a copy of the complaint reviewed by the Los Angeles Times.

The lawsuit says the band has long gone by Lady A informally and that White did not oppose any previous applications for the Lady A mark, nor did she seek to cancel any of the Lady A registrations or seek the trademark for herself.

However, White’s legal team reportedly drafted a settlement agreement that “included an exorbitant monetary demand,” the lawsuit says.

The band said in a statement it had “heartfelt discussions with her about how we can all come together and make something special and beautiful out of this moment. We never even entertained the idea that she shouldn’t also be able to use the name Lady A, and never will — today’s action doesn’t change that.”

A representative for White did not immediately respond to the a request for comment Wednesday.

‘The Crown’ will have six seasons after all — but don’t expect Meghan

Netflix, which said in January that its hit series “The Crown” would run only five seasons, announced Thursday that the story of Britain’s royal family would include a Season 6 as originally planned.

Alas, the show won’t cover more royal ground in six seasons than it had planned to cover in five.

“To be clear, Series 6 will not bring us any closer to present day, it will simply enable us to cover the same period in greater detail,” writer-creator-executive producer Peter Morgan said in a statement.

In other words, they are not going to tackle Megxit.

To sum up, that means one more season with Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II before she passes the crown to Imelda Staunton.

Telefilm employee investigated after tweets that criticized an executive

Telefilm Canada says a third party is investigating allegations of misconduct against one of its employees.

The statement doesn’t name the employee, citing privacy concerns, but the investigation comes after allegations on social media about the conduct of Telefilm feature film executive Dan Lyon, who decides which projects with budgets under $2.5 million receive financing in the Ontario and Nunavut regions.

Last Friday, Canadian writer-director Pavan Moondi posted a series of tweets criticizing Lyon’s “opaqueness” in his decision-making at the Crown corporation and his reasons for rejecting funding for two of his projects.

He called on Lyon to step down, alleging he and Telefilm have taken too long to make good on their 2016 pledge to reflect more diversity onscreen.

Responding to Moondi’s tweets, writer Melissa D’Agostino alleged that Lyon made a sexually inappropriate comment to her at a party while offering her a meeting at Telefilm to talk about one of her screenplays.

D’Agostino said she spoke about the incident in the film “#MeAfterToo” in 2019 and sent an email to Telefilm HR asking about filing a formal complaint, but no one emailed her back.

“You shouldn’t have to build your own funding/streaming system to avoid harassment & discrimination,” she tweeted.

“We must reckon with the fact that women, BIPOC & other marginalized filmmakers continue to be discriminated against, harassed & misled by funders & key orgs in the Cdn film industry. There’s PR & lip service, but no real change or action.”

Read', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.']",2020-07-09,"Jean Smart, a veteran of “Designing Women,” “24” and “Fargo” among many other projects, has most recently added HBO’s “Watchmen” to her list of credits. The limited series, created by Damon Lindelof and based on a graphic novel, is set in an alternate history where masked vigilantes go after criminals decades after the actual Tulsa race massacre in 1921.

Smart plays Laurie Blake, a reformed vigilante turned no-nonsense FBI agent who has some internal conflicts of her own. “You’ve got to see so much of her public and totally private moments. It really was a gift as an actor,” Smart says of the series.

In this excerpt from the “Can’t Stop Watching” podcast, she also fills us in on a recent “Designing Women” reunion and shares some details about what she has coming up next.

Q: Laurie Blake is called in to Tulsa to investigate the death of Police Chief Jed Crawford. How much did you know about the story and the real-world massacre of Black citizens in Tulsa?

A: I knew nothing about that. It was shocking to me, shocking that I had never heard of it. And my father was a history teacher. It’s astonishing to think how prophetic the show was in a way, because first with the coronavirus and the idea that something happened that gave the entire world a common enemy and that that would help bring peace if we had something big to fight together. But then it was set against a historical event of unbelievable brutality against the Black community. It’s just incredible that Damon wrote that right before all of this happened, right before.

Q: What was your crash course into the world of “Watchmen?”

A: I went out for martinis with one of the writers and she gave me a lot of information about Laura’s background, her family and her relationships, because I knew nothing about it. “Watchmen” wasn’t something that my son had been into when he was growing up. I always feel like research is good. Just to a point, I mean, it was actually very valuable to know about her parents and her personal relationships. But research only goes so far. You have to base it really on the script.

Q: So much of what’s going on in the news right now is explored in the series: racism, cop culture, leadership. And fear — of fellow citizens or the use of fear to control.

A: We were doing the show in the time of our present administration, which is to say, that seems to be their tactic for everything. If you find out what people are afraid of, they have used that to get voters to come to their side. My character, she obviously has come to hate vigilantes. You know, she’s not a person necessarily to hold up as an example. She’s not the most ethical law enforcement person. She certainly doesn’t believe in people taking things into their own hands.

Q: Well, how is it to be part of art that takes on subject matter like this head-on?

A: Oh, it’s great. This is what actors crave. I mean, yes, sometimes you want to do stuff that’s just fun and just entertainment. But there was a quote from an actor a long time ago that said, “As an actor, if you want to believe that you can affect people in your audience in a good way, in a positive way, open their eyes to something.”

You also have to accept the fact that you can be a negative influence as well. You have to make your own personal wise choices about the kind of material you do. So you get to do something like “Watchmen,” it’s extremely rewarding. And it was nice that the audience responded the way it did. Of course, we had no idea what was coming. Like I said, it’s prophetic to an alarming degree. We had no idea about the pandemic. We had no idea how the race relations were going to come to a head in 2020.

Q: Your “Watchmen” character’s pining for somebody who’s been living on another planet for 30 years. How do you find the truth in that?

A: Good question! That says a lot about her. Then she finds out that he is living here with another woman. She thinks that she’s kind of got it all together, but she’s really kind of a mess. And she tells Angela (Regina King) that, you know, you don’t strike me as the kind of person who has friends. I’m thinking just look in the mirror! She’s living alone, in an apartment with an owl and has a closet full of black pantsuits and no social life whatsoever. She’s in love with a man who likes shoes. Like you said, she hasn’t seen in 30 years. And another guy who’s in prison. A shrink would have a field day with her.

Q: Sony has a YouTube channel called Throwback TV, and they have been getting together shows that are no longer on the air, like “Designing Women,” and having the actors do a remote table read of one of the scripts. How was that?

A: Delta (Burke) was not able to participate. She’s taking care of her mother. And unfortunately, we don’t have darling Dixie Carter. We read the pilot script. You would not have thought that 30 years have gone by for Annie (Potts). I mean, we just felt like we were right back there. It was just so much fun. It was weird not having an audience laughing, but it was really fun.

Q: What were you working on before stay-at-home orders from the pandemic?

A: I actually just got a deal producing a movie that I might also be in for Amblin. It is a combination of somewhat topical and also very uplifting and entertaining, hopefully a working title as “Miss Macy.” I hope it turns into something in the way that we envision it right now. I’m also in the middle of another one, a miniseries with Kate Winslet. And it’s been such an amazing time. I love Kate and I play her mother. They live together and they can’t stand each other. And they’re very blue-collar South Philly. I look forward to getting back to it. I’m not quite sure when we will.

Q: What are you watching while at home?

A: My guilty pleasure is HDTV. “Fixer Upper,” my relationship with my husband is sort of like their relationship. Also, I’ve recently discovered “Flea Market Flip.” I really desperately want to be on that show.",[]

Music and theatre lovers can’t go to concerts; dance lovers can’t go to recitals; nor art lovers museums; foodies to restaurants. That doesn’t mean the richness of our lives diminishes; it just means we need to look at it differently, for now. There are still plenty of new things to experience — alone and together, in person and virtually. And each week the Star brings you that in our Life, Entertainment and Books section — now At Home.

Art is something we can all experience together — even if we’re apart. Each week, we’re presenting Star readers with a work of art.

This week, Carlos Bunga’s new work, at Toronto’s Museum of Contemporary Art, seems to be made for our times — the strong, visual image evokes a sense of us all staying apart while still being together.

But Bunga created this piece even before the COVID-19 social distancing we’re all experiencing. He methodically organized hundreds of standard packing boxes into a vast grid covering a significant portion of MOCA’s second floor.

Bunga’s work encourages us to situate ourselves within art, and thereby, the conditions of the present.

The boxes are labelless and open-ended, uniformly facing upward, as if offering themselves up to be physically or imaginatively filled. Collectively, the composition suggests an anonymous geography or urban plan, a camp or modular storage system.

There are no specific directions, no designated beginning or end. Each viewer’s passage is entirely their own.

We’ll all get through this together, even as we all take our own slightly different path while doing it.

So in the time of COVID-19, the Star wanted to hear what some of the best in Canada had to say. This is the first in a series of essays that share ideas, emotions, ways to cope — and bring us together.

A friend of mine, when he begins a novel, always reads the last page first. Perhaps he wants no surprises, perhaps he wants to read for voice rather than plot, or, perhaps he doesn’t want to read in the dark. He claims that any novel that can be spoiled by knowing the ending isn’t worth reading. This is the same friend who reads in large gulps, like a dog bolting down food. He is fast, he is efficient — he read “The Idiot” in one day. Is this impatience? Rapacious desire? A need to dominate the narrative?

I have been thinking of my friend these days as we experience the virus that has affected billions of people. What do you do if the ending of this story has not yet been written and you cannot skip to the last page, if the narrative is constantly changing? We would like to believe that we are the authors of this story, not the virus. If it were otherwise, we would all throw up our hands and hug each other.

As a writer of fiction, I live under the illusion that stories can be shaped, that I have control of my characters and their actions, and that I can determine the various voices, and the structure of the novel. Of course, every story has a structure, even ones with dire endings, and just because we don’t like dire endings doesn’t mean that the story can be ignored. In our story, right now, it is difficult to trust the narrator, or the many narrators. And this makes it difficult to keep reading. I mean that literally. Many people I speak with are having a hard time concentrating on reading. Oh, news works. Facts. And more news. And more facts. But at some point, the news bleeds together and so we have a reappearance of the same story. Eternal repetition. Eternal return. But why this difficulty with fiction?

Some say they have found it easier to go back to Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf. Well-worn stories, where the endings are known. The familiar. Read what is safe. Others, those who can parcel up the world, are devouring fiction. My father reads Revelations and calls to tell me about the pale horse. I am reading “Threshold” by Rob Doyle, a young Irish writer. It is drug and sex addled — a quest for dead writers, a search for meaning. Which is what all novels worth their salt do: they deal in death. They trigger our imaginations, and our memories.

I am also reading “Decameron,” a plague novel by Bocaccio, a story of seven women and three men who go up to a deserted villa in Italy during the Black Death — this is the 14th Century. Each night, for ten days, they gather and tell stories to each other as a distraction or as a reminder of better times. The stories are not about the plague and death, but about life. The tales are often sexual, and full of trickery. Freed from the morality of the city their stories grow wild and wanton. Even the nuns of the villa have their wily ways, seducing a deaf mute who cannot out them.

Another book: “The Plague,” by Camus. Like many a reader, I recently went back and reread the novel, and discovered that Camus had captured, in 1947, the intricate details and emotions and dread that we experience today — the failing economy, the rich going short of practically nothing, letting the weak die, herd immunity, fear of the other, the efficacy/inefficacy of wearing a mask, flattening the curve, ‘doubtful cases’, finger-pointing, the bravery of the doctor, the nurse, the undertaker. Camus of course is dealing with more than a plague foreshadowed by dead rats. He is looking at how the plague is both outside of us and inside of us. He is saying that Yes, our bodies may survive, but if we don’t recognize the interior pestilence, we will be diminished metaphysically. At the end of the novel, as the fear of the plague fades, the rodents return. Beware the rats. What is astounding about Camus’ novel is the use of facts, the counting of the dead, and the utter banality of the pestilence. “The truth is that nothing is less sensational than pestilence, and by reason of their very duration great misfortunes are monotonous.” First goes imagination, then goes memory.

I watched a YouTube video recently, in which a psychoanalyst said that during this time humans are regressing. He said that the virus has normalized paranoia and has literally scared the s--t out of us — hence our need to hoard toilet paper. We have lost our sense of control, our sense of the future, and therefore we have lost our sense of time. We are in isolation, stuck here forever, never ending, eternal. Usually, time passes from the past to the present to the future. And that future includes death, for all of us. No one wants to live forever. We just don’t want to die quite yet, not in this manner.

My daughter, who is in isolation in Montreal with her husband and their four-month-old daughter, sent me a Sylvia Plath poem called “Nick and the Candlestick.” It is about a pregnant mother who wanders like a miner through her cave-like house, carrying a candle, talking to her unborn child. It is perfect for our times, in that it recognizes the child to come, the future. Plath ends the poem by pushing away dread and praising the unborn child.

You are the baby in the barn.

The baby in the barn. The book as barn. Do we build fictions like barns, to protect ourselves from the unknown? In literature, in art, in photographs, film, in any art form that succeeds, there has to be a sense of movement, of life beyond the frame, of the story continuing after we close the book.

Also, art requires work. It isn’t a Twitter feed, or Instagram — rather than being fed, we must learn to feed ourselves. As we read the narrative of our own plague, in real time, we keep looking for what is to come. We want hope. We need it. We want to sustain a sense of time. We must protect the baby in the barn.",[]

Read', 'Star Staff']",2020-04-22,"When we find ourselves in times of trouble music is a solace we turn to. It can uplift, relax, transport or energize us. Live music, in particular, is exciting because anything can happen: it’s intimate; it’s urgent, and everyone in the room experiences and shares it together. United.

But what does a musician do when they don’t have an audience? And audiences when they can’t access live music? Here in our coronavirus self-isolation being able to share music is a gift.

The Toronto Symphony Orchestra has teamed up with the Toronto Star to offer an exclusive weekly Musical Moment — a new performance by one of the TSO’s musicians every week — a respite from the hard headlines and tough news we hear every day.

“Like the Toronto Star, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is here to serve Torontonians throughout the GTA,” said its CEO, Matthew Loden. “We hope that this exclusive Toronto Star performance series serves as a hopeful musical tonic as readers review challenging but important headlines.”

Here’s how it works: the musician records themselves playing their instrument live at home, then sends their recording to TSO producers; as in the first performance by concertmaster Jonathan Crow, to be paired with the piano of Philip Chiu.

Pieces will be no longer than three minutes. And because they’re recorded at home, you’ll get new insight into each musician; a glimpse into their lives beyond the stage. Each week will offer up a new experience — as you would at a live performance, you never know what might happen. There’s an energy and an intimacy.

There are many couples at the TSO — maybe they’ll play together. Other family members, children perhaps, might join in somehow. Ensembles might record separately with each musician in their own home and then be joined together in production.

The new video will be posted each Thursday at thestar.com/musicalmoments; check in every week for music to unite the city.

After Monday, when they officially bade adieu to royal life, it’s time for champagne, caviar and a three-tier cake scrawled with, “Freedom!” The bash with their closest pals should also include a few symbolic nods to their new homeland, Canada. (Actually, scratch that because now I’m picturing Heather Dorak browbeating guests into doing Pilates on an itchy Hudson’s Bay blanket as George Clooney gets wasted on Molson Canadian and Oprah, already stinking of ketchup chips, demands the terrified chefs whip up a batch of Nanaimo bars for her flight home.)

The point is, Harry and Meghan are now liberated. Congratulations!

Your royal nightmare is over. Let the real dreaming begin.

Anyone who believes the young couple made a grave mistake by ditching the charmed life of his birth — and one she married into — need only watch a nine-second clip from Monday. It was Commonwealth Day, Harry and Meghan’s last pony show as departing senior royals. The narcoleptic event went down inside Westminster Abbey, though given the frostiness on display, it should’ve unfolded in the North Pole.

Harry and Meghan, looking resplendent, were already seated in the second row. But when Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ambled toward their spots in the first row, months of reported feuds twisted into high-def focus. Meghan waved at Kate, sweetly, but was ignored like a dirty panhandler.

William and Kate then took their seats. And Meghan turned toward her husband to whisper.

What she said, I have no clue.

But I would not blame Meghan had she asked in a hush, “Harry, what is wrong with those two?”

After months in which a “falling out” between the brothers was widely reported, this was a chance for the couples to at least feign congeniality for the global cameras. You know? Pretend everything is A-OK. Hug it out. Fake laugh and make small talk. Do something to disabuse the world of the notion there is now bad blood between two blood brothers.

But that’s not what happened. And the blame goes to William and Kate, who telegraphed petulance.

My heart goes out to Harry and Meghan. It really does. Tired of the absolute garbage they’ve endured from the British tabloids — and determined to animate their own philanthropic and career goals without the controlling shackles of Buckingham Palace — they reasonably asked to become part-time royals.

Instead, they were stripped of their Sussex brand and banished from the Queendom.

Whether it was the awkward, chilly interaction with William and Kate on Monday or getting booed by a heckler at the Endeavour Fund Awards a couple of days earlier, Harry and Meghan’s final weekend as royals was not cause for any second-guessing — it was proof #Megxit was one of the greatest decisions ever made.

The royal family does not deserve Harry and Meghan. The world does.

The royal family wanted to hold them down. They are now free.

On Saturday, during an interview on MSNBC Live, British journalist Victoria Mather revealed the extent of the classist-slash-racist forces aligned against Markle when she blurted out, “I think what has really, really upset the British public is that Meghan Markle, who many people consider only, you know, five clicks up from trailer trash, has actually tried to disrespect the Queen. And the Queen is the most respected person — most respected woman — in the world.”

Now, if I were to be similarly nasty, I might point out Mather looks like Benedict Cumberbatch’s uncle in drag who works the overnight shift at a Twinings factory. Five clicks up from trailer trash? Mather looks and sounds three clicks below a stolen bangers-and-mash breakfast along the banks of the River Thames, in the company of Piccadilly Circus freaks.

But if you watch the rest of the interview, the narrative is clear: Kate Middleton came from a great family worthy of royalty. Meghan Markle, by contrast, was spawned from a biracial hillbilly clan, and has no right to yank Harry from his relationship with his king-in-waiting brother and preternaturally uptight sister-in-law.

So Meghan is basically the Yoko Ono of this century: blamed for the breakup of another “Fab Four.”

Give me a break. From the moment Markle was linked to Prince Harry, she has coped with vicious attacks on her character and motivation. And yet, at every turn, she has bravely smiled, put on her hiking boots and taken the high road. Her steely resolve, her focus on the big picture, reminds me of someone else: Princess Diana.

So Harry and Meghan’s final march through royal duty this weekend is no longer cause for debate: it is irrefutable evidence they made the right decision by getting the hell away. What they want for themselves, compared to what was expected of them, could never be reconciled. There was no middle ground here.

Harry and Meghan, after the birth of their son, realized royal life was a prison in the making.

Now they are free. Now there is no looking back.

Read', 'Shinan Govanicontributing Columnist', 'Contributing Columnist', 'Shinan Govani Is A Toronto-Based Freelance Contributing Columnist Covering Culture', 'Society. Follow Him On Twitter']",2020-03-11,"It only took 14 years.

When the Dixie Chicks triumphantly returned earlier this month, dropping a fist-up emoji of a song called “Gaslighter” — also the name of a long-awaited album, coming soon — my thoughts darted to a few places. One, I remembered how much I bloody love the Dixie Chicks.

Two, a reminder of the fuss that engulfed the game-changing country trio, back in the early aughts, when frontwoman Natalie Maines publicly denounced both the Iraq War and the then-president George W. Bush (and how quaint all of that sounds now).

Three, a fixation on the idea that while “Gaslighter’ has the ire and the tang of songs on their 2006 comeback album — think “Not Ready To Make Nice” — and that it, additionally, makes pulp of a term that is ubiquitous these days — “gaslighting” is an in-vogue word, employed everywhere from politics to reality TV — I was not entirely sure that what this song was about was actually … well … “gaslighting.” Maybe it’s just a bummer?

Indeed, visions of Alanis cascaded upon me, as I wondered if gaslight might just be the next “Ironic”? You remember, dontcha, that ’90s anthem which describes any number of things — “a traffic jam when you’re already late,” for one; “ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife,” for another — few of which were especially ironic?

Some background: “gaslighting” has become a more popular expression, in this Trump-era zeitgeist of “alternative facts” but in its purest essence, in the personal realm, it refers to a form of sustained emotional abuse that involves manipulating the truth to make someone doubt their grip on reality — and the term actually goes back decades. To a 1938 play “Gaslight,” in fact — one that later became a classic movie with Ingrid Bergman. In that plot, a husband wrecks havoc on his wife by subtly altering things, including playing with the gaslights in the house.

What do you think?

Lying. Manipulation. Keeping your victim foggy-eyed and off-balance. The toolbox of the classic gaslighter in that original incarnation. And one that has become a staple in psychology, and has now morphed into a go-to bit of invective in this era, it reaching its own sort of pop-political apotheosis when, in an interview last year, none other than Taylor Swift accused Trump of “gaslighting the American public.” Lately, I have heard everyone from Real Housewives to contestants on “Love Island” throw around the term.

The term has also been enjoying a good run on bookshelves, too, especially in a form of domestic noir as practised by authors like Gillian Flynn. There is, for instance, Tara Isabella Burton’s pretty great, gender-bending Talented Mr. Ripley redux from a couple of years ago, “Social Creature,” in which the anti-heroine uses gaslighting via the very 21st-century modes of social media. And also, even crazier, the meta-ness of A.J. Finn’s bestseller “The Woman in the Window” (soon to be a movie with Amy Adams), which was sold as a gaslight novel but then got even more curiouser, when the author was unveiled as a serial liar himself in a long profile done of him in “The New Yorker,” with his past deceptions including claiming to have had cancer, among other things (cue the allegations of Finn as a gaslighter by colleagues).

A Guardian columnist echoed some of my own reservations, though, when she warned against cheapening the term. “Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter,” Barbara Ellen wrote. Meaning: it is not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious behaviour, nor is it “gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses.”

When it occurs, “it is a systematic dissolving another person’s sense of self, until they’re questioning every move and instinct.” And not just a phenomenon that pops up on a show like “Love Island,” where male contestants are tagged as gaslighters, when — girl, please — many of them are just himbos who’d say anything to get laid.

So, what say you, Dixie Chicks? In their album — which the group has called “the most personal and autobiographical” — the just-out song clearly traces Maines’ very public divorce from a liar-face. And the full-blast lyrics? Well, they speak for themselves. Exhibit A: “Give you all my money, you’ll gladly walk away … Gaslighter, denier, doing anything to get your ass farther …”

It is an earworm, all right, but is, actually … gaslighting? Let the debates begin.",[]

Read', 'Karen Frickertheatre Critic', 'Theatre Critic', 'Summer', 'The Donna Summer Musical', 'Plays At The Princess Of Wales Theatre', 'King St. W']",2020-03-10,"Disco is back, according to some experts. Others would say that it’s never gone away: disco has been an enduring influence on music — and pop culture more broadly — ever since producers and artists first integrated synthesizers and four on the floor beats into pop sounds in the late 1960s and early ’70s.

Wherever you fall in these debates about disco’s evergreen status, what cannot be disputed is the central place of the late American singer and songwriter Donna Summer in the history of the genre.

Performer and frequent co-writer of 14 Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hits — including “Hot Stuff,” “Bad Girls,” “Macarthur Park,” “Heaven Knows,” “Last Dance,” “Dim all the Lights” and more — Summer’s musical legacy is huge. And yet for many years Summer resisted her status as the so-called Queen of Disco, says theatre director Des McAnuff, “because she was so many other things.”

McAnuff is the director and co-writer of the Broadway musical “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” which is playing at the Princess of Wales Theatre through March 22. The premise of the show is that it takes place at a concert celebrating Summer’s music and then flashes back to retell the story of her life.

Three actors play Summer, as the senior Diva Donna (Dan’yelle Williamson), the career-prime Disco Donna (Alex Hairston) and the fledgling Duckling Donna (Olivia Elease Hardy).

“One of the themes is that she was many people,” says McAnuff. “She lived a number of different lives, some even contradictory.”

The show revisits Summer’s early professional years in Germany, where she met up with the producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, and put out the groundbreaking singles “Love to Love You Baby” and “I Feel Love.” In its survey of Summer’s career, it demonstrates the wide range of musical genres that influenced her and to which she contributed, including pop, funk, R&B, gospel and inspirational rock.

It also touches on some of the more controversial aspects of Summer’s life and career: a born-again Christian, she was quoted in the 1980s as saying that AIDS was divine retribution for immoral lifestyles, statements she denied but which caused great distress among her massive gay following.

The show reunites McAnuff, the Tony and Olivier Award winner and former artistic director of the Stratford Festival, with choreographer Sergio Trujillo. The pair have created several highly successful musicals built around the back catalogues of musical groups and artists, including “Jersey Boys,” about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, and “Ain’t Too Proud,” about The Temptations.

Both McAnuff and Trujillo, who live in the U.S., spent formative years in Canada and still identify partly as Canadian. Trujillo’s memories of the disco era are directly tied to Toronto.

“My family arrived in Canada in 1976 from Colombia,” says Trujillo. “I had never heard disco music before. I’d only heard salsa in Colombia. This whole new sound and style of music was electrifying to me. My cousins are older than me by five or six years and they were all really immersed in the disco craze. They would take me to various clubs around Toronto — I was 14 or 15 — and I watched them dance. I saw the music and the decadence of that world.”

The challenge that Trujillo gave himself with “Summer” was to do more than “dust off those old disco moves” (just to set expectations: no one does the Hustle in this show).

“I lived through this period,” says Trujillo. “I decided that I was going to take the opportunity to create some storytelling” through the way the musical numbers are staged.

A priority for Trujillo and McAnuff was to make the production a showcase for female performers, particularly female performers of colour. Besides the three Donnas, there is a chorus of 12 female dancers (and one male) who, in addition to performing Trujillo’s choreography, play various roles in the story, female and male.

This “creates a kind of androgyny that captures the time,” says McAnuff, “and uses extraordinary talents that have been relatively sidelined in our business … Sergio and I spend a lot of time in auditions and one of the thing that becomes clear is that there are many, many women who don’t get the opportunities they deserve in terms of roles.”

While he spent his high school years in Scarborough and launched his theatre career in Toronto, McAnuff’s memories of the disco era are firmly set in New York. “I was working at the Public Theater in those days. The disco beat permeated all kinds of genres of music,” recalls McAnuff. “I was very aware of it. I play music; you couldn’t play music without being influenced by it.”

While he was at the time the sort of artsy rebel “who considered anything north of 14th Street as uptown,” says McAnuff, he does remember going to Studio 54 in its heyday and hearing Summer’s “Macarthur Park” for the first time.

“That song was of course a big discovery,” he says, “and this is in the show. Before that people thought of Donna as a sort of Black Marilyn Monroe, but the fact that she could sing that way was something of a shock. She hadn’t really had the chance to show off those extraordinary pipes.”

“Summer” played on Broadway from April to December 2019 and earned two Tony nominations (for LaChanze as Diva Donna and Ariana DeBose as Disco Donna). This North American tour has been on the road since September 2019, and both McAnuff and Trujillo say they’re coming to Toronto to see the show here.

“I am excited that we are bringing it to the hometown where I fell in love with disco dance,” says Trujillo, “to be able to revisit that in the place where it all started for me. I hope audiences enjoy it and that they not only reminisce, but they leave dancing.”

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-03-11,"When even the mother of “The Bachelor” doesn’t believe he has a chance in hell of finding love you know it’s over: romance, or whatever passed for romance on the long-running reality franchise, is dead.

Viewers who endured a train wreck of a “Bachelor” season had to put up with a fiasco of a finale, spread over four hours and two nights Monday and Tuesday, as pilot Peter Weber’s bid to find a wife crashed and burned.

To summarize: Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with one woman who said she loved him but that they were too different to make things work. Two days after she walked out on him, Peter claimed to be head over heels in love with another woman and proposed marriage to her. But the engagement ended because he still had feelings for the first woman, who confessed she still had feelings for him and agreed to give him a second chance.

Despite the optimistic presence of jeweller Neil Lane in Tuesday’s live studio audience in Los Angeles, briefcase of diamond rings in hand, there was no engagement.

A couple of clear villains emerged from the shambles: Weber himself and a tired series that prizes made-for-TV manipulation over the human connections it claims to value above all else.

There was also a clear hero: Hannah Ann Sluss, the 23-year-old we were all making fun of a couple of weeks ago for dotting her i’s with hearts, but who boldly and confidently stood up for herself and rejected Peter’s weaselly rationalizations after he sabotaged their engagement.

The third person involved in this mess, Madison Prewett, also 23, was coaxed back into Peter’s arms after “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison personally delivered the news of Peter’s broken engagement. This strikes me less as altruism than a desperate attempt to get Peter paired off and stave off criticism that the entire season was a colossal waste of time.

But Peter’s mother Barb very bluntly told Peter and Madison on Tuesday that their relationship is doomed to fail. While I think it was impolitic of her to sabotage her own son on live TV like that, I also think she’s probably right given her disdain for Madison (evidenced by the rude faces she made on camera every time Madison opened her mouth) and that of the rest of Peter’s family. How does a relationship that’s already on shakey ground withstand that kind of familial disapproval?

But let’s back up and retrace how we got to this sorry point.

Weber was never a popular choice as star of this “Bachelor” season, one that was marked by tedious sniping among the contestants and Peter’s seeming inability to form more than shallow connections with any of his would-be mates.

Madison, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala., was an early front-runner, but just before she, Peter and two other women jetted off to Australia for “fantasy suite” week, she told him she’d be hard pressed to continue dating him if he had sex with the other two on their overnight dates. Deeply religious, she was saving herself for marriage.

Peter, on the other hand, was renowned for his sexual prowess. His claim to fame, and likely the reason he was chosen as Bachelor, was that he had sex four times with “The Bachelorette” in a windmill fantasy suite. So to no one’s surprise, except maybe Madison’s, Peter confessed he’d been “intimate” (whether with one or both of the other women was never specified) and Madison bolted.

She did come back, but his indiscretion hung like a cloud over their relationship and she left him in the Australian outback, seemingly forever.

This is where Peter could have used his powers for good instead of evil.

Hannah Ann, a model from Knoxville, Tenn., adored Peter; his family adored Hannah Ann. (That clip we saw ad nauseam of Barb wailing at Peter, “Bring her home to us”? The “her” was Hannah Ann.) But Peter was obviously gaga for Madison. The day after the breakup he told Hannah Ann that despite her obvious devotion to him his heart was “being pulled in two different directions.”

The honourable thing to do would have been to send Hannah Ann home then and there. Instead he claimed the very next day that he’d found “true love” with her. “My heart chooses you forever,” he told a very surprised Hannah Ann before pulling out a pear-shaped diamond ring.

It’s the same ring Hannah Ann put back in his hand weeks later after Peter confessed he couldn’t give her his entire heart.

Onstage in the studio, Hannah Ann lambasted Peter for downplaying his feelings for Madison. “I had no idea what I was saying yes to. That’s called being blindsided,” she said. “If you would have sat me down and had an honest conversation you know that my instinct would have picked up on that you were not ready for a commitment with me …

“And that’s the most hurtful part is that you didn’t respect me enough just to have that open conversation with me.”

She left him with this zinger: “If you want to be with a woman you’ve got to become a real man.”

Peter apologized a lot but never really explained why he did what he did. Was it pride? FOMO? A desire to please his family? A sense of pressure not to leave the show still single?

Whatever the reason, his actions did nothing to endear him to viewers who were already very displeased with him. And it’s hard to feel unreserved enthusiasm for his and Madison’s relationship given his shoddy treatment of Hannah Ann.

This is the third season in a row of “The Bachelor” to finish without a so-called happy ending. Arie Luyendyk Jr. dumped his fiancée for his runner-up; Colton Underwood got jilted by his favourite but got her to agree to continue dating him; and now this.

But maybe the issue isn’t the show’s failure rate but the whole premise that a man getting down on one knee to propose to a woman he’s known for barely two months is the pinnacle of romantic love.

Warner Bros. and ABC remain unbowed. They’re debuting yet another “Bachelor” spinoff on April 13, “Listen to Your Heart,” in which the contestants are all musicians, to be followed by a new season of “The Bachelorette” on May 18 starring Clare Crawley, the oldest franchise star at 38.

Maybe she’ll get a genuine shot at finding a mature and respectful partner, but I wouldn’t hold my breath.",[]

Organizers said Tuesday that they are pushing forward with plans for its 77th instalment, which will include a slightly reduced number of films in the main competition as well as some outdoor and virtual screenings. If the schedule stays intact, it will be the first major film festival since COVID-19 essentially shut down the industry in mid-March.

Festival director Alberto Barbera said in a statement that he is “extremely pleased that the Biennale Cinema can be held with a minimum reduction of films and sections” and that “a significant number of directors and actors will accompany films to the Lido.”

There will still be 50 to 55 films in the official selection, which will be announced on July 28, and screenings will take place in the traditional venues as well as two outdoor arenas (at the Giardini della Biennale and a skating rink on the Lido) with adopted safety measures established by authorities.

The festival will take its Virtual Reality section online and this year forego its Sconfini section, which hosts smaller films and genre fare, to accommodate more socially distanced screenings of the major films in competition. Actress Cate Blanchett is presiding over the main competition jury.

Travel to Italy, an early epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic, is allowed from European countries. The European Union last week said it would reopen its border to 14 nations, but most Americans have been refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections in the U.S. Press from countries with travel restrictions will be able to view press conferences virtually, Barbera said.

“Without forgetting the countless victims of these past few months to whom due tribute shall be paid, the first international festival following the forced interruption dictated by the pandemic becomes the meaningful celebration of the re—opening we all looked forward to, and a message of concrete optimism for the entire world of cinema which has suffered greatly from this crisis,” Barbera said.

The Toronto International Film Festival, which is typically held on the heels of Venice in September, has already announced plans for a smaller 2020 version, with fewer films and virtual red carpets. Both festivals serve as major launching grounds for awards hopefuls, although no one know how exactly it will work now that runway to the Oscars has been extended by two months.

The Venice Film Festival runs from Sept. 2-12.",[]

Read', ""Frances D'Emiliothe Associated Press"", 'The Associated Press', ""Frances D'Emiliothe Associated Pressmon.""]",2020-07-06,"ROME - Ennio Morricone, the Oscar-winning Italian composer who created the coyote-howl theme for the iconic Spaghetti Western “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and often haunting soundtracks for such classic Hollywood gangster movies as “The Untouchables” and the epic “Once Upon A Time In America,” died Monday. He was 91.

Morricone’s longtime lawyer, Giorgio Assumma, said “the Maestro,” as he was known, died in a Rome hospital of complications following surgery after a recent fall in which he broke a leg bone.

Outside the hospital, Assumma read a farewell message from Morricone.

“I am Ennio Morricone, and I am dead,” began the message. In the greeting, the composer went on to explain that the only reason he was saying goodbye this way and had requested a private funeral was: “I don’t want to bother anyone.”

During a career that spanned decades and earned him an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Morricone collaborated with some of Hollywood’s and Italy’s top directors, including on “The Untouchables” by Brian de Palma, “The Hateful Eight” by Quentin Tarantino , “The Battle of Algiers” by Gillo Pontecorvo and “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,” a nostalgic ode to the importance of movie houses in Italian small town life, by Giuseppe Tornatore.

The Tarantino film would win him the Oscar for best original score in 2016. In accepting that award, Morricone told the audience at the ceremony: “There is no great music without a great film that inspires it.”

In total, he produced more than 400 original scores for feature films.

His iconic so-called Spaghetti Western movies saw him work closely with the late Italian film director Sergio Leone, a former classmate.

Morricone practically reinvented music for Western genre movies through his partnership with Leone. Their partnership included the “Dollars” trilogy starring Clint Eastwood as a quick-shooting, lonesome gunman: “A Fistful of Dollars” in 1964, “For a Few Dollars More” in 1965 and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” a year later.

Morricone was celebrated for crafting just a few notes — like the four notes played on a miniature pan flute favoured by a character in Leone’s 1984 movie “Once Upon A Time in America” — that would instantly become a film’s highly memorable motif.

That movie is a saga about Jewish gangsters in New York that explores themes of friendship, lost love and the passing of time, starring Robert De Niro and James Woods. It is considered by some to be Leone’s masterpiece, thanks in part to Morricone’s evocative score, including a lush section played on string instruments.

“Inspiration does not exist,” Morricone said in a 2004 interview with The Associated Press. “What exists is an idea, a minimal idea that the composer develops at the desk, and that small idea becomes something important.”

In a later interview, with Italian state TV, Morricone cited “study, discipline and curiosity” as the keys to his creative genius. “Writing music, like all creative arts, comes from a long path” along life’s experiences, he said.

“A great phenomenon of world music” was how Italian film director Dario Argento described Morricone, who scored five of his films.

In his late 80s, Morricone provided the score for “The Hateful Eight,” Tarantino’s 2015 70-mm epic and the first time in decades that he had composed new music for a Western. It was also the first time Tarantino had used an original score.

In accepting Morricone’s Golden Globe for the music in his place, Tarantino called him his favourite composer.

“When I say ‘favourite composer,’ I don’t mean movie composer. ... I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert,” Tarantino said.

Italy’s head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, in a condolence message to the composer’s family, wrote: “Both a refined and popular musician, he left a deep footprint on the musical history of the second half of the 1900s.”

Morricone’s sound tracks, Mattarella said, “contributed greatly to spreading and reinforcing the prestige of Italy in the world.”

Morricone’s style was sparse, made of memorable tunes and unusual instruments and arrangements, and often stirred deep emotions.

His music punctuated the long silences typical of the Spaghetti Westerns, with the characters locked in close-ups, staring at each other and waiting for their next moves. The coyote howl, harmonicas and eerie whistling of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” became Morricone’s trademark and one of the most easily recognizable soundtracks in cinema.

Minutes before handing Morricone the Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, Eastwood recalled hearing for the first time the score of “A Fistful of Dollars” and thinking: “What actor wouldn’t want to ride into town with that kind of music playing behind him?”

It was a night to remember for Morricone, who had been nominated for Oscars five times (“The Hateful Eight” was his sixth) but until then had never won.

Born in Rome on Nov. 10, 1928, Morricone was the oldest of the five children. His father was a trumpet player.

After studying trumpet and composition at the Conservatory of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in the Italian capital, he started working as a trumpeter and then as an arranger for record companies.

“I started working on very easy kinds of music pieces for the radio, for television and then for the theatre, and then little by little I started to compose the film scores,” he told the AP in 2016.

In 1961 he wrote his first score for a movie, a bittersweet comedy set in the final moments of Fascism called “Il Federale” (known in English as “The Fascist”). That decade also saw Morricone co-operate with Pontecorvo, first on “The Battle of Algiers,” the black-and-white classic depicting the Algerian uprising against the French; and later on “Queimada,” a tale of colonialism starring Marlon Brando.

Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for original score with “Days Of Heaven,” a 1978 movie by U.S. director Terence Malick. Beside “The Hateful Eight,” the others were for “The Mission” (1986), “The Untouchables” (1987), “Bugsy” (1991) and “Malena” (2000).

Shortly before his lifetime Oscar, Morricone joked that he would have been happy without the coveted statuette, saying “I would have remained in the company of illustrious non-winners.”

But he also made no secret that he thought “The Mission,” with its memorably sweet theme of “Gabriel’s Oboe,” deserved the Academy Award. That year, he lost to Herbie Hancock’s “Round Midnight.”

Morricone had recently composed music to be performed in Genoa’s Carlo Felice Theater later this summer in honour of the 43 victims of that city’s 2018 Morandi Bridge collapse, Genoa Mayor Marco Bucci said. The music will be performed on the eve of a ceremony inaugurating the bridge’s replacement, the mayor said.

Highly versatile, Morricone also orchestrated Italian pop tunes that include enduring classics, like one version of an eternal summer hit, “Sapore di Sale” (“Taste of Salt”), which was written by famed Italian troubadour Gino Paoli.

Another renowned maestro, Riccardo Muti, cited his “friendship and admiration? for Morricone. Muti on Monday recalled that when he directed the composer’s piece “Voci dal Silenzio” (Voices from the Silence” ) the work elicited “true emotion” from the audience, both in Chicago, where Muti directs the symphony orchestra, as well as during a performance in Ravenna, Italy.

Muti called Morricone an “extraordinary” composer both for films and in classical music.

Asked by Italian state TV a few years ago if there was one director he would have liked to have worked with but didn’t, Morricone said Stanley Kubrick had asked him to work on “A Clockwork Orange.” But that collaboration didn’t happen because of a commitment to Leone, Morricone recalled.

Morricone is survived by his wife Maria Travia, whom he cited when accepting his 2016 Oscar. Married in 1956, the couple had four children, Marco, Alessandra, Andrea and Giovanni.

Read', 'Robert Lloydlos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Robert Lloydlos Angeles Timesmon.']",2020-07-06,"June was Pride month, commemorating the 1969 Stonewall riots that birthed the gay liberation movement. As in other journeys toward recognition, equality and freedom to be, the world has come far, and not far enough. And as always, there are arguments about which way to go.

June may be over. But television goes on, and we would like to propose some recent relevant series to keep the party going. One caveat: Not all that follows constitutes a party.

‘Pose-a-Thon’

Mostly a party is the isolation-shot “Pose-a-Thon,” a fundraising special featuring the cast and creators from the FX ballroom drama “Pose” that dropped on the eve of the Stonewall anniversary weekend. Offering songs and stories and testimonials, with a brief history of Stonewall from showrunner Steven Canals, the show makes a point of declaring that the “queer liberation movement was begun by black and brown trans women,” the very people at the heart of “Pose.”

‘Visible: Out on Television’

TV has indeed made progress in the intervening years, if stumbling along the way. Last year brought a same-sex marriage on the PBS cartoon “Arthur,” while the May series finale of Netflix’s “She-Ra and the Princess of Power” made explicit what fans already understood, that it was a long arc lesbian love story. The five-part documentary “Visible: Out on Television,” which premiered on Apple TV Plus in March, reaches back to the earliest days of the medium and gives a pretty thorough account of how LGBTQ people have been portrayed and employed across the decades — from invisibility to subjects of (invariably misguided) analysis, to objects of censure and pity and low comedy, to fodder for concerned social comment and big drama.

A running theme of “Visible” is that we should look for ourselves reflected in popular culture, how what we find or fail to find changes us and how in the absence of real representation, we look for what we can adapt and use. LGBTQ characters have moved from guest shots to supporting parts to central roles — to being played, in the bargain, by performers whose identity matches the character’s — as queerness has become something not always worth comment in and of itself. This too raises issues in a still imperfect world — as Times TV editor Matt Brennan pointed out in his piece on the series, the arc toward justice will require more bending.

‘Disclosure’

“Visible” pairs well with (and overlaps) “Disclosure,” a Netflix documentary specifically about trans actors and images, directed by Sam Feder and narrated and featuring “Orange Is the New Black” superstar Laverne Cox. Its view is less historical — though it supplies ample context, back to silent film — than it is concerned with the present and immediate future. Autobiographical, philosophical and political at heart, “Visible” and its contributors are erudite, articulate and disinclined to simplify.

‘Welcome to Chechnya’

HBO has put up a pair of documentaries that demonstrate in different ways the effects of homophobia. The just-premiered, ironically titled “Welcome to Chechnya” is an on-the-ground documentary shot in 2017, when authorities in the Russian Federation republic waged war on its LGBTQ population. They carried out what has been described as a “purge” — allegedly making arrests, torturing citizens to name other citizens, encouraging “honour” killings and generally trying to will difference out of existence. It feels shockingly medieval. The film, directed by David France, focuses on a group of underground activists smuggling refugees through halfway houses and out of Russia to countries willing to take them. It has all the elements of a classic escape film and is often difficult to watch, both for the subject matter and cinematic tension. But it is not without hope.

‘Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn’

Seven minutes into the first episode of “Visible,” legal attack dog Roy Cohn turns up next to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy at the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, which, among other things, targeted LGBTQ people as security risks during the so-called Lavender Scare. Broadcast to an audience of some 80 million over its run, the hearings introduced the fact of homosexuality to television and, one would suppose, to much of America. Cohn is never heard from, or, for that matter, talked about, in “Visible,” but HBO’s excellent “Bully. Coward. Victim. The Story of Roy Cohn” discusses him at feature length.

The film takes its title from a panel in the AIDS memorial quilt that director Ivy Meeropol and her father happened upon. It was a moment of particular significance for them, as Meeropol is the granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped send to the electric chair; he also was, significantly, a closeted gay man, who would die of AIDS complications. A high-living social climber who made it a point of honour to pay as few bills as possible, and no taxes, Cohn was a mentor to Donald Trump, if that word may be used in such a negative context, and an attorney for various organized crime figures.

Cohn died in 1986, and Meeropol’s film offers a picture of a gone world — a time when gay culture was influencing the mainstream, without the mainstream quite recognizing that fact. (Cohn was a regular in gay-friendly Provincetown, Mass., and at Studio 54.) Given the Rosenberg connection, “The Story of Roy Cohn” is remarkably even-handed, nearly sympathetic and more than a little sad. Cohn may have been a villain, but he was a victim not only of HIV but also of his generation. In hiding his sexuality, even as he was dying, his case was little different from that of actor Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS complications a year before Cohn. Both were 59.

‘Hollywood’/‘Now Apocalypse’

A fictionalized young Hudson, played by Jake Picking, is a central character in Ryan Murphy’s Netflix miniseries “Hollywood.” It’s an alternative-history postwar fantasy in which fear of a gay Hollywood is overcome as early as 1947, giving Rock the happy beginning, and we assume the ending life denied him — or he denied himself in life. It is a weird mess of a show that works best taken not quite as seriously as it wants to be. But it works as a kind of camp art film — something along the lines of Gregg Araki’s exuberant, future-camp, polysexual, porn-adjacent sci-fi farce “Now Apocalypse,” a Hollywood fable of a different sort. Starz sent it into the world last year. But the glossy, madcap first season is still available to stream, and worth seeking out.

‘A Secret Love’

For a lovely documentary take on the theme, see “A Secret Love,” which debuted on Netflix in April. It tells the story of Pat Henschel and Terry Donahue, a lesbian couple who didn’t reveal the nature of their relationship until they were in their 80s. Made by a family member, Chris Bolan, it’s moving not only for its somewhat reluctant, matter of fact intimacy but also for its sweep. The film takes in their younger lives with photos and home movies that capture a full domestic, romantic and social life in a time when exposure might mean ruin, even imprisonment. That Donahue was a member of the all-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the one pictured in “A League of Their Own,” is a historical bonus.

He was 67.

The news was confirmed by his friend, actress Liliana Greenfield-Sanders, and others on social media. “He was the funniest person on the planet,” she wrote. “I will miss him terribly.”

The Los Angeles native was born in 1952 and graduated from the American Film Institute in 1975. After working with Anne Bancroft on two projects at AFI, he was introduced to her husband, Mel Brooks, and became his assistant on the 1977 film “High Anxiety.”

Cornfeld went on to work with the couple on several more projects and got his first executive producing credit on Brooks’ 1980 film “The Elephant Man.”

In the early days of his career, he produced “National Lampoon’s European Vacation” (1985), David Cronenberg’s “The Fly” (1986), Steven Soderbergh’s “Kafka” (1991) and Guillermo Del Toro’s “Mimic” (1997). He also had bit parts in several movies including “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” in which he played the Pirate King of Captain Hook Fish ’n’ Chips.

In 1999 he teamed with Stiller to launch Red Hour Films, under which they enjoyed success with the comedies “Zoolander” (2001), “Duplex” (2003), “Starsky & Hutch” (2004), “Dodgeball” (2004), “Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny” (2006), “Blades of Glory” (2007) and “Tropic Thunder” (2008), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Robert Downey Jr. and won best comedy at the Broadcast Critics Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards.

“A really great person left the planet today,” Stiller said on Twitter. “Stuart Cornfeld ... was my friend, producing partner and creative confidant. He knew movies, made movies and loved movies. World = less better without him.”

Toward the end of his career, Cornfeld produced Jack Black’s 2017 film “The Polka King” and did some work in television. He was awarded the Franklin J. Schaffner Alumni Medal by AFI in 2013 and most recently produced the documentary “Have a Good Trip: Adventures in Psychedelics” for Netflix.

Scottthe New York Timesfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'A.O. Scottthe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'A.O. Scottthe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"The opening scenes of the filmed version of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” which started streaming on Disney Plus on Friday, pull you back in time to two distinct periods.

The people onstage, in their breeches and brass-buttoned coats, belong to the New York of 1776. That is when a 19-year-old freshly arrived from the Caribbean — the “bastard, immigrant, son of a whore” who shares his name with the show — makes his move and takes his shot, joining up with a squad of anti-British revolutionaries and eventually finding his way to George Washington’s right hand and the front of the $10 bill.

But this Hamilton, played with relentless energy and sly charm by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the music, book and lyrics, also belongs to the New York of 2016. Filmed (by the show’s director, Thomas Kail, and cinematographer Declan Quinn) in front of a live audience at the Richard Rodgers Theater in June of that year, the movie, while not strictly speaking a documentary, is nonetheless a document of its moment. It evokes a swirl of ideas, debates, dreams and assumptions that can feel, in the present moment, as elusive as the intrigue and ideological sparring of the late 1700s.

“Hamilton” may be the supreme artistic expression of an Obama-era ideal of progressive, multicultural patriotism.

Casting Black and Latino actors as the Founding Fathers and their allies was much more than a gesture of inclusiveness. The show’s argument, woven through songs that brilliantly synthesized hip hop, show tunes and every flavour of pop, was that American history is an open book. Any of us should be able to write ourselves into it.

Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury and an architect of the U.S. banking system, was Miranda’s chosen embodiment of this belief: an outsider with no money and scant connections who propelled himself into the centre of the national narrative through sheer brains, talent and drive. Miranda shares some of his hero’s ambition and intelligence, and turns Hamilton into an avatar of modern American aspiration.

“Hamilton” is a brilliant feat of historical imagination, which isn’t the same as a history lesson. Miranda used Ron Chernow’s dad-lit doorstop the way Shakespeare drew on Holinshed’s Chronicles — as a treasure trove of character, anecdote and dramatic raw material. One of the marvels of the show is the way it brings long-dead, legend-shrouded people to vivid and sympathetic life. The close-ups and camera movements in this version enhance the charisma of the performers, adding a dimension of intimacy that compensates for the lost electricity of the live theatrical experience.

The glib, dandyish Thomas Jefferson (Daveed Diggs) is a perfect foil for Hamilton: his rival, his intellectual equal and his sometimes reluctant partner in the construction of a new political order. The duplicitous Aaron Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) may be the most Shakespearean figure in the pageant, a gifted man tormented and ultimately undone by his failure to make himself matter.

Not that public affairs are the only forces that move “Hamilton.” I haven’t forgotten the Schuyler sisters, who have some of the best numbers and who somewhat undermine the patriarchal, great-man tendencies inherent in this kind of undertaking. Angelica Schuyler (the magnificent Renée Elise Goldsberry), the oldest of the three sisters, is a freethinker and a feminist constrained by the narrowness of the options available to women of her time and class. Her sister Eliza (Phillipa Soo), who marries Alexander, is saved from being reduced to a passive, suffering figure by the emotional richness of her songs.

Still, the personal and the political don’t entirely balance. The biographical details are necessary to the structure and texture of the show, but it is fuelled by cabinet debates and pamphlet wars, by high rhetoric and backroom dealing, by the glory and complexity of self-government.

“Hamilton” is motivated, above all, by a faith in the self-correcting potential of the American experiment, by the old and noble idea that a usable past — and therefore a more perfect future — can be fashioned from a record that bristles with violence, injustice and contradiction. The optimism of this vision, filtered through a sensibility as generous as Miranda’s, is inspiring.

It is also heartbreaking. One lesson that the past few years should have taught — or reconfirmed — is that there aren’t any good old days. We can’t go back to 1789 or 2016 or any other year to escape from the failures that plague us now. This four-year-old performance of “Hamilton,” viewed without nostalgia, feels more vital, more challenging than ever.

Read', 'Alexis Soloskithe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Alexis Soloskithe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"“Unsolved Mysteries,” the alternately chilling and far-out docuseries that returned to TV this week, began with a solved one.

In the fall of 1982, William Catterson, a New Jersey father of two, failed to return home from his fast-food job. His car was found, abandoned. A chocolate cake, an anniversary present for his wife, still rested on the passenger seat. Two years later, writer and producer Terry Dunn Meurer included his case in an HBO documentary: “Missing Persons: Four True Stories.” Catterson, who had faked his own disappearance, saw it. He turned himself in to police, then reunited with his family.

“And I was like, ‘Wow, that’s interesting,’” Meurer said. She and her producing partner, John Cosgrove, began to imagine a series that would not only televise have-you-seen-this-person enigmas and criminological riddles but maybe also crack them, too.

“Unsolved Mysteries” debuted on NBC in 1988 as part of a late-’80s tabloid TV boom and endured for decades on various networks and cable channels.

It had murders and missing persons. Also ghosts, Bigfoot and assorted UFOs. A cadaverous Robert Stack hosted. Eerie theme music gave even hardened viewers the heebie-jeebies. A pick-and-mix format alternated melodramatic crime stories and supernatural thrillers, arguably presaging both pulpy newsmagazines like “Dateline” and paranoid dramas like “The X-Files.”

Now Netflix has brought it back. The new “Unsolved Mysteries,” which reunites much of the original creative team, debuted Wednesday with a six-episode batch, to be followed by at least six more instalments later this year. It arrives in an America it anticipated: a crime-obsessed, conspiracy-minded nation with increasingly subjective notions about truth.

The format has changed, but the blend of fact and folklore remains. It is a combination that risks trivializing actual crimes by juxtaposing them with wilder content and legitimizing the uncanny through proximity to fact. Not that the creators see it that way.

“We like the mix,” Meurer said brightly. “We’ve always thought of ourselves as a mystery show, not as a true-crime show.”

From the beginning, competing impulses powered “Unsolved Mysteries”: a crusading compulsion to seek justice and a market-driven need to entertain. The show leaned heavily on reliable tabloid conventions — lost loves, missing heirs, unexplained deaths, medical mysteries — and many of the segments varied first-person interviews with best-guess re-enactments, some of them lurid. Paranormal cases and alternate histories made the counterfactual (a conspiracy theory about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, Bigfoot) into just another puzzle.

“We just came up with every single type of mystery that we could think of: UFO, paranormal, ghost stories, miracles, past lives, psychics,” Meurer said. “We just mixed it all in with the crime.”

On NBC, “Unsolved Mysteries” began with a disclaimer: “This program is about unsolved mysteries. Whenever possible, the actual family members and police officials have participated in recreating the events. What you are about to see is not a news broadcast.”

So it was not news. Not exactly. But as crowdsourced detection, the series worked.

In the ’80s and ’90s, as an episode aired, viewer tips would pour into the show’s call centre. Of the solvable mysteries — a missing child, say, or unidentified remains — the show counts more than 260 as resolved, a clearance rate of about 34 per cent. (“Bigfoot isn’t necessarily solvable,” Meurer said.) Some of those solutions came via viewer tips. After a Friday night broadcast in 1988 about fugitives Missy Munday and Jerry Strickland, a flood of calls had already led to their arrest by Saturday morning.

After nine seasons on NBC, the show moved to CBS, then to Lifetime in an attenuated form, then to Spike, which repackaged old episodes and added Dennis Farina as a tan, tough-guy narrator. The Spike stint ended in 2010, but “Unsolved Mysteries” did not disappear. Its website and cold case forums remained open. Old episodes popped up, unofficially and then officially, on YouTube. Amazon began streaming them in 2017.

Meurer never gave up on a revival. “There’s always mysteries that need to be solved,” she said. When the hit Netflix drama “Stranger Things” premiered in 2016, she noticed tweets and Facebook posts comparing that scripted series, which is set in the ’80s and goes big on the paranormal, to “Unsolved Mysteries.” So she brought a pitch to its producers at 21 Laps Entertainment.

Shawn Levy, who founded 21 Laps, had watched the original “Unsolved Mysteries” in college, admiring the way it meshed genre mystery with character-driven story. “There’s a finite number of true iconic brands in the world, especially in the world of storytelling,” he said. “‘Unsolved Mysteries’ is a true icon.” (He also called it “the Holy Grail of IP.”) Levy, whose company has a deal with Netflix, came on as an executive producer, as did Josh Barry, president of 21 Laps.

Levy wanted to honour what he called the “DNA” of the original show, though longtime viewers will immediately recognize changes. Feeling that Stack, who died in 2003, was irreplaceable, producers omitted a host. Gone, too, is the party-platter format of the ’80s and ’90s, in which calamity followed calamity, separated only by commercial breaks. Now each episode, which runs 50 minutes, give or take, centres on a single mystery. There are no commercials.

These episodes — three unexplained deaths, one missing person, one wanted man, one paranormal phenomenon — move closer to traditional documentary, with fewer re-enactments and a greater emphasis on interviews and archival sources. The show assumes a somewhat more sophisticated viewer with a far longer attention span. One episode — a family annihilation chiller — is presented almost entirely in French, with English subtitles.

And the producers hope that a platform like Netflix, with its global reach and its more than 180 million subscribers, many of them now homebound, may lead to more solutions.

“The reach is so wide,” said Marcus A. Clarke, who directed several episodes of the new version.

That reach prodded Angel Rivera to participate in the first episode, “Mystery on the Rooftop.” In 2006, his brother, Rey Rivera, went missing. His body was found a week later in the conference room of a Baltimore hotel. A murder or a suicide? The medical examiner could not say.

“It’s not something that I ever readily shared with anyone,” Angel Rivera said. But he trusted the producers and described the interviews that Clarke had conducted as therapeutic.

“There was a sense of peace doing it,” he said. And the show, he believes, might prompt someone to come forward with information.

“We’ll get it out to more ears and eyes than we could ever possibly imagined,” he said. “For my parents, even for me, there’s that closure that we’re all looking for.”

Rivera did not mind that the same viewers who will scrutinize his brother’s death can also watch “Berkshires UFO,” an episode about close encounters in the Berkshire mountains in 1969. “I think it falls in line with what the brand is about,” he said.

In 2020, when politicians knowingly circulate alternative facts and conspiracy theories trend on TikTok, what does it mean for that brand to take a flexible approach to observable reality? “Unsolved Mysteries” did not create this fungible, disingenuous moment. But a show that puts aliens on the same epistemological footing as a murdered family does meet it.

This is not necessarily an act of bad faith — Meurer absolutely believes in the paranormal. “I’ve always felt that way, my whole life,” she said. And Clarke, who directed “Berkshires,” is a UFO enthusiast. He mentioned the Times’ reporting on the Pentagon’s recent release of three videos, filmed by Navy pilots, that show unidentified aerial phenomena.

“If at this point people don’t believe or understand that these things are real, they are in denial,” he said.

Levy, who described himself as “slightly to the skeptical end of that sliding scale,” enjoyed “Berkshires UFO.” But when pushed, he said he felt less certain about the show’s accommodating approach to the supernatural. “That is something that needs to be considered moving forward,” he said.

Another potential problem, for viewers if not necessarily the producers, is the show’s relationship with law enforcement. Cops were not necessarily the series’ heroes. After all, if a case made its way to “Unsolved Mysteries,” police had probably failed in some way.

But agencies have historically suggested mysteries to the show’s producers and sent officers to vet tips. Like the recently cancelled “Cops,” the series makes an implicit argument for law and order with its envisioning of a dangerous, anarchic world.

“We’ve always had a great reputation with law enforcement,” Meurer said.

Still, an episode in this new series, “No Ride Home,” explores a botched police investigation into what may have been a racially motivated crime. In 2004, Alonzo Brooks, a young Black man, disappeared after attending a party. After a police search failed, a search led by friends and family located his body.

A cause of death was not determined. In June, spurred by inquiries from “Unsolved Mysteries,” the FBI reopened his case, offering a $100,000 (U.S.) reward.

“We’ve been seeing a lot of people being kind of brought to justice from old cases and this is one that really deserves it,” Clarke said. “The family deserves it.”

Cynthia Bowles, a longtime story producer, thinks that the Brooks case could be solved. She also feels hopeful about the murder of Patrice Endres (the subject of the episode “13 Minutes”) and the disappearance of Lena Chapin (“Missing Witness”).

“They could all shake loose,” she said.

Ethical complications will not matter so much if the right tips come. If Brooks’ family — or Rivera’s or Endres’ or Chapin’s — gets answers, who will care about wiggly truth value or an outlook that sees the world through a camera lens, darkly?

“‘Unsolved Mysteries’ has always represented hope,” Meurer said. “That’s why we do the show: the hope is that we’re going to solve these cases.

“To me,” she added, “that mitigates the darkness.”

The year was 1943, he was soon to be stationed in London with the Royal Canadian Navy (still as a violinist) and — following part-time studies at the Royal Academy and Royal College of Music — to return to postwar Toronto and a long professional life facing orchestras.

It is never easy to explain what makes a real conductor. When I was in university a popular textbook was Max Rudolf’s “The Grammar of Conducting” (I still own a copy). I later had the opportunity to hear Rudolf himself conduct in Cincinnati, thanked him and was promptly told that following the conducting diagrams in his book was the barest beginning.

He was right, of course. Two conductors can use those same diagrams and produce greatly different results.

On another occasion I asked a member of the TSO what he considered to be the role of a conductor and, with the cynicism born of long experience, he replied, “to not get in the way.”

Feldbrill did not get in the way. He knew what it was like to play in orchestras and knew better than to treat them without respect for their knowledge.

His own knowledge was acquired more on the front lines than academically. Conducting is something you learn by doing, and he started doing it regularly while still in school.

Did he become a great conductor? No, he became a valuable conductor, championing the work of Canadian composers more than any of his contemporaries did.

He knew the composers on a personal level, worked with them on their premieres and during his decade as music director of the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra starting in 1958, he set a precedent that has sadly not been followed of making Canadian music a regular feature of his programming.

He did conduct internationally, mostly in England and Japan. In the latter country he became the first Canadian guest conductor at Tokyo’s National University of Art and Music in 1979. Throughout the 1980s he conducted and taught regularly in the Land of the Rising Sun.

It was back home in the true north, strong and free, that he made his mark, teaching and conducting at the University of Toronto and appearing with orchestras, both youth and professional, across the country.

His association with the TSO was particularly close, not only as a frequent guest but as sometime director of youth programming and founding conductor of the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra.

Although he never became the orchestra’s music director — recognizing that he was too much the hometown boy to be considered for the job — he stepped up at a critical point in its history, following the 1973 death of Karel Ancerl, to act as resident conductor during the search for Ancerl’s successor.

I think it broke his heart when the then-manager of the orchestra finally terminated his annual appearances at Roy Thomson Hall. He last conducted a full concert at the age of 83.

Seven years later he was still conducting at an Arts and Letters Club celebration of his 90th birthday. I was one of the speakers at that occasion, remarking that critics and conductors have at least one thing in common: we tend to outlive everyone else. When he died in Toronto on June 17, Victor Feldbrill was 96.",[]

Here’s what it has promised.,"['Ben Sisario', 'Bsben Sisariothe New York Timessat.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Ben Sisariothe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Ben Sisariothe New York Timessat.']",2020-07-04,"What’s the fastest way to put music industry money into the hands of its Black creators? A small Swedish synthesizer manufacturer has a plan.

Teenage Engineering, which makes sleekly designed, retro-sounding machines adored by dance-music producers, will soon begin sharing sales revenue with a set of Black musicians and other artists of colour in the United States in recognition of their role in popularizing the company’s products.

“This is not charity,” Emmy Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, said in an interview. “Not only is it the right thing to do, it is also good for our business.”

The U.S.-wide soul-searching in the wake of George Floyd’s death has been felt with particular acuteness in the music industry, which owes much of its wealth to the work of Black artists but has just a handful of Black executives in the most senior jobs. Scrutiny has brought the business together in rare ways, with corporate rivals taking part in passionate discussions over Zoom and major companies promising to diversify their ranks.

Still, a thread of anger and impatience remains palpable behind the scenes.

“If history is any indicator, this blows over,” said Troy Carter, a longtime music and technology executive who is now an adviser to the Prince estate.

Despite some cynicism about the promises for change, the predominant mood is one of a momentum that must be seized. Almost as quickly as the major labels made big pledges in the past few weeks, an advocacy group, the Black Music Action Coalition, was formed to hold those companies to account.

“One of our main motivations is not to allow the record companies to get away with pledging money and not pledging systemic change,” said Prophet, a manager of Asian Doll, Layton Greene and other acts, who is part of the group. “Even though their foot was not on the neck of George Floyd, that same systemic racism that plagues society plagues the music business.”

Here’s where the industry’s responses currently stand.

Pledges from the major labels

On June 2, a campaign begun by two young Black women who work in music, Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, paused the industry for a day of reflection and grew into an internet phenomenon under the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.

Within days, a deluge of donation promises from major music companies followed. Warner — backed by a foundation connected to its parent company — and Sony each pledged $100 million (U.S.) to charity. Universal committed $25 million and established a task force to examine its operations. Spotify, Apple, YouTube and SiriusXM made further pledges.

In tacit acknowledgment of the industry’s poor record of hiring minorities for top positions, each of the big labels has undertaken employment inclusion efforts. Sony and Warner began searching for top diversity officers in recent weeks; Universal began its diversity push in 2017.

Universal is also a partner with the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, which two years ago rocked the music world with a study finding scant representation of women in pop. Last week, the initiative said it would study the diversity of record labels, publishers, talent agencies, digital platforms and other companies.

“I think the findings will be shocking,” said Stacy L. Smith, an associate professor at USC who is the founder of the Annenberg initiative.

The term ‘urban’

One of the few concrete changes made so far has been contested. Three days after #BlackoutTuesday, Republic Records, a Universal label that is home to Drake and Ariana Grande, said it would stop using the word urban in department and job titles, calling it “outdated.”

That term, once used by radio stations to evoke sophistication, has come under fire as pigeonholing Black music and stunting the career growth of Black executives. Last month the Grammys renamed its urban contemporary album category “progressive R&B.”

Yet moves to retire “urban” have been called premature. Ethiopia Habtemariam, the president of Motown Records and a co-chair of Universal’s task force, said in an interview that addressing the word was not the task force’s first order of business. The greater goal, she said, was “to make sure we are creating a diverse environment at our company, making sure we have Black leadership across all of the industry. That’s the key.”

One complication: Many Black executives fully embrace the term, including Shawn Gee, the manager of the Roots, whose promotion company, Live Nation Urban, is a joint venture with the concert giant Live Nation Entertainment. The debate over “urban,” Gee said, is a distraction from the industry’s larger problem of a dearth of Black leaders.

“Who in these companies has been able to green light Black culture?” Gee said in an interview. “That’s where the real problem lies. The problem lies in the infrastructure, in the system — not in the word.”

Calls for Black leaders

One goal of the newly-formed Black Music Action Coalition — whose public letter was signed by artists including Pharrell Williams, Nicki Minaj, Travis Scott and Lady Gaga — was to address what it called “long-standing racial inequities in the music business.”

“There are not enough Black executives in the music business who have control of P&L,” said Binta Niambi Brown, a manager and executive who has worked with Chance the Rapper, referring to the profit and loss statements that measure a business’s finances. Brown, who is part of the coalition, added, “But they are required to explain Black culture to white executives who do run that.”

Carter, now of the Prince estate, became Spotify’s global head of creator services in 2016 — a high-ranking job covering all genres. But when he left two years later, Carter said, an Amazon executive offered him a job there as head of urban music.

“That is the bias that is automatically built into our business,” Carter said. “That if I am a Black executive, call me for the urban music job, which is completely unfair at the end of the day.”

An Amazon spokesperson denied Carter’s account, saying he “was never officially offered a role at Amazon.”

Looking back at old deals

Another question is the treatment of artist contracts from previous decades. Lisa A. Alter, a copyright lawyer who works on behalf of many older artists, said that in the past, Black artists routinely received poor contracts.

“Historically there was less robust representation of artists of colour from a legal point of view,” Alter said. “That resulted in an inability to get advice and negotiate strongly in certain areas — particularly the recoupment of advances and how royalties are calculated.”

Stories of poor contracts for older artists, particularly Black ones, are legion. Little Richard, for example, said that he waived his rights to many of his classic songs early in his career, though he regained them as part of a lawsuit settlement in the 1980s.

“I didn’t read my contracts right; I signed bad contracts,” he told the New York Times in a 1992 interview. “I paid dearly for it.”

One company, BMG Rights Management, a mid-size label and publishing group, has said it will review its past contracts to address “any inequities or anomalies.”

Yet the company’s pool of contracts is far shallower than that of any of the major labels, which have catalogues going back a century. BMG’s review also only covers its recording contracts, not those for music publishing, which are a majority of the company’s holdings.

In a statement, a Universal spokesperson said the company recognized “there is more work to be done” and is committed to looking into legacy contracts.

The Teenage Engineering plan

Compared to giant record companies and streaming platforms, Teenage Engineering is a tiny force. In 2018, it had about $11 million in net sales, according to its most recently disclosed financial statements.

But the company is positioning its revenue-sharing plan — which it is calling an artist fellowship — as a bold statement to recognize and quantify the contributions of artists of colour.

The program is set to begin Sept. 1, and Teenage Engineering’s contracts with artists are still being finalized. But Jesper Kouthoofd, its chief executive, said the company will pay at least 15 per cent of sales revenue to four acts when customers in the United States use special links to the company’s website. The four initial fellows are Underground Resistance, a long-running collective from Detroit; Suzi Analogue, from Miami; and VoltageCtrlR and Baseck, both of Los Angeles.

Other companies on music’s margins have drawn acclaim for their efforts to put more money in artists’ pockets. Bandcamp, an indie streaming and retail platform, has waived its fees on certain days during the pandemic. On Juneteenth, the site donated its share of sales to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

Parker, the company’s chief brand officer, declined to give specific terms of Teenage Engineering’s deals for the new program, but said the artists’ share of company revenues “could be anywhere from $100,000 a year to, in some cases, close to $1 million a year.”

“This will allow us,” Parker said, “to make a shift in the economic model immediately.”",[]
296,thestar,https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/2020/07/03/bob-dylan-has-a-lot-on-his-mind.html,Bob Dylan has a lot on his mind,"['Douglas Brinkley', 'Dbdouglas Brinkleythe New York Timesfri.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Douglas Brinkleythe New York Times', 'The New York Times', 'Douglas Brinkleythe New York Timesfri.']",2020-07-03,"A few years ago, sitting beneath shade trees in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., I had a two-hour discussion with Bob Dylan that touched on Malcolm X, the French Revolution, Franklin Roosevelt and World War II. At one juncture, he asked me what I knew about the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864. When I answered, “Not enough,” he got up from his folding chair, climbed into his tour bus, and came back five minutes later with photocopies describing how U.S. troops had butchered hundreds of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho in southeastern Colorado.

Given the nature of our relationship, I felt comfortable reaching out to him in April after, in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, he unexpectedly released his epic, 17-minute song “Murder Most Foul,” about the Kennedy assassination. Even though he hadn’t done a major interview outside of his own website since winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, he agreed to a phone chat from his Malibu home, which turned out to be his only interview before next Friday’s release of “Rough and Rowdy Ways,” his first album of original songs since “Tempest” in 2012.

Like most conversations with Dylan, “Rough and Rowdy Ways” covers complex territory: trances and hymns, defiant blues, love longings, comic juxtapositions, prankster wordplay, patriotic ardour, maverick steadfastness, lyrical Cubism, twilight-age reflections and spiritual contentment.

In the high-octane showstopper “Goodbye Jimmy Reed,” Dylan honours the Mississippi bluesman with dragon-fierce harmonica riffs and bawdy lyrics. In the slow blues “Crossing the Rubicon,” he feels “the bones beneath my skin” and considers his options before death: “Three miles north of purgatory — one step from the great beyond/I prayed to the cross and I kissed the girls and I crossed the Rubicon.”

“Mother of Muses” is a hymn to the natural world, gospel choirs and military men like William Tecumseh Sherman and George Patton, “who cleared the path for Presley to sing/who cleared the path for Martin Luther King.” And “Key West (Philosopher’s Pirate),” is an ethereal meditation on immortality set on a drive down Route 1 to the Florida Keys, with Donnie Herron’s accordion channelling the Band’s Garth Hudson. In it he pays homage to, “Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac.”

Perhaps someday he’ll write a song or paint a picture to honour George Floyd. In the 1960s and 1970s, following the work of black leaders of the civil rights movement, Dylan also worked to expose the arrogance of white privilege and the viciousness of racial hatred in America through songs like “George Jackson,” “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” and “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.” One of his most fierce lines about policing and race came in his 1976 ballad “Hurricane”: “In Paterson that’s just the way things go/If you’re Black you might as well not show up on the street/Unless you want to draw the heat.”

I had a brief followup with Dylan, 79, one day after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. Clearly shaken by the horror that had occurred in his home state, he sounded depressed. “It sickened me no end to see George tortured to death like that,” he said. “It was beyond ugly. Let’s hope that justice comes swift for the Floyd family and for the nation.”

These are edited excerpts from the two conversations.

Was “Murder Most Foul” written as a nostalgic eulogy for a long-lost time?

To me it’s not nostalgic. I don’t think of “Murder Most Foul” as a glorification of the past or some kind of send-off to a lost age. It speaks to me in the moment. It always did, especially when I was writing the lyrics out.

Somebody auctioned off a sheaf of unpublished transcripts in the 1990s that you wrote about J.F.K.’s murder. Were those prose notes for an essay or were you hoping to write a song like “Murder Most Foul” for a long time?

I’m not aware of ever wanting to write a song about J.F.K. A lot of those auctioned-off documents have been forged. The forgeries are easy to spot because somebody always signs my name on the bottom.

Were you surprised that this 17-minute-long song was your first No. 1 Billboard hit?

I was, yeah.

“I Contain Multitudes” has a powerful line: “I sleep with life and death in the same bed.” I suppose we all feel that way when we hit a certain age. Do you think about mortality often?

I think about the death of the human race. The long strange trip of the naked ape. Not to be light on it, but everybody’s life is so transient. Every human being, no matter how strong or mighty, is frail when it comes to death. I think about it in general terms, not in a personal way.

There is a lot of apocalyptic sentiment in “Murder Most Foul.” Are you worried that in 2020 we’re past the point of no return? That technology and hyper-industrialization are going to work against human life on Earth?

Sure, there’s a lot of reasons to be apprehensive about that. There’s definitely a lot more anxiety and nervousness around now than there used to be. But that only applies to people of a certain age like me and you, Doug. We have a tendency to live in the past, but that’s only us. Youngsters don’t have that tendency. They have no past, so all they know is what they see and hear, and they’ll believe anything. In 20 or 30 years from now, they’ll be at the forefront. When you see somebody that is 10 years old, he’s going to be in control in 20 or 30 years, and he won’t have a clue about the world we knew. Young people who are in their teens now have no memory lane to remember. So it’s probably best to get into that mindset as soon as we can, because that’s going to be the reality.

As far as technology goes, it makes everybody vulnerable. But young people don’t think like that. They could care less. Telecommunications and advanced technology is the world they were born into. Our world is already obsolete.

A line in “False Prophet” — “I’m the last of the best — you can bury the rest” — reminded me of the recent deaths of John Prine and Little Richard. Did you listen to their music after they passed as a kind of tribute?

Both of those guys were triumphant in their work. They don’t need anybody doing tributes. Everybody knows what they did and who they were. And they deserve all the respect and acclaim that they received. No doubt about it. But Little Richard I grew up with. And he was there before me. Lit a match under me. Tuned me into things I never would have known on my own. So I think of him differently. John came after me. So it’s not the same thing. I acknowledge them differently.

Why didn’t more people pay attention to Little Richard’s gospel music?

Probably because gospel music is the music of good news and in these days there just isn’t any. Good news in today’s world is like a fugitive, treated like a hoodlum and put on the run. Castigated. All we see is good-for-nothing news. And we have to thank the media industry for that. It stirs people up. Gossip and dirty laundry. Dark news that depresses and horrifies you.

On the other hand, gospel news is exemplary. It can give you courage. You can pace your life accordingly, or try to, anyway. And you can do it with honour and principles. There are theories of truth in gospel but to most people it’s unimportant. Their lives are lived out too fast. Too many bad influences. Sex and politics and murder is the way to go if you want to get people’s attention. It excites us, that’s our problem.

Little Richard was a great gospel singer. But I think he was looked at as an outsider or an interloper in the gospel world. They didn’t accept him there. And of course the rock ‘n’ roll world wanted to keep him singing “Good Golly, Miss Molly.” So his gospel music wasn’t accepted in either world. I think the same thing happened to Sister Rosetta Tharpe. I can’t imagine either of them being bothered too much about it. Both are what we used to call people of high character. Genuine, plenty talented and who knew themselves, weren’t swayed by anything from the outside. Little Richard, I know was like that.

But so was Robert Johnson, even more so. Robert was one of the most inventive geniuses of all time. But he probably had no audience to speak of. He was so far ahead of his time that we still haven’t caught up with him. His status today couldn’t be any higher. Yet in his day, his songs must have confused people. It just goes to show you that great people follow their own path.

On the album “Tempest” you perform “Roll on John” as a tribute to John Lennon. Is there another person you’d like to write a ballad for?

Those kinds of songs for me just come out of the blue, out of thin air. I never plan to write any of them. But in saying that, there are certain public figures that are just in your subconscious for one reason or another. None of those songs with designated names are intentionally written. They just fall down from space. I’m just as bewildered as anybody else as to why I write them. The folk tradition has a long history of songs about people, though. John Henry, Mr. Garfield, Roosevelt. I guess I’m just locked into that tradition.

You honour many great recording artists in your songs. Your mention of Don Henley and Glenn Frey on “Murder Most Foul” came off as a bit of a surprise to me. What Eagles songs do you enjoy the most?

“New Kid in Town,” “Life in the Fast Lane,” “Pretty Maids All in a Row.” That could be one of the best songs ever.

You also refer to Art Pepper, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz in “Murder Most Foul.” How has jazz inspired you as a songwriter and poet over your long career? Are there jazz artists you’ve been listening to lately?

Maybe Miles’s early stuff on Capitol Records. But what’s jazz? Dixieland, bebop, high-speed fusion? What do you call jazz? Is it Sonny Rollins? I like Sonny’s calypso stuff but is that jazz? Jo Stafford, Joni James, Kay Starr — I think they were all jazz singers. King Pleasure, that’s my idea of a jazz singer. I don’t know, you can put anything into that category. Jazz goes back to the Roaring Twenties. Paul Whiteman was called the king of jazz. I’m sure if you asked Lester Young he wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.

Has any of it ever inspired me? Well yeah. Probably a lot. Ella Fitzgerald as a singer inspires me. Oscar Peterson as a piano player, absolutely. Has any of it inspired me as a songwriter? Yeah, “Ruby, My Dear” by Monk. That song set me off in some direction to do something along those lines. I remember listening to that over and over.

What role does improvisation play in your music?

None at all. There’s no way you can change the nature of a song once you’ve invented it. You can set different guitar or piano patterns upon the structural lines and go from there, but that’s not improvisation. Improvisation leaves you open to good or bad performances and the idea is to stay consistent. You basically play the same thing time after time in the most perfect way you can.

“I Contain Multitudes” is surprisingly autobiographical in parts. The last two verses exude a take-no-prisoners stoicism while the rest of the song is a humorous confessional. Did you have fun grappling with contradictory impulses of yourself and human nature in general?

I didn’t really have to grapple much. It’s the kind of thing where you pile up stream-of-consciousness verses and then leave it alone and come pull things out. In that particular song, the last few verses came first. So that’s where the song was going all along. Obviously, the catalyst for the song is the title line. It’s one of those where you write it on instinct. Kind of in a trance state. Most of my recent songs are like that. The lyrics are the real thing, tangible, they’re not metaphors. The songs seem to know themselves and they know that I can sing them, vocally and rhythmically. They kind of write themselves and count on me to sing them.

Once again in this song you name a lot of people. What made you decide to mention Anne Frank next to Indiana Jones?

Her story means a lot. It’s profound. And hard to articulate or paraphrase, especially in modern culture. Everybody’s got such a short attention span. But you’re taking Anne’s name out of context, she’s part of a trilogy. You could just as well ask, “What made you decide to include Indiana Jones or the Rolling Stones?” The names themselves are not solitary. It’s the combination of them that adds up to something more than their singular parts. To go too much into detail is irrelevant. The song is like a painting, you can’t see it all at once if you’re standing too close. The individual pieces are just part of a whole.

“I Contain Multitudes” is more like trance writing. Well, it’s not more like trance writing, it is trance writing. It’s the way I actually feel about things. It is my identity and I’m not going to question it, I am in no position to. Every line has a particular purpose. Somewhere in the universe those three names must have paid a price for what they represent and they’re locked together. And I can hardly explain that. Why or where or how, but those are the facts.

But Indiana Jones was a fictional character?

Yeah, but the John Williams score brought him to life. Without that music it wouldn’t have been much of a movie. It’s the music which makes Indy come alive. So that maybe is one of the reasons he is in the song. I don’t know, all three names came at once.

A reference to the Rolling Stones makes it into “I Contain Multitudes.” Just as a lark, which Stones songs do you wish you could’ve written?

Oh, I don’t know, maybe “Angie,” “Ventilator Blues” and what else, let me see. Oh yeah, “Wild Horses.”

Charlie Sexton began playing with you for a few years in 1999, and returned to the fold in 2009. What makes him such a special player? It’s as if you can read each other’s minds.

As far as Charlie goes, he can read anybody’s mind. Charlie, though, creates songs and sings them as well, and he can play guitar to beat the band. There aren’t any of my songs that Charlie doesn’t feel part of and he’s always played great with me. “False Prophet” is only one of three 12-bar structural things on this record. Charlie is good on all the songs. He’s not a show-off guitar player, although he can do that if he wants. He’s very restrained in his playing but can be explosive when he wants to be. It’s a classic style of playing. Very old school. He inhabits a song rather than attacking it. He’s always done that with me.

How have you spent the last couple of months home-sheltered in Malibu? Have you been able to weld or paint?

Yeah, a little bit.

Are you able to be musically creative while at home? Do you play piano and tool around in your private studio?

I do that mostly in hotel rooms. A hotel room is the closest I get to a private studio.

Does having the Pacific Ocean in your backyard help you process the COVID-19 pandemic in a spiritual way? There is a theory called “blue mind” which believes that living near water is a health curative.

Yeah, I can believe that. “Cool Water,” “Many Rivers to Cross,” “How Deep Is the Ocean.” I hear any of those songs and it’s like some kind of cure. I don’t know what for, but a cure for something that I don’t even know I have. A fix of some kind. It’s like a spiritual thing. Water is a spiritual thing. I never heard of “blue mind” before. Sounds like it could be some kind of slow blues song. Something Van Morrison would write. Maybe he has, I don’t know.

It’s too bad that just when the play “Girl From the North Country,” which features your music, was getting rave reviews, production had to shutter because of COVID-19. Have you seen the play or watched the video of it?

Sure, I’ve seen it and it affected me. I saw it as an anonymous spectator, not as someone who had anything to do with it. I just let it happen. The play had me crying at the end. I can’t even say why. When the curtain came down, I was stunned. I really was. Too bad Broadway shut down because I wanted to see it again.

Do you think of this pandemic in almost biblical terms? A plague that has swept the land?

I think it’s a forerunner of something else to come. It’s an invasion for sure, and it’s widespread, but biblical? You mean like some kind of warning sign for people to repent of their wrongdoings? That would imply that the world is in line for some sort of divine punishment. Extreme arrogance can have some disastrous penalties. Maybe we are on the eve of destruction. There are numerous ways you can think about this virus. I think you just have to let it run its course.

Out of all your compositions, “When I Paint My Masterpiece” has grown on me over the years. What made you bring it back to the forefront of recent concerts?

It’s grown on me as well. I think this song has something to do with the classical world, something that’s out of reach. Someplace you’d like to be beyond your experience. Something that is so supreme and first rate that you could never come back down from the mountain. That you’ve achieved the unthinkable. That’s what the song tries to say, and you’d have to put it in that context. In saying that though, even if you do paint your masterpiece, what will you do then? Well, obviously you have to paint another masterpiece. So it could become some kind of never ending cycle, a trap of some kind. The song doesn’t say that though.

A few years ago I saw you play a bluegrass-sounding version of “Summer Days.” Have you ever thought about recording a bluegrass album?

I’ve never thought about that. Bluegrass music is mysterious and deep rooted and you almost have to be born playing it. Just because you are a great singer, or a great this or that doesn’t mean you can be in a bluegrass band. It’s almost like classical music. It’s harmonic and meditative, but it’s out for blood. If you ever heard the Osborne Brothers, then you know what I mean. It’s an unforgiving music and you can only it stretch so far. Beatles songs played in a bluegrass style don’t make any sense. It’s the wrong repertoire, and that’s been done. There are elements of bluegrass music for sure in what I play, especially the intensity and similar themes. But I don’t have the high tenor voice and we don’t have three-part harmony or consistent banjo. I listen to Bill Monroe a lot, but I more or less stick to what I can do best.

How is your health holding up? You seem to be fit as a fiddle. How do you keep mind and body working together in unison?

Oh, that’s the big question, isn’t it? How does anybody do it? Your mind and body go hand in hand. There has to be some kind of agreement. I like to think of the mind as spirit and the body as substance. How you integrate those two things, I have no idea. I just try to go on a straight line and stay on it, stay on the level.

“Just yesterday we confirmed two more shows. I think we’ll be open — whether it’s a music event or a DJ event or a corporate event or a movie — I believe we’ll be operating five days a week.”

The new venue will feature a 70-metre stage, LED walls and an initial 50 per cent capacity of “220 to 240 vehicles,” says Khabouth.

“We’re building a state-of-the-art stage,” Khabouth adds. “‘Stage’ meaning not just the actual physical stage, but the lighting, the production, the sound, the visuals, the massive LED wall so we can show movies as well. The quality is top-notch on all of it.”

He’s hoping to roll out the venue for corporate events and movies, although “our No. 1 target is to do as many concerts as possible.”

“It’s a venue that we really want to be proud of and be a statement in the city that something good can be outdoors,” said Khabouth.

“So it’s very crucial that we bring in some of the top people in the production world to put this thing together.”

Khabouth, who estimates his company has sunk “a half a million dollars” into the project, said the CityView Drive-In plans have been in the works for two months.

“Financially, it’s a big risk; it’s a huge risk because you could build it and not be able to do the bookings, or not be able to sell tickets,” says Khabouth, whose organization has 37 years of experience in operating and booking concert-driven clubs such as Rebel, and previously, The Guvernment and Kool Haus.

Tickets for the first two shows, starting at $45 per person — with a minimum of two admissions per vehicle — are now available via Ticketmaster, with A Tribe Called Red tickets on sale Monday.

Khabouth says people can bring their own food and non-alcoholic beverages, or they can order food for straight-to-vehicle delivery. There will also be a merchandise table for those who want to purchase masks.

One item that won’t be served, however, is alcohol.

“I did not want to do alcohol,” he says. “I did not want the liability. If there are four people in the vehicle and they order four drinks, what if the driver drinks all of them? I don’t want that responsibility.”

People will also be expected to stay in their vehicles, unless they need to use the restroom.

“So far, the city is saying that they have to be in their cars,” says Khabouth. “That could change by the end of July; there might be a big change, so people might be able to sit on the hoods of their cars.

“But we are taking every precaution and going by the book. For that reason, we’re at 50 per cent capacity.”

Restroom availability won’t be a problem: patrons will be able to walk across the street and use the Rebel facilities.

“We have more than a sufficient number of bathrooms, enough for 5,000 people,” says Khabouth.

Concertgoers can roll down their windows to listen to the performance or tune into FM88.1 for a limited-range Wi-Fi broadcast signal on their in-vehicle radios.

And Khabouth says the artists will perform full sets, with the only limitation being a curfew of 11 p.m. due to noise bylaws.

Khabouth says his organization is committed to running City-View Drive-in a minimum of three months and his aim is to operate the venue “five days a week” for concerts, DJs, movies and corporate bookings.

“We run the parking lot. So all the stage and lighting is paid for monthly,” says Khabouth. “It’s up to us: if it’s a great experience and we’re doing well, then we’re going to continue. I can’t see us not doing a few more months anyway.”

While Khabouth says this won’t solve a lot of the financial issues from the lack of live entertainment due to the pandemic — shut down since March 17 — but it’s solution he was happy to take a gamble on.

“Having 1,000 people come to a show is not going to save the day,” Khabouth says. “I think it’s more of us pivoting and keeping ourselves busy and continuing to have people employed, and just move forward with what we’re doing.

“We don’t want to be sitting on our hands, waiting for this thing to end, so we’re doing everything we can to do at the moment.

He’s encouraged by the attention it’s getting so far.

“I truly believe it’s going to be amazing and the amount of interest in it is insane,” says Khabouth.

“ People are excited and bands are excited to perform again. People are excited to come out and see things live again, because that doesn’t exist now.”",[]

Read', 'Gary Gerard Hamiltonthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Gary Gerard Hamiltonthe Associated Presswed.']",2020-07-08,"NEW YORK—Though it shares a title with her major label debut album, Sara Bareilles isn’t exactly telling her own story in the new streaming series “Little Voice.”

The Grammy Award-winner says the Apple TV+ show incorporates experiences of many striving artists while reflecting the diversity of its New York City setting.

“There are moments that are more inspired by my life rather than it being any sort of recreation of my journey.” Bareilles said. “This is an amalgamation of so many of the struggles that I’ve seen.”

The show from Bareilles, producer J.J. Abrams and writer-director Jessie Nelson follows a young singer named Bess King (Brittany O’Grady) as she navigates life and love while attempting to pursue her musical dreams.

It’s the first foray into television for both Bareilles and Nelson, who worked together on the Broadway musical “Waitress.” Bareilles said both want to keep making “hopeful art.”

“I love that Jessie and I both are very committed to making hopeful art — art that has a lot of heart and a lot of kindness and a lot of hope sort of woven into what we create,” said Bareilles. “It’s nice to be able to get an opportunity to tell stories about characters who are messy and make mistakes and are flawed and certainly are not perfect people, but that, in essence, are good people and they try to be good.”

Bareilles relished the novel experience of working in TV.

“I got to learn so much from this,” she said. “I felt very much like a newbie stepping in. They had to tell me, ‘Don’t stand in front of the lights on the set.’ I was like, ’Oh, my bad, my bad!”

Bareilles wrote original music for “Little Voice” and helped direct musical performances from O’Grady, who previously appeared on the musical series “Star.” The first three of 10 episodes premiere Friday.

Nelson, who directed five episodes, said that while the series comes at a time when Hollywood is working to amplify under-represented voices, diversity came naturally to this production.

“We really wanted to write a love letter to the music of New York, and if you’re going to do that authentically, you’re just organically going to have a diverse cast,” she said.

O’Grady praised the “true diversity” she encountered on set.

“You have the scenes in the retirement home: we had actors in their 90s on the set. We have actors who are on the spectrum. We have actors who are Black, white, Hispanic,” she said. “I think that it’s just an honest portrayal of what the real world is. So that makes me happy.”",[]

Read', 'Gregory Strongthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Gregory Strongthe Canadian Pressthu.']",2020-07-02,"In the new season of the documentary/reality TV show “Queen of the Oil Patch,” two-spirit Indigenous entrepreneur Massey Whiteknife embarks on an introspective, healing journey.

Whiteknife is a businessman in the northern Alberta oilsands and also a glamorous female recording artist known as “Iceis Rain.”

In season 2, which airs Sundays on APTN, Whiteknife moves to Edmonton and works on his mental health, while Ices Rain is curbing the clubbing lifestyle to focus on her next album.

The Canadian Press recently spoke with Whiteknife by phone from Edmonton to discuss the show and current events.

CP: What are you most proud of when it comes to season 2?

Whiteknife: There’s so many amazing moments but I like the fact that I was able to be exactly who I am and I didn’t have to face any scrutiny or anybody that was very aggressive in the process of filming, which was actually quite shocking. The camera crew was worried for me to dress up as Iceis Rain and walk down the street in daylight. They were scared because they thought, ‘Oh my God, what if somebody comes and gay-bashes you or what if somebody throws something at you?’ I would tell them, ‘Do you see the way you guys are feeling right now because you’re with me? That’s how me and my people — the (LGBTQ) people and the Indigenous people — feel every single time we walk out our door.’ That to them was just like — what a wake-up call. For you guys to have to feel this fear every day. It’s stressful. So for me, I told them this is why I’m doing what I’m doing. This is why I tell you guys no holds barred. Show everything in the show because I want people to see the successes that I have been able to achieve but I also want you guys to show the failures and the struggles that I also have to face every day.

CP: Have you faced discrimination in the oil patch and have you noticed more acceptance in the region since the show started?

Whiteknife: The way I came out was I did an anti-bullying show in Fort McMurray. I asked the companies that I work for if they would sponsor the event. When they found out what kind of event I was actually doing — like dressing up in drag and I was going to have drag queens — they didn’t care that the money I was raising was going to non-profit organizations, they cared about the fact that their name was going to be associated with somebody that was not only gay, but dressed up as a female. And I lost 10 of my largest clients. They just flat out told me, they said, ‘We are not going to be associated with this. We’re sorry but we’re cutting your contract.’ That started the struggle for me and Iceis and my company. I just said, ‘OK, well you know what, I don’t want to work with people like that anyway.’ Then when I did do the anti-bullying show, the local newspaper had put a thing on it and I ended up getting like 25 new clients because of it.

CP: Can entertainment serve as a blueprint to help people, especially in marginalized communities, cope through times of hardship?

Whiteknife: I think so. A perfect example, take for instance, Hollywood. If you look back in the day, the big movie companies wouldn’t allow to have a Black screenwriter. They wouldn’t allow to have a Black actress in a leading role and it wasn’t until one person finally stood up and said, ‘I’m the executive of this production company and we are going to have a Black lead actress.’ And it ruffled a lot of feathers in Hollywood. Just like in the oil sands, they’re like, ‘We’re not going to allow a female business owner run the company. We’re not going to have a female tell the men, the union people, what to do.’

But it wasn’t until somebody actually does it that people will start to calm down and realize that it’s no big deal and that we’re just human beings. Life goes on and we all have to face the same challenges of bidding, contracts, negotiations and profit margin.

CP: How much has the conversation changed on the anti-Indigenous racism front in the wake of recent examples of police brutality around the world?

Whiteknife: What I’ve noticed just personally in being here in Alberta is that there was a lot of vocal haters. There was a lot of people that were saying, especially to my friend, Chief Allan Adam, there was a lot of people that were coming forward saying he deserved it or he provoked it or that wasn’t racism. It’s that sort of ignorance that to me, left me shaking my head. How could somebody, by tackling another person to the ground and bashing their face in like that, be justifiable in any circumstance? That’s the kind of conversations that go on over here that we have to face. It’s sad but it is real.

CP: In season 2, the show’s protagonist deals with a self-improvement journey. Given the challenges in the world right now and many people looking within to be better versions of themselves, is that a topic that more people can relate to?

Whiteknife: Yes, absolutely. 100 per cent. Because right now it’s a struggle for me. I am open about my addictions on the show. I suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction and gambling. A lot of that stems from the sexual abuse that I endured when I was a child. The bottle kind of helped me cope. It didn’t really help me though. It just made things worse. But right now with COVID, having to be isolated, there’s no resources available at all. I want to go to an AA meeting when I’m feeling like I’m going to fall off. Or that I’m feeling this stinking thinking where, ‘Right now a bottle of gin would be perfect.’ I don’t have the opportunity right now to go to an AA meeting because of social distancing and because they were all shut down. I pray every night for my people because there are a lot of people right now that have internet that could go online and that can take an AA meeting. But there’s people that depended on those meetings to go to that were in smaller communities that don’t know how to use the internet or don’t have access to the internet. So it is really hard.

The women of Netflix’s version totally get it,"['Yvonne Villarreal', 'Yvyvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.', 'July', 'Min. Read', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Times', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Yvonne Villarreallos Angeles Timesthu.']",2020-07-02,"Countless women who came of age in the 1980s and ’90s have memories of “The Baby-Sitters Club” books that provoke a nostalgic, pastel-hued wave of heart-eyed emojis.

Rachel Shukert, a producer and writer known for her work on “GLOW” and “Supergirl,” received the first book as a birthday present. Scanning the description on the back cover, Shukert, then in elementary school, wasn’t all that intrigued. But one uneventful afternoon she finally cracked open “The Ghost at Dawn’s House,” book No. 9 in the series, clutching the ends of its warm, peach-toned cover with the same steady grip of a kid today clinging to a tablet. She was hooked.

An entire shelf inside her bubblegum-pink room at her family home in Omaha, Nebraska, was eventually jammed with the recognizable rainbow block of spines (“I kept them very separate and special from all the other books,” Shukert, now 40, says. “The shelf would get bigger and bigger since there were more and more books.”) During recess at Friedel Jewish Academy, on a knoll out of ear shot of the school, she and her friends would talk about the book series, trade copies and sometimes pretend to be the characters.

Growing up in a suburb of Springfield, Mass., Lucia Aniello, best known for her work on Comedy Central’s “Broad City,” vividly remembers how her insatiable appetite for the book series resulted in stacks of free pizza certificates as part of Pizza Hut’s Book It program, which rewarded kids for reading. (”My parents owned a pizza restaurant, so I couldn’t use them,” Aniello, 37, notes with a laugh. “I actually ended up kind of becoming popular and I would hand out free pizza slips because I had no use for them.”)

Still fresh is Aniello’s memory of lying in the family’s backyard hammock as a kid, reading book after book until the moon nudged the sun away.

Decades after those formative years reading about the plucky, ragtag group of middle-school babysitters in fictional Stoneybrook in the book series launched by author Ann M. Martin in 1986, Aniello and Shukert are now responsible for translating the franchise’s binge-reading power into a TV series for the streaming generation. (Shukert is the showrunner, while Aniello serves as a director and executive producer.)

Premiering Friday, the 10-episode reboot opens with a modern wink to an origin story as important to some as Spider-Man’s or Batman’s. Sporty seventh grader Kristy Thomas (Sophie Grace) watches as her single mom, Elizabeth (Alicia Silverstone), is in need of a sitter to watch her youngest son. Elizabeth huffs about young people these days being hard to get in touch with, as well as the high fees of internet-based babysitting services: “When I was a kid, my mother would just call some girl in the neighbourhood on a landline,” she says. “And she would answer, because it was part of the social contract.”

Kristy’s great idea is born: a babysitting club.

She enlists her shy bestie Mary Anne Spier (Malia Baker) as secretary, their artistic friend and neighbour Claudia Kishi (Momona Tamada) as vice-president, fashionable new girl from New York City, Stacey McGill (Shay Rudolph) as treasurer and eventually, environmentally conscious California transplant Dawn Schafer (Xochitl Gomez) as an alternate officer. (Claudia also serves as the resident BSC host because she has a phone — one of those now-vintage transparent landlines with brightly-colored hardware — in her room.)

“When I saw them all together for the first time, that was one of the top five moments of my life,” Shukert says. “Maybe ahead of my wedding, but after having my son.” The way she speaks with reverence about the series, it’s easy to believe she isn’t joking.

That adoration, steeped in childhood memories untouched by the corrosion of time, made for a surreal adaptation process. Shukert says rereading the original book series, which ran until 2000 and has sold more than 180 million copies, she was struck by how she remembered very specific details — like Stacey painting her toenails with pink polish accented by a green dot or Claudia having white tights with plaits all over them or how Eleanor Marshall, one of the kids the girls babysit, was allergic to strawberries. But what came more sharply into focus was how the girls’ environment and experiences shaped how they navigated the world. She points to Kristy as an example.

“She is viewed as being bossy and controlling and has to have all the ideas, and she’s such a leader,” Shukert says. “And then you think about Kristy in a kind of emotional context and she’s this kid whose dad walked out on her when she was, like, six years old and never called her and had no contact with her family. Her mom has done this on her own. And you’re like, of course she’s controlling. She needs to control her environment because her early life lacks a lot of control. I think I sort of didn’t see that as a kid, because why would you?”

In her early 30s when tapped to write the original book series, Martin has watched the literary saga get a Hollywood filter before. HBO had a short-lived adaptation in 1990 and there was a 1995 feature film, which starred ’90s all-stars Rachael Leigh Cook and Larisa Oleynik, that grossed less than $10 million (U.S.). Martin said it was important for her to be involved with the Netflix series, story-wise, from the beginning. She read scripts, offering the occasional note. (For example, in the sixth episode, Claudia’s grandmother Mimi mentions she doesn’t like peaches because she associates them with trauma in her childhood. Martin reminded Shukert that Claudia has an aunt named Peaches who is introduced in book No. 47.) She also visited the show’s set in Vancouver.

“I was just desperate for her approval,” says Shukert, who adds that she received a signed copy of her favourite book in the series, “Little Miss Stoneybrook ... and Dawn,” from Martin during production. “She’s such a huge figure in the lives of many women my age. It was kind of overwhelming.”

“I had a sort of ‘I’m not worthy,’ ‘Wayne’s World’-type response to her,” is how Aniello describes it.

The Netflix series manages to evoke a certain time-capsule quality — it’s infused with the books’ signature sherbet colour palette and the girls’ wardrobe seems yanked straight off the book covers — while also feeling current. Shukert and Aniello felt strongly that the girls should feel like an updated version of their literary counterparts, particularly when they’re using cellphones, without diluting their essence.

“It’s definitely for today’s viewers,” Martin, now 64, says over the phone from her home in upstate New York. “But I think it still retains all the parts of the (book) series that young kids fell in love with 35 years ago. Just listening to the things that the characters care about, looking at the way that they’re dressed, how they interact with each other. It’s my girls.”

That remains true even as the group became more diverse onscreen: Mary Anne is biracial, Claudia’s Japanese heritage comes more sharply into view and Dawn is Latinx.

“The series from the beginning has been about inclusivity,” Martin says. “We wanted to have a diverse cast of characters. So some of the characters have changed a little bit and I hope any kid who watches the show will find themselves when they see this Stoneybrook and the characters.”

A fundamental principal both Shukert and Aniello felt strongly about was infusing the young characters with as much dimension as they’ve given to the adult characters they’ve shaped on “GLOW” and “Broad City,” without sacrificing the angst of middle-school growing pains.

“I feel like ‘GLOW’ and ‘The Baby-Sitters Club’ share a lot of DNA, honestly,” says Shukert, while revealing that “GLOW’s” Dawn (Rebekka Johnson) and Stacey (Kimmy Gatewood) are named after “The Baby-Sitters Club” characters. “It’s this group of women, or girls, who are very different from one another, who come from different backgrounds, and they’re coming together with this shared vision of creating something larger than themselves and being something greater, and finding their power in each other.”

Adds Aniello: “We really wanted to make something for young girls that treated them like real people that weren’t glossy in any way. ‘Freaks and Geeks’ was a show we talked a lot about, how they felt as fully fleshed out as adult characters, they just happened to be younger.”

Read', 'David Bauderthe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'David Bauderthe Associated Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"NEW YORK—Fox News on Wednesday fired daytime news anchor Ed Henry after an investigation of sexual misconduct in the workplace.

The network said it had received a complaint last Thursday from an attorney about the misconduct. An outside investigator was hired and, based on the results of that probe, Fox fired Henry.

Henry, who co-anchored “America’s Newsroom” between the hours of 9 a.m. and noon on weekdays, had slowly rehabilitated his career on Fox following a four-month leave of absence that ended in 2016. That followed published reports of an extramarital affair that he had conducted with a Las Vegas cocktail waitress.

Fox offered no details of the complaint that resulted in Henry’s firing, only to say that it happened “years ago.” Henry could not immediately be reached for comment.

The alleged victim is represented by noted sexual harassment attorney Douglas Wigdor. He also would not provide any details of the case.

Henry’s former co-anchor, Sandra Smith, announced the firing on the air. Fox said she’ll continue in her role with rotating co-anchors until a full-time replacement is hired.

Henry, a former White House correspondent for Fox, was only recently elevated to the role on “America’s Newsroom.” He got the job after Bill Hemmer moved to Shepard Smith’s afternoon time slot.

In a memo to staff, Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace reminded employees of Fox’s 2017 overhaul of its human resources operation and the avenues they can follow with a sexual harassment complaint.

Fox’s late former chairman, Roger Ailes, was fired in 2016 following harassment allegations made by former anchor Gretchen Carlson. Prime-time anchor Bill O’Reilly lost his job a year later following the revelations of settlements reached with women who had complaints about his behaviour.",[]

Read', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Press', 'The Canadian Press', 'Victoria Ahearnthe Canadian Presswed.']",2020-07-01,"When “Canada’s Drag Race” starts its engines Thursday on Crave, it will be just as glittery and entertaining as the American version, say the judges.

But with the camp and “condragulations” comes an added level of resonance, as the series arrives just after Pride month and Canada Day, and amid the Black Lives Matter movement’s urgent calls for justice and more representation of marginalized voices, they add.

With that, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman, and Stacey McKenzie hope the series serves as an important “educational experience” that isn’t taken for granted.

“It’s entertaining, but it tells the stories of queer people and of drag artists in a way that humanizes us,” Bowyer-Chapman, an actor and activist, said in a phone interview.

“It peels back the layers of otherness or misconceptions that the general population — the status quo, heteronormative audiences — may place upon us. They may see us as this other thing, they may see drag queens as these beasts, these monsters. They may see Black, queer people as these very threatening femme queens, or whatever stories they tell themselves.

“And I think that through the beauty of this show and showcasing the artistry of drag, and getting to know who these individuals are on a deeply personal level through their interactions and experiences and them sharing their life stories on the show, it’s the perfect equalizer... It shows that we have so much more in common than what separates us.”

Like “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” the Canadian version is a competition series in which drag artists compete in a series of challenges for the title of the Next Drag Superstar and a grand prize of $100,000.

Bowyer-Chapman is on the main judging panel alongside McKenzie, who is a supermodel, runway coach and “America’s Next Top Model” mentor; and Hytes, who was the first Canadian competitor to be featured on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and placed second on the show.

Singer Deborah Cox and actors Elisha Cuthbert, Tom Green, and Amanda Brugel are among the celebrity guests in the episodes, which roll out weekly.

The core of the show is the same as the American one, minus RuPaul, said the judges. And there are some “Canadian nuggets,” including a giant, glittery maple leaf on set.

“The show is so important for Canadian queens because it gives them something to work towards. It gives them a goal, it gives them a dream,” said Hytes, a classically trained ballet dancer and model who’s performed around Canada and the U.S. Hytes is the drag queen persona of Toronto-raised performer Brock Hayhoe.

“That’s the reason I left Canada to go to the States, is because I wanted to get on ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ and because in Canada, I didn’t have any more goals left, I didn’t have anything to aspire towards.... And now we’re bringing that dream to Canada and bringing it to all these amazing queens who work so hard.”

In trying to inspire the queens, the judges found themselves also learning a thing or two.

“I definitely learned how to do better makeup,” McKenzie said with a laugh, adding that they were also inspired by the queens’ bravery, resiliency, and willingness to be vulnerable.

“The way they took the critiques was really refreshing. As a person who has worked on quite a few reality shows, competition shows similar to ‘Drag Race’ — I have never met a group of competitors who were just so open and so hungry to learn. They put aside all the their egos, all their high and mightiness.”

As Bowyer-Chapman put it, the only way the LGBTQ and Black Lives Matter movements can endure is for people to educate themselves.

And shows like “Canada’s Drag Race” can help with that, “so that we don’t repeat the same mistakes over and over and over again.”

“At this moment, it’s important for ‘Canada’s Drag Race’ audience, the young kids, to enjoy the celebration of our community while also paying respect and homage to the trailblazers who have come before us, who have made it possible for us to have a show like this,” said the former “Unreal” cast member, who’s been a guest judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” and is a vocal advocate for diversity and inclusion, particularly for people of colour and the LGBTQ community.

“And it’s important for older generations who watch the show, to be able to acknowledge the importance of having a show like this and to inspire others to consistently and continuously educate themselves and enlighten themselves — and to make it abundantly clear that ... our rights and a show like ‘Drag Race’ on the air is not something that can be taken for granted. It’s a gift and it’s a blessing, but it’s something that we’ve worked for and worked towards for generation after generation.”",[]

By this point in his career, Stephen King knows that the legions of loyal readers he addresses in his author’s notes will read anything he puts out. That he has continued to push his work into new territory only proves that he is a far more serious and “literary” author than his critics give him credit for. “If It Bleeds” is a kind of “odds and sods” of King’s latest shorter fictions, though the title piece, at just under 200 pages, could have been published as a novel. “If It Bleeds” features one of King’s favourite supporting characters, Holly Gibney, the tenacious private detective of the Mister Mercedes trilogy and “The Outsider,” here elevated to main-character status for the first time. The other novellas/long stories move nimbly between genres and tones, often in the same work, proving that King still has plenty of gas left in the tank — good news for us loyal readers.

From the Wreck by Jane Rawson

Picador, 272 pages, $19.99

In 1859, the passenger steamship “Admella” struck a submerged reef off the South Australia coast, a disaster that claimed the lives of most of those on board. Author Jane Rawson was researching the life of George Hills, an ancestor who survived the sinking, when she began to spin the incident into a fabulist story of a shape-shifting alien who saves Hills from drowning. “From the Wreck” follows Hills from the night before the sinking (he was a ship’s steward) to his troubled life as a disaster survivor haunted by his encounter with the otherworldly presence. A first-rate and deeply humane blend of historical fiction, fantasy, sci-fi and horror.

The Ghost in the House by Sara O’Leary

Doubleday, 190 pages, $22.95

This compact, eerie novel dives deep inside the metaphor of the ghost, a restless spirit bound to an earthbound location, by artfully employing a first-person ghost as narrator. Fay wakes up just before dawn lying on top of a piano, dressed in one of her husband’s shirts. Assuming she passed out drunk the night before, Fay wanders her dark Vancouver home trying to find her bedroom. Time seems to cut out and Fay is standing at the top of the stairs watching a girl she’s never seen before walking down the hallway. Thinking that she must be seeing a ghost, Fay soon realizes that she is the ghost. “The Ghost in the House” is short-story and children’s author Sara O’Leary’s debut novel. It may not satisfy some straight-up horror fans, but there is plenty here to haunt the imagination.

Home Before Dark by Riley Sager

Dutton, 400 pages, $36

In 2017, Riley Sager, the pseudonym for author and editor Todd Ritter, hit the bestseller lists with “Final Girls,” a fierce postmodern twist on the hoary horror trope (a “final girl” is the last woman standing in an ’80s slasher film). In “Home Before Dark,” Sager explores the dilemma of a different kind of survivor. Maggie Holt was only five when her family fled a haunted country manor house called Baneberry Hall after a mere 20 days of occupancy. Since then, Maggie’s life has been defined by the bestselling memoir her father wrote about the experience. When her father dies, she is shocked to discover that she has inherited Baneberry Hall and, despite her mother’s and father’s warnings, Maggie returns to the house to confront her past. Maggie is at times too much the Strong Female Protagonist, now a thriller/horror cliché in its own right, but “Home Before Dark” is a smart, page-turning work with special appeal for readers who, like me, love the haunted house sub-genre.

Stories are one of the ways we can work together to disrupt stereotypes and the “single stories” prevalant about people in our communities. Here are my summer book recommendations which I hope will help us all learn a little more about each other, dig deeper into important topics and build a love of reading.

Not My Idea: A Book about Whiteness

By Anastasia Higginbotham

Dottir Press, 64 pages, $28.50

“Not My Idea: A Book about Whiteness” explores white privilege and racism in an age appropriate way. It emphasizes the need to have these conversations with children, highlights everyday examples of differential treatment many black and racialized people experience and calls for actions that support racial justice. It disrupts ideas of colour blindness and shows us how we can move beyond simply teaching children to be kind. Children learn that even though these are big systemic issues, they can have an impact and work to make things fair for all.

Going Up

By Sherry J. Lee, illus. by Charlene Chua

Kids Can Press, 40 pages, $19.99

“Going Up” is a fun and creative story. It takes place in an apartment building and readers meet residents of various identities, abilities and lived experiences as they “go up” to a birthday party on the 10th floor. At each floor the elevator becomes more crowded but the excitement and happiness connects everyone. The word choice and illustrations gently disrupt the many stereotypes associated with various identities. Readers learn about the importance of building a community where all people are respected for their differences and feel a sense of belonging.

You Matter

By Christian Robinson

Atheneum Books for Young Readers, 60 pages, $23.99

“You Matter” is a beautiful story that teaches us that, old or young, we matter and are connected. An important story because sometimes our identities can make us feel excluded, ignored and silenced. A great way to send the message that we “see” people in our communities, value them and acknowledge their different experiences. It is powerful to be “seen” completely for who we are and to know that we are respected and loved for all parts of ourselves. A very affirming story that reinforces our importance and self worth.

Read', 'Deirdre Baker Is The Author Of', 'Becca Fair', 'Foul.', 'Deirdre Baker Special To The Starfri.']",2020-06-26,"Summer is here and stories about the outdoors are apt, but under Covid-19, what do they mean?

Deborah Underwood’s “Outside In”, illustrated by Cindy Derby (Harcourt Houghton Mifflin, 32 pages, $24.99, ages 3-7), resonates even in the shadow of lockdown. “Once we were part of Outside and Outside was part of us,” begins this story aimed to tempt kids to explore nature. Instead, Underwood’s take on Outside shows ways nature reaches indoors — through sunlight, our clothes, even the water gushing from our taps. We might forget we’re part of nature, but Outside reminds us. A wonderfully perceptive mix of poetry, art, and environmental awareness.

Akiko Miyakoshi’s “I Dream of a Journey” (Kids Can, 32 pages, $18.99, ages 3-7) suits Covid-19 shut-in fatigue. “In my dreams I set off on a journey …” says a bear hotelier, and he dreams of travelling to places his guests have been, to beaches and windswept dunes. When he wakes from his colour-filled sleep, he’s back in his own hotel. There’s something eerie yet familiar in Miyakoshi’s muted art, the bear’s timid wanderlust, and travel that can happen only in dreams.

Deborah Hodge celebrates the real “Outside” in “West Coast Wild Babies,” with lose-yourself-in-them illustrations by Karen Reczuch (Groundwood, 32 pages, $19.95, ages 3-6). In simple language Hodge describes some of the Pacific coast’s many baby creatures — gray wolves, orcas, harbour seals, oystercatchers and more. Reczuch’s pellucid colours show the scene with idealized serenity (no “graveyard of the Pacific” tumult here), heightening natural beauty, baby life and security.

Ibram Kendi’s “Antiracist Baby,” illustrated by Ashley Lukashevsky (Kokila, 24 pages, $11.99, all ages), brings the vital issue of antiracism to babies and all readers in a jaunty, challenging board book. Here are nine clear steps to acting for and practicing racial equity. Kendi’s words are few but his content is deep: “open your eyes to all skin colours … use your words to talk about race …” With its acknowledgement that “Antiracist Baby is bred, not born,” this timely book can be a first step in discussing our own society.

Andrea Curtis explores nature in urban spaces in “A Forest in the City,” illustrated by Pierre Pratt (Groundwood, 40 pages, $19.95, ages 10 and up). In a direct, informative text, she tells us of urban trees and the perils posed by city soil, pollution, and neighbourly peccadilloes. Pratt’s illustrations balance the staid text with playfulness and humour, showing trees’ glorious greenery among and around humans’ busy ways. Pratt’s art conveys the joie-de-vivre trees bring; Curtis’s text provides the science.

In Rebecca Stead’s “The List of Things That Will Not Change” (Wendy Lamb, 224 pages, $22.99, ages 10-14), set in New York, Bea tells the story of her father’s wedding to his gay partner. To do it, she takes us back to the time of her parents’ divorce, her ensuing life in two homes, her bad spelling, and her efforts to befriend her step-sister. Stead is a marvel at ravelling up her tale through interlocking pieces, past and present, and here she’s at her best. Bea’s slow revelation of what’s in her heart happens with colourful, precise incident, each page deepening emotional intensity.

First Nations sleuths the “Mighty Muskrats” travel from their reservation to the city in Michael Hutchinson’s “The Case of the Missing Auntie” (Second Story, 181 pages, $10.95, ages 8-13). While they contend with city ways, they try to find out what happened to Grandpa’s sister, scooped by the government and adopted years ago. This quick, engaging mystery (indeed, the series) is a real gift to Canadian readers, most particularly for the Indigenous familial culture and social and historical realities it portrays.

A strong sense of place and down-to-earth narrator characterize Riel Nason’s “Waiting Under Water” (Scholastic, 216 pages, $8.99, ages 9-12). Loving her home on the Bay of Fundy, Hope is terrified when her family decides to move to Toronto. Her nervous tic worsens as departure day approaches, and in a refreshing plot twist, her parents change their plans.",[]

It’s abundant, highly decorated, and unafraid of extravagance, of stylistic excess: “The Mairs, the Mairs — what were they and why on earth? I have been collecting eccentric trueborn Nova Scotians my entire life but none compare, pound for pound, person for person, with the Titus Mairs of Tower Road. The Maritime provinces of Canada are saturated generally with peculiars — drunks, pundits, misfits, masterminds — but the Mairs were the oddest on record, functioning in the years of my childhood on an almost mythopoeic level.”

That unrestrained nature extends to size itself: nearly 400 pages, “Aubrey McKee” ends with “End Book One”; another four volumes will complete the series.

A book composed of fourteen exuberant, freewheeling stories, each focused on a peculiar “peculiar,” “Aubrey McKee” has “the insanity of being human” as a general theme. More specifically, this coming of age story also operates as a love letter, of a sour-sweet sort, to home. That’s Halifax, “a shabby little city … worn stale and flat in detail,” in the view of one source mentioned by the narrator, and an “evil village” and a place “obsessed with itself,” in the words of narrator Aubrey McKee’s sisters.

Whether he’s recalling his phase as “an indiscriminate teenage joiner” or as a marijuana salesman in the mid-1970s, Alex Pugsley’s narrator writes from the point of a man well settled into middle age who’s seeking lost time, place, and meaning. He says as much: “I have done by my to recover those moments, to display them as best I could and to display the mysteries — and people — who were to me the city’s truths.”

While McKee (who, like Pugsley, seems to have been born in 1963) can evaluate an incident in literary terms — as “a fantasia on Maritime themes — brilliancy, loss, nostalgia decay,” for example — he also conjures with fantastic, captivating detail a youth where parents, siblings, friends, and school jostle alongside episodes of municipal history (itself teeming with bootleggers, drug dealers, suicides, sanatorium habitués, eccentric scions of formerly grand families, and brothel keepers).

From ordinary incidents — a childhood acquaintance, marital strife, a wedding — as well as a few extraordinary ones, “Aubrey McKee” builds a dazzling and complicated world, a childhood in Halifax as a vibrant universe in itself. While Pugsley’s literary performance is an immediate delight, the portrait of the early days of a “wayward oddity” lingers long after.

Brett Josef Grubisic’s latest novel is “Oldness; Or, the Last-Ditch Efforts of Marcus O.”

By Cara Black

Soho, 360 pages, $35.95

Fans of Cara Black’s nineteen novels featuring the plucky Parisian private eye, Aimee Leduc, should now make way for Kate Rees, likewise plucky and likewise serving the cause of justice in Paris. But unlike the French Aimee of the 2000s, Kate is an American-born Allied spy operating in German-occupied Paris in June 1940.

Kate, a sharp shooter extraordinaire, is assigned to assassinate the Fuhrer himself when he makes an appearance at the Sacre-Coeur Cathedral in Montmartre. Kate’s shot misses — the bullet takes out a German admiral standing behind Hitler — and she spends the following hair-raising day and a half slipping around Paris, avoiding Nazis on her trail, seeking the undercover route to safety in England.

The story packs in all the Second War spy story staples: nasty Germans and nastier French collaborationists; traitors to the Allied cause and infiltrators of its espionage apparatus; cameo appearances by Churchill and multiple off-stage rants from the Fuhrer. All of this, in Black’s familiar style, is relentless, honest and immaculately researched.

Sister Dear

By Hannah Mary McKinnon

Mira, 360 pages, $23.99

The narrator, 30 and an IT wizard in Portland, Maine, has been hard done by. Just before the man she has always thought to be her dad died, she learned her biological father was actually a rich man-about-Portland. When she approaches him with love in her heart, he slams her out of his life. At that low point, she sets out to win a little justice and fair play.

What follows is a plot heavily weighted in red herrings, much misdirection and several fake leads. There’s a murder, but it comes so close to the book’s end that it’s almost meaningless. All the rest is expertly dodgy and entertaining.

Hurry Home

By Roz Nay

Simon & Schuster, 260 pages, $24.99

Sibling rivalry has seldom been so fraught.

Alex, the youngest sister by five years, has a solid job and a hunky live-in boyfriend in a Colorado town. Ruth, who split from Alex and the rest of the family ten years earlier, unexpectedly shows up. She’s loaded with awkward baggage: a stretch in prison, a stash of cocaine and money belonging to a sinister drug dealer who’s on her trail. Ruth is also five months pregnant.

Both sisters spin contrasting but believable lines of narrative explaining their contrasting life histories. As the dark and creepy story grows more complex with every chapter, the question becomes: which sister is speaking the truth? The answer finally arrives not without huge surprises for all concerned, the reader conspicuously included.

The Last Trial

By Scott Turow

Grand Central, 455 pages, $37

It seems only yesterday — it was actually July 1987 — when Scott Turow introduced Sandy Stern, the absolute ace of criminal attorneys, to American crime fiction. That was in “Presumed Innocent,” and now, many novels later, here is Stern back again. Despite his age (he’s 85) and various frailties, he performs gloriously in what may be Turow’s most legally complex book.

Stern’s client is a man of medicine who conceived a cancer cure that won him a Nobel Prize and made him a zillionaire. Now patients on his regimen are dying. The government charges him with a slew of crimes, fraud and murder not excluded. Everybody goes to court where we all stay, vastly entertained, for almost the entire book.

If law schools offer doctorates in criminal law, “The Last Trial” would seem to make a definitive textbook. It is amazingly instructive, and amid all the heavy-duty learning, Turow treats us to one chapter that is as darkly comic as anything he has written. Check it out. Chapter 19.",[]

By Marie-Andrée Gill, translated by Kristen Renee Miller

Book*hug, 88 pages, $18

Spare and image-driven, the poems in “Spawn” chart a young woman’s coming of age with a captivating mix of lyricism and earthy candour. Marie-Andrée Gill is Pekuakamishkueu, and grew up on the Mashteuiatsh Reserve on the shores of Lake Piekuakami (Lac Saint-Jean) in Quebec. She uses the life cycle of freshwater salmon, which inhabit the lake (hence the book’s title), as a frame for her own growth. There’s teen sex and partying, but also a yearning to connect to her heritage, despite the stifling effects of colonialism, conveyed in the image of “four cement teepees/engraved:/…drab procession/the story drawn, lifeless.” Gill often returns to the idea of lacking words (the original book was written in French, not her Indigenous language), and her effort “to lick the skin of the water/with a tongue I don’t speak.” In the end, there’s a sense of affirmation, beautifully expressed: “I know we are blue plumage/the symmetry of spruce/the language of hailstones.”

Roguelike

By Mathew Henderson

Anansi, 80 pages, $19.95

If you know that “roguelike” refers to a type of video game, you have an advantage in appreciating the ingenuity of Mathew Henderson’s second poetry collection. But being a non-gamer (as I am) isn’t an obstacle, primarily because the emotions driving the poems are so resonant. Henderson applies the tropes of role-playing games — particularly the structure of quests, traps and perils— to make sense of a painful family history. The speaker looks back on a mother who was addicted to narcotics and a father he struggles to see as a man and not just in his paternal role. His figurative language is striking and evocative: “You already knew how a house could pile/upon your chest, could pin you as sure as a railway spike,” he writes, an image that viscerally conveys the crushing weight of memories. At the heart of this powerful book is a longing to gain perspective and move on from a difficult past.

The Dyzgraphxst

By Canisia Lubrin

McClelland & Stewart, 166 pages, $21

Complex and kaleidoscopic in range, Canisia Lubrin’s second collection is a sweeping meditation on Black identity, the meaning of home and the rupture caused by slavery (as she puts it, “how many ways can you disappear/a people, dignity by dignity”). The meditations address a character called Jejeune, and sift through a lyric collage of recollections and reflections. Lubrin’s turns of phrase crackle with evocative immediacy, whether she’s describing the past (“the twisted timbres of a ship/from some unknown century”) or the present (climate change is “the scorching heat of a moneyed world”). She returns often to the connection of language to being, and the agency in speaking. Dysgraphia is the inability to write coherently, and by replacing the “i” in dyzgraphist with an “x” in the book’s title, Lubrin signals her ambitious quest to understand identity in historical context in both an individual and communal sense (in her words, “the ballasts of who we/are”).

The Tower

By Paul Legault

Coach House, 80 pages, $21.95

I started off a somewhat resistant reader of Paul Legault’s revamping, in 21st century style and queer sensibility, of W. B. Yeats’s classic “The Tower.” But Legault won me over, in part because he’s thematically faithful to Yeats’s anguish over mortality and disenchantment with the world, but also because he’s so entertaining. In Legault’s poems, that world is absurd, fixated on pop culture, celebrity and the banal preoccupations of our digital age, all of which he blithely skewers. “This is no country for old men” (the opening line of Yeats’s iconic “Sailing to Byzantium.”) becomes “This country’s too young to think —/…dying’s gotten old.” Like Yeats, Legault draws on mythology and the occult, albeit while eschewing lofty language, and he rambles cheerfully through the minutiae of television shows and fashion trends. But there’s also an underlying uneasiness about the future in the face of climate change: as Legault puts it, “Everything’s a little Cormac-McCarthyish.”",[]

Wiersema Is The Author', 'Most Recently', 'Of Seven Crow Stories.', 'Robert J. Wiersemaspecial To The Starsat.']",2020-06-06,"“All I Ask,” the debut novel from award-winning St. John’s short story writer Eva Crocker, begins with a violation. Twenty-something Stacey is still in bed when she is awakened by “the doorbell ringing and a pounding that shook the house.” Her roommate isn’t home, and she’s confronted with members of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, waving a warrant and barging into her house. She returns, repeatedly, to the fact that she isn’t wearing a bra, that she’s not wearing her contacts, so she can barely see, as she struggles to keep her cats inside while the men — all men — search her apartment for “illegal digital material.”

The novel opens with the chilling lines “They took my computer and phone so they could copy the contents. They called it a mirror image. They said it was the fastest way to prove I wasn’t the suspect and also I didn’t have a choice.”

That opening chapter seems, initially, to be the set-up for a particular sort of novel; it isn’t. While the police raid and its effects run throughout the story, they’re not what the story is about. “All I Ask” is a powerful coming of age cri de couer, rather than a thriller or novel of wrongful prosecution.

With sly wit and sharp emotional acuity, Crocker explores the next few months in the lives of Stacey and her circle, including her best friend Viv; Holly, the mysterious and alluring recent transplant to St. John’s; and Kris, who repairs bikes and with whom Stacey shares an instant chemistry. The novel delves deeply into Stacey’s life and past, everything from early sexual experiences to the cyclical changes in her body, while at the same time encompassing a vital, passionate and often fraught community.

This intimate immediacy not only connects the reader to the central characters — it opens the novel up to a broader generational examination.

Stacey and her friends live in a post-binary world, where old constructs of gender identity and sexual attraction, along with external moral judgement, no longer seem to exist. But it’s also a world of disenfranchisement and insecurity. While they all have training and degrees, the members of Stacey’s community are struggling to get by; Stacey herself, despite a theatre degree, works in the box office rather than on the stage, picking up occasional work voicing radio ads.

It’s a world of uncertainty set against a historical backdrop of the environmental protests against the controversial Muskrat Falls hydro-electric project in Labrador, and the not guilty verdict against Doug Snelgrove, a police officer accused of sexual assault. “On the stand, he said he’d known she was drunk; he said that he had sex with her while he was on duty, while he was in uniform with a gun attached to his pants.”

“All I Ask” unfolds with a casual, almost aimless quality, a slow drift through a series of moments in these lives. It’s a wickedly funny, sexy, joyous novel, threaded through with sadness, uncertainty, and emotional risk.

More than anything, though, it’s a novel that is unafraid to show its heart, always broken, always healing, always open.",[]

Soulpepper Theatre’s “The Brothers Size” took five awards in the general theatre division while “The Mush Hole,” from Kaha:wi Dance Theatre and Young People’s Theatre, took an equal number in the young audiences division.

The next biggest winner was the Canadian Opera Company’s “Rusalka,” which took four prizes in the opera division.

The awards were handed out by the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts in an online ceremony.

“The Brothers Size,” a play about two Black brothers in the Louisiana bayou by Oscar-winning screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (“Moonlight”), won Outstanding Production, Outstanding Direction for Mumbi Tindyebwa Otu and Outstanding Feature Performance for Daren A. Herbert. It also won for costume design and lighting.

The other winners in the general theatre division included Tarragon Theatre’s “Buffoon” by Anosh Irani, which took Outstanding New Play and Outstanding Lead Performance for Anand Rajaram. Soulpepper’s “Almighty Voice and His Wife” won for scenic design and “Julius Caesar,” from Groundling Theatre and Crow’s Theatre, for lighting design.

“The Mush Hole” is the nickname for the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, which operated as a boarding school for Indigenous children from 1829 to 1970.

The theatre production of that name, based on interviews and writings by survivors, won both Outstanding Production and Outstanding New Play as well as Outstanding Direction for Santee Smith, who also created it. It also took Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble and projection design.

The award for individual performance in the young audiences division went to Malindi Ayienga for Young People’s Theatre’s “You and I.”

In the musical theatre division, the prizes were shared among six productions, with “Caroline, or Change,” from Musical Stage Company and Obsidian Theatre, and “Ghost Quartet,” from Crow’s Theatre and Eclipse Theatre Company, taking two each.

Read', 'Mark Kennedythe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press', 'Mark Kennedythe Associated Pressmon.']",2020-06-29,"NEW YORK—The shutdown on Broadway has been extended again — until at least early January.

Although an exact date for performances to resume has yet to be determined, Broadway producers are now offering refunds and exchanges for tickets purchased for shows through Jan. 3.

“The Broadway experience can be deeply personal but it is also, crucially, communal,” said Thomas Schumacher, chairman of the board of The Broadway League, which represents producers.

“The alchemy of 1,000 strangers bonding into a single audience fuelling each performer on stage and behind the scenes will be possible again when Broadway theatres can safely host full houses,” he added. “The safety of our cast, crew, orchestra and audience is our highest priority and we look forward to returning to our stages only when it’s safe to do so.”

Broadway theatres abruptly closed on March 12, knocking out all shows — including 16 that were still scheduled to open — and postponing indefinitely the Tony Award schedule. Producers, citing health and city authorities, previously extended the shutdown to June 7 and then again to Sept. 6.

In London, producer Cameron Mackintosh has said his company’s West End productions of “Hamilton,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mary Poppins” and “Les Miserables” won’t reopen until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., has cancelled most previously announced performances and events through the end of 2020, as has the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston.

Broadway grossed $1.8 billion (U.S.) last season and attracted a record 15 million people. Producers and labour unions are discussing ways theatres can reopen safely.

The latest extension wipes away many shows planned for the fall. Many have just moved to next year, including a revival of “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster that was to start rehearsals on June 29 but will now open in May 2021.

Shows that were to open this spring have abandoned their plans, including “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” A production of “The Minutes” by Tracy Letts and “American Buffalo” by David Mamet will arrive on Broadway in Spring 2021, opening exactly one year after their originally scheduled opening dates.",[]

Follow Him On Twitter""]",2020-06-22,"The Canadian Opera Company has cancelled all of its in-person performances and events slated for this fall, including “Parsifal” and “The Marriage of Figaro,” due to continued limits on travel and large gatherings in Toronto in the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company’s production of Wagner’s “Parsifal” will be rescheduled for the 2022/23 season. “Marriage of Figaro” is simply cancelled. Also falling victim to the new rules is a popular free noon concert series and other events.

The remainder of the COC’s 2020/21 season is, for now, intended to proceed as planned, with Bizet’s “Carmen,” Verdi’s “La Traviata” and more still scheduled for January through May 2021.

The company’s spring 2020 season was cancelled in March as the pandemic arrived in Canada.

Since then, COC general director Alexander Neef said in Monday’s release, it’s been pondering what its near future could safely be, but “opera gathers talent from all around the world to work together in close quarters, requires an extensive rehearsal schedule, plenty of advance planning and — to remain economically viable — an auditorium full of people, without whom no live performance is complete.

“Taking all of these factors into account, plus the many unknowns around public health guidelines in the fall, this was the only viable course of action to ensure the continued safety of our artists, staff and audiences.”

The COC Ensemble Studio will continue to develop Canada’s top young opera artists by working remotely as required. The company says that in recent months its trainers have used digital resources to deliver vocal, diction, language, dramatic and performance kinetics coaching among others.

The cancellation of the COC’s first production of “Parsifal” will “come as a disappointment to many,” Neef said. “This production caps a decade-long, community-led effort to stage Wagner’s final work here.”

A recently commissioned production of “Fantasma,” by COC composer-in-residence Ian Cusson with libretto by Colleen Murphy and intended for young audiences, will be moved from December to sometime in spring 2021. The company is working to create webinars, interactive programming and other educational material in a digital format.

Options for affected ticket-holders range from tax receipts issued for ticket donation, converting ticket value to gift certificate credits that never expires, or full refunds; complete details are listed at coc.ca/FallTickets.

Both the COC’s home venue, the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, and the company’s administrative office remain closed to the public until further notice, with full-time staff continuing to work off-site.

The COC has created a digital content hub at coc.ca/Hub, home to a “Virtual Choir,” a video chorus that received hundreds of submissions from all over the globe; “Songs of Hope,” an intimate online concert from the COC Ensemble Studio slated to premiere on July 9; and “Opera Makers,” a series of bite-sized video tutorials for young people.

Read', 'Jennifer Schuesslerthe New York Times', 'The New York Times']",2020-06-19,"“The Phantom of the Opera” has garnered plenty of superlatives over the years, including the longest-running show in Broadway history. But in recent months, it has also laid claim to a more unlikely title: path-breaking musical of the COVID-19 era.

As theatres around the globe were abruptly shuttered by the pandemic, with no clear path to reopening in sight, the world tour of “Phantom” has been soldiering on in Seoul, South Korea, playing eight shows a week. And it has been drawing robust audiences to its 1600-seat theatre, even after an outbreak in the ensemble led to a mandatory three-week shutdown in April.

The musical, with its 126-member company and hundreds of costumes and props, is believed to be the only large-scale English-language production running anywhere in the world. And it has remained open not through social-distancing measures — a virtual impossibility in the theatre, either logistically or financially, many say — but an approach grounded in strict hygiene.

And it’s one that its composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, is arguing can show the way for the rest of the industry, a point he is hoping to demonstrate to the world, as he prepares to turn the Palladium, one of seven theatres he owns in London, into a laboratory for lessons learned in Seoul.

“I don’t think we should just be sitting on our hands and saying, it’s all doom and gloom, we can’t do anything,” he said in an interview last week. “We have got to make the theatres as safe for everybody as we possibly can,” he said. And South Korea, he said, shows that it can work.

That the show, at the Blue Square cultural complex in central Seoul, has gone on is a testament not just to the protocols in the theatre, but to South Korea’s rigorous system of test, trace and quarantine, which has kept the virus largely under control.

It was also a matter of sheer timing and luck, though it didn’t seem that way at first.

When the tour’s previous stop in Busan, South Korea’s second biggest city, wrapped up in mid-February, the country was emerging as the latest epicentre of the pandemic.

The company mostly went home for a break to Britain, Italy, North America, Australia and elsewhere. Serin Kasif, vice president of Lloyd Webber’s company, the Really Useful Group, and the producer of the tour, said she was fielding daily messages from company members anxious about whether to return.

On March 2, when Kasif flew to Seoul to begin preparations to open there, South Korea had the second-highest number of confirmed cases, and the pandemic had not yet fully hit Britain.

She contrasted the “overwhelming sense of fear” that developed in London with what she had experienced in Seoul, with its clear governmental directives and local partners who had lived through previous epidemics like SARS.

“When I was speaking to our Korean partners, in lead-up to the decision to continue, one said, ‘The word “unprecedented” keeps getting used, but it’s not unprecedented here,’ ” she explained.

“Amazingly,” Kasif said, the entire company returned to Seoul. Matt Leisy, a Northwestern University graduate who plays Raoul, said that when he went home to New York during the break, friends were “freaking out” at the idea that he might go back to Korea. But he said he was reassured by the producers’ constant communication about safety protocols, as well as their videos of daily life in Seoul.

“It was quite scary leading up to us coming back,” he said. “Who knew we’d end up being in the safest place in the world?”

The protocols, which are mandated by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are strict, but they are not particularly space-age. Before entering the theatre, audience members are sprayed with a light mist of disinfectant. Thermal sensors take each person’s temperature, and everyone fills out a questionnaire about symptoms and recent places they’ve visited, so they can be notified of any exposures they may have had through the country’s contract-tracing app.

There are hand-sanitizing stations throughout, and ubiquitous signs and announcements reminding everyone that masks must be worn at all times. And in contrast to movie theatres, where alternating rows or seats are left empty, no seats are blocked off (though the first row was removed).

Backstage, there’s a similar drill: no embracing, no handshakes, no inessential physical contact. Reusable water bottles are forbidden, along with sharing food. Wigs, props and costumes are regularly sprayed or wiped with antibacterial cloths. Everyone must wear a mask, except for actors when they are being made up or go onstage, and some members of the orchestra.

Sharon Williams, the head of wardrobe, said that masks and “constant handwashing” aside, protocols for the 17-member costume department are not that different than they would be normally, beyond extra cycles of high-temperature washing with antibacterial soap.

The crucial element, she said, is the whole company’s rigorous co-operation. “No one is saying ‘I’m not going to do it,’” she said.

As for the onstage action, Kasif said there have been no modifications — and yes, Raoul and Christine still kiss.

Which isn’t to say the actors haven’t had nerve-racking moments. Leisy said initially he was “hyperaware” of all the saliva flying around the stage, especially in big numbers like the Act Two showstopper “Masquerade.”

“When I enunciate, the spit really flies out of my mouth,” he said. “At one point, we’re all dancing and singing our faces off and I look around and see all this saliva flying. I thought, ‘My goodness!’”

(The first row of seats is a seemingly safe 5.2 meters from the edge of the stage, according to a video issued by the show’s Korean producer in early May detailing the safety precautions.)

The run, which has been extended until August (after the touring production of “War Horse” set to follow in the same theatre cancelled), has not been without its bumps. In late March, about two weeks after the show opened, one of the show’s ballerinas said she wasn’t feeling well. She was tested, and the result — positive — was back by 9 a.m. the next morning.

Authorities moved swiftly to lock down the theatre and check if all guidelines were being followed. A mobile testing unit was installed on the roof of the apartment building where the cast and nonlocal crew live, and everyone was immediately tested both for active virus and antibodies. (A male ensemble member also tested positive but remained asymptomatic.)

All 76 members of the touring company were quarantined for 15 days in their apartments. The local employees were also tested, and quarantined at home. (A local production of “Dracula: The Musical” also decided to suspend performances in this period, in response to the outbreak at “Phantom,” according to local news reports.)

In keeping with local policies, the more than 8,000 people who had seen “Phantom” received text alerts informing them of the outbreak. Another announcement, which Kasif said was drafted in conjunction with authorities, was sent to patrons, describing the safety measures that had been in place.

Kasif suggested the fact that the virus had not spread more widely in the company was proof, at least “anecdotally,” as she put it, that the protocols work.

“The ballerinas are a very close ensemble,” she said. “They share a dressing room, warm up together, perform together, warm down together. They happen to be very good friends socially. So if the guidelines weren’t working, on paper they all should have had coronavirus.”

The show reopened on April 23, and ticket sales have been about 70 to 85 per cent full since, Kasif said. Even last Thursday, when a spike in cases in the country led authorities to close all public museums, galleries and entertainment venues across greater Seoul until June 15, the seats were mostly full, according to a reporter who attended. (Publicists for the show declined to provide box office information.)

Private venues, like the Blue Square, were allowed to remain open, and “Phantom” continues to operate “in accordance with KCDC guidelines and instructions,” Kasif said in a statement.

Several audience members expressed concern about the spike, but said they trusted the theatre’s measures and the country’s larger public health response.

Yi-seul Lee, 28, a graphic designer, had seen the musical in March and said she didn’t want to miss the chance to see it again. “Unless we shout very loudly while watching the show or take off our masks, I think we are more or less safe,” she said.

Still, some fans thought the uncertainties of the pandemic had dampened spirits a bit. In-hae Bae, 36, a human resources manager who was seeing “Phantom” for the sixth time, said that every time the actors embraced, the virus popped into her head. And the applause at the curtain call, she said, seemed “timid.”

“They were way too calm,” she said of the audience. “It made me think, ‘Coronavirus must have strangled our passion, too.’”",[]

She is of northern Manitoba Swampy Cree and Irish-settler descent. She offers insight into her life experiences as the Stratford Festival dedicates its social media platforms to First Nations artists.

When I learned that I would be going to the Stratford Festival to play Zhaboonigan Peterson in Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters,” I was overcome with excitement, joy and gratitude. What a gift to work in a room full of powerful Indigenous artists. This felt like an opportunity that I dreamed of during my school days. My dream, and the play, were ultimately postponed by the pandemic.

I spent six years training as an actor and I earned two degrees. During that time I gained many skills — but none of those skills would prepare me for what lay ahead. I could not have foreseen the amount of work I would be required to do. Work that had nothing to do with acting.

As an Indigenous woman growing up in this country, I got used to the questions: “Where are you from?” I grew accustomed to the comments: “You’re so articulate!” I learned to smile, laugh it off and gently correct. “They mean well.” Mostly. This is how I learned to walk through the world safely.

As I journeyed from schooling into my career as an actor, I had not realized that the way I learned to walk through the world had grown into a full-time job. No benefits. No pay. The ways I had educated family, friends, co-workers, strangers on the bus, I now had to apply to the world of directors, people of influence, of power, those who could hire or fire me.

I learned to be soft and agreeable so as not to frighten anyone.

“Of course, I’m not saying you’re racist.” I learned to put a lid on my anger and to be so incredibly patient.

“I know, I know you’re trying.”

I picked my battles and let things slide, and made offers and tried my very hardest to soak my words in syrup to make the truth more palatable.

I have run out of ways and words and sweetness. I want to speak candidly. I want to tell the truth.

The truth is my people are dying.

It’s hard to know what to say after that.

This is my truth. It is my truth when I walk into the rehearsal room, onto the stage and when I am alone with my thoughts. This truth is heavy and larger than the confines that this space allows. To share it comes at a cost and I am just one person.

I am feeling extra tender these days. I’m thinking about all the artists who came before me. I am angry. I am heartbroken. Everyday I am learning and unlearning. I understand that I am not untouched by the sludge of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, patriarchy and colonialism. Black Lives Matter.

There is so much work left to do.

I long for the day I can be in a space with my fellow artists again, whether that be in picturesque Stratford or anywhere art can be made. I believe in what I do now more than ever. I have to.

I believe that the art I help create can reach people, teach people, offer comfort and hope.

Yes, I do have hope to offer. Not always a surplus but enough to keep the lights on. Yet there is still a lot more truth that needs to be brought into that light.",[]

Follow Them On Twitter']",2020-06-18,"The Stratford Festival is again in the spotlight as Canadian theatre contends with systemic racism in the wake of ongoing Black Lives Matter protests around the world.

Stratford will hand over its social media channels to Indigenous artists Friday and Saturday, June 19 and 20, in advance of National Indigenous Peoples Day on Sunday, June 21.

The initiative follows a similar move the weekend of June 6 when the festival turned its platforms over to Black actors and artists — sparking a wave of testimony and activism that has already led to policy and leadership changes in national theatre.

Over the next two days, past and present Stratford Festival artists and theatre workers with Indigenous heritage will run the company’s Twitter, Instagram and Facebook feeds using the hashtag #DecolonizingTheStage.

On June 20, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., a YouTube panel will take place, titled “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi — We Are Standing Strong: Stories of endurance, resilience and resistance from members of the Indigenous circle at Stratford.” It will include artists Jani Lauzon, Quelemia Sparrow, Lisa Nasson and Jessica Carmichael from this season’s postponed production of Tomson Highway’s “The Rez Sisters”; actor Gordon Patrick White; director Cole Alvis; and former Stratford associate artistic director Dean Gabourie. They will be joined by elder Liz Stevens from Kettle and Stony Point First Nation.

“This is a group of artists that have these particular points of view and these particular experiences,” said Lauzon, who has taken the lead on organizing the takeover and will moderate the “Ndo-Mshkogaabwimi” panel. “But we do not speak for the entire community because it’s so vast and different in the way that we work, who we work with and how we intersect with theatre.”

Lauzon said each social media feed will have its own purpose: Twitter and Instagram will amplify more activist-driven arguments and experiences, Stratford’s Facebook page will be devoted to individuals who worked with the festival in the past, and the YouTube panel will provide room for in-depth, complicated discussions of Indigeneity and colonial systems in Canadian arts and culture.

“We’re here to repeat the things that we have been saying, knowing that there is a deeper listening going on, which is the exciting part, as well as maybe disclosing things that we felt unsafe saying before,” she said.

Reneltta Arluk — the first Inuit person and the first Indigenous woman to direct a Stratford production with “The Breathing Hole” in 2017 — is among the artists participating in the social media takeover. Director of Indigenous arts at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, Arluk was encouraged by the festival’s anti-Black racism venture, which resulted in an end to its “as cast” policy, which allows directors to cast actors in small roles without their consent.

“The way that Indigenous people have been treated for over 150 years by the Canadian government — they have been reminded that they need to assimilate, they need to move out of their home territories, their language is not recognized as official. Treaties and agreements are broken. These are the histories we carry in our bones and our veins,” said Arluk. “When we come to the table … we’re coming from that historical place of distrust.”

Lauzon echoed Arluk’s caution about Canada’s history of Indigenous oppression. The recent deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi during interactions with police in New Brunswick, and a video showing the violent arrest of chief Allan Adam in Alberta have renewed calls for change.

In Lauzon’s view, Canadians want to believe that “Canada is better somehow or that we’re not quite as bad as the circumstances are in the States. We’ve been very good at hiding things; we’ve been very good at not educating our youth,” she said. “It is an unfortunate residue of colonial thinking, which is an assumption of superiority.”

Stratford Festival artistic director Antoni Cimolino said the company has commissioned new works by Indigenous writers and began including more Indigenous voices in its programming over the past few years. “I feel strongly that, for the remainder of my tenure, I would like a play by an Indigenous writer in each season.

“I feel that we have a special responsibility to Indigenous people in Canada and that means we would really like to build a stronger relationship with this community of artists.”

But there has been greater learning for Cimolino in the way Indigenous theatre artists work. And it’s led to structural changes at Stratford, such as welcoming smudge ceremonies at the beginning of rehearsals, the inclusion of land acknowledgments before performances and modifying the pace of some creative processes.

“Usually in rehearsals, you’re rushing into a room, it’s last minute and you get right to it. There isn’t a sense of breath, of acknowledgment of who we are, where we are,” he said.

Observing the rehearsal process of “Pawâkan Macbeth” at the Banff Centre of Arts and Creativity in February was revelatory for Cimolino. It’s a Stratford-commissioned, Plains Cree retelling of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” written by Arluk and directed by Michael Greyeyes.

“For our Indigenous colleagues, the greeting at the top of rehearsal takes 20 minutes, half an hour. We don’t normally invest that much time to start the day,” Cimolino said.

“The payoff though was beautiful and I felt there was a sense of trust … This is part of a learning process for us that isn’t only about supporting our Indigenous colleagues, it’s also a learning process that I hope will make us a better place and our work better.”

No. Instead, we find new ways of sharing and understanding each other.

The students at Etobicoke School of the Arts, like other pupils honing their creativity across the city, the country and the world, usually have a year-end exhibition. They show and sell their work, hold a Portfolio Day to showcase the fruits of their labour and create connections with the larger, outside world.

This year, the Class of 2020 has taken the sale online.

“The tension with teaching and having the sale online is the loss of personal interaction with other people,” observes Matthew Varey, head of contemporary art at the Toronto high school. “We are used to engaging with brilliant, creative, humble, powerful and ambitious people every day. That is the loss I am feeling, and the one I hear from the students that is being felt most deeply.”

For Ella Webber, the just-graduated Grade 12 student and young artist who painted this portrait of “Charlotte,” her art is a way of connecting with her peers, with the people she encounters in the world each day. She creates large-scale portraits — the size of the art, she says, “increases the intimate connection that I share with it, strengthening my personal bond with my subjects and allowing my paintings to take on a life of their own.

“Through portraits I’m working to understand the complexities, nuances and possibilities of human connection.”

In exhibition, her portraits command our attention. The people in them demand we see their perspective and understand their stories.

These students are graduating to a wider world. By supporting them in their creativity and understanding the way they see the world, together we can all graduate to a better one.

To see the exhibition, learn more about these young artists or to buy a painting, go to the online sale at www.esava.ca. Half of the sale price goes to the students and half to the school — to inspire and support more students to create, and in so doing to encourage all of us to see the world through fresh eyes.",[]

Read', 'Aritz Parrathe Associated Press', 'The Associated Press']",2020-06-30,"MADRID—Scholars in the work of surrealist Frida Kahlo have searched for more than six decades for “The Wounded Table,” a 1940 oil painting illuminating her pain over the breakup of her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera that hasn’t been seen since an exhibition in Poland.

And the historians strongly reject the idea that the mystery of its whereabouts has been solved, as claimed by a Spanish art dealer who says the painting is now sitting in a London warehouse awaiting a buyer willing to spend more than 40 million euros ($60.9 million).

Experts consulted by the Associated Press have concluded that published images of the work now on sale show nothing more than a copy of Kahlo’s painting.

Helga Prignitz-Poda, an art historian who has fruitlessly tried to track down the long-lost painting, said that there are clear differences between the work for sale and old photographs of the original and that there are similarities between the offered work with inaccurate replicas based on those old images.

In addition, she said, Kahlo did the painting on wood and not on canvas. The work for sale is described as a canvas painting.

Cristian López, the Spanish art dealer who says he represents the anonymous owner of the painting, stands firm in defending its authenticity.

“Time will give us the truth,” López said during a phone conversation in which he offered few details on the painting.

López, who is little known in the art world, said specialists have endorsed the painting’s authenticity, but he declined to identify them.

“Whoever proves genuine interest and the ability to pay the figure of 40 million euros, can spend as much time as wanted with their experts analyzing the work,” López said.

“The Wounded Table” was unveiled at the International Surrealism Exhibition in 1940 in Mexico City. It includes a self-portrait of Kahlo at a long table, flanked by a Holy Week Judas and a monster that embraces her, while the two sons of her sister stand at one end and her pet fawn is at the other. Blood flows from knots of the wood table, which is considered to represent the artist’s anguish of the just concluded divorce from Rivera.

Kahlo donated the painting to the Soviet Union in 1945 for a planned Mexico room at the Museum of Western Art in Moscow, but Soviet art officials disdained surrealism as decadent and the project was dropped. The Mexican works ended up in a cellar.

A year after Kahlo’s death, a Mexican group organized a travelling art exhibition for shows in Soviet bloc nations and arranged for a loan of “The Wounded Table.” Prignitz-Poda said there is photographic evidence the 46-inch by 98-inch painting was shown in Warsaw, but nothing is known of it after that. There is no clue whether it was returned to Moscow, destroyed or perhaps acquired by someone.

Susana Pliego, an art historian who has studied the work of both Kahlo and Rivera, is among the experts who don’t think the painting for sale is the real thing.

She said there is a big problem with faked Kahlo painting because the art market thirsts for more works by an artist who produced only about 200 paintings before her death in 1954.

“Fridamania has been a marketing invention,” said Pliego, who directs cultural programming at the Casa de México in Madrid and who worked for years on Kahlo’s archive. “Because her paintings are sold so expensively, someone makes a proposal to see if anyone falls for it.”

Hans-Jérgen Gehrke, an art collector who operates a museum dedicated to Kahlo’s works in southwestern Germany, considers it “implausible, if not directly ridiculous,” that an unknown 22-year-old businessman operating a website from a town in northwestern Spain is the guardian of the missing painting.

“There are thousands of Frida Kahlo fakes,” Gehrke said. “She is possibly the artist who has painted more dead than in life.”",[]

From spring to summer. From fearing each other to celebrating in each other’s presence. They are thoughts for our times, evoked by Inuit artist Jessie Oonark’s 1979 image “Angagok Conjuring Birds.”

Angagok (also spelled angakkuq) are often called upon to serve as healers or as keepers of justice in the community.

Here, they are transforming into birds, a recurring image in Oonark’s work, notes Sarah Milroy, chief curator of the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, where a copy of this print resides. The figures, male or female, “serve as spiritual mediators, (and are) called to their roles through visions or dreams. Stories abound of their powers to fly or run as fast as the caribou.” Or to transform.

It is one of hundreds of images that Oonark, born in 1906 in the Barren Lands, north and west of present-day Baker Lake in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, created. She spent her early life in Utkusiksalingmiut camps, in traditional pursuits including dressing caribou and sealskins, as well as making parkas and other items of traditional clothing, wrote Janet Catherine Berlo in “North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century.”

In the late 1950s, Oonark moved to Qamani’tuaq — Baker Lake — and it was only when she was 59 that she began drawing and creating textile hangings. Soon she had her own art studio and, eventually, a salary.

Between 1970 and 1985 more than 100 of Oonark’s drawings were translated into prints and issued in Baker Lake’s annual print editions, Berlo writes. Three of her prints were also released through the famous Kinngait (Cape Dorset) print program between 1960 and 1961 — the only Inuk outside the community to have her work included in that collection. Her work hangs in the National Arts Centre; before she died in 1985, she was named to the Order of Canada.

Oonark’s compositions feature figures in traditional clothing, animals, and birds and traditional tools. In Inuit Art Quarterly, art critic and CBC reporter Robert Enright noted how “the whimsical, awkward gestures the figures make and the colours in the drawings speak unequivocally about Oonark’s uncompromising celebration of Inuit life.”

Now, we are able to see each other again in a world that doesn’t quite look like the one we lived in before. It’s time to reach out awkwardly to each other in a celebration of life. It’s time to heal.

Read', 'Deborah Dundasbooks Editor', 'Books Editor', 'Deborah Dundas Is The Star S Books Editor. She Is Based In Toronto. Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-22,"Storytelling is universal. It can bridge the space between individuals and cultures. It can bridge centuries. Even ancient stories have resonance today. Stories of love, war — and plague. The circumstances might not be exactly the same, but the parallels of experience and the universality of our emotions echo. When the world seems out of our control there’s comfort in that.

Often compared to Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” the story of “Layli and Majnun,” was written in 1188 and is one of five long romances from the poet Nizami’s “Khamseh” (Quintet). It tells of two young lovers who are prevented from being together by their families and community.

This illustration comes from a “Khamseh” manuscript dated 1527; it depicts the moment when, after many years of separation and emotional hardship that has left them physically weakened, Layli and Majnun are finally brought into each other’s company by a go-between.

They keep their distance, however, out of fear that the intensity of embracing each other would kill them. Instead, Majnun, a poet, sings a beautiful composition he has written to Layli in an expression of the intensity of his love.

As we are able, once again, to physically meet with friends and family after months of being apart, we can understand the emotion the two lovers feel. Whether we can understand the script or not, the illustrations encourage us to use our imaginations and create a story of our own using cues from the past.

And that’s poetry for you: even when we can’t understand the script, we can interpret the images. When we can’t understand the language, we can understand the emotion. Poetry’s images collide and refract, illuminating new ideas and connections. The breadth of human experience resonates and hums in the spaces between words, something we can experience together.

Follow Her On Instagram']",2020-06-21,"Qualitywise, this is a terrible photograph. Taken with a hot-in-the-’90s disposable camera, the flash lighting is harsh and nobody is actually in focus.

Still, as a personal memory, I’ve always loved it for the tableau of emotions and body language and relationships unwittingly captured that night. I love it, too, for the reminders it gives me about my apparently quite coy, younger queer self. Hey now, baby dyke.

It was July 1999. That much I know for sure because it’s date-stamped on the back of the photograph. The rest, not so much. But after reaching out to four friends who were all there that night, the best we could come up with is that we think we’re at the much-missed Gypsy Co-Op for some queer club night, for maybe somebody’s birthday, maybe not.

I went digging through my personal archive because in the right-before times, I had spent two days at the ArQuives gleefully looking at hundreds of photographs just as terrible as this one.

Housed on Isabella Street, the ArQuives is Canada’s LGBTQ2+ Archives and the world’s largest independent collection of LGBTQ heritage materials. As part of my photo laureate activities, we had been working together to produce an exhibition of photographs that would have launched on the front face of City Hall during Doors Open Toronto and stayed up for Pride Month.

Responding to the 2020 Doors Open theme, “Open TO Music,” I had wanted to visualize the relationship between music and LGBTQ activism in Toronto, and so I searched for photos depicting the presence of music not only at conventions and at marches and at rallies, but also at gay bars and trans parties and queer picnics.

For those two days, I was like a drag queen in a wig store, giddied and in awe as I pored over box after box of photographs. Capital-H history is in there, yes, in the documentation of events such as the first Gay Pride march in 1972 and the demonstrations after the 1981 bathhouse raids. But it was the photographs of small-h history, of the everyday activism of trans and queer folks just living their best life, that moved me to tears again and again.

People have donated everything from 4x6 prints to strips of film negatives and sheets of slides, and while the collections do include images created by professional photographers for newspapers or photo shoots, the bulk of the bounty is made up of amateur snapshots or what are often called vernacular photographs.

These ordinary photographs taken by ordinary people have received increased interest from photography scholars and collectors lately, though their value in revealing social histories has long been appreciated by community-based archives.

As I studied image after image at the ArQuives, it was these everyday photographs that showed me the laughter and the flirting and the tender moments of the past but, decidedly and frustratingly, only those belonging to certain ordinary histories and not others.

Just as with similar LGBTQ archives elsewhere in Canada and in the U.S, the stories of white, cisgender gay men and lesbians were overwhelmingly dominant, with trans and queer Black, Indigenous and people of colour histories barely accounted for.

Although not everything can be recorded and collected, let’s be clear, this collective “archival silence” is rooted in transphobia and the racism that everyone suddenly seems overly eager to acknowledge and slightly less so to address. These oppressions have limited whose stories are seen as worth preserving, as well as who has even been told their stories are worth preserving in the first place.

Many of these archives were founded by white gay activists in the early ’70s and, as much as the reckoning was already underway, there is a new-found urgency to current efforts to continue to acknowledge their contributions, while also directly grappling with the problematic challenges posed by their legacies.

Two books raising some of these issues have already been released this year alone, “Documenting Rebellions: A Study of Four Lesbian and Gay Archives in Queer Times,” by former ArQuives executive director Rebecka Taves Sheffield, and “Out North: An Archive of Queer Activism and Kinship in Canada,” by Craig Jennex and Nisha Eswaran.

And then last month, Archivaria, the journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, published an article by my colleague, Elspeth Brown, professor of history at the University of Toronto and long-time volunteer and board member at the ArQuives.

In describing her six years of helping to bring an intersectional, trans-inclusive framework to the organization, she echoes the present demand to actually take explicit action: “Making visible the materials of LGBTQ2+ people outside the white, cis, settler-colonial, usually gay male norm requires specific strategies and approaches; otherwise, the default historical formation of white ‘gay and lesbian’ people and their histories will continue to overdetermine the LGBTQ2+ archive.”

Along with Brown’s work at the ArQuives, these strategies have included a recent name change, hiring staff of colour, diversifying their 120-strong volunteer base and supporting exhibitions like last year’s “Legacies in Motion: Black Queer Toronto Archival Project,” in partnership with Myseum and Black Artists’ Network in Dialogue.

With this last project, rather than reproduce a colonial dynamic and collect the personal records themselves, the ArQuives supported the years of stewardship of local Black queer activists, including curator Courtnay McFarlane. As Brown notes, these postcustodial approaches “emphasize contributive justice and the addressing of structural inequalities.”

This leaves me with two options for my blurry photograph above and all of the others like it sitting on my shelves. But after my time looking and seeing and touching all of those other photographs, I can’t help but want a different experience for those who come after me. As soon as the ArQuives reopens, I suspect I’ll be headed over, boxes in tow. We are in #BlackSpring and Pride Month, and we deserve more.",[]

Follow Her On Twitter']",2020-06-19,"Imagine feeling enveloped by the famous Vincent van Gogh painting “The Starry Night” or the glorious colours of a giant version of his “Irises.”

That’s part of what you can expect at the exhibit “Immersive Van Gogh,” which has turned a giant room that used to house the Toronto Star’s printing presses into a cavernous art gallery: 600,000 cubic feet with 50-foot ceilings.

The media got the first look on Wednesday morning and I confess I was a bit skeptical going in. As someone who has been privileged enough to see famous art in the flesh, so to speak, around the world as well as here in Toronto, I wondered: could projections of paintings on walls and floors be thrilling?

The answer is yes, albeit in a different way than seeing them in person.

Before we get to that, let’s talk about the who and why of the show.

Vincent van Gogh, born in the Netherlands in 1853, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1890 in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, is undoubtedly one of the world’s most famous artists. People are drawn to him for the turbulence of his life, including cutting off part of his own ear and spending time in an asylum, as much as for the beauty of his post-Impressionist paintings.

This exhibit came to Toronto after co-producers Svetlana Dvoretsky of Show One Productions and Corey Ross of Starvox Entertainment saw a wildly popular van Gogh show in 2019 at Ateliers des Lumières in Paris. The former iron foundry, opened in 1835, closed in 1929, reopened in 2018, features several immersive art exhibitions a year.

“Going in, I was wondering how is it possible that in a city such as Paris, one of the cultural capitals of the world that offers over 130 of the greatest museums, something like a digital multimedia art space could be so successful,” Dvoretsky told the media Wednesday. “I was so impressed and inspired that when I came back to Toronto I had to put the wheels in motion and try to create a similar institution here.”

Two of the Lumières masterminds, Massimiliano Siccardi in Italy and Luca Longobardi in Germany, designed the Toronto exhibit, but Dvoretsky noted that it is an original and not a copy of the Paris show.

So what is it exactly?

Well, it truly is immersive. You are surrounded by ever-shifting views featuring about 400 images, including 40 of van Gogh’s paintings, displayed on the massive walls and floors of the room. They are enhanced by lighting, animation and music. The work is anything but static: a page turns in “Still Life With Bible”; the windmill blades rotate in “Le Moulin de La Galette”; the water ripples in “Starry Night Over the Rhone”; the delicate flowers of “Almond Blossoms” float through the air and onto the painting’s branches.

The sheer size of the room means that the paintings are projected at a scale that lets you see brush strokes and blobs of paint. The colours seem especially intense.

You might think this would demystify van Gogh’s work, but I found that it amplified my appreciation for his talent. As I gazed at magnified blades of grass I marvelled at how painstaking it must have been to put multiple colours on each blade, particularly since the original painting is much smaller than the projection.

The show is 35 minutes long and you can’t linger over works the way you can in a traditional gallery, but the combination of art and an evocative soundtrack heightens your emotional response. You can’t help but reflect on van Gogh’s untimely and tragic end, for instance, as self-portraits of the artist fill otherwise dark walls and Samuel Barber’s mournful “Adagio for Strings” plays.

(The audio guide, which was not part of the media preview, includes narration by actor Colm Feore with details about van Gogh’s life and career.)

In a Skype video, Siccardi described “Immersive Van Gogh” as “a tribute to Vincent the man.” Through his art, Siccardi said, van Gogh “led us to discover a world of brightness and darkness at the same time. I would say he let us discover the power of life.”

Longobardi, in a separate video, said he hoped visitors to the exhibit would find it “cathartic and liberating.”

An anticipated June 18 opening, rescheduled from May 1, was postponed since Toronto is still in stage one of Ontario’s pandemic reopening plan. A publicist said the plan now is to open for socially distanced walk-in visits on July 1, with the drive-in option opening July 3.

Lighthouse Immersive, the production company Ross and Dvoretsky formed, will open a second multimedia gallery in an adjacent part of the old printing plant, which means walk-in and drive-in viewings can happen simultaneously.

I briefly sampled the drive-in option, but I much preferred the view on my own two feet. The car option would work well for someone especially nervous about being in a room with other people or who would have a hard time standing for 35 minutes.

There’s no doubt that the van Gogh show won’t be the last we hear of Lighthouse Immersive. Dvoretsky said they plan to expand into art classes, lectures, art camps and other programs. In fact, she talked about changing “the Toronto arts landscape.”

“Coming from Saint Petersburg (Russia) about 22 years ago, where I grew up surrounded by museums and palaces, I could only dream about being involved in establishing a cutting-edge art space here in my beloved city of Toronto,” she said, “but dreams come true, even in times of COVID.”

“Immersive van Gogh” is scheduled to begin July 1 at 1 Yonge St. See vangoghexhibit.ca for tickets and information.
