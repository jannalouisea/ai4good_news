First, Paul Tagliabue, who ran the NFL for 17 years, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020 in Canton, Ohio. It took 10 years and a one-time only expanded class for the NFL’s 100th-year celebration to get across the goaline. Tim Finchem didn’t have to sweat out “golf’s highest honor.” He was a first-ballot guy as a finalist, just like his fellow Class of 2021 inductee, Tiger Woods.

“To be included in that group is very powerful,” Finchem said in a press conference on Monday of being elected in the “contributor category” to join the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida. “I want to certainly thank those that thought that I was deserving of it. I kind of in many ways don’t feel like I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long. It was absolutely captivating for me year after year after year.”

Finchem isn’t the only one who doesn’t think he’s deserving. Social media was not kind when the announcement was made this morning.

it’s ridiculous. he happened to be sitting there when Tiger arrived and just got swept up in the hurricane. A rubber tree plant could’ve done that. — Rick Reilly (@ReillyRick) April 20, 2020

And why should they be? Just days ago, my colleague Beth Ann Nichols and others applauded the World Golf Hall of Fame for finally electing Marion Hollins also through the contributor category. (Quick aside: If the Hall is going to continue with this category, please at least limit it to a max of one per induction.) Hollins was a trailblazer and while her inclusion won’t send people turning off I-95 at International Golf Parkway in droves, hopefully some of those visitors who spring for a ticket to go and see the locker for Tiger Woods will learn her story too.

But the World Golf Hall of Fame needed another plaque of an administrator about as much as it needed one for Augusta National chairman Billy Payne two years ago. This isn’t so much a knock on Finchem as much as a wider complaint that we’re honoring the wrong people. The Hall of Fame should be for the greats of the game, the players who achieved the moments etched in our memory. There is still one more inductee to be named later this week, but all of the other players who will be left on the outside looking in are far more deserving of recognition in the Hall of Fame than Finchem.

He led the PGA Tour through very prosperous times during his 22-year tenure that began in 1994 after Deane Beman passed him the baton, but Finchem’s been richly rewarded for it. According to the Tour’s 2017 Form 990, he earned $12 million and another $6 million in reportable compensation from related organizations.

“Deane’s left him a Mercedes with the tank a quarter full, and all Tim has to do is keep putting gas in it,” Tour pro Peter Jacobsen once said.

That is an oversimplification, of course, but best I can tell Finchem wisely followed the Deane Beman playbook and had the good fortune of having Tiger, the world’s most famous athlete, come along and lift the sport to new heights during his tenure. As Beman used to say during his good years, “we’re not selling here, we’re enrolling.” (Last side note: Beman, Michael Bonallack of the R&A, and former USGA president Bill Campbell, who are all previously inducted, could have earned this distinction for their amateur record alone.) I’m not saying Finchem had an easy job, but it would have been hard to fail at the job with Tiger and an ever-expanding TV contract.

Former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will be inducted into the Golf Hall of Fame next year with Tiger. Fitting that he rides on Tiger’s coattails one last time. — Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) April 20, 2020

Even Finchem conceded as much when he told the following story about Tiger.

“There was some magazine that ranked me in the top 10 or 20 powerful people in sports one year. Obviously a lousy magazine. But people called me to say, what do you think?” Finchem recounted. “Well, I’m not — you know, the person that’s the most powerful person in sports is Tiger Woods, and they said, what do you mean by that. I said, well, I’ll give you an example. If I wanted to convey something, we’re building a tournament in Tokyo or something, I wanted to convey some information, I’d have to spend a week getting people charged up figuring out some communications, who are the people we have to go to to get this message across, this, that and the other. Tiger Woods doesn’t have to do any of that. Tiger Woods, all he has to do is issue a little statement, and his name is on it, Tiger Woods, everybody in the world knows about it. And to me, that’s real power. That is real power.”

And when asked about how much more difficult a job it would have been without Tiger, Finchem channeled his inner Captain Obvious and said, “It would have been a much more difficult job.”

You don’t say? Give Finchem a gold watch on the way out the door for a job well done and I’m OK if you want to let him continue as a board member of The First Tee. But membership in the World Golf Hall of Fame should be sacred. His election further validates claims that it is merely a popularity contest and charges of cronyism. (PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, who was Finchem’s handpicked successor, and other leaders in the game whose chances of being honored in the future probably also improved with Finchem’s election are among the voters. It all adds up to too much potential conflict of interest.) Interestingly, Finchem was a semi-finalist in 2019 and didn’t even make it to the list of finalists. It makes you wonder what changed in the last two years during his retirement. But his election is just another reason why the number of members returning for the ceremony is often low and why Hall of Famers continue to give their best mementos elsewhere. The last thing it needed was to enshrine another administrator, even if Finchem says he has a great letter from Arnold Palmer that he will donate to his exhibit along with some photographs of the greats that he bumped elbows with – from Gene Sarazen to Tiger.

When asked if he felt administrators should be honored at the Hall of Fame, Finchem demurred. “I’m not going to comment on that now, but when I speak at the induction, I will comment on it. I’m not trying to be cagey, but I’d just prefer to do it that way.”

I’ll save his speech writer some time. He’s going to say that it’s an honor to be recognized but the players are the real heroes and that he and his fellow administrators just support them. And people will clap politely and then we’ll move on to the induction of Tiger and the next time some guest says they want to see Finchem’s plaque will be the first time, but he’ll be housed there all the same between Nick Faldo and Raymond Floyd.

But as long as the Finchem’s of the industry continue to be enshrined, “golf’s highest honor” will remain just what it is – another empty slogan.",[]

That much was evident with the news that former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will join Tiger Woods and Marion Hollins in the next class to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The announcement was greeted with griping that was as predictable as it is tedious, an exercise in collective eye-rolling intended to suggest not only that Finchem is undeserving but that his inclusion dilutes the Hall’s credibility.

That argument is familiar and has been leveled against more deserving targets who got a call to the Hall, like George H.W. Bush, Bing Crosby or Bob Hope. But there’s no sound basis for raising it against Finchem.

There is a sentiment that says lockers in St. Augustine ought to be earned for exploits on the field of play, and the only field of play that matters is a golf course. Not a boardroom or a factory or a production trailer or a media center. It’s an absolutist position that would disqualify plenty of current Hall of Famers.

Like C.B. Macdonald or Pete Dye, who only designed those fields of play,

Like Karsten Solheim, who innovated the instruments used on those fields.

Like Dan Jenkins or Herb Graffis, whose only mastery was of a typewriter on the sidelines.

The reality is that most sports halls of fame are intended to acknowledge not just quantifiable achievement but immeasurable impact. Charlie Sifford wasn’t inducted for his two PGA Tour victories but for what his presence, courage and determination symbolized in golf’s ugliest era. Frank Chirkinian wasn’t given a locker to store his Emmy awards, but because the legendary CBS producer’s influence far exceeded that of most players he put on living room TVs.

It’s why the football and tennis Halls have “contributor” categories to enshrine non-players, and it’s why the golf Hall is welcoming Finchem, just as it did his predecessor Deane Beman, Augusta National’s Billy Payne and the European Tour’s Ken Schofield before him.

This is hardly to say Finchem is beyond criticism. He forged a colorless culture at Tour HQ and enforced a level of secrecy around disciplinary proceedings and drug testing that would have been envied in Pyongyang. But it can’t be argued that he didn’t leave the Tour in a considerably better place than he found it.

When he took over as commissioner in 1994, total prize money on Tour was $56.4 million. Toss in the Champions and then-Web.com Tours and the fund was just over $90 million. This season the Tour’s prize money is nearing $400 million, before bonuses at least until COVID-19 upended things. He created the oft-maligned World Golf Championship events, which if nothing else helped temper Greg Norman’s plans for world domination, and the FedEx Cup playoff system 13 years ago.

It’s a popular though specious suggestion that Finchem owes his success to coat-tailing on Tiger Woods. Sure, he was dealt a strong hand, but he played it well for what was demanded of him. If subsisting on crumbs from Tiger’s table was sufficient to earn a spot in the Hall, then Mark Steinberg would have his own wing.

Arguing over Hall of Fame inductees is a staple of most every sport, moreso during a quarantine when we’re happy for any meat to chew on, no matter how lacking in nutrition it is. And golf’s Hall has richly deserved much of the criticism it has received over the years. The last class inducted Peggy Kirk Bell. The famed teacher was eminently worthy, but she was deserving of the honor when she was alive. She lived for 95 years, but the Hall only saw fit to induct her three years after her death. That kind of standard can’t be encouraging to others who deserve a spot and have been thus far denied, like Tom Weiskopf or Butch Harmon.

There are obvious shortcomings surrounding golf’s Hall of Fame. There are those who deserve the honor who have been overlooked and those who’ve been given a spot they didn’t merit. But whatever his failings, Tim Finchem doesn’t belong on either list.",[]

And boy is it ever going to pour in Toronto this weekend.

A major rain storm on “steroids” will start overnight Friday and could leave up to 50 mm of the wet stuff by the time it’s all over Sunday night.

“A real whopper of a system,” Environment Canada’s senior climatologist David Phillips said Friday, describing the storm as “a significant event.”

“Every single conceivable weather warning and condition is part of this massive system. It’s a powerful storehouse of weather even for January,” he said. ” It’s got subtropical moisture from the gulf of Mexico just loaded with moisture and it is coming northward.”

“The question (for Toronto) is when will it turn to freezing rain? And most of the indications right now are that it will be the evening on Saturday,” Phillips added.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Toronto calling it “a soaker” with “very strong southwest winds Sunday.”

The temperature, meanwhile, is expected to get up to a balmy 11C on Saturday (the record high for Jan. 11 of 11. 7C was set in 1975) before plunging to a high of 2C (still above normal) on Sunday.

The rain is expected to be continuous and heavy at times all day Saturday and into Sunday morning.

“The average we get of rain in Toronto in January would be around 25 mm,” said Phillips. “So what we’re going to get in one day, in one 24-hour period, is going to exceed what we normally get in 31 days.”

Strong southwest winds are also expected Sunday morning, especially along the Lake Ontario shoreline, with gusts up to 90 km/h.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) also issued a statement Thursday saying “a flood outlook” was in effect until Sunday and “all shorelines, rivers and streams within the GTA should be considered hazardous,” and “any children or pets should be kept away from any slippery or unstable banks.”

Meanwhile, the City of Toronto sent out a press release Friday saying “Toronto Water’s storm readiness plan is in place,” and crews are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer flooding calls at 311.

Otherwise, residents are being asked to clear catch basins on their streets to avoid potential street and basement flooding and “move valuables from basement to shelves or upper floors, and take cleaners, paint or chemicals off the floor as not to further contaminate potential floodwater.”

They’re also being told to keep eavestroughs and downspouts clear and shovel any snow or ice away from their foundation and onto their lawn not the road.

21,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/hunter-johnny-papalia-hit-sealed-mob-boss-pat-musitanos-death-warrant,HUNTER: Johnny Papalia hit sealed mob boss Pat Musitano's death warrant,"['Brad Huntermore Brad Hunter', 'More Brad Hunter', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Am Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'News', 'Toronto', 'Gta']",2020-07-11 15:50:57+00:00,"Pat Musitano signed his death warrant on May 31, 1997, just minutes after longtime underworld chieftain Johnny Papalia hit the sidewalk dead as a doornail.

Still, it just took the grim reaper 23 years to collect the rotund gangster’s staggering karmic debt.

For the hitmen hunting the Hamilton mob boss, the third time turned out to be the charm.

In April 2019, Musitano narrowly missed getting toe-tagged when he was shot four times outside his Mississauga lawyer’s office.

On Friday, he didn’t budge from the broiling parking lot where he was cut down just after 1 p.m.

Musitano, 52, was taken off the board in a daring daytime hit at a Burlington plaza, likely bringing an end to three years of bloody gangland tit-for-tat that has left at least a dozen people dead.

According to The Hamilton Spectator, Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, John Clary, was also wounded in the shooting along with a third unidentified man.

The gangster’s violent death marked the end of more than 70 years of criminal activity in southern Ontario for the Musitano family.

Longtime mob observer James Dubro told The Toronto Sun the power vacuum left by the the mob scion’s death is small and there will likely be no recriminations.

It isn’t known whether a double shooting hours later that left one man dead on Hamilton’s Red Hill Pkwy. is connected to the Musitano hit. No matter.

“The Musitanos are finished. Period. It’s the end of that vendetta,” Dubro said, adding that Pat’s old crew would have trouble gathering enough guys for a hand of briscola.

He suspects the contract to ice Musitano was likely taken out by the Luppino or Violi families or young Turks from the newer N’drangheta cells that have emerged over the last decade.

Dubro has been predicting the violent demise of Pat Musitano for three years. He turned out to be correct.

The man known as “Fat Pat” was born into underworld royalty.

The crime family was founded in the early 1940s by Anthony Musitano, who fled to Canada after murdering his sister in an honour killing when she became pregnant out of wedlock.

In southern Ontario, the fugitive began building his extortion and gambling rackets to become a criminal powerhouse.

In 1965, his nephew, Dominic Musitano — Fat Pat’s father — took over and shared the spoils fairly peaceably with the Papalia and Luppino families. Oh, there were periodic business disputes that ended in the morgue, but the era was largely peaceful and profitable.

Pat Musitano and his younger brother Angelo “Ang” Musitano, followed their father and uncles into the underworld. Cops have estimated that by 1992 the crime family was earning $14 million a year, mostly through illegal gambling.

When Dominic Musitano left this mortal coil from a heart attack on Aug. 13, 1995, his eldest son took over. The brothers owed Johnny Papalia $250,000 and they had no intention of paying it.

In quick succession, The Enforcer was rubbed out on Railway St. in the city’s north end and just weeks later, his top lieutenant, Carmen Barillaro was clipped at his Niagara Falls home.

Triggerman Kenneth Murdock pointed the finger at the Musitano brothers as the architects of death. Murdock chirped that the brothers were sick of kicking back tribute to Buffalo (Papalia) and feared a deathly tabling of accounts from Barillaro.

Pat and Angelo Musitano were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for the Barillaro hit. The Papalia charges were withdrawn.

But the Sicilian saying “revenge is a dish best served cold” hovered over the brothers and “Ang” checked out on May 2, 2017, when he was shot dead in his truck in the driveway of his Waterdown home.

Sources said he had recently found God.

At least 10 more underworld-connected figures would die by the gun over the next three years.

Dubro said with the implosion of his allies, the Rizzuto crime family in the Montreal, Pat Musitano’s doomsday clock went into overdrive.

The mobster was considered by other underworld figures as too brash, too impetuous, and graceless. And it caught up to him.

“Pat deserved his fate more than any psychotic killing gangster since (New York mob chief) Carmine “The Cigar” Galante,” Dubro said.

“Pat threatened me through my colleague Gord Martineau in 1991 when he came up in his Caddy with his boys as Gord and I were filming for a CITY special mob series near his auto body shop in downtown Hamilton. He told Martineau that I ‘belonged in Hamilton Harbour.’”

Dubro added: “There was too much piss and vinegar and nastiness in Pat. He had to go.”

Cops say one male was seen fleeing the scene west on Plains Rd. E. in a grey, four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50, with a sunroof. No suspect description was immediately released.

Anyone with information regarding this double shooting, the whereabouts of the suspect vehicle, or who has dashcam that may help investigators, is urged to call police at 905-825-4777 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

That was certainly the case for one Ruth Ellis, a British nightclub manager who shot her lover, racecar driver David Blakely, to death in 1955.

Growing up in North Wales as one of six children, Ellis had to mature into adulthood early after becoming pregnant at age 17. One abusive marriage and two children later, Ellis made ends meet by becoming a prostitute, modelling and later dabbled in acting — achieving a bit part in the 1951 comedy Lady Godiva Rides Again.

In 1953, Ellis became the manager of Little Club, a nightclub in Knightsbridge, a district in central London. According to The Guardian, it is there where she met and fell in love with the 25-year-old Blakely.

Despite being engaged to another woman, Blakely moved in with Ellis within weeks of meeting. The relationship reportedly turned violent out of jealousy as both Ellis and Blakely dated other people while together.

In one instance, Blakely punched a pregnant Ellis in the stomach during an argument, causing her to miscarry. Blakely wanted to end the relationship, but his lover wanted no part of that.

So one day, Ellis sought the man out in Hampstead, where he had been laying low with some pals. On Easter Sunday in 1955, Ellis waited for Blakely to depart the Magdala pub where she would be waiting outside with a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver.

In cold blood, Ellis shot Blakely twice to take him down. The woman then stood over a wounded Ellis and shot him three more times, killing him.

The Irish Times reported Ellis then calmly gave her gun to an off-duty cop.

“Will you call the police?” Ellis asked the officer.

“I am the police,” the cop replied.

“Will you please arrest me?” Ellis questioned.

During her two-day murder trial, Ellis lacked remorse when questioned by prosecutor Christmas Humphreys on the motive behind Blakely’s killing.

“It is obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him,” Ellis told the court, as reported by the Guardian.

It didn’t take long — 25 minutes — for a jury to render a guilty verdict. With the verdict came an automatic death sentence.

There were attempts to stop Ellis’ execution, but they were unsuccessful.

On July 13, 1955 at the age of 28, Ellis was hanged.

Ellis’ execution spawned a movement to abolish the death penalty in Britain. The fatal practice was put to bed a decade later.

Ellis is on record as the last woman to be executed in the U.K.

Some 65 years after her death, the concept of capital punishment is still debated in countries such as Canada.

Earlier this year, a survey conducted by Research Co. noted more than half of Canadians were in favour of bringing back the death penalty to our country.

Capital punishment was extinguished in Canada in 1976.

Research Co’s poll noted 51% of Canadians support the reinstatement of death penalty for murder, with the highest amount of supporters aged 55 and older. The company also queried Americans and their support for capital punishment, yielding 59% in favour of the death penalty.

“A sizeable majority of Canadians who are in favour of the return of the death penalty (57%) believe it would save taxpayers money and the costs associated with having murderers in prison,” Mario Canseco, president of Research Co. said in a media release. “In the United States, only 43% of supporters of capital punishment feel the same way.”

In a poll conducted by Sun Media in 2012, 63% of Canadians supported capital punishment for dangerous offenders. The 2012 poll reaffirmed decades-old debate whether the death penalty is a good idea.

UPCOMING EXECUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

Capital punishment is still alive and well in the United States.

As of press time, there are 42 convicts scheduled to be executed in the U.S., with nine taking place in 2020, according to the Death Penalty Information Center

Billy Joe Wardlow was the first to be executed for his crimes. Wardlow died of lethal injection on July 8 for the killing of 82-year-old Carl Cole in Texas.

Other individuals scheduled to be executed in 2020 include:

• Daniel Lewis Lee, who was sentenced to death for his role in the murder of William Mueller and his family in Florida. Lee’s execution is scheduled for July 13.

• Wesley Ira Purkey is on death row for the killing and dismemberment of Kansas teen Jennifer Long in 1998. Purkey will be executed on July 15.

• Dustin Lee Honken was found guilty for his role in the death of four people who were lured to their deaths by Angela Johnson. Honken’s execution is scheduled for July 17.

• Harold Wayne Nichols faces execution after being found guilty in the rape and murder of 21-year-old Karen Pulley in Tennessee in 1988. Nichols is scheduled to die via lethal injection on Aug. 4.

• Keith Dwayne Nelson was found guilty in the kidnapping and killing of 10-year-old Pamela Butler in Kansas. Aug. 28 will be Nelson’s execution date.

• John Henry Ramirez is scheduled to die via lethal injection on Sept. 9 in Texas for the July 2004 stabbing death of convenience store employee Pablo Castro.

• Carlos Trevino will be executed on death row on Sept. 9 for the 1996 gang rape and murder of Linda Salinas, 15.

• Pervis Tyrone Payne is scheduled to die on Sept. 30 for his role in the rape and death of Charisse Christopher and her two-year-old daughter, Lacie in Tennessee in 1987.",[]

So Toronto family law firm Shulman & Partners LLP, which has experienced a 40% rise in people seeking to split from their spouses since pre-COVID-19, are recommending out-of-court settlements through arbitration and mediation.

“For me as a lawyer, court is always the last resort,” says Diana Isaac, a partner at Shulman & Partners LLP, and a 10-year veteran of practising family law.

“We always try to settle matters and negotiate them because it’s more cost-effective, it’s less emotionally draining for people, and it’s lot more expedient. So talking about mediation, arbitration, as we call it, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, works really well for people who a) want this done quickly and b) with you may not be very far apart in your positions. So if we want to maintain the matter and we want to have good faith discussions and some sort of resolution, mediation is a great option. And a lot of people are gravitating towards this because it’s also private. It’s not in the public realm where your information is put into a court system.”

Issac says Shulman & Partners’s top-five pieces of advice to resolving a divorce or separation outside of court are:

— Remember the pandemic: “These are unprecedented times. We appreciate that changes in the parenting schedule or the financial situation will be temporary and they may be short-lived.”

— Be flexible: “I think in order to keep conflict down and to avoid increased legal costs we have to come up with a solution that makes sense for both parties. So if someone has lost their job during the pandemic, it may make sense to have some sort of temporary arrangement in the interim rather than going to court and saying, ‘I insist that the status quo be maintained.”

— Choose your lawyer wisely: “Having a good fit with that individual is important. Someone that matches and is able to understand what’s important to you. What are your goals and what are your expectations? I think that makes a real difference.”

— Keeping an open mind: “No matter what the situation but especially during a pandemic. And that sometimes coming up with a solution and avoiding court may be a win-win situation. Sometimes in court there’s a winner and a loser but at that point, people are emotionally drained, people have expended significant funds.”

— Talk to each other: “Communication is so pivotal in cases. And I think more and more it’s important. Yes, we are physical distancing, but I think the communication with your partner is very important at this time. Keep each other apprised as to child-related issues is very important and doing it in a way that is respected, that is civil, and in cases involving children, are child-oriented, is very important. Not adding adult conflict and being civil will take you a long way in these times.”",[]

Quebec provincial police said they found the bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, in a wooded area of St-Apollinaire, Que., drawing to a close a days-long search that gripped the province.

“Like all Quebecers, I am devastated, without words. Losing two children, what we hold most dear in life, is incomprehensible,” Legault said on Twitter. “It is a national tragedy.”

2/4 J’ai une pensée particulière pour la mère de Norah et Romy. Pour tous leurs proches aussi. C’est le Québec entier qui pleure avec vous aujourd’hui. — François Legault (@francoislegault) July 11, 2020

He said that all of Quebec is grieving with Norah and Romy’s loved ones.

A spokeswoman for the provincial police confirmed the news of the girls’ deaths on Saturday afternoon, saying the investigation into the cause of death is ongoing.

But Ann Mathieu said the current priority is to locate the girls’ father, Martin Carpentier.

“We think that he is still in the area, so the police operation is still on to find him as soon as possible,” she said.

The girls had been missing since late Wednesday. Their disappearance has gripped people across the province who had hoped they would be found safe.

Police had said the girls and their father were believed to have been in a car crash on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday evening.

Investigators said the car was heading east on the highway when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway.

An Amber Alert was issued for the girls Thursday afternoon, and an extensive police search began in the rural area south of Quebec City.

That search had resumed Saturday morning, with police deploying a helicopter, as well as canine units, ATVs and on-foot search teams, to try to locate the three people.

Police believe Carpentier could still be in St-Apollinaire or the nearby town of St-Agapit, Que., Mathieu said.

“We ask the residents of St-Apollinaire and also St-Agapit to really be alert,” she said.

Bernard Ouellet, the mayor of St-Apollinaire, said earlier Saturday that the tragedy touched the hearts of people across the province.

“Everyone has tears in their eyes,” Ouellet said in a brief interview. “It’s not easy for anyone.”

Mathieu said police are asking anyone who sees Carpentier or has any information on his whereabouts to immediately contact 911.

Police say the 44-year-old was wearing a grey T-shirt and jeans when he was last seen. He is listed as being five-foot-ten and weighing 130 pounds.",[]

Unfortunately, this requires naming the involved songs — Tears Are Not Enough; We Are The World — so get ready for weeks of ear-worm.

One or both tunes will now play non-stop in your head for a month.

Sorry.

Those songs and the resultant albums, music videos and documentaries ensured that for all of 1985 these charitable supergroups hogged the headlines.

The Americans went first, recording We Are The World in January of 1985.

The gathering of top recording artists, calling themselves USA for Africa, was an initiative to raise money for famine relief; included were Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Bill Joel, Willie Nelson and dozens of others.

We Are The World was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian.

Also at the U.S. recording session was Bob Geldof, who had spearheaded the British gathering that got the ball rolling. In late 1984, Geldof corralled a who’s who of U.K. artists to do a benefit recording for famine relief in Ethiopia.

The large group, which called itself Band Aid, included the usual suspects: Bono, Sting, Boy George, various Duran Duran, Boomtown Rats and Spandau Ballet members, George Michael, Phil Collins, etc.

Other big names — David Bowie and Paul McCartney, for example — couldn’t attend the recording session but added messages later.

Geldof and Midge Ure wrote Do They Know It’s Christmas, got it recorded and released it in December 1984. The song made millions for famine relief.

Harry Belafonte then got a similar project started in the U.S. and it eventually became USA for Africa and We Are The World.

What it was like to wrangle all those superstars at once in an all-night session? Quincy Jones uses the phrase, “Like running through hell with gasoline drawers on,” in an excellent recent Rolling Stone story about the events of 35 years ago.

About two weeks after the American session, the Canadians had their turn.

It was a less fraught undertaking — politeness is our national identity — held at Toronto’s Manta Sound on Sunday, Feb. 10.

Produced by David (“I’ve been an a**hole a lot,”) Foster, the single was written by Foster and Bryan Adams and about 50 well-known Canadian artists got together to sing it.

The wildest part about looking at the recording session now is seeing how young everyone is — Gordon Lightfoot, Anne Murray, Burton Cummings, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Hawkins. Corey Hart looks like a baby.

(Having been at that session, one memory that stands out is Anne Murray singing her solo line. She was note-perfect on the first take and people were impressed.

Everyone: Wow!l

Anne Murray: Oh, pshaw.)

The musicians seem to have been grouped, inadvertently or otherwise, according to a fame pecking order that to them must have felt a lot like being back in high school.

Gordon Lightfoot had the honour of singing the first line. If they were making this thing today, that probably wouldn’t change.

The passage of time has altered other reputations, though, and mostly in the burnishing; Joni Mitchell and Neil Young were already big stars, for example, but neither had achieved sainthood yet.

Context? Drake and Justin Bieber weren’t born yet. Neither was Taylor Swift. NWA was three years away from releasing a first album. The Tragically Hip was four years away from their first album. Beyonce was a toddler. There was no internet. Home computers were rare. A few people had car phones but otherwise there were no cell phones. Imagine getting all those famous folk to show up using land lines.

It was an amazing bit of cooperation and coming together for charity. As Geddy Lee said at the time, “It’s 50 lead singers pretending they’re a chorus.”

The end result was a lot of money for charity.

Could such a collegial event ever happen today?

Mallory, 72, a former TV station owner, had an insatiable appetite for vile child pornography.

At his 2013 sentencing, the judge described him as “probably the most prolific collector of child pornography in the entire world.”

In December 2012, he was found guilty of a staggering 60 counts of sexual exploitation of children, tampering with evidence and invasion of privacy.

Detectives found 26,000 files on his computers containing child pornography. The wealthy collector had an infinite number of images and videos showing “children being raped, tortured and sexually exploited.”

Game. Set. Match. Right? Wrong.

On May 27, he was paroled after the parole board decided the twisted man deserved to be released because, you know, “performance incentive credits.”

The prosecutor said he was “powerless” to stop it.

Mallory brought to mind Canada’s very own Blair Evans.

Now 70 years old, the one-time scientist at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa has been in and out of jail on child pornography charges since he was first arrested in 1996.

Every day, he dutifully clocked in at DND, then proceeded to spend every minute of his working day seeking out and downloading nauseating child pornography. Tens of thousands of images.

At the time, he was a married father of two living a quiet suburban existence. But beneath his nebbishy exterior was a dark heart consumed by demons.

“I remember standing on his doorstep, telling his wife what was going on. She was like, ‘No, he would never do something like that,’” said former Ottawa Police sex crimes investigator Keith Daniels. “Of course, he did.”

Evans was found guilty, served eight months in jail, and resumed his near religious devotion to his hobby.

In 2002, he was pinched again, this time in Toronto, for stashing a heartbreaking 200,000 images on his computer while he was on probation.

“These 200,000 images of children … represents tens of thousands of individual children as young as six months old being abused in the most horrendous ways,” Toronto Police Staff-Insp. Gary Ellis told The Toronto Sun at the time.

He was found guilty again, then in 2004 he was spotted accessing child pornography at the library and an internet cafe. Cops called the images “horrific.”

Again, he pleaded guilty. Total custody this time was just under four years. In 2009, he was dinged for breaching his probation.

Evans is now in the wind.

According to Sun files he hasn’t been in trouble since, but we are not privy to every single crime committed in this country. He may have gone straight, but I doubt it.

Suckers at the National Parole Board likely fell for whatever nonsensical tale Evans served up.

Rehabilitation was something the Georgia District Attorney Herb Cranford wasn’t buying.

“In the current digital age, no amount of supervision can stop a compulsive sexual deviant like Mallory from seeking out the most heinous images and videos of small children being sexually abused,” Cranford wrote in a desperate last ditch effort to keep the pedophile behind bars.

No such luck.

DOUBLE MURDER AT SKI LODGE

For 42 years, detectives have hit nothing but brick walls in a double murder at a New York state ski lodge that saw the killers get away with $18,000 from a hidden safe.

The cold-blooded murders of Wing Hollow Ski Corporation employees Michael R. Forness, 29, and Stephen C. Bender, 30, occurred on Feb. 6, 1978. It has remained unsolved.

Cops say that for the victims, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time on the icy cold morning in Allegheny, NY. Both were ski hill groomers working the overnight shift at the resort outside Olean.

Sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. the two men took a break and went to the chalet to get warm and do some chores. They walked into a burglary where the thugs were roving the cash-laden safe from a floor in the manager’s office.

Forness and Bender were each shot three times with the finishing touch a bullet to the back of their heads. A janitor found the bodies at 3 a.m.

Over the years, investigators have said the murders and heist were committed by “professionals” with the killers knowing about the hidden safe.

MISSING

Kenneth James Schmit

411: Lawyer Kenneth James Schmit vanished on Sept. 22, 1966, from St. Walburg, Saskatchewan. At the time of his mysterious disappearance he was 33, stood 5-foot-8 and weighed 155 pounds. He was last seen at 10:30 p.m. leaving a local residence when he went to see about a new car and go fishing with pal Horace Green. Cops say the two men went to the home of a Mr. Romphf where an argument ensued about the car and Schmit — in good health and enjoying a happy home life — vanished forever.

Despite a massive search, he has never been found.

Hamilton Police say the deadly shooting happened in the southbound lanes of Red Hill Valley Pkwy., near King St., around 10 p.m.

The dead man has been identified as 27-year-old Matar Abouchere.

“Hamilton Police are investigating a double shooting on the Southbound Red Hill Valley Parkway in (Hamilton) between King and Greenhill,” police said on Twitter on Friday night.

“One male is deceased and the other is in hospital with serious injuries. Roads are closed in both directions as police investigate.”

The motive for the shooting is unclear and it was not immediately known if it was connected in any way to Pat Musitano’s killing.

Musitano, who narrowly survived a shooting just over a year ago, was fatally shot in the parking lot of a plaza on Plains Rd. E. around 1 p.m.

Two other men, one of whom was reportedly Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, were also wounded in the Burlington shooting.

The Ontario government has already banned dancing and singing on patios, and a source said it’s still undecided on whether dance club-style bars will be allowed to reopen with most other businesses in Stage 3 of the economic recovery plan.

At this point, it’s expected that bars that also offer food service will be part of Stage 3, a phase Premier Doug Ford hinted could come shortly.

But even if the province green lights a return to pubs or clubs, local municipal public health officials could still say no.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s Associate Medical Officer of Health, said the city has helped restaurants and bars expand their outdoor spaces where possible, as COVID-19 is known to spread more easily indoors for reasons such as difficulty maintaining physical distancing, less ventilation and higher risk of contamination on surfaces.

“While COVID-19 case numbers have decreased in Toronto, new infections are still being reported each day,” Dr. Dubey said in an email. “We are seeing more younger adults getting COVID-19 compared to earlier in the outbreak when there were many residents in long-term care homes who were getting COVID-19. This means we still need to be careful. This point is made very clear in the experiences of other jurisdictions.”

Yes, very clear.

Quebec allowed its bars to reopen in late June, but this week imposed new restrictions and threatened to close them again after dozens of COVID-19 cases were linked to watering holes.

As of Friday, Quebec imposed new restrictions on bars — no dancing, no drinking standing up and a midnight last call which is three hours earlier than normal.

Nightclubs and bars across the United States reopened to the public only to be told to shutter their doors as COVID-19 cases soared.

Emily Hogeveen, a spokesperson for Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips, said in an email that venues for large public gatherings such as night clubs continue to be restricted under Stage 2 of the ‘Framework for Reopening Our Province.’

Restaurants and bars were allowed to operate outdoor patios as part of the current Stage 2 provided they follow guidelines such as mandatory reservations and spacing between tables, she said.

“Based on public health advice and the best practices and lessons learned from Stage 2, Stage 3 will focus on reopening the remaining workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually lifting restrictions,” Hogeveen said. “Public health measures and workplace safety guidance will remain in place and available.”

The Ontario government has yet to say definitively what will reopen in Stage 3, and the reclosing or tightening up of bars in other jurisdictions is likely to give province public health officials pause.

“We just want to be cautious,” Ford said Friday. “But eventually we have to open up the bars. We have to open up restaurants inside. We have to get people back to work.”

Tony Elenis, president and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association (ORHMA), said the hospitality industry believes it’s ready for a return of customers.

The sector expects there will be special restrictions on bars — customers won’t be allowed to drink standing up or congregate around the bar.

When patios were reopened, live music wasn’t allowed because of the possibility of airborne droplets from the singing but also due to the tendency of patrons to get closer to each other to talk, he said.

Bars should have their own set of safety rules, but operators are capable of implementing them, he said.

For instance, large bars typically have security guards at the door, he said.

Restaurants, hotels and bars have taken a large financial hit, he said.

“Looking around, it is the last hospitality concept along with large concerts that seems to open,” Elenis said. “All we’re saying is that the industry is ready to open, and it’s ready to open with safety in mind.

“The frightening thing, and the worrisome thing, is that as the crisis stabilizes, and the economy stabilizes and starts to show growth, the hospitality industry is not — the restaurants are not, the bars are not — and that’s the issue,” he said.

Toronto Police say the gunfire erupted near Jane St. and Woolner Ave., north of St. Clair Ave., around 10:20 p.m.

It’s believed two people opened fire from a grey sedan.

“They were just indiscriminately shooting at individuals in this area,” Insp. Norm Proctor told reporters at the scene. “It’s completely reckless.”

“These individuals with no regard for human life just took it upon themselves to shoot out of their vehicle at anybody who was in that area,” he added.

The motive for the driveby was not immediately clear but Proctor said the victims were innocent bystanders.

A woman in her 50s, a man in his 30s and another man in his 40s were taken to hospital.

Two other victims made their own way to the hospital.

No suspect descriptions were immediately released but police say the suspect vehicle were last seen travelling east on Woolner Ave.

The driveby was one of at six shootings in the city Friday as gunplay continues to soar to new heights.

As of July 6 there had been 220 shootings with 96 victims, 22 of whom were killed, in Toronto this year.

Deputy Chief Shawna Coxon, who visited the shooting scene Saturday, said the two shooters just drove up to a gathering and opened fire. It’s believed one opened fire from the driver’s side of the car and the other was shooting from the passenger’s side. “It’s so concerning. It was a brazen shooting,” Coxon said. “We have five victims but there could have been so many more.” She said four of the victims’ injuries were minor but one victim remained in life-threatening condition. “It’s been violent in the city and it is very concerning,” Coxon said.

Oh sure there’s the occasional small private plane taking its passengers north for a camping or fishing vacation (and others city-bound bringing them back home). But one of the sounds we hear more and more frequently, no doubt because of our living close to Sunnybrook Medical Centre, is the distinctive “thump, thump, thump” of the helicopters of Ornge — the non-profit charitable organization that provides air ambulance as well as ground transportation services for the province of Ontario.

Ornge’s “Bandage One” helicopters are frequent visitors to Sunnybrook’s helipad. The sounds that I really notice are missing are those of the various passenger jets following the numerous flight paths laid out right over our house.

Right now, it’s as quiet up there as I’m sure it was 110 years ago on July 12, 1910.

On the evening of the following day the quietness in the skies over our city was interrupted by the sound of one of the marvels of the age, a modern new flying machine piloted by the French count, Jacques de Lesseps, the eldest son of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal (1859-1869).

The young man was in town, accompanied by his Blériot monoplane, to participate in the Toronto Aviation Meet that was sponsored by the Ontario Motor League on the 1,000 acre model farm of William Trethewey located near the Town of Weston.

While de Lesseps and several other pioneer aviators — who travelled to Toronto from various parts of the world with their own personal aircraft — performed for the wide-eyed public over the farm fields, it was the Count who piloted his craft over the city, becoming the first person to fly a heavier-than-air machine over our city.

In recognition of this record-setting feat, Trethewey (after whom today’s Trethewey Drive in named) presented the Count with a check for $500.

The news was predictably grim.

According to forecasts, all provinces will run large deficits this year. And Ontario’s deficit this year (relative to the size of the provincial economy) will be larger than at any point in the last 25 years.

When the COVID public health and economic crisis ends, the Ford government will face an even worse fiscal situation than when they took office. How bad is Ontario’s fiscal outlook?

The Ford government published its budget in mid-March, forecasting a $20.5-billion deficit, the largest nominal deficit in provincial history. Unfortunately, that was overly optimistic. Now, according to new forecasts, the government will collect about $5 billion less.

The government’s fiscal plan, however, included substantial contingencies (an accounting buffer), which would partially offset lower-than-forecasted revenues. Subsequently, RBC Economics now estimates Ontario’s deficit could exceed $21 billion this year.

With its buffer gone, any further bad news on the revenue side — or additional unplanned spending — will cause Ontario’s deficit to grow even larger. But the bad news just keeps coming.

In addition to a larger deficit, Ontario potentially faces a steep recession. According to recent forecasts, Ontario’s economy will shrink 4.2% this year. These two factors combined — a large deficit and a recession — mean Ontario’s long-standing fiscal mess will quickly get much worse.

Consider this: Ontario’s debt-to-GDP ratio (the best measure of debt sustainability) is forecasted to grow from 40% to 46%, the highest level in provincial history.

These problems can’t be solved overnight, especially during a pandemic and recession. The Ford government’s top priority should be helping the province weather the COVID public health and economic crises. However, once these have passed, Ontario’s government must exercise fiscal discipline — for a long time — to repair the damage.

Which raises the key question: Will the Ford government actually do the hard work to reduce Ontario’s debt burden when the recession ends? Only time will tell. But if it does, Ontarians will see a marked change from the policies of this government’s predecessors.

In the years following the 2008-09 recession, when Ontario’s deficit ballooned, the McGuinty and Wynne governments allowed large deficits to persist, which caused government debt to accumulate quickly. In the wake of today’s recession, to not repeat recent history, the Ford government must take active steps to reform and reduce government spending.

If, however, the Ford government — like its predecessors — continues to steadily increase nominal spending while hoping for larger revenue gains to shrink the deficit, it will likely produce similar results, namely more red ink.

The Ford government is not responsible for the current recession nor its effects on provincial finances. Still, once the recession is over, it will be the Ford government’s responsibility to clean up the mess. Doing this — quickly — will help the province prosper in the long-run and will reduce the size of the debt burden to be passed along to future generations of Ontarians.

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s latest legislation against assault weapons really is the first salvo in a campaign to take away every last gun, then you’re on your own.

When Toronto Mayor John Tory and his Calgary counterpart, Nahead Nenshi, ban shooting ranges, it’s your fight.

It wasn’t always this way.

If I am to be labeled a “liberal,” then I was one of the rare ones willing to stand by you. I live in possibly the greatest concentration of left leaners in the country.

I am a bike riding, Chardonnay swilling, Toronto downtowner. I have also spent the last 20 years of my career writing and radio broadcasting and I have always defended the rights of gun owners. No more.

I’m done with your hectoring and condescension. I’m through with your paranoia.

I don’t need to be lectured on a constitutional amendment from another country. The fact that I don’t own a gun is immaterial. That I live in an urban setting doesn’t mean I don’t understand a farmer’s need for a firearm for pest control.

I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don't know why anyone needs automatic weapons. — John Moore (@MooreintheAM) May 1, 2020

I also don’t need the patronizing reminders about how it’s not “a weapon.”

This new indifference stems from a tweet I posted on May 1 that read: “I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don’t know why anyone needs automatic weapons.”

A pretty rare endorsement from a guy who lives in the most liberal North American city outside of San Francisco.

But this brought on such a torrent of abusive tweets my Twitter feed started to look like one of the screens from the Matrix.

Many dwelled on my use of the word “automatic” with tart dispositions about the intricacies of different guns. Ok, I get it. I should have said “assault.”

I don’t have a PhD in guns but you likely don’t have a degree in economics and yet I’m sure you have views on the federal budget.

NO small number of people said “automatic” guns are already banned in Canada. In which case, why the outrage? If Trudeau and Blair are banning something that is already banned, let’s all go back to bed.

I’ll set aside those who called me a “libtard.”

I may not be an expert in guns but I have fired one. I have a policy of trying pretty well everything and if I was going to talk about guns on my radio show (which is in a city where the mayor wants to ban ALL guns), then I thought I should go to a gun range.

My friend, Becky Coles, and her father, John, took me to an indoor range. They taught me to load the magazine of a CZ 75 Compact.

John instructed me on aiming, trigger pressure and recoil. I fired maybe 100 shots. Like most first-timers, I had some good luck. I get that the skill and the thrill are in replicating the good shots.

It was not an experience I care to repeat. I’m just not a gun person. Becky and John have no interest in my hobbies of cycling and golfing.

But that’s the difference. I understand that target shooting is a hobby not a personality disorder. I support hunting (so long as you eat what you kill). I’m not one of those urban snobs who calls gun owners “nutters” or wants to ban ranges or compel people to store their weapons at the range (like many, John and Becky go to different ones).

I do want sensible gun laws. As a matter of fact, even an overwhelming majority of gun owners have few issues with gun storage and transportation laws. They know they reduce the incidence of suicide, accidents and guns falling into criminal hands.

Perhaps, the cohort of angry gun owners is small. I can’t tell. But I don’t need their stress-inducing insults and tirades.

Gun owners, you had an ally but you’re on your own now.

The President Donald Trump-hating comedian Bill Maher, in 2018, openly rooted for a recession, if its price meant the defeat of Trump in 2020. Maher said: “By the way, I’m hoping for it because one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy. So please, bring on the recession… Sorry if that hurts people but it’s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy… I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.”

Similarly, only days ago, a cable host touted the coronavirus’ “silver lining,” that the crisis, or, more specifically, Trump’s alleged poor handling of it, politically damages the president. MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace said: “There is something both tragic, and pathetic, and ironic about the fact that it took a, you know, colour-blind, gender-blind, you know, state-line-blind virus to sort of have all of the president’s sins from his first three years catch up with him. You can’t stand there and lie… And I wonder what you think about whether or not there’s some silver lining there, that some of the things that, that we’ve been talking about for three years may be finally catching up with him?”

“Silver lining”?

The anti-Trump narrative, of course, is that he botched the handling of this crisis, and that but for his inattentiveness, America would not have over 1 million coronavirus cases. This means the worse things get, the greater the chance of Trump’s defeat in November.

This perhaps explains the math of Wallace’s MSNBC colleague, Rachel Maddow. Maddow, on April 21, said: “These are the top five largest outbreaks on Earth. Number five is Germany, with just under 150,000 cases as of today. Number four is France, just under 160,000 cases. Number three is Italy. Number two is Spain with just over 200,000 cases. And then there’s us — USA. USA, biggest outbreak in the world, with over 800,000 cases now. We have more coronavirus cases than all of the other top five countries combined.”

First, does anyone really believe the number is coming out of China, a nation of nearly 1.5 billion and where the outbreak started? The Chinese government lied repeatedly about the origin of the virus, about its transmissibility and, no doubt, about its number of cases.

Second, as of April 21, 2020, the total of the next five countries exceeded our number. The number of confirmed cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was as follows: Spain 200,210; Italy 181,228; France 155,383; Germany 146,653; and the United Kingdom 124,743. That comes to 808,217, versus the USA at 786,566.

Third, how about a little perspective? Spain had 207,634 cases, versus our 931,698 cases. But its population is 47 million. Ours is 330 million, or seven times bigger. Multiply Spain’s number times seven, and that would be over 1.4 million, making Spain’s numbers, when adjusted for population, far worse than America’s. Likewise, Italy’s population is 60 million, making the U.S. population 5.5 times bigger. Multiply Italy’s 181,228 coronavirus cases by 5.5, and that comes to almost 1 million cases, making Italy worse than we were.

What about deaths? As of that date, the total deaths of the five most stricken countries outside the U.S. comes to 86,446, versus our 42,201.

What is it with Democrats, the left-wing media and arithmetic? Joe Biden once talked about President Barack Obama’s “three-letter” program, “Jobs. J.O.B.S.” During one of the Democratic debates, Biden said: “150 million people have been killed since 2007, when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.”

“150 million”? That’s nearly half the population of America.

And consider MSNBC’s Brian Williams’ analysis of Mike Bloomberg giving every American $1 million, rather than spending $500 million to get elected president. Williams, with a New York Times reporter nodding at his side, said: “When I read (this tweet) tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear. ‘Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. U.S. population, 327 million.’ Don’t tell us if you’re ahead of us on the math. ‘He could have given each American $1 million and have had lunch money left over.’ It’s an incredible way of putting it.” Actually, Bloomberg’s $500 million, at $1 million per American, would have gifted exactly 500 of us.

The country is facing a pandemic that has, so far, killed about 60,000 Americans, with many experts expecting a vaccine a year to 18 months from now, if then. But rest assured, say the Trump-haters, the sacrifice the sick and the dead have made were not in vain. There is a “silver lining.” Trump may go down in November.

So, raise a glass.

63,torontosun,https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/articles/205818089-Privacy-Policy#Cookies,Privacy Policy,[],,"Version Effective Date: December 31, 2019

This document has updated the definition of children to persons under the age of 16 (Section 13. Watch the Kids). In the previous version of the policy, children were described as those under the age of 13.

1. About this policy Top

We know your privacy is important to you. It’s important to us, too. So this Privacy Policy will help you, as a user of the Services, understand what information we may gather about you, how we use it, and how we work to protect it. This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Use that govern your use of the Services. Defined terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Use. In visiting the Websites, downloading the App or otherwise using the Services, you are consenting to the information practices outlined in this Privacy Policy, and to the Terms of Use.

Basically, if you’re using PressReader, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree (but we hope you will), don’t use PressReader, and delete your account.

2. Information covered by this policy Top

This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information. “Personal Information” is personally identifiable information that can be used to contact you or determine your identity. When other information is linked to this personally identifiable information, it may also become Personal Information.

Depending on the privacy laws where you live, Personal Information may include your name, personal email address, phone number, billing information, shipping address, device ID, or account login credentials, such as your login for sites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, or other third party websites or apps (your “Social Logins”).

This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that you provide to us, or Personal Information provided to us on your behalf by a third party, including through a Social Login.

We want to be clear: unless we or a third party tells you otherwise, we won’t ask a third party to hand over your Personal Information in order for us to provide you with the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of those third parties with respect to how they themselves collect or use Personal Information in the course of their own business. Also, this Privacy Policy doesn’t cover any advertisements from third parties you may see while using our Services, nor does it cover content in the Services that links to third party websites. You’ll have to check with them to find their privacy policy.

3. It’s all about you Top

Readers are at the center of every decision we make at PressReader. We collect, use, share and process your Personal Information, we promise it’s not to creep you out, but only to make your PressReader experience even better. By “better” we mean, customized to you – we want to recommend stories and content we think you’ll love, and allow you to save and share the ones you do.

If you want to get technical about it, there are a number of reasons we collect and use your Personal Information. For example, we do so in order to deliver the Services to you as required by the Terms of Use, including providing customer support to you when you need it. We also use it to comply with our contractual obligations to our publishing partners, and to help our product development team build a better PressReader product that better reflects your interests.

4. Some Personal Information is required to access certain features or Services Top

Certain features or Services will only be available to you if you create a Registered Account. When you create a Registered Account, we ask you for basic registration information, including your name and email address or Social Login. This is the minimum information you will need to provide in order to create a Registered Account. You will be required to create a Registered Account to fully use and enjoy the features associated with a Trial, Subscription, Single Issue Purchase, or Gifted Issue.

If you purchase a Subscription or make a Single Issue Purchase, we will also collect billing information such as your credit card number, expiry date, and billing address.

Sponsored Access may not necessarily require you to create a Registered Account.

5. We might ask for more Personal Information Top

We may ask you to volunteer additional Personal Information at other times, such as when you provide opinions, post a Submission, enter a contest or promotion, or report a problem with the Services. You can choose not to provide us with this additional Personal Information, but it may mean that you cannot take advantage of the features, Services, contests or promotions associated with our request.

6. We automatically collect certain information Top

When you submit a request for support or information, PressReader will keep a record of that support or information request, and the manner in which it was handled by us.

We also collect information about you as a user so we can make your experience more personal. We automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, your computer or device’s name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses, mobile device IDs, location information derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device (where you have enabled such features and where you have given us permission to collect this information), date/time stamp, and other generally-accepted log information. We also record page views (hit counts), and capture information about your reading behavior.

7. Cookies (not the chocolate chip kind) Top

A cookie is a small amount of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookies to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. However, to protect your privacy, most browsers only permit a website to access the cookies that the same website has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

PressReader sets and accesses our own cookies on your computer. We use them to identify you as a repeat visitor, to maintain session information for logged-in users, and to track usage trends and patterns. That helps us better understand and improve areas of the Websites.

PressReader also allows third parties who are providing content on our Websites to set and access their own cookies on your computer. Third parties’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. We do not have access to any information stored by third parties about you.

You can find more information about the types of cookies that we use on the Cookies page.

8. When we disclose Personal Information Top

In general, we will not disclose Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent. However, there may be circumstances where we may need to disclose Personal Information about you to an unaffiliated third party. For instance:

When PressReader employs other third parties to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, providing customer service, sending mail, processing credit card payments, processing currency conversions, or other functions necessary to our business;

If publishers of the Publications request additional Personal Information from us. The information practices of those publishers will be governed by their own privacy policies;

If we believe you are harming or interfering with the enjoyment of the Services of other PressReader users, anyone else, or violating the terms of your Subscription, Trial, Sponsored Access or Gifted Issue, or violating the Terms of Use, or if we believe you are infringing any of PressReader or a third party’s legal rights;

If we are required by applicable law (or court order) to provide any of your Personal Information. We will, if permitted by applicable law or the terms of a court order, attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied when creating your Registered Account before we respond to the request;

In the event of a sale of all or most of PressReader’s assets, this information may be transferred to the purchaser so they may continue to provide the Services to you.

9. How we use and disclose Anonymous Information Top

“Anonymous Information” is any information other than Personal Information, including aggregated information that we derive from Personal Information. We make sure that Anonymous Information does not include any Personal Information.

PressReader may use Anonymous Information:

To improve the Websites, the App, and the Services;

To deliver the Services;

To monitor traffic and general usage patterns;

To inform publishers as to what content is appealing to certain users of the Services;

To inform advertisers of the usage habits or characteristics of certain users of the Services;

To advise potential investors so that they may better understand the PressReader user base; and

To provide you with an improved experience when using the Websites, the App, and the Services.

10. Your Personal Information may be transferred Top

PressReader has headquarters in Canada, Ireland and the Philippines, all of which work together to seamlessly provide you with the Services. Basically, we’re one big happy PressReader family. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, what you need to know is that PressReader International Limited (“PRI”), located in Dublin, Ireland, is the controller of your Personal Information, as described in applicable data protection law.

PressReader has data processing agreements and security controls in place between the PressReader group of companies, to ensure the safety and security of your Personal Information as it’s shared between us. In using the Services, you consent to us sharing your Personal Information within the PressReader group of companies to the extent required to provide the Services to you.

If you’re located outside of Canada or the Philippines and choose to use the Services or give us any Personal Information, you’re agreeing and understanding that your Personal Information will be transferred, processed and stored in Canada and the Philippines, as it is necessary for us to provide the Services to you and to fulfil our obligations to you under the Terms of Use.

11. You’re in control of your Personal Information Top

You have control over your Personal Information and can change your Registered Account, Subscription information, or other information saved by us, including how much of your Personal Information is publicly available in your profile, by visiting the Website and reviewing your settings.

If you’d like a copy of the Personal Information that PressReader has saved, you can ask us for it anytime, by contacting us here: https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new.

If you want to delete your Registered Account, Subscription Information or other information saved by us, contact us here: https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. We’ll be sad to see you go, but your information will then be deleted, assuming that: (a) you are current with all payment obligations regarding any Subscriptions you have purchased or Single Issue Purchases you have made; (b) PressReader does not believe it is reasonably necessary to keep such information in accordance with applicable law or any pending legal action; and (c) we are under no other legal obligation to retain such information. If your information is deleted, any unfulfilled Subscriptions will be cancelled without refund and you may have to re-register with PressReader in order to use the Services.

You can also object to any aspect of how we process your Personal Information based on what we’ve set out in this Privacy Policy, or revoke your consent to this Privacy Policy, lock stock and barrel, at any time, by contacting us at https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. Where you’ve objected to an aspect of how we process your Personal Information or revoked your consent to this Privacy Policy, we will stop providing the Services to you.

The TL;DR version? If you have any complaints or concerns about your Personal Information or how PressReader uses it, just hit us up at https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. We’re here for you.

12. Privacy Notice for California Residents Top

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. To learn more about your rights under the act, please visit https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038010812.

13. Taking security seriously Top

PressReader uses reasonable and up-to-date security methods to prevent unauthorized access to Personal Information. Seriously. We work hard to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure correct use of Personal Information.

Your Personal Information will be stored within a database behind a firewall for added security. The server that houses the database is physically protected at a secure site and is monitored by security personnel twenty-four hours a day. Only authorized personnel can access the site and the particular server housing the database.

No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. So, while we try to protect your Personal Information, we can’t ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We encrypt all information and web sessions within the Services that are required to be encrypted, such as transmission of credit card information to the Websites or the App, to help protect the data.

14. Watch the Kids Top

The Services offered by PressReader are not directed to children (persons under the age of 16) and we do not knowingly collect, either online or offline, Personal Information of children under the age of 16, except where a parent or guardian has authorized its collection. If you believe the Personal Information of a child under the age of 16 has been provided to us without parental or guardian consent, please notify us at https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new.

We don’t want to spam you, but we do periodically send emails to users with Registered Accounts that we think are helpful. They might talk about changes to the features of the Services, the addition of new issues of your favorite Publications, promotions, or other fun stuff. You can always opt out of PressReader’s marketing or promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your Registered Account. Sorry, but you can’t opt out of billing, legal, or account-related emails.

16. Ch-ch-changes (to this Privacy Policy) Top

We might change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do make changes regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information, we will post a super-obvious notice of the new-and-improved Privacy Policy on the Websites (you might get an email from us, too). Your continued use of the Services after we’ve posted notice of any change to this Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of those changes.

We have answers. Give us a shout here: https://care.pressreader.com/hc/en-us/requests/new.

18. Who’s in charge around here? Top

After finding out, despite denials, that the Prime Minister’s family was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to appear at WE Day events and that Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s two daughters have been involved – one even working for WE now – we find out more.

Did you know the Morneau clan took a trip to Ecuador with WE in December 2017? That’s right, Morneau, his wife Nancy McCain and their children were hosted by WE near Tena in Ecuador’s Amazon rainforest. This was after Ms. McCain and the couple’s daughter Clare Morneau were part of a trip to Kenya earlier that same year.

“In both cases the Morneau family covered all associated costs and expenses,” said Morneau’s spokesman Pierre-Olivier Herbert.

I’m glad the Morneau family paid for their own trip but the point is that Bill Morneau’s whole family is intimately tied to the WE Charity and he didn’t recuse himself from voting to give them a nearly $1 billion sole-sourced contract. Neither did Trudeau, nor it seems anyone else involved.

As they say on those TV infomercials, wait, there’s more!

As first reported by The Post Millennial, Trudeau’s Chief of Staff Katie Telford was a co-founder of a non-profit launched in 2010, “working in support of Free The Children.” The organization, called Artbound, sought to help Free the Children — as WE was then called — build an arts school in Kenya.

Telford wasn’t the only top Liberal on board with Artbound. Longtime Liberal strategist, fundraiser and TV pundit Amanda Alvaro was also a co-founder of the group. The man serving as honourary chair of Artbound was none other than then TV host and current Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan.

As I said in yesterday’s column, it might be easier to ask which top Liberals around Trudeau don’t have a connection to the various WE organizations.

Then there is the problem of the WE-produced video for their Canada 150 celebrations that looks an awful lot like a election video for Justin Trudeau.

The video, on WE’s YouTube channel, is titled “WE are Canada” and features Trudeau making campaign-style comments about his commitment to youth. The PM’s image is featured against beautiful landscape shots of mountains and farm fields, only at the end do you know it is a video from WE.

The video was produced to promote the WE Day on Parliament Hill on July 2, 2017.

At that event Trudeau was a featured speaker addressing thousands of excited young people. WE also got to use the government facilities set up for Canada Day, from the extensive stage to the crowd control measures. According to media reports the Trudeau Liberals also kicked in $1.5 million from taxpayers as part of the Canada 150 celebrations.

I asked WE if they had paid anything to use the facilities and did not get a response. After 18 years of watching those very same Canada Day celebrations, I can say that I’ve never seen any other organization be given that kind of access.

“WE works for Trudeau and Trudeau for them,” Conservative MP Candice Bergen tweeted in response to the video.

With all the close connections, all the coziness, the sentiment expressed by Bergen will only become more widespread. Since 2017, WE has received more than $5 million in grants and contributions from the Trudeau government.

And all of that was before the now cancelled $912 million sole-sourced contract Trudeau announced at the end of June.

With the PM’s family being paid, the Finance Minister’s daughter working for WE and his whole family being involved with them, with the PM’s Chief of Staff and a cabinet minister having started a charity specifically to support WE, how did they not see that they would have a conflict of interest?

And any fault here lies with the government, not WE.

It wasn’t WE that asked the government for a $912 million contract that never went to tender — it was the government that offered it up to their friends.

So far it doesn’t seem that Trudeau, his ministers or top staff understand this. They are hoping they can get away from this by simply repeating the same lines over and over again.

Let me repeat this every day until it sinks in, Mr. Trudeau, you can’t help your friends with our money.

With the pandemic’s sudden arrival, scores of people found themselves abruptly out of work. In an expensive city like Toronto, those already on the edge and barely scraping by were hit the hardest.

In the heavy days following the emergency declaration — when the reality of what was before us was only just beginning to sink in — the emails didn’t stop coming.

In these “unprecedented times,” banks, cell phone providers, car companies, even utility companies were coming out of the woodwork to declare their solidarity and support by adjusting rates, waiving late-payment fees and offering deferral options. It’s not an exaggeration to say that fear and uncertainty were everywhere, even for those of us with secure jobs and savings to sustain us.

All levels of government were scrambling to figure out how to cushion the blow.

For those living paycheck-to-paycheck while employed in fields and industries effectively shuttered until further notice, the shutdown was disastrous.

On March 26 when asked what he would say to Ontarians worrying about how they’d make rent in a few days, Premier Doug Ford said this: “If you have a choice between putting food on your table or paying rent, you’re putting food on your table. The government of Ontario will make sure that no one gets evicted. We stand by that and we’re gonna make sure we take care of those people.”

And with that came a provincial moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent. Problem solved?

Well, no. Not if you’re an out-of-work tenant, grateful for the temporary relief but wondering how on earth you will be able to pay rent without income, let alone begin to face the months of accrued back-rent once the moratorium is lifted.

Certainly not if you’re a landlord being asked to work in good faith with your tenants to land on a payment plan, while simultaneously having to wonder if the tenant in question is truly unable to pay or simply feels they shouldn’t have to. After all, your overhead and operating expenses remain the same.

An impending crisis was plainly identified, but in the months that followed a true solution never materialized. As government stimulus money flowed and the Canada’s Emergency Relief Benefit cheques rolled out, presumably the thinking was that besieged tenants could now keep up but that presupposes that everyone qualified, and that there weren’t other expenses — food, medicine, family needing emergency assistance — that took precedence.

An important additional layer to all of this is the fact that the data shows that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Toronto’s low-income Black communities in the northwest corner of the city, many of the very same communities already historically overrepresented in the eviction applications presented to the Landlord Tenant Board. Particularly in light of the current societal reckoning drawing our awareness to the insidious nature of institutionalized racism, this connection cannot be ignored.

So, what now?

Well, for starters, Bill 134, the “Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act,” already in the works prior to the pandemic, is on the verge of coming into effect and that could well be the match that lights this powder keg.

Purportedly designed to address the significant backlog at the Landlord Tenant Board by streamlining and expediting the hearing process, tenants’ rights advocates are ringing the alarm that things are about to get even worse for the already vulnerable.

Among a number of changes intended to introduce efficiencies, most relevant is that any tenant who defaults on a payment arrangement could face immediate eviction without a hearing. So, in practical terms, what that means is that the tenant who fell behind in April but promised to catch up in June — when we all assumed life would have surely returned to some form of normalcy — has no mechanism available to them to facilitate revisiting that payment arrangement. If they fail to honour it by even a few dollars, they can be out on the street.

On the flip side, landlords are not all faceless corporate entities — just as many are smaller-scale investors who might own a few condos as long-term investments which they lease out to offset the carrying costs. They are likely already feeling the impacts of the “COVID recession” and not receiving that rent could be equally damaging.

Recognizing that the stakes are incredibly high, with homelessness already a crisis in our city, it is critical that the same government who identified the moral imperative to freeze evictions and protect its citizens from the economic fallout of a global pandemic now sees it through.

Hitting pause wasn’t enough. We need a solution.

As we all brace for the distinct possibility of a second wave come fall, it seems obvious that if the solution is to stay safe and stay home, doing all we can to keep people in their homes is paramount.

Instead of persistently explaining their platforms to the party’s membership, the two frontrunners — Erin O’Toole and Peter MacKay — seem to have been spending too much time bickering over each other.

At least that’s the impression to those far more concerned at the moment with the problems imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the multi-billions our prime minister seems to be dishing out willy-nilly.

O’Toole’s silly headline-grabbing episode of accusing MacKay of stealing some campaign data, and then calling in the cops, was too juvenile for someone wanting to be prime minister.

So, do you write him off? It’s awfully tempting.

During the French language debate, which was uncomfortable even to a non-French speaker, all MacKay and O’Toole will be remembered for are accusations that one is secretly planning to introduce a carbon tax as part of the Tories’ next election campaign.

Liar, liar, cried O’Toole.

And MacKay referring to O’Toole as “Erin Trudeau” was childish trap-baiting and so utterly impossible to conjure.

If there is anyone not-Justin-Trudeau-like, it’s Erin O’Toole.

According to politicos who hover over Parliament, only Peter MacKay has the chance to unseat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals.

Yet, where is the excitement? If MacKay is the ticket, where are the crowds? Where are the new young Tories clambering for volunteer jobs?

If there was ever evidence that the Conservatives had to do some time in the wilderness, it was post-election 2015 when Trudeau visited the Global Affairs building and was treated by civil servants like the messiah.

The supposed non-partisan role of the civil servant went entirely out the window. The Tories, at that moment, were toast, and Andrew Scheer was obviously not the answer then, and never would be.

But the dew is long off Trudeau the Younger’s rose.

The two other Tory contenders, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan, both appeal to the Conservative base with more right-wing principles.

Sloan, a first-term Tory from the south-central Ontario riding of Hastings-Lennox & Addington, is vehemently pro-life and doesn’t waste a moment’s thought on the LGBTQ community.

Leslyn Lewis is a Toronto lawyer who has never been elected even dog catcher, has little grasp of the French language, but seems to be getting closer looks.

Last week, she was endorsed by Conservative stalwart, Scott Reid, an Ontario MP who has served in the House of Commons without fatally tripping for 20 years.

And Reid was gushing, saying the last time he was this excited about a leadership candidate was in 2004, when Stephen Harper became the boss over Peter MacKay of the newly-formed Conservative party.

But really?

Having worked in government briefly as speechwriter and senior political advisor to former Tory cabinet minister Lisa Raitt, and previously in provincial politics, it amazes me that a one-term MP, or someone with no political experience at all, believes they can step immediately into a party’s leadership and not immediately be horribly overwhelmed.

Sloan and Lewis, despite their courage, are in way over their heads. The job they’re seeking is not for newbies.

To the casual Conservative, therefore, what’s needed is a seasoned politician, or a recognizable senior business type with huge political connections like the oft-maligned Brian Mulroney, who has the ability to not only motivate people but to inspire them.

An unknown has never been that person.

You see, the world is about to get very complicated for the Leafs and several other NHL teams who have spent money with the assumption the salary cap would continue to rise, and rise some more. In all the planning and organizing the Leafs and other clubs worked through, nobody budgeted for a pandemic.

So, this is perhaps the last dance for a Leafs team with John Tavares, Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and William Nylander. The last dance with Frederik Andersen in goal and Morgan Rielly on defence. The last dance with Zach Hyman banging around in the corners.

Somebody is going to have to go. You can’t spend half your money on four players and have any real chance of success. And there is little assurance the salary cap of $81.5 million US — now artificially in place for the next two seasons — will be going up in the years to follow.

It was natural for Kyle Dubas to assume the cap would continue to increase. In the past four seasons, it went from $73 million to $75 to $79 to $81. Anything close to that projection would have seen a cap at $87 million within two seasons, which would have freed up appropriate money for Maple Leafs spending.

Now, there’s still this summer playoff run and who knows where everything goes from here? Hockey was complicated before. The business is a whole lot more complicated now.

THIS AND THAT

Buster Posey isn’t playing. David Price isn’t playing. Travis Hamonic isn’t playing. Spencer Dinwiddie isn’t playing. More will say ‘no.’ You don’t know them, really. You don’t know their families. You don’t know their personal situations. You can’t criticize anyone who says ‘no’ to playing through this pandemic … If I’m Tie Domi, I’m having the difficult conversation and urging Max Domi, his son, not to play for the Montreal Canadiens when the season resumes. But I’m not Tie and I know Max, he’ll play … A management team of Doug Armstrong, Ken Holland, Kelly McCrimmon and maybe Julian BriseBois should be selected to run Team Canada for the 2022 Winter Olympics. A lot of people want Mike Babcock to coach. I’d like to see Bruce Cassidy, who beat Babcock twice in playoff series, get a shot. And if not him, Jon Cooper … Nylander has scored three goals in 20 playoff games with the Leafs. Marner leads the team in playoff scoring the past three seasons with 17 points in 20 games. Matthews has scored at an 83-point pace in his regular-season career, but just a 53-point pace in the playoffs … The Western Conference playoff series I can’t wait to watch: Winnipeg vs. Calgary. I also won’t miss a second, if I can, of watching Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl against what’s left of the Blackhawks … Two very good hockey people available: Mike Futa, formerly of the L.A. Kings, and Rick Dudley, formerly of just about everywhere … I can name about 60 players in the NBA, MLB and NFL who have tested positive for COVID-19. There is no social stigma for testing positive. With the see-no-evil ever-secret NHL, though, not a name has gone public.

HEAR AND THERE

There’s more to Chris Pronger leaving the Florida Panthers than has been spoken about. Pronger wanted to be the next general manager and should have been the man to replace Dale Tallon. Word around is that the assistant GM, Eric Joyce, will soon to be elevated to the top job. His background isn’t hockey, it’s national security. The Panthers continually keep trying to be smarter than everyone else in hockey and somehow fail every time they get cute … Initials I’ve learned since I started covering hockey: CBA, MOU, AAV, UFA, RFA, NHLPA, PK the player, PK the penalty-kill, PP and I’m sure I’m missing a whole bunch. There should be classes in this stuff … So, this is confusing. The first round of play-in games in the NHL are considered playoffs by the league for purposes of statistics. But if a team, say, Vancouver, loses out in the first round, the Canucks will be thought to have not made the playoffs. Got all that? … You might have missed this: Mike Harrington of the Buffalo News reported that Alexander Mogilny got a super-snub from the Hockey Hall of Fame committee. Never mind that he didn’t get voted in. He didn’t even get nominated … A name that should come up more often for Hall of Fame conversation: Jeremy Roenick. Another one: Patrick Elias. And the goalies, starting with Tom Barrasso … Thought Lindy Ruff was an odd choice to coach the Devils until I did some checking. He isn’t, I’m told, a dinosaur. He isn’t, like Mike Babcock was, yesterday’s stubborn man. He’s learned from being fired in Buffalo and Dallas. I thought he was a great coach years ago. Now we’ll find out what he has left … I won’t sleep at night (which I don’t anyway) until an NBA player in the bubble gets food from Bobby Flay or Guy Fieri.

SCENE AND HEARD

The best part of the Blue Jays playing intrasquad games throughout their pre-season training: Every night is guaranteed win night … The best way the Jays could ensure they play games in Toronto this season: Send a cheque to Margaret Trudeau. Kidding. Sort of … At the wrap-up interviews at the end of last season, both Ross Atkins and manager Charlie Montoyo said they thought Vladimir Guerrero Jr. was on his way to becoming a third baseman. They talked positively about his progress, although the eye test told a different story. It makes sense to move Guerrero to first base. It would have also made sense to say that last October … Edwin Encarnacion became a different hitter when he moved from third base, where he struggled, to first base or DH. Guerrero might get the same kind of freedom now what he doesn’t have to worry about playing the hot corner … Best third basemen in Blue Jays history: 1. Josh Donaldson; 2. Scott Rolen (briefly); 3. Kelly Gruber … ESPN baseball writer Buster Olney, one of the very best in the business, believes there is zero chance of completing the major-league season. Baseball is clearly more disorganized than the other sports in attempting to return … Why the Blue Jays can’t be allowed to have home games in Toronto? Premier Doug Ford can’t tell us to be safe, to wear masks, to stay home, to socially distance, to be smart every single day — and he’s doing it wonderfully well — and then turn around and say: ‘Never mind, we’re opening the border for the Tampa Bay Rays from the COVID-19 capital of the world.’

AND ANOTHER THING

Hero of the week: Julian Edelman. The slight New England receiver was smart enough to turn the racist anti-Semitic social media ignorance of DeSean Jackson into an educational positive … Missing from the Jackson tweet and the Stephen Jackson follow-up of further ignorance, were the usually loud voices who passionately and rightfully support Black Lives Matter. I thought being silent was being complicit. I guess Jewish Lives Don’t Matter … The unwritten rules of sport: Brendan Leipsic says something insulting and gets bounced by the Washington Capitals within seconds — partially because of what he said, partially because he was a disposable player. Jackson tweets something offensive and the Eagles will penalize him internally. You keep the difference-maker. You push the marginal guy out the door … What hasn’t been talked much enough: The personal difficulty for athletes in bubble situations who suffer from any kind of anxiety, insomnia or social discomfort. As someone who has had panic attacks in hotel rooms over the years — and I can tell you they’re not pleasant — I feel for those who must be cooped-up for the next several weeks and, in some cases, for the next few months. The sports psychologists will be hard at work throughout the NHL, NBA and MLB’s attempted returns … What I’d still like to know: What exactly did Ontario and Alberta allow for the NHL return that Dr. Bonnie Henry in British Columbia would not? And if there were such a thing as a COVID-19 draft, my first pick would be Dr. Henry … What to do early on a Sunday morning? Read this column. Watch Toronto FC with your breakfast … Happy birthday to Joey McLaughlin (64), Al MacInnis (57), Jordan Binnington (27), Bruny Surin (53), Leon Spinks (67), Bill Barber (68), Julio Cesar Chavez (58), Kristi Yamaguchi (49), Brock Lesnar (43) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (22) … And hey, whatever became of Jesse Litsch?

When I hear the name Edmonton Eskimos, the first thing I think of is excellence.

I know that’s not a popular thing to say right now in this time of necessary change.

When I hear the Edmonton Eskimos name, my first thoughts are of Warren Moon and Tom Wilkinson, of Dan Kepley and Gizmo Williams, of five straight Grey Cups, of the greatest players and greatest franchise in Canadian Football League history. My thoughts are also of Ricky Ray and Matt Dunigan, Damon Allen and Ron Lancaster and Hugh Campbell.

The connotation for me, as a white Canadian who has grown up in this country and lived in Ontario and Alberta is that Eskimos is a name to be celebrated. It may be different for you, depending on your life experiences and your own viewpoints.

This is a time for change in North America and around the world. This is an important time. We have a serious problem in this country with how we treat our Indigenous people — or more importantly how we continue to mistreat them. You see it night after night on the national news. Changing the name of a football team that offends some, but not everyone of that culture — see Jordan Tootoo’s recent response — won’t change anything but toss history to the side.

How about we celebrate the historical greatness of the Eskimos as a starting point to begin to solve Canada’s most significant social and cultural problem?

It’s hard to believe it’s been this long, but this is the beginning of Mark Shapiro and Ross Atkins’ fifth season in charge of the Blue Jays — and still, we really don’t know what to think of them.

Just who are they and what have they accomplished in their time in Toronto? I wish we knew more. I wish we had a greater sense of who either man is. I thought, maybe over time, they would grow more comfortable in the environment, open up a little more, make you feel like they’re the right people for the job, that you can trust them to operate the baseball club properly.

Shapiro remains a textbook talker. He sounds a little like John Farrell sounded when he came to the Jays. Like he walked and talked out of some second-year university course and was big on buzz words that said nothing. You want to trust him. You want to believe in him. As the fifth year begins, I still don’t know who he is, what he really thinks, what he believes, what the future might look like.

Atkins is a nice man. All you have to do is spend time around him to know that. You can’t help but like him. But then ask him a straight question and you rarely get a straight answer back. It’s not that he can’t answer. He’s still not sure what he’s supposed to say.

Do I believe in him the way I believed in Pat Gillick or Alex Anthopoulos? Not yet. And it’s not early anymore.

I have been fortunate enough to cover nine Olympic hockey tournaments, five with NHL players involved, four without. Two tournaments in Canada, one in France, one in Norway, one in Russia, one in Italy, one in Japan, one in South Korea, one in the U.S. Each of them different in style and substance.

But there is little doubt in my mind that the Olympics are far richer when the best in the world are playing against the best in the world.

The most recent Olympic hockey tournament, put together more hastily than any before it, was probably the worst calibre of hockey played at the greatest of sporting events in five decades.

When it was reported recently that Olympic participation was part of the NHL’s new Collective Bargaining Agreement with its players — barring a problem with the IOC or the International Ice Hockey Federation — I couldn’t have been happier. Not for me. For you. For hockey fans. And the first player I thought of was Connor McDavid.

I’ve spoken to McDavid numerous times about his want and need to play in the Olympics, to play for Canada. Now, what looked like a lost opportunity, is suddenly there for him, for Auston Matthews for Jack Eichel for Nathan MacKinnon for Elias Pettersson, for the great young NHL players who haven’t been there before.

The win in the negotiations was for them and, by extension, for hockey fans. Finally, something for the fans.",[]
68,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-eastern-canada-unfazed-by-trudeaus-lack-of-ethics,GOLDSTEIN: Eastern Canada unfazed by Trudeau's lack of ethics,"['Lorrie Goldsteinmore Lorrie Goldstein', 'More Lorrie Goldstein', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Opinion', 'Columnists', 'Share']",2020-07-11 16:30:50+00:00,"As recent political history shows, the Conservatives should not pin their hopes on the Trudeau-WE Charity scandal alone bringing down the Liberals.

To win, the next Conservative leader will have to convince voters they can safely hand the keys of government to the Tories and they won’t wreck the place.

Voters already knew Prime Minister Justin Trudeau lacks any sense of ethics when it comes to conflict of interest laws.

They re-elected him anyway last October, or, more accurately, Eastern Canadian voters did — albeit reducing his majority government to a minority — because they didn’t consider Andrew Scheer a viable alternative.

They knew Trudeau acts like an arrogant elitist who believes he’s entitled to break the rules lesser mortals must follow.

They knew that when caught, Trudeau misleads the public about what he did, until he’s forced to fess up and promises to cooperate with the ethics commissioner.

Then, when the ethics commissioner finds him guilty of breaking the Conflict of Interest Act, Trudeau says he accepts responsibility for what he did, without taking responsibility.

In the Aga Khan scandal, Trudeau said accepting free family vacations from the Aga Khan on his private island in the Bahamas, while his government was considering taxpayer funding to his charity, wasn’t illegal.

This because the Aga Khan was his close, personal friend and the law allows for gifts from friends.

When then ethics commissioner Mary Dawson said that wasn’t true — that the Aga Khan’s friendship was with Trudeau’s father, Pierre, not him — and that he had broken four sections of the Conflict of Interest Act, Trudeau apologized and said he would consult the ethics commissioner in future.

But he pointedly added he disagreed with Dawson’s key finding and still considered the Aga Khan a close, personal friend, meaning he doesn’t think he did anything wrong.

In the SNC-Lavalin affair, Trudeau initially called the Globe and Mail story that broke his second conflict-of-interest scandal “false.”

After ethics commissioner Mario Dion’s scathing report on Trudeau’s illegal efforts to get then attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to drop a criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin in Quebec for political reasons, Trudeau said he wouldn’t apologize because he was protecting jobs.

Again, Trudeau doesn’t think he did anything wrong.

This time, Trudeau awarded a now-cancelled $912 million, sole-sourced government contract, with a $20 million administration fee, to the WE Charity, which has paid his mother, brother and wife over $300,000 in speaking fees.

Trudeau initially said the decision to give the contract to WE was made independently by civil servants, who determined it was the only organization that could fulfill the contract competently.

We now know that claim was nonsense. Trudeau actively participated in the cabinet decision to fund the so-called Canada Student Service Grant, a bizarre scheme to pay students less than minimum wage for doing “volunteer” work.

Trudeau now says he will “collaborate” with the ethics commissioner’s investigation into the role he played in awarding the contract to WE.

Meanwhile, Trudeau is still riding high in the opinion polls because of his handling of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggests if an election was held today the Liberals would win a majority government.

None of this means the Conservatives — and the other opposition parties — should not hold Trudeau to account for what he’s done.

It does mean understanding the WE scandal alone won’t defeat him in the next election.

For the first time since a win over Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz on March 9, the Raptors took the court as a team for a practice in Orlando in advance of the NBA’s season resuming with scrimmages later this month. By all accounts, despite an expected bit of rust, the team looked pretty good.

“It felt good, it’s been awhile,” said starting guard Fred VanVleet. “I think you saw some rust, some excitement, and that first day of school type of thing for everybody, coaches and players,” he said.

“We’ve got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we’ve still got a long way to go.”

VanVleet said he hadn’t yet seen much of the NBA’s setup because the team had just gotten out of quarantine Saturday morning after arriving from their previous training location elsewhere in Florida (where they could only do individual work).

“I think we’ll have more things to do, we’ll kind of walk around and more controlled. When we were in Naples, we couldn’t control everybody else, I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that’s probably the biggest difference,” VanVleet said of what life will be like for the team.

On the court, head coach Nick Nurse said he pushed them a little harder than he initially anticipated and there are plenty of things to work on, but, “from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us,” Nurse said.

“I started heavier than normal and just told the guys to please self-monitor and let’s not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.”

Still, Nurse saw what he always does, a smart, savvy, professional group.

“We’ll find a way, we’ll manage a way to do some experimenting as well as we put the pieces of the puzzle back together (during this second training camp),” Nurse said.

“I think that’s going to go fast, I sensed a lot of guys grasping all our set calls and all our defensive coverages, it was pretty good.”

If everything goes smoothly, Toronto will scrimmage against the Houston Rockets on July 24 in the team’s first quasi game action.

Way back in October the Raptors and Rockets opened the pre-season with a pair of games in Japan.

“I never really looked at it that way,” Nurse said.

“That does seem like a long, long time ago, that we were in Tokyo. And we always like to see the Rockets, so we’ll look forward to that first scrimmage.”

But first, there’s quite a bit of work to be done.

NOT EASING IN

Every though it was the first day of practice in months, the competitive juices were immediately flowing for the Raptors.

“It’s good that we’re back here. We just wanna play,” said all-star forward Pascal Siakam.

“Everyone is excited about playing. That’s what you wanna see. It gets a little intense every time you get on the floor. It doesn’t matter how long you were off. Once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that’s what you wanna see from a team.”

For one of the only times in 2019-20, the full roster is intact at the moment. Just about every key player, save for OG Anunoby, missed substantial time due to injury.

“We haven’t really had a full team all year, so it will be interesting to see what that looks like for a long stretch of time,” VanVleet said.

The guard added Nurse mixed up the lineups, not playing the expected starting five together on Monday.

WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART

Kyle Lowry was originally slated to address the media on Saturday, but the new plan is a Monday media session, with Marc Gasol going Sunday. Despite being the team’s leaders, most decorated and most experienced veterans, neither has talked since the season shut down months ago, which has forced some teammates like VanVleet, Norman Powell and Siakam to be quite busy fulfilling media obligations.

On another note, Siakam declined to disclose what the back of his jersey would say (the NBA is allowing players to have social justice messages on their jerseys in light of the movements taking place around the world), but said there have been many discussions as a team.

“I’m definitely not the spokesperson for it. I think we have a lot of plans,” Siakam said. “Together as a team we have a whole committee working on it. I think once it’s time, you guys are gonna see what we have. I think everyone is mindful of it from management, ownership, everyone is really involved into it. We just want to do everything we can to make a change. We’re just gonna have to see … You’ll see soon.”

THE PROCESS

The Raptors arrived in Orlando on Thursday and immediately went for testing. They were tested again on Friday night and Nurse said they “got the all-clear around 10:30 or 11 (Saturday) morning.”

He said there was a bit of anxiety and was very thankful everyone was OK.

As for another two days of quarantining? Siakam said it was no big deal.

“I didn’t get out for like three months or two months, so I’m used to it,” he said.

“Two days is nothing. It went by quick, found things to do, like video games, anything I can do to let time fly. And just being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team. We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere (on Saturday), and that’s all I really care about.”

Poker player and internet celebrity Dan Bilzerian has a penchant for spending money, but as the annual report from his cannabis company reveals, he’s not as good at making it.

Bilzerian is the CEO of Ignite International Brands, Ltd., which sells a line of cannabis and CBD products, such as CBD-infused toothpicks. Forbes reports that the company posted $67 million in losses in 2019.

The company, which is listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange, was trading at a peak of $5 a share in 2017 but was down to .94 cents a share as of Friday morning.

According to Forbes, the company stayed afloat in two ways last year, by raising money via debt and selling shares of the company’s stock.

Flush with other people’s money, the company hosted lavish parties but didn’t move much product. For every dollar earned in sales, almost two dollars went towards general and administrative costs.

Bilzerian, the son of millionaire Paul Bilzerian, who served 13-months in prison in the 1980s as a result of filing incomplete disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has said the Ignite brand is about “not conforming.”



“I think a big piece of it is about destigmatizing the cannabis industry,” he told London Real in 2019. “People look at cannabis as like, ‘Oh, you smoke weed, you’re a stoner,’ and I’m out here with six per cent body fat.”

Meital Manzuri, a Los Angeles-based cannabis business attorney, told Forbes she is “wondering what’s going on behind the curtain,” with the company.

“They probably expanded too quickly, had loose spending, bad business decisions — which is common in this space,” she said. “They just look like a failing company.”

75,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/traikos-nhl-needs-to-be-transparent-with-who-has-covid-19,Traikos: NHL needs to be transparent with who has COVID-19,"['Michael Traikosmore Michael Traikos', 'More Michael Traikos', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports', 'Hockey', 'Nhl']",2020-07-11 23:30:47+00:00,"In the 2009 playoffs, Nicklas Lidstrom missed the final two games of the Western Conference final with what was vaguely described as a “lower-body injury.” But everyone who saw the Detroit defenceman doubled over in pain knew what the actual extent of the injury really was.

Lidstrom, who had been speared by Chicago’s Patrick Sharp in Game 3, had a badly bruised testicle. It required surgery. He said it was the most painful injury he’d ever endured.

It was also the most embarrassing.

Going forward, we will no longer be told if a player pulls a muscle or breaks a bone or even ruptures his scrotum in a game. And we certainly won’t know if he develops a respiratory illness that could jeopardize him, his teammates and the entire Stanley Cup playoffs.

According to the NHL, disclosing who has the coronavirus is off limits. And if you can’t disclose who has the coronavirus, by process of elimination, then you can’t really disclose any other injury.

In other words, there is no transparency when it comes to player absences.

If someone misses a game, it could be because he suffered a concussion. Or it could be because he has COVID-19. It’s up to fans — and other players sharing the same hotels and facilities inside one of two bubbles — to guess.

“Medical privacy is important in this process,” deputy commissioner Bill Daly said during a conference call on Saturday, one day after the NHL and NHLPA ratified an agreement to begin the playoffs on Aug. 1. “Having said that, we understand as a league we have an obligation of some transparency with respect to the COVID virus in particular.

“At least for now we’re going to maintain a policy where the league is announcing on league numbers and clubs are prohibited from giving any information with respect to COVID test results and for the purposes of making the system work, any injury information going forward.”

We still don’t know for sure whether Toronto’s Auston Matthews tested positive for COVID-19 last month or whether he still has the coronavirus. And we won’t know if he gets it again — even if it’s prior to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final — because the NHL doesn’t want us to know.

Why the secrecy? What is the disadvantage of saying that Matthews or another player has tested positive for COVID-19? Well, the league wants you to believe that it’s a privacy issue. But in reality, all they really want is to control the message at a time when the potential negative press from one, two or a handful of tests could end up shutting down the NHL’s dream of awarding the Stanley Cup before a single game is even played.

“The media and public will know what kind of situation we’re in,” said Daly. “But we don’t want to be in a situation where we’re doing it on a club-by-club basis or a player-by-player basis, because I think the interests of medical privacy are important and we’re going to protect them.”

The league said it would give daily or weekly updates during the playoffs as to how many players have tested positive for COVID-19, but it will not identify what players have it or even what team they play for. But the latter two details are just as important as the first. In some ways, with up to 12 teams living inside the same bubble, they are even more essential.

If you were a player, wouldn’t you want to know if the person you’re riding the elevator with or lining up against in the faceoff circle has the coronavirus? Concussions are not contagious, but COVID-19 is.

We’re at the point now in this pandemic where everyone knows at least one person who has contracted the coronavirus. It’s not as if we’re announcing which players have erectile dysfunction or irritable bowel syndrome. There is no stigma around COVID-19. If you get it, it doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. Put enough people in a hotel — with some workers coming and going within the bubble — and chances are that someone is going to get it and spread it.

When asked what it would take for the league to cancel the playoffs, Daly said there is no threshold.

“One positive shouldn’t shut down the tournament,” he said.

Multiple tests might not even. It’s more of a sense and a feel as to whether the spread of the virus has gotten out of hand.

In other words, if five players on five different teams get the coronavirus, it’s a different situation than if five players on the same team tested positive. There’s also a difference between Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl testing positive versus a third-pairing defencemen and the backup goalie.

But we’ll have to trust the league in being able to differentiate between the two. And we’ll also have to trust that teams and players, who have a history of hiding concussions, won’t hide a heightened temperature reading if it means advancing to the conference final.

Maybe that is why Calgary’s Travis Hamonic and Vancouver’s Sven Baertschi have already opted out of the playoffs. Players have until the start of training camp on Monday to decide whether they will participate.

“The fact is that all of us — everybody who’s served — understands the importance and the seriousness of what we’re dealing with,” said NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, “and I don’t think anybody is going to want to be playing games with the truth and the reality of what we’re all dealing with.”

The fact is that these are also hockey players. They are young and healthy. They are potentially the least at-risk group for dying from COVID-19 or even being hospitalized. If Lidstrom, who returned to play in the Stanley Cup final — albeit in considerable pain — was willing to risk his so-called manhood for a chance at the Cup, what are the odds that a player or a team will try to play on?

Either way, the league is making sure we’ll never know about it.

76,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/sports/horse-racing/silent-poet-makes-a-loud-statement-in-the-175000-connaught-cup-stakes,"Silent Poet makes a loud statement in the $175,000 Connaught Cup Stakes","['Steve Bufferymore Steve Buffery', 'More Steve Buffery', 'Michael Burns', 'Woodbine Entertainment', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports']",2020-07-11 22:54:30+00:00,"A couple of years ago, Justin Stein was raising goats in the mountains of British Columbia.

Now the veteran jockey is back raising big money for his owners and trainers at Woodbine Racetrack.

Stein hasn’t missed a beat since giving up the mountain life and returning to Woodbine to ride in 2019. This year he is red-hot, displaying excellent form again on Saturday at the Etobicoke oval where he won two races in spectacular fashion, including the Grade II $175,000 Connaught Cup Stakes aboard Silent Poet on a soft E.P. Taylor turf course.

Not that the victory was easy. The race finish was a thing of beauty as Silent Poet, on the inside, and 8-1 long shot Admiralty Pier, with Jerome Lermyte in the saddle, charged down the stretch side-by-side until Silent Poet, the 7-5 favourite, managed to break away in the final few strides.

Silent Poet had been ridden his entire career by Gary Boulanger, but the Hall of Fame jockey was injured in a training accident two weeks ago and is laid up. Trainer Nick Gonzalez replaced Boulanger with Stein, who is second in the Woodbine jockey standings with 22 victories, six behind the leader Rafael Hernandez and one ahead of third-place rider Emma-Jayne Wilson.

“I was really excited to ride him. He definitely showed me his stuff,” said Stein. “When I rode against him, I was on Cooler Mike, and we rolled right up to him like we were going to drive on by and Silent Poet looked at us and laughed, kind of like what he did today.”

Stein said the eight-time winner had the same attitude here, testing Admiralty Pier all the way. “Just so much heart, unbelievable,” said Stein, who won the 2012 Queen’s Plate on Strait of Dover.

Silent Poet, a Stronach Stables home bred, battled on top with Admiralty Pier through panels of :23.07 and :45.70, with City Boy and Gray’s Fable stalking the dueling leaders all the way into the stretch. The top pair pulled ahead, and the slugfest continued down the lane, with Silent Poet ultimately persevering by half a length in the seven-furlong contest in 1:23.62.

Blind Ambition finished 4 3/4 lengths behind Admiralty Pier, just edging out Olympic Runner for the show prize, while City Boy and Gray’s Fable rounded out the order. The field was reduced to six with the scratches of White Flag and Regally Irish. The well-respected White Flag was a late stewards scratch, which was a shame for jockey Luis Contreras who had won three races on the day prior to the Connaught Cup.

“With a speedy horse like (Silent Poet) and another speed horse on the outside — we got the one-hole — you’re committed to a very forward position,” said Stein of his front-running strategy. “It depends on how bad the other horses wanted it, but I talked to Nick and he told me the horse was really easy to ride, according to Gary Boulanger, and that gave me the confidence I needed. I saw the horse run a bunch of times and he’s a pro.”

Winner of the Grade II Play the King Stakes last year, Silent Poet was sent postward as the 7-5 favourite and returned $4.90 to win. After wintering at Palm Meadows, he entered the Connaught Cup fresh off a victory in a 7-1/2-furlong prep on the inner turf when making his June 11 season’s debut. The consistent son of Silent Name out of Cara Bella has missed the board just twice in his 15-race career. The victory boosted his bankroll over the $550,000 mark.

Stein also won the Connaught Cup in 2014 with Ian Black trainee Excaper.

NO BOLD VICTORIES

The John Oxley-owned colt Bold Victory has been a disappointment in his two years at Woodbine. The three-year-old chestnut had raced four times before Saturday’s Race 4 — a $123,200 1 1/16 miles maiden special — but had failed to cross the wire first. Trained by Woodbine’s leading conditioner Mark Casse, Bold Victory was purchased for a whopping $485,000 at the August 2018 Fasig-Tipton sale and was listed at 30-1 to win this year’s Queen’s Plate in the Woodbine winterbook. He went off as the 2-1 favourite on Saturday and finished out of the money in fifth in a race won by Lawrence Cordes’ home bred Mighty Heart, a 13-1 long shot ridden by Stein for trainer Josie Carroll. Mighty Heart is also Plate eligible and is suddenly in the conversation as a possible contender.

AROUND THE TRACK

The five-year-old mare Post to Post won Race 1, a $25,000 claimer, with Contreras in the saddle for trainer Donald MacRae – the bay’s second victory in 18 lifetime starts. Post to Post had finished second no fewer than nine times, four times in 2019 alone …Two-year-old filly American Indy was acquired for a hefty $225,000 at the November 2018 Fasig-Tipton sale and was the early 5-2 favorite for Saturday’s fifth race. But the daughter of the great Triple Crown winner American Pharoah was a vet’s scratch. She finished a disappointing seventh (20 lengths back) in her debut on June 11 at Churchill Downs … In another spectacular finish at Woodbine on Saturday, 24-1 long shot Court Battle, ridden by Jason Hoyte, held off the favored Bode’s Maker to win Race 8, a 1 1/16 miles optional claimer, by a half a length after the two waged a battle royale in the stretch. The five-year-old bay gelding Court Battle is trained by John Staples and owned by JTR Racing. Stein was on Bode’s Maker … The handle for the 10-race program Saturday was $4.27 million.

And some players aren’t too happy about it, as their tweets in reply to the news getting out indicated.

“Here is what’s going to keep #BlueJays players in their stadium/hotel bubble this summer,” TSN‘s Scott Mitchell tweeted on Friday.

“Per multiple sources, players have been told penalty if seen outside ballpark is $750,000 fine and potential jail time.”

We were told two weeks… not all summer… all summer is a bit much https://t.co/6S7euLbHWA — Travis Shaw (@travis_shaw21) July 10, 2020

New Jays first baseman Travis Shaw, who was signed as a free agent, was the first to reply, though some tweets were later deleted.

“We were told two weeks, not all summer, all summer is a bit much,” Shaw tweeted.

“All summer isn’t gonna happen. Not an option.”

Outfielder Randal Grichuk tried to bring some clarity from the player’s side. “I wanna make it clear, we’re not asking for special treatment,” Grichuk tweeted.

“We understand that we need to stay in a ‘quarantine bubble.’ We wanna make sure everyone is safe. The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That’s what makes it tough for a lot of guys.”

I wanna make it clear, we’re not asking for special treatment. We understand that we need to stay in a “quarantine bubble”. We wanna make sure everyone is safe. The toughest part is them not allowing our family to come with us. That’s what makes it tough for a lot of guys. — Randal Grichuk (@RGrich15) July 10, 2020

Shaw tweeted then deleted a couple of tweets:

1) “Let me be clear. We are on board with the TWO week quarantine. I currently have a PAID for condo a block away from the stadium that I can’t use. At no point would I risk public safety or not follow rules. Is it wrong to want to live in a place that I’ve already paid for…”

2) “to be able to go on a walk (WITH A MASK) to be able to get fresh air walk to go get takeout food (not eat inside). We aren’t looking to party, hit the patios, go out at night, anything like that. Public safety is priority number 1…”

Former Jays star pitcher Marcus Stroman, now of the New York Mets, tried to bring some levity:

“Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol,” Stroman tweeted.

Guys are going to be walking around in full disguises. Lol — Marcus Stroman (@STR0) July 10, 2020

On Friday afternoon, Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo emphasized only that the organization would follow all rules to the fullest.

“We’re fine. I talk to guys every day, communicate with them, everybody is fine,” Montoyo said of the grousing.

“The Canadian government gave us a chance to come to Toronto to have a spring camp. Nothing else has been decided (in terms of playing actual games in the city). You have no idea how grateful I am and the Toronto Blue Jays for this opportunity to be here in Toronto. It’s safer, believe me, I feel that way. I know we all do,” he said.

“The Canadian government, the Canadian people have done a great job with this virus and you have no idea how safe I feel.”

Major League Baseball’s current plan for a 60-game season has the Jays travelling to various American locales for their 30 road games, even though the U.S. is in the midst of record COVID-19 cases, with the pandemic’s spread showing no signs of abating.

Other leagues have already, or will be implementing, bubbles where all the games will be played, without any movement. That includes the NHL, with hubs in Toronto and Edmonton, and the NBA, with everything set up in a “campus” at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Major League Soccer has its own Orlando bubble, though two teams have had to pull out of its return to play tournament due to COVID-19 outbreaks.

When in Toronto (assuming the federal government approves games in Toronto and not just the training that is currently taking place), the Blue Jays and visiting teams will be bubbled at Rogers Centre and in the hotel attached to the stadium.

Part of Canada’s Quarantine Act reads: “Every person who fails to comply with an obligation imposed under section 35, subsection 39(1) or 44(3) or section 51 is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than $750,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, or to both.”

But the best-of-five series — all to be played at an empty Scotiabank Arena — is just part of the COVID-19 concessions that players and owners OK’d Friday night. The entire 24-team tournament, 12 teams in the Toronto and Edmonton hubs, has the go-ahead. Leafs – Jackets is one of eight qualifying rounds in the Eastern and Western conferences, while the top four clubs in each who were ahead when play halted March 12 get a bye to stage a round robin event for first round seeding.

The first three games in the Toronto – Columbus series will be every other day, with Game 3 and if necessary Game 4 back-to-back, having the Jackets as home team. Game 5 would be Aug. 9. Start times for all teams in Toronto are staggered at noon, 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., with full broadcast information to follow. It’s the first ever playoff series between the teams who haven’t met since Oct. 21.

It’s expected the Leafs will address the media on the weekend to detail their plans and perhaps some of the enhancements at SBA to replicate a full house, after the league and PA hold Saturday Zoom press conferences to comment on ratification of the collective bargaining agreement. The Leafs have been working out in small groups, but move to full camp on Monday at Ford Performance Centre with a maximum of 31 players.

Though the Leafs trumpeted their official Hub status on Twitter Friday night, they get no special breaks. They must stay in a hotel like the other 11 squads, might have to give up their spacious dressing room to a higher seeded team and shift to the visiting bench for Games 3 and 4. After the first three rounds, Edmonton has been pre-selected for the conference final and Stanley Cup championship.

But with COVID numbers down in Ontario and a second ‘bubble’ environment available around Coca-Cola Coliseum on the spacious Exhibition grounds where the AHL Marlies play, Hogtown was always high on the league’s list. The 12 teams will split between staying at the Royal York Hotel near SBA and Hotel X beside the Coliseum.

“The Leafs, working in concert with the NHL, NHLPA, and health officials from the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario, are determined to create and maintain a safe and secure hub city experience for the players and the league alike,” a statement from the club read. “More importantly, we are also deeply committed to help ensure the health and safety of the residents of Toronto by adhering to the strict and comprehensive protocols of the hub strategy so that the experience is a positive one for all.”

Once all visiting teams arrive here by July 26 (a couple of exhibition games will precede the start of the tourney Aug. 1), players and staff that comprise a total of 52 people can’t stray from a daily routine of practice, hotel, meals and games, though Mayor John Tory said earlier he wouldn’t deny them a chance for “fresh air” now and then. All will be tested daily as well as temperature checks and symptom screenings. Individuals who might have direct or indirect contact with the teams will be tested daily, too.",[]
79,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/sports/baseball/toronto-blue-jays/vlad-guerrero-jr-to-switch-from-hot-corner-to-first-base,Vlad Guerrero Jr. to switch from hot corner to first base,"['Frank Zicarellimore Frank Zicarelli', 'More Frank Zicarelli', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports', 'Baseball', 'Toronto Blue Jays']",2020-07-11 00:41:15+00:00,"The first thing Charlie Montoyo wanted to make clear in announcing how Vladimir Guerrero Jr. will switch over to first base is that all options remain open.

For the media mavens covering the team, Friday’s announcement by the jovial skipper amounted to some seismic event, the same day some grousing could be heard on the team’s self-imposed bubble.

Montoyo is in the business of winning and it goes without saying how his stated goal in this coming 60-game sprint of a baseball season is to field the best positional players each and every night.

Travis Shaw is the presumptive guy at the hot corner with this year’s fifth overall pick, Austin Martin, a long-term option.

“Vladdy is going to focus during this camp at first base,’’ said Montoyo, who patiently and professionally answered every query tossed his way when the mania surrounding baseball’s No. 1 prospect intensified last season with every baseball Tom, Dick and Harry wanting to know when Vladdy would get the call up.

“And we’re going to keep his options open. We’ve been talking about that since spring training before we got shut down. He (Guerrero Jr.) was already taking ground balls at first base with Luis Rivera (Toronto’s first base coach), but then talking to Ross (GM Atkins) and Vladdy, Vladdy feels better doing it.”

For Friday night’s intra-squad game, the second by the Jays during this camp setting, Vladdy was pencilled in at first base.

Montoyo added how Guerrero Jr. would see more action at first and DH this season.

“But we’re going to keep third base option open because he can play there, too,’’ the manager said. “For now, for this camp, he’s going to be playing first and probably during the season he’s going to play first and DH.”

Every time Montoyo was asked about the reasons behind the decision, it became so obvious, even for neophytes remotely familiar with the team.

“It’s all about having the best chance to compete in a shortened season,’’ Montoyo continued. “For me, the best chance for Vladdy is to play first, DH and also play third. Knowing Travis Shaw can play third and I’ve seen him, he’s a good third baseman, and that also helps, but this is more about Vladdy and giving him his best chance to succeed in a short season.”

The timing of the switch might be questioned considering the Jays will open — or at least are scheduled to pending the pandemic — on July 24 in Tampa.

“It goes back to what I said,’’ Montoyo said. “It’s not going to be quick (turnaround) because he was taking ground balls at first during spring training. And I trust Luis Rivera more than anybody. And when Luis said he was comfortable, that’s why we’re making the decision now.

“We didn’t start this (transition) today. We’ve been talking about it, Ross, me, Vlad, Luis Rivera, about making this move and that’s why we’re doing it now.”

Montoyo would add: “Vladdy is motivated to do it.”

As one might expect, Guerrero said all the right things when he addressed the media on a Zoom call, reiterating how he was willing and able to do whatever it took to win.

“Whatever the team needs me, I’m going to be ready,’’ the can’t-miss kid said. “I’m OK with that.”

Guerrero Jr. hasn’t been shy in asking teammates for any advice on the nuances of playing first base, a position that demands subtle foot work.

“I’m ready for whenever the chance comes,’’ he added.

Guerrero Jr. said how his body feels good and is eagerly awaiting the start of MLB’s truncated season.

He dismissed any thought how the amount of games he played last season at the hot corner led to fatigue down the stretch. The decision to move to first base was one he fully endorsed.

“I just want to win,’’ he added.

Once the Jays wrap up their summer camp and ramp up for their regular season, it’ll be a new experience for Guerrero Jr. and for every other big leaguer.

“It’s going to be different,’’ he said. “Right now, you have to start hot. If you get into a slump you’re going to get into trouble, but just be ready to start the game.”

Guerrero Jr. has been working hard, but now comes the mental preparation knowing a regular season is about to begin.

The time away from his teammates in the wake of the virus allowed Guerrero Jr. to maintain and follow the routine mapped out by strength and conditioning coaches.

“Pretty much the same routine. No big changes,’’ said Guerrero Jr., who returned to his native Dominican Republic when COVID-19 forced baseball to suspend its spring league season.

BO-DACIOUS

One can argue how the emerging talent known as Bo Bichette has assumed the mantle as the franchise face of the Jays, which probably suits the kid well given his extraordinary talents and willingness to embrace any challenge.

Bo knows the Jays’ youth has the potential to serve the club well as MLB takes aim on its shortened season.

Be it a standard 162-game slate or the current 60-game model, Bichette’s attitude remains the same, as does his approach.

“Bottom line, we have a lot of really good players in here,” the 22-year-old shortstop said. “Short season, long season, I’ve told you guys (in the media) plenty of times that I think we were going to compete, regardless of 162 or 60.

“I believe in everybody in here. I believe we’re a lot better than people think.”

It’s now up to Bo’s baseball brethren to follow his lead.

SHOE-IN

One of baseball’s better feel-good stories to usher in the 2019 season, Matt Shoemaker’s campaign would come to a crushing end in Oakland as the Jays swept the A’s in a three-game set in the Bay Area.

As the right-hander left the mound to field first base, his knee gave in.

Surgery ensued and Shoemaker, who was in tears inside the team’s clubhouse when he addressed the media, never did get to pitch another regular-season game.

When the Jays gathered in the familiar surroundings of their spring training home in Dunedin, Shoemaker looked like he had never missed a beat.

Along comes the team’s first intra-squad game at Summer Camp being staged at Rogers Centre and suddenly baseball’s buzz was back, albeit under the backdrop of a pandemic.

“We’re still playing baseball, even though it’s against our team,’’ Shoemaker said. “It is different than playing a different team, but when you’re on the mound and you just have that mentality that you’re going to beat that guy, you’re going to get that guy out, you can still make it pretty similar and game-like to in-season.

“When you can lock it in, I’m battling, me-versus-you right now, just go to battle. Having that mindset just gets us ready for the game and gives us a better chance to win.”

The right-hander threw 60 pitches, which included 42 strikes.

POSEY TAKES A PASS

San Francisco’s Buster Posey has decided to skip the season, informing reporters how his family recently adopted twin girls who were born prematurely.

“After weighing it for a long time, talking to doctors, I just feel like in the current state that we are right now and these babies being as fragile as they are for the next four months, at minimum, this ultimately wasn’t that difficult a decision for me,” said Posey, a six-time all-star catcher and three-time World Series champ.

The Giants, in a released statement, said they “fully support Buster’s decision.”

The statement went on to read: “Buster is an integral part of our team and will be sorely missed, but we look forward to having him back in 2021.”

L.A. Angels superstar Mike Trout recently said how he’s feeling uncomfortable and uncertain about playing as he and his wife await the arrival of the couple’s son.

BOSTON-BOUND

The Jays announced they will be in Beantown for a two-game set against the host Red Sox, July 21 and 22 at 7:30 p.m., the only two pre-season games Toronto will get under its belt before opening pitch gets officially thrown in MLB’s 60-game regular season.

No word yet on where the Jays will play their home games.

The feds paved the way for the club to use Rogers Centre and the adjoining hotel to set up summer shop.

If the team can’t play its regular-season games in Toronto, the most logical option is for the team to return to its spring training home in Dunedin.

TESTING TIMES

There were 66 positive tests of the virus during the intake screening process, MLB and its players’ union announced Friday.

The number includes 58 players and eight staff members out of 3,748 samples tested, a rate of 1.8%.

There was at least one positive test from 27 of the 30 teams.",[]

United on Sunday morning.

“None of this stuff phases us,” said Bradley, when asked how the group was doing in COVID-19 plagued Florida, with positive test chaos seemingly around every corner. “We got here (on Monday) and the first 12-18 hours everybody was in their room as we awaited the first test results. And since then we’ve settled into a good routine of training. We’ve really stuck to ourselves and have spent time on our floor with each other. We found a good routine and we’re excited as the game gets closer.”

The Reds were three days late arriving to Orlando for the MLS is Back tournament when a member of the team’s travel party came down with “symptoms” last weekend. Because the club traveled late, Toronto’s first game at the tournament was changed from Friday to Sunday. But it’s the time change of the first match that is not ideal. Toronto’s first game is now at 9 a.m., something Bradley called “a shame.”

“When you talk about wanting to bring the league back, wanting to bring games back in a moment like this, obviously the hope is there are a lot of people watching and you want to feel that the product on display is as close to the highest level as possible,” he said. “And when you think about what a 9 a.m. game in Orlando at this time year is going to mean in terms of the weather and the humidity, I’m not sure makes a ton of sense.”

On top of that, because of the schedule change, the Reds only have three days between its first two matches. After the D.C. United match on Sunday, TFC faces 401 Derby rival Montreal Impact on Wednesday. But Bradley believes that the clubs with the “strongest mentality” will be in the best shape to succeed and he feels his team has that in abundance. The MLS is Back tournament — which will be played at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake — will feature a group stage, which will count toward the 2020 MLS regular season standings, followed by knockout rounds. The tournament champion will qualify for the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League and the 2020 season is scheduled to resume upon completion of the tournament.

“Everybody’s just really excited about getting back to playing,” said Bradley. “So when that whistle blows on Sunday morning, I think you’re going to see a group of guys and a team that is ready to go for it and really excited to be back on the field together. We’re going to enjoy every part of that.”

Bradley hasn’t played since the MLS Cup Final on Nov. 10 in Seattle. He injured his ankle in that match and underwent surgery in January and missed TFC’s first two games of the 2020 season before MLS closed down because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“For me it’s been a long time, too long without a game, so I’m really excited,” he said. “When you talk about D.C. as an opponent … they’re always organized. They always compete hard. It’s never an easy game. Even in certain moments when their backs are up against the wall, they still find ways to make games difficult. The playoff game last year at BMO Field was a great example. It didn’t look like they had much going and it looked like we had things under control and they were able to find an equalizer right at the end and push us to the brink a little bit. We have respect for them.”

TFC faced D.C. United on Oct. 19 in round one of the 2019 MLS Cup playoffs and seemed to be cruising to victory when D.C. United scored the equalizer in the third minute of second-half stoppage time, before the Reds broke out for four goals in the first half of extra time to win 5-1.

TFC defender Justin Morrow, as usual, will be counted to help his club rise to the occasion on Sunday against D.C. United. Morrow is also a key member of the Black Players for Change organization. In a powerful statement in the fight for social justice, the group lined up across the main field at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex before the kick off of the first MLS is Back match on Wednesday, between Orlando City SC and Inter Miami CF. Morrow was joined by TFC GM Ali Curtis and other members of the Reds’ staff. The demonstration lasted eight minutes and 46 seconds in a tribute to George Floyd.

“I’m so proud to be able to stand out there with Ali, Jason Bent and Samra Habtom. He’s been doing an incredible job since the death of George Floyd leading this club on racial issues and tackling racial inequality and what are going to be the next steps moving forward and a big initiative,” said Morrow of Curtis.

“He’s led that not only with TFC, but league wide. He’s making sure that TFC has a leadership role in these initiatives.”

TFC coach Greg Vanney expressed some deep concern about the COVID-19 situation before the Reds headed to Florida but said he and the players feel comfortable.

“I feel like we’re in a good place,” said Vanney. “Diligence is the name of the game for us, to wear our masks, to stay in our own rooms, to only really engage with each other at the right moments in the right ways, leave the other teams be and let them do their thing. Our team is very good at that.”

Vanney believes the depth of his club may be key on Sunday’s opening match.

“We’ll have to utilize our depth,” he said. “We believe we have a deep team and we’ll have to find good ways to manage our roster. It helps us that we have five substitutions. Obviously this being going to be the first game that we’ve played in months, it’s going to be a challenge for guys.”",[]

Every team believes it has a chance to make the playoffs. This year, with 24 teams in the post-season, that optimism has never been higher as camps open up on Monday following a four-month break because of the coronavirus.

But with optimism comes heightened expectations.

Here’s a look at each of the 24 teams and the unique pressures they face:

BURNING

TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS

After three straight seasons of getting bounced in the first round, no team has more to prove than the Leafs, who are paying Mitch Marner, John Tavares and Auston Matthews more money than any other player in the league. If they don’t get past the Blue Jackets, GM Kyle Dubas, who fired head coach Mike Babcock, will find himself in the crosshairs.

TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING

The bitterness of last year’s first-round sweep is still lingering in the mouths of the Lightning, who were one of two teams that were against this 24-team format. As the Cup favourites, they need to go deep. Anything less could cost Jon Cooper his job as head coach.

BOSTON BRUINS

Boston lost in Game 7 of last year’s final and was the best team in the league when the season was put on hold because of the coronavirus. With an ageing roster (this could be Zdeno Chara’s last year), the Bruins’ window on winning another championship is closing.

PITTSBURGH PENGUINS

On paper, the Penguins have the easiest play-in round opponent. But in reality, no team wants to face Carey Price and the “nothing-to-lose” Habs. If Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin can’t get past Montreal, which finished with 15 fewer points in the regular season, they’ll never hear the end of it.

EDMONTON OILERS

Forget about what we may have thought of Edmonton at the beginning of the season. With Leon Draisaitl emerging as a Hart Trophy favourite and Connor McDavid finishing second in scoring, this is a very good team. The question is whether the Oilers are mature enough to get past a veteran Chicago team. If not, it could be a long post-season as some other team wins the Stanley Cup in Edmonton’s backyard.

HOT

CALGARY FLAMES

If not for Tampa Bay falling flat on its face, we would be talking a lot more about Calgary’s disappointing first-round exit a year ago. Remember: this was the best team in the West. The pieces are still there to be the best. But if they can’t win at the most important time of the year — even if it’s against the Jets — then changes could be coming.

ARIZONA COYOTES

The top-spending team in the NHL pushed in all its chips this year by acquiring Phil Kessel in the summer and Taylor Hall in December. So far, the results haven’t been what anyone expected. With Hall potentially gone after the season, Arizona needs a deep run to justify the money was well spent.

WASHINGTON CAPITALS

The Capitals won their first Stanley Cup two years ago. But if Alex Ovechkin hopes to get his face on the Mount Rushmore of hockey, he may need to win another one before his career is done.

VEGAS GOLDEN KNIGHTS

Expansion franchises rarely feel the pressure to win this early. But a trip to the Cup final in Year One sped things up. The fact that head coach Gerard Gallant was fired after the team hit a mini speed bump in December tells you all you need to know about the win-now mentality in Vegas.

FLORIDA PANTHERS

The Panthers haven’t won a playoff round since 2012. If they hope to change that then Sergei Bobrovsky will have to start earning his $10-million salary. If not, then it could be a long six more years for the two-time Vezina Trophy winner.

LUKEWARM

COLORADO AVALANCHE

There comes a time when every young franchise has to take that step forward. But with Cale Makar in his rookie season and top prospect Bowen Byram still playing major junior, the thinking is the Avs are another year or two away from that point.

NASHVILLE PREDATORS

The fact that GM David Poile fired a head coach for only the second time in 21 years suggests that the pressure to win in Nashville has never been higher.

CAROLINA HURRICANES

Those bunch of jerks are trying to make the actual playoffs for the second year in a row — something they’ve never done in the history of the franchise. If they don’t, they can rest easy knowing that five of their top-7 scorers are 25 years old or younger.

DALLAS STARS

It’s been more than a decade since Dallas advanced past the second round of the playoffs. But with 11 players who are over the age of 30 — including Joe Pavelski and Corey Perry, who are both 35 years old — there’s no telling whether the four-month pause will help or hurt a Stars team that had been fading down the stretch.

WINNIPEG JETS

The Jets acquired defenceman Dylan DeMelo and centre Cody Eakin at the trade deadline for what they had hoped would be a long playoff run. But first, they have to get past the Flames. For that to happen, the pressure is on goalie Connor Hellebuyck to continue to play at a Vezina Trophy level.

COLD

ST. LOUIS BLUES

They won their first ever Stanley Cup a year ago, so the Blues could get swept in the first round and fans would still be in the streets singing Gloria.

COLUMBUS BLUE JACKETS

In a season where they lost more man-games to injury than any other team — and to players, such as Seth Jones, who were integral to their success — it’s amazing that the Blues Jackets were even in the playoff picture when the season was halted. Now that everyone is healthy, no one knows what to expect.

MINNESOTA WILD

The fact that the Wild hired the Canucks’ former director of amateur scouting this week is an indicator that the team is focusing more on the draft than planning the Stanley Cup parade route.

CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS

No one would be surprised if Chicago, which has a core that has won three Stanley Cups together, upset Edmonton in the play-in round. If they don’t, then maybe the Blackhawks can get around to that rebuild they’ve been putting off.

PHILADELPHIA FLYERS

The Flyers wouldn’t be where they are without 21-year-old goalie Carter Hart, who looked like the second coming of Carey Price this season. And while the playoffs can make or break a goalie in Philadelphia, fans will be forgiving — at least, we hope — if he should falter.

FREEZING

VANCOUVER CANUCKS

This is the first post-season appearance for Elias Pettersson, Brock Boeser and Quinn Hughes. With Pettersson and Hughes still on their entry-level contracts, their window on winning may never be this wide open. At the same time, it’s not closing anytime soon.

MONTREAL CANADIENS

No team has less on the line than the Habs. If they win, it’s a bonus since no one expected them to be in the playoffs in the first place. If they lose in the play-in round, they could very well end up with the No. 1 pick and a chance to draft Alexis Lafreniere.

NEW YORK RANGERS

As a team, the re-tooling Rangers are not under pressure. But for Henrik Lundqvist, who’s reign as a No. 1 goalie seems to be coming to an end, this could be his last chance to lead the team to glory.

NEW YORK ISLANDERS

Pressure? The team is still playing with house money after losing John Tavares to free agency a year ago.",[]

The ratification votes mean that training camps will begin on Monday, with teams traveling to the hub cities — Toronto in the Eastern Conference and Edmonton in the Western Conference — on July 26. The start of the post-season, which includes a round robin for the top-4 seeds in each conference and a best-of-five qualification round for the next 16 teams, is scheduled for Aug. 1.

According to various sources, the NHL plans on playing six games a day during the qualification round and round robin.

The conference finals and the Stanley Cup will be played solely in Edmonton, with the Stanley Cup beginning Sept. 20 and ending no later than Oct. 2. Under this scenario — and it is subject to change, based on whether there is an outbreak of the coronavirus during Phase 3 or 4 — the 2020-21 season will begin in December.

While the Return to Play protocols have the most immediate impact, the CBA was arguably the more contentious of the two votes. By extending the CBA by another four years, the NHL and NHLPA is ensured labour peace until 2026. As part of that agreement, the NHL agreed to return to the Olympics in 2022 in Beijing, China and in 2026 in Milan, Italy.",[]
83,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/sports/hockey/nhl/toronto-maple-leafs/leafs-pipeline-elynuik-looking-ahead-after-overall-improvement-with-marlies,LEAFS PIPELINE: Elynuik looking ahead after overall improvement with Marlies,"['Terry Koshanmore Terry Koshan', 'More Terry Koshan', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports', 'Hockey', 'Toronto Maple Leafs']",2020-07-10 02:34:23+00:00,"Greg Moore’s summation of Hudson Elynuik as it pertained to hockey was rather uncomplicated.

Moore took over as coach of the Toronto Marlies on Dec. 1 after Sheldon Keefe was promoted to the Maple Leafs in November, and by the time the American Hockey League was put on pause in March because of the coronavirus global pandemic, Moore had come to a conclusion regarding Elynuik.

“He was our most improved forward,” Moore said during a recent interview with the Toronto Sun. “He had a lot of growth in the sense of the work he put in, in the weight room.

“You could tell before the pause that he was much stronger on his feet, had a little more power in his step and that allowed him to have a little more of a dominant role in the offensive zone.”

It wasn’t as though Elynuik arrived on the doorstep of the Marlies last fall with a difficult road ahead to becoming an impactful player in the AHL.

In 2018-19, Elynuik helped the Newfoundland Growlers win the ECHL championship, contributing 15 points in 16 games in the march to the Kelly Cup. Also that season, Elynuik dipped his toe into the AHL, scoring once in 10 games with the Marlies.

While representing the Leafs at the Detroit Red Wings rookie tournament in Traverse City, Mich., last September, Elynuik told us his objective for the coming season was to make his mark with the Marlies.

It took some time for the centre for that goal to be realized, but by the time play was halted, Elynuik had accomplished as much.

“It just goes back to getting more confident throughout the season,” Elynuik said from Calgary, where he has been training since the AHL season was halted and later cancelled. “At first, I wouldn’t say I was nearly as confident as I was going down the last stretch of the season. I think that showed.

“Getting more comfortable with my game, I showed my skills a lot more, it was about getting confidence.”

Elynuik had five goals and eight assists in 53 games when the season came to a sudden end, and had grown into an effective penalty killer for the Marlies.

From Moore’s viewpoint, the improvement in Elynuik’s performance was a testament to the player’s outlook.

“It was just the work he did,” Moore said. “We laid it out there in front of him, and he was willing to buy into the game plan and the schedule and the workouts. He definitely found a way to better himself and got rewarded for it.

“I would not say it was a survival instinct, but when you’re trying to earn more ice time and more responsibility from the coaching staff, any extra responsibility you can gain on special teams, on the penalty kill, different areas, any player should be looking to add that to their game.”

A couple of factors that few players have at their fingertips were put to use by Elynuik. One was the experience of winning a championship with the Growlers, and the other a regular opportunity, if he desired, to lean on his dad Pat, who played in 506 National Hockey League games with Winnipeg, Washington, Tampa Bay and Ottawa in a pro career that ended in 1997.

“Not everyone has a dad who has been through the exact path I want to go,” Elynuik said. “He knows what it takes and the commitment and the work ethic that has to go into it.

“He went through ups and downs and adversity throughout his career. Same process, so he has a lot of experience and input on the journey.”

Elynuik’s determination during the 2019-20 season ended with a deserving result, as the 22-year-old signed a one-year AHL contract with the Marlies in June. And with the salary cap issues the Leafs are going to have to meet head-on in the coming seasons, Elynuik realizes that further progress could lead to a better shot with the Leafs at some point.

“I’m really excited for next year and to just keep moving forward with my development,” Elynuik said. “I’m going to do what I can to get an entry-level deal this upcoming season and I’m working really hard this summer. I’ll do whatever I can to make that happen.

“Trying to fill out my (6-foot-5) frame, put some weight on — that will help me with strength around the whole rink. You can always work on everything — quickness, my shot, I want to put the puck more in the net in the next season.

“I want to be a a two-way centre who can play a big role, that contributes putting the puck in the net or creating offensive opportunities and at the same time being reliable defensively and keeping the puck out of our net.”

It didn’t end that way.

Through nine holes of the opening round of this one-time PGA Tour event, both Hadwin and Taylor were one-under par. Ho hum. When their rounds ended the Canadian pals from Abbotsford, B.C., were first and second atop the leaderboard before Collin Morikawa scorched Muirfield Village with a seven-under 65 in the afternoon to take the lead over the Canadian duo.

Hadwin made five birdies on his second nine to shoot a six-under-par 66 and take the clubhouse lead after the morning wave.

“Even though it’s sort of a tamer Muirfield Village than we may be used to, still a lot of slope on those greens,” Hadwin said after his round. “Just hitting good shots, quality shots to the right side of the hole, giving myself looks.”

The Workday Charity Open is the first of back-to-back tour events at the famed Ohio golf course, with Jack Nicklaus’ Memorial Tournament set for next week. This week, tournament organizers have set up a slightly more forgiving course with shorter rough and slower greens. The famed course will be back to its familiar test a week from now when Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy join the field.

“It’s a golf course where if you get too aggressive, it’ll sneak up on you pretty quick,” Hadwin said. “Even with softer conditions than what we’re used to.”

Hadwin is alone in second place at six-under.

Even though this week is an undercard of sorts before next week’s main event at Muirfield, the field is still strong, featuring five of the world’s top 10 players, including No. 2 Jon Rahm and Nos. 5 and 6, Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka. There are six Canadians in the field, including Taylor who is making his PGA Tour restart debut.

Taylor began his back nine with a 33-foot birdie putt on the 10th hole to get to two-under par. He followed that birdie bomb up with some magic on the par-5 11th hole.

“I drove it really, really well,” Taylor said of his round. “On the par-5s, I put myself in good positions.”

Taylor hit a 318-yard drive at the 11th, and then followed it up with a 271-yard approach shot to the green that finished three feet from the hole, setting a near tap-in eagle.

He birdied the closing hole to finish the day with a bogey-free five-under 67, tied in a group including Hideki Matsuyama and Zach Johnson at five-under. Roger Sloan teed off late in the day and joined the Canadian leaderboard party finishing at four-under to join a group of players including Justin Thomas and Patrick Reed.

“I didn’t have a lot of expectations,” Taylor said. “I know competitive rust is definitely a thing I’ve had to struggle with in the past, but I’ve felt that I’ve played enough, so I felt good there, and I had no expectations, which is a good thing. So everything is going well.”

Taylor is one of the only North American players to sit out the first four tournaments of the tour’s restart after the 91-day COVID-19 shut down. The 32-year-old has an eight-month-old son at home and already has a win under his belt this season at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am where he outdueled Phil Mickelson on Sunday.

“Obviously the break was great timing for a lot of reasons but to have a bit of a cushion, take some more time off, I just really enjoyed being home,” Taylor said. “I’m excited to get back out here and play.”

Taylor and Hadwin are the same age and grew up playing junior golf together at Ledgeview Golf and Country Club in B.C. It’s already been a banner year for Canadian men’s golf with Taylor’s win in February, and now back-to-back top-five finishes from Mackenzie Hughes at the Travelers Championship and Hadwin at the Rocket Mortgage Classic coming into this week.

Canadians have a victory and seven top-six finishes this season and we have a record three players (Hadwin, Hughes, Corey Conners) inside the top 100 in the world rankings, with Taylor (102nd) looking to join the party soon.",[]

Instead, the team’s first intrasquad game of summer camp was played before a socially distanced press row populated by 25 observers, plus teammates and staff.

A crack of the bat never seemed so loud (OK, maybe when Vlad Guerrero Jr. was hitting bombs at the Home Run Derby in Cleveland a year ago this week) but you get where we’re going.

It was so quiet you could hear the street traffic outside the dome. And the seagulls.

So, how will the Jays recreate the excitement and manufacture the adrenalin of game night?

“We’re getting ready for a different kind of season,” shortstop and emerging leader of these young Jays, Bo Bichette, said on a Zoom call prior to the loosely administered scrimmage under an open Rogers Centre roof. “When the season starts, we’re going to have to create our own adrenalin. We’re kind of practising that now.”

In Bichette’s case, practising what he preaches. The breakout rookie star of the Jays last season turned on a Matt Shoemaker offering in the second-inning and rocked it over the wall in left field. That was your highlight of the night, other than seeing a semblance of real live baseball for the first time since COVID-19 shuttered Grapefruit League play.

The team will do what it can to create an environment before the season begins on July 24 in St. Pete, Fla.

Manager Charlie Montoyo says the Jays will squeeze in as many of these intrasquad games over the next two weeks to help make the sounds of near-silence feel like second nature.

Bichette, meanwhile, is confident that the internal motivation will come quickly enough for a young, hungry team looking to take advantage of a short sprint of a season.

“Once we get out there, it should be pretty easy,” Bichette said. “We’ve still got to win that day and we’re playing for our jobs. During these couple of weeks, we’ll figure out how to get ourselves going, how to get our juices flowing and being able to be as locked in as possible.”

WILL BOYS BE BOYS?

How are the Jays handling the tight quarantine regulations the team must operate under given their self-isolation requirements?

Both Bichette and catcher Danny Jansen said there is a belief that the players will efficiently self-police.

“This is bigger than us,” Bichette said. “I think we will have to have a team discussion to make sure we are on the same page and be ready to stay inside, but I don’t think it will be too tough.

“As of now, we are definitely not allowed to leave. I don’t think anyone is wanting to, either. Sometimes you have to be put out of your comfort zone and I think we’re all very willing to do that.”

Jansen actually seems the quarantine as being an advantage — and certainly a much safer environment than in Florida.

“We all pretty much agree that we have an advantage being in Canada and being here in the stadium,” Jansen said. “Everybody is taking the protocols extremely seriously. We’re staying in our rooms. We’re working out when the schedule tells us to and we’re doing all the protocols.”

READY FOR A TASTE

Hours after finalizing his Blue Jays record signing bonus, 2020 first-round pick Austin Martin learned he has been added to the team’s 60-man roster.

Once he clears testing protocols, he’ll join his future team here in Toronto.

“I’m super-excited and glad things turned out the way that they did,” Martin said on a Zoom call with Toronto reporters. “I look at it as a positive thing being able to be around those big league guys and being able to pick their brains so early in my professional career.

“I think it’s a great thing and will help me in the long run. I’m excited to get out there and get working and take advantage of what I can take advantage of.”

No one is expecting Martin to be part of the team when camp breaks, but with no minor-league play this season, at least he’ll have a place to work.

“I’m just excited to get back on the field,” the Vanderbilt University star said. “I’m excited to get back on the field and back on the clay and playing again.”

This Intrasquad Game is officially ROWDY! 😎 pic.twitter.com/sNAAMLCOwp — Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) July 10, 2020

AROUND THE BASES

Shoemaker pitched five innings (or thereabouts) showing he’s well along in arm strength. The veteran right-hander, who was strong when we left him in Dunedin, threw 60 pitches, striking out four and allowing four hits … Sure, it will go down as an intrasquad affair, but it had to be a big night for Simeon Woods Richardson, the well-regarded teenaged pitching prospect. Woods Richardson worked an inning, allowed a couple of singles, but looked comfortable … Other than Bichette’s monster blast, the big action at the plate came from Rowdy Tellez who had a homer, double and single … Jays fans craving some action will get some pre-season ball next week when Sportsnet airs their intrasquad games on Tuesday and Wednesday … Seen on the field prior to the game was Dante Bichette, father of Bo. The former all-star was a popular voice with hitters during spring training and is carrying on that role here … Canadian reliever Jordan Romano continues to impress with a fastball that has touched 97 and 98 miles per hour … Behind home plate calling balls and strikes on Thursday was Buffalo Bisons manager Ken Huckaby … The team has yet to reveal the names of the dozen players who remained in Florida after one of the Jays tested positive last week.

Top RFAs will still get their big contracts,"['Michael Traikosmore Michael Traikos', 'More Michael Traikos', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports', 'Hockey', 'Share']",2020-07-10 02:26:49+00:00,"The list of names was as long as it was impressive.

Mitch Marner. Patrik Laine. Mikko Rantanen. Matthew Tkachuk. Brayden Point. Charlie McAvoy. Sebastian Aho. Kyle Connor.

One year ago, all of them were coming off their entry-level contracts at exactly the same time, culminating in what became a watershed moment for restricted free agents. Players under the age of 23 had never held so much bargaining power. And one by one, they took advantage of the situation to make more money than ever before.

While Marner (six years, $10.89 million) and Rantanen (six, $9.25) signed long-term deals that carried a $10.89-million and $9.25-million cap hit, respectively, Tkachuk (three years, $21 million) and Laine (two years, $13.5 million) went with bridge deals.

Either way, everyone cashed in.

The question is whether this year’s crop of RFAs, which include Islanders’ Mathew Barzal and Pierre-Luc Dubois of the Blue Jackets, will find similar fortunes now that the salary cap is remaining frozen at $81.5-million for the foreseeable future.

“I don’t think anything will change,” said agent Dan Milstein, who represents Toronto’s Ilya Mikheyev. “The upper class is going to get what they want because teams are building around those players. The teams are more likely to squeeze the middle guys over the next two years.

“We already know what the cap is going to be. In some ways, it makes it easier to plan. If you have a top player, you’re going to pay him.”

Milstein added that the truncated season could have more of an impact on evaluating a player’s worth than the salary cap, especially if that player has arbitration rights and has spent limited time in the NHL.

“(Mikheyev) has arbitration rights. And he’s a unique case, because he played only 39 games and was injured,” Milstein said of the 25-year-old winger, who is in his first NHL season. “If they use his stats and multiply by two, he’ll get one number. I honestly don’t know what they’re going to do. But I’m not sweating.”

OLD-SCHOOL, PRE-SCHOOL

One of the youngest teams in the NHL is getting one of the oldest coaches.

Lindy Ruff, who is ranked seventh on the career coaching list with 1,493 regular-season games, officially beat out Gerard Gallant, Peter Laviolette and John Stevens to become the head coach of the New Jersey Devils on Thursday.

The new job means the 60-year-old Ruff will have to vacate his current position as an assistant coach of the New York Rangers weeks before the 24-team post-season was to begin. His replacement with the Rangers is Gord Murphy, an assistant coach with the team’s AHL affiliate.

The Devils also lifted the interim tag from GM Tom Fitzgerald, but haven’t decided if interim head coach Alain Nasreddine will join Ruff’s staff.

“It just seemed like the perfect fit for me with the way that Tom talked about the game and where he wanted this team to go,” said Ruff, who was previously the head coach of the Dallas Stars for four years and the Buffalo Sabres for 15.

In New Jersey, Ruff takes over a rebuilding team that has two recent No. 1 overall picks — Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier — and a rookie goalie in Mackenzie Blackwood. It’s a fixer-upper, for sure. But while the Devils finished with the third-worst record in the Eastern Conference, they also showed glimpses of growth by going 19-16-8 under Nasreddine.

Ruff’s job will be to help Hughes and Hischier, who combined for 21 goals and 57 points, to reach their full potential, while also getting veteran P.K. Subban to return to a Norris Trophy level after scoring seven goals and 18 points.

NEW DAD HORVAT TO PLAY

The deadline for opting out of the 24-team post-season is approaching. But Vancouver Canucks captain Bo Horvat, whose wife gave birth to their first child last week, never considered not playing this year.

“Not one time have I thought about opting out,” he said in a conference call on Thursday. “I want to be there for my teammates. I want to be there when the season gets going and be part of winning here.”

The Canucks will be in the hub city of Edmonton for the duration of the post-season. Players won’t be allowed to have family members stay with them until the start of the conference final. That means that Horvat could go two months or longer without seeing his wife and new son.

“I’m not going to lie. It’s not easy to leave your newborn after a week. But it is what it is. I’m focused on winning a Stanley Cup right now,” said Horvat. “Hopefully, by the end of this, I’ll be putting him in the Stanley Cup.”

CANUCKS LOSE DRAFT GURU

The person partly responsible for drafting Brock Boeser, Elias Pettersson and Quinn Hughes is now working for the team that Vancouver will play in the first round of the post-season.

Judd Brackett, who left the Canucks in May after an apparent power struggle with GM Jim Benning, was announced as the Minnesota Wild’s director of amateur scouting on Thursday.

The Wild, which has arguably the best prospect currently not playing in the NHL in Kirill Kaprizov (a fifth-round pick in 2015), could use all the help it can get. Of its past four drafts, only Luke Kunin has reached the NHL.

LOOSE NOTES

The salary cap’s remaining flat at $81.5-million will not affect the Canucks this year or next year. But with Pettersson, Hughes and goalie Thatcher Demko all coming off their entry-level contracts in 2022, the team better start putting some money away for the future. “I wouldn’t want to have a head office job with the way that the cap is,” said Horvat. “But we’re going to do whatever we can to keep our core group together. How we’re going to do it, I’m not sure.” … Horvat on the expected intensity of the playoffs after a four-month layoff: “Guys are going to be going 100 miles per hour,” he said. “It’s going to be one of the toughest playoffs ever” … Horvat, who is the Canucks’ player rep, said he was pleasantly surprised at how the league and the NHLPA were able to put aside their past differences and hammer out a new collective bargaining agreement for the good of the game. “For the most part it was pretty civil,” he said. “I’ve heard in the past that it hasn’t been pretty and things haven’t gone this smooth. It was pretty impressive to see how they did it in this short of time.”",[]

The greatest international goalscorer of all time is competing with Portland Thorns FC in the National Women’s Soccer League Challenge Cup.

The first North American professional sports league to get back up and running following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is well into its second week and running smoothly in Utah.

“I think we all had our hesitations and reservations with everything that is going on in the world, but we’re two weeks in and everything has been top notch,” Sinclair said on Thursday. “I don’t think anyone has any safety concerns in terms of COVID or anything like that, it’s been very well run.

“As a player, it’s nice to just get some competitive games in this year, obviously not knowing what is going to happen in the future. But it’s been great to be around the team and play some meaningful games.”

The eight-team tournament has given players, coaches and officials an escape from the current situation in regards to the global pandemic.

Coming to the 2021 Summer Olympics, competing in a new sport… @LindseyHoran @sincy12 pic.twitter.com/g5zIIsoa6K — Portland Thorns FC (@ThornsFC) July 3, 2020

Aptly named, the Challenge Cup did not come without its difficulties as the league attempted to rescue a lost season by hosting a tournament in a central location.

Utah has proven to be good host so far, as all the attention has been on the field and not on the virus. There are over a dozen Canadian players taking part in the tournament, most like Sinclair, who are part of the women’s national team.

“It’s nice, whether it’s training or games, to be able to escape away a little bit,” Sinclair said. “But as soon as we get back to the hotel, you’re quickly reminded of what we are living through in terms of the restrictions that are in place to make sure that everyone is safe and the amount of times you’re getting tested.

“But for those two hours on the field every day, it’s a nice escape and you can just focus on your job.”

There was plenty of debate on how pro leagues would be best to return, particularly when the virus is still raging out of control in some parts of the United States.

The NWSL was the first to come up with a format and get on the field, which helped provide a road map for other leagues to follow. So far, only Major League Soccer has followed, but its event has seen a myriad of problems with two teams already dropping out of the tournament due to COVID concerns. The NWSL had the Orlando Pride drop out after a number of players and staff were infected, which was attributed to a few members of the team leaving their training facility to attend a Florida nightclub.

“I think we’re proud of what we’ve done,” Sinclair said. “There were some reservations whether the NWSL should be the first league to go just in terms of resources compared to other leagues.

Some of us were thinking, ‘Are we sure this is the best idea?’ But I think we’re showing what is possible in this day and age when teams and staff follow rules and follow the restrictions in place.

“Obviously there were some bumps along the road with Orlando and things like that, but these past couple of weeks have gone very smoothly and I believe everyone feels very safe.”

The format has every team plays four games in the preliminary round, which determines its ranking for the knockout stage. The final is scheduled for July 26 in Salt Lake City.

Portland wraps up its group stage Monday against OL Reign. Portland lost the tournament opener to 2-1 Canadian goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe and the North Carolina Courage, conceding the winning goal deep into second-half stoppage time, and tied their next two games against the Chicago Red Stars and Washington Spirit.

“We’re happy where we’re at and how we’ve been playing, but obviously there are things we need to improve upon,” said Sinclair, who is still looking for her first goal of the tournament. “We have a very difficult draw with the teams we were drawn against, playing those first three games in a week and with injuries and people deciding not to participate in the tournament, our roster has taken a hit.

“But that being said, I’m proud of how we’re performing, I think we’re playing very well in every game and I think we’re fortunate not to get some sort of result against North Carolina and I’d say our other two games we should have won.”

There were some questions on the calibre of play considering teams were off for months before being allowed to practice and not in mid-season form. Yet, the quality of play has been excellent evidenced by Thorns striker Lindsay Horan, who scored an outstanding goal on a diving header to give Portland the lead against Washington on Sunday.

In order to protect players from the Utah heat, games are scheduled in the morning and late evening.

“I’ve been pleasantly surprised, the level of play is pretty high,” Sinclair said. “I think what you see is the fatigue kick in more than the quality of play dropping. Games come the 60th minute start to get stretched that I don’t think you’d see in the regular season once teams have had a proper preseason.”

88,torontosun,https://driving.ca/jeep/grand-cherokee/reviews/road-test/suv-review-2020-jeep-grand-cherokee-summit/,SUV Review: 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee,"['Andrew Mccredie', 'Hours Ago', 'Share Story']",2020-07-11 10:00:51+00:00,"OVERVIEW Fully loaded, luxury SUV with serious off-road cred PROS Interior creature comforts; exterior styling CONS Cargo space VALUE FOR MONEY Decent, but brings into the conversation luxury German performance utes WHAT TO CHANGE? Prefer a darker interior HOW TO SPEC IT? As is, but pass on rear entertainment system

If the Grand Cherokee lineup were the Spice Girls, this vehicle would be Posh Spice. The upmarket Summit trim is one of seven available for 2020, two more than there are ‘Girls,’ and rounds out a model line that includes some other Spice-parallels (Baby Spice would be the base Laredo trim; Sporty Spicy the SRT; and while there is no Scary Spice, the ridiculous, 707-horsepower Trackhawk is that and more).

Like the girl-power pumping quartet, the Grand Cherokee has marched to its own drummer. When it debuted as the larger sibling to the Cherokee nearly three decades ago, it utilized a monocoque, or unibody, construction, unlike the SUV competition of the early Eighties that featured body-on-frame designs. Unibody design dominates the utility market today, as it is safer, more fuel efficient and easier to design and build. And with their lower centre of gravity, unibody SUVs handle better and provide a smoother ride. Translation: they tick that SUV Holy Grail box: they drive like a car. And for a vehicle like the Summit, which comes with the promise of refined luxury with a rugged streak, that’s just the ticket.

After a week in the Laguna leather driver’s bucket seat, I can confirm that this Grand Cherokee ticks all the boxes if you’re in the market for a comfy urban SUV with some serious off-roading bona fides. Of course, its highly unlikely you’ll come across a Summit on, well, a summit, as that kind of excursion is more the domain of the Overland (Muddy Spice?), or, of course, Jeep stablemate Wrangler models. That’s not to say this Summit couldn’t reach those lofty, logging-road accessible peaks. Like all Grand Cherokees, its 4x4 underpinnings are very real, from Quadra-Drive II with a rear Electronic Limited Slip Differential, Selec-Speed Control with hill-ascent and hill-descent control and the Selec-Terrain traction management system. That latter feature is controlled with a centre console dial offering up five drive modes: snow, sand, auto, mud and rock. Four adjacent buttons control hill descent, 4WD low gearing and the Quadra-Lift air suspension system. One last unique point about the vehicle’s off-road personality is that hill descent control works in a reverse gear.

That all said, it’s not really the good ol’ boy utility that will attract would-be buyers to this vehicle: it’s the cabin’s creature comforts, the somewhat elegant exterior (for an SUV, anyway), and its drive-ability.

There’s more than enough power, thanks to the 295-horsepower 3.6-litre V6 engine, and its 260 lbs.-ft torque provides a tow rating of 6,200 pounds (2812 kg). Certainly not as robust as the best-in-class 7,200 pounds (3266 kg) the available 5.7-litre V8 boasts, but for most applications more than up to the towing task. That power is transferred to the four wheels through a precise and smooth TorqueFlite eight-speed transmission, a very impressive gearbox that gives the SUV quick acceleration, but more importantly, a luxury car-like level of ride quality. The air suspension system certainly contributes to that sedan-sense of handling, particularly at the lowest setting. As does the slippery shape of the Grand Cherokee.

Having driven a number of luxury crossovers and sport-utes in the past few months, I was relieved to discover a good old gearshift in the centre console. You know, a proper one with a tactile feel of clicking into the selected gear, topped off with a nice leather knob. Competitors have abandoned these tried-and-true shifters in favour of push-buttons, shift by steering wheel stalk or odd little shifters that require you to check the digital readout to see if the gear you want is actually engaged.

Where the Summit really distinguishes itself from the other Grand Cherokee trim levels is in the cabin, with a sense of refinement and style that really ups the value-for-money quotient here. The dash design is clean and flows nicely from door to door, and the dominant 8.4-inch touchscreen is not just intuitive to use, but easy to read in any lighting conditions, something that can’t be said for some of the competition. I also like the old-school climate controls located under the screen, redundant in a sense as you can also control the climate via the Uconnect screen, but for me a more preferable way to adjust temperature and the fan, particularly when on the fly.

My already very well-appointed Summit had three add-on options packages. I loved the so-called Signature leather-wrapped interior package and the 20-inch wheels that came with the Premium Plus appearance package, but wasn’t a big fan of the exterior platinum chrome accents that are part of that latter package. And in this day and age of everyone having their own screen — be it phone or tablet — and their own catered tastes, the Rear DVD entertainment centre seemed a waste of money. And a Blu-ray player?

Where some of the competition betters the Grand Cherokee is in the storage department, as its lower profile does compromise rear cargo space. Rear seat room, however, is very good both from a leg and head perspective. Fuel economy is decent. The number that does stand out is the base price of just over $70K, which brings some of the performance CUVs/SUVs from German luxury brands into the conversation.

Finally, what’s somewhat remarkable about the 2020 Grand Cherokee, and serves as testament to the forward thinking of the design and engineering teams responsible for it, is that 2020 models are nine years into their fourth generation. True, there have been exterior and interior tweaks, and the addition of those aforementioned trims, but at its core is the same design DNA as that original one way back in 1983.

If success is measured through the test of time, the Grand Cherokee is a winner.",[]

Buy It! Original KITT Firebird signed by The Hoff

One of three original Pontiac Firebirds used in the iconic ’80s TV show Knight Rider is going under the hammer at Julien Auctions. The mildly modified 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am KITT car doesn’t clap back verbally like the on-screen version did, but it was really used during filming and its hood has been signed by David Hasselhoff, so it’s definitely worth — something. As of this writing, that “something” is defined by a US$75,000 bid.

Fiat Chrysler warns employees: no work, no pay

After two North American FCA employees at two different plants recently halted the line over fear management wasn’t properly adhering to COVID-19 health and safety practices, the brand is letting all of its employees know it will not tolerate such work stoppages.

Fiat Chrysler’s head of North American manufacturing issued a letter that said “unauthorized work stoppages in our facilities create both disruption, and, potentially, safety concerns, and therefore cannot be tolerated,” and any such activity “will result in zero pay.”

British firm AC to build EV Cobras

U.K. firm AC plans to build a total of 116 of the new Cobras (technically Aces) with either 230-kW (308-horsepower) electric motors kicking 369 lb.-ft. of torque; or Ford 2.3-litre EcoBoost four-cylinders good for 354 horsepower and 324 lb.-ft. of torque. Price for the EV Cobra has been set at $233,000, while the ICE model will run $144,000.

Honda, VW and Ford pump brakes on Facebook in Canada

Ford Canada was the first to go. In protest against the social media giant’s handling of misinformation and hate speech, the Blue Oval’s Canadian branch joined the Stop Hate for Profit campaign and officially suspended advertising on Facebook and Instagram. The budget retreat came after brands like Honda, The North Face, Ben and Jerry’s, and Verizon imposed similar Facebook boycotts in the U.S.

Not long after Ford Canada’s announcement, Honda and VW Canada followed suit, pulling the plug on their digital ad spend chez Facebook. The social media platform claims it will start to flag posts that break hate speech rules.

The 2021 Lamborghini Sián Roadster uses supercapacitors instead of lithium-ion batteries

Lamborghini’s entry into the hybrid hypercar space is different from its competition (McLaren P1, etc.) in that, rather than going full-tilt for high voltage, the 2021 Sián Roadster pairs its 785-horsepower V12 with a 34-horsepower electric motor powered by not batteries, but a supercapacitor.

In essence, supercapacitors allow for speedier energy transfers than with batteries, leading to more direct throttle response and far quicker recharging times. Lambo claims the capacitor recharges fully every time the Sián hops on the brakes. View the photo gallery and learn more about Lambo’s new hyper-hybrid bull here.

She had never seen a car like that before. It was love at first sight.

Her father bought the car when it came up for sale. But Lisa was too young to drive it. That would have to wait.

But Lisa eventually got her hands on the worn-out a rusty convertible. It sat for years before she had it completely restored.

Lisa, who lives in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, is part of a large group of enthusiasts worldwide who have made the first-generation Mustang the most popular collector car of all time.

Not surprising, data from classic car insurer Hagerty released July 10, Collector Car Appreciation Day in the U.S., also recognizes the 1965 and 1966 Mustang as the most sought-after collectible of the 1960s.

Amongst models from the 1920s, the Ford Model T is the most collected car. Ford Model A cars are the collector’s choice for the ’30s. It was Ford again for the forties. But the tri-five Chevys dominate collectibles of the 1950s.

The Chevrolet Corvette tops the list for both the ’70s and ’80s, with the Fox-bodied Mustangs and their immediate successors winning it for the ’90s. It’s Corvette again for the first decade after the millennial and, for 2010 to the present, it’s been the Dodge Challenger.

Across North America, 21 per cent of the population has an interest in collectible cars. Yet only five per cent of them actually own one, and less than one per cent rent them on a regular basis.

In Canada specifically, the Baby Boomers born between 1945 and 1965 account for well over half of those who collect cars, representing 57 per cent. Next are the so-called “Echo Boomers” born from 1972 through 1992, who represent 18 per cent of the hobby. Millennials (born 1981 to 1996) are fast catching up, though, growing their share of the market by more than three-quarters over the past five years.

Geographically, 78 per cent of Canada’s car collectors live in Ontario and east through Quebec and the Maritime provinces, which follows the concentration of where people live. But B.C. and Alberta have a disproportionate number of collectors, at 20 per cent.

The vast majority of cars in collections are domestically manufactured, at 79 per cent; with 21 per cent foreign-made collector vehicles.

Future classics will be vehicles that resonate with their owners in some way, Hagerty reckons, and stand out from indistinctive vehicles meant to get people from A to B.

A mere three per cent of the cars produced today are likely to become new classics, according to Hagerty. That’s about 490,000 vehicles per year.",[]

Hmmmm... HOW TO SPEC IT? Handling upgrades and Burmester audio should do

I knew something was afoot when first viewing the 2021 Porsche Cayenne Coupe GTS’s head up display. Proudly presented in my line of sight as I peered over the Cashmere Beige Metallic hood was a tachometer and G-force meter – ready to measure my anti-social behavior in real time. Hmmm.

While some will argue a snarling SUV with fastback bodywork and sports car aspirations is nothing more than a wacky, rolling contradiction, no one can dispute the fact that Porsche is awfully good at this game — namely kicking poor old Isaac Newton right where he lives when it comes to giving unlikely behemoths the moves of a gazelle. Granted, a 2.5-tonne gazelle, in the case of this third-gen 2021 Cayenne GTS that debuts in both “regular” and Coupe form in the fall of this year. But dang, this thing does handle.

I’m coursing my usual back road test loop, and the GTS is not so much pounding the blacktop into submission as it is dancing above it. While many vehicles of this ilk can get messy when pushed, this porky Porsche gets up on its toes and asks for more. Hammer out of a tight bend and the back end will side-step in the most delightful manner.

Granted, you’re always aware of the great mass being flung about, but as is the case with all sporting Porsches, poise and high levels of communication generate ease and confidence when behind the wheel. You just don’t expect this in an SUV.

The previous generation Cayenne GTS made a nod to downsizing by switching to a twin-turbo 3.6L V6. None of that here. This 2021 remake returns to V8 glory with a detuned version of the Cayenne Turbo’s 4.0L twin-turbo unit that kicks out a healthy 453 horsepower and 457 lb.-ft. of torque. While this isn’t a huge gain over the old GTS’ 434 horseppower and 443 lb-ft turbo V6, it certainly is an exponential boot up the emotional ladder. The V8 sounds the business, especially with this tester’s extra vocal Sport Exhaust II with its central tailpipes — part of the $10,110 Lightweight Sport Package that also adds carbon fibre roof and interior bits, a heated Alcantara steering wheel, and 22-inch wheels. Transmission duties are handled by a ZF eight-speed automatic.

So, what gives the Cayenne Coupe GTS its moves? Traditionally, GTS versions of any Porsche — be they sports car, sedan, or SUV — have been dubbed the sportiest. Not the fastest, not the most luxurious, but the iteration that puts you closest to the pointy end of the driving experience. And generally a value proposition, although in this case “value” is entirely relative.

The 2021 Cayenne GTS runs with three-chamber air-suspension which sees a 30-millimetre drop in ride height, and the all-wheel-drive system gets more rear torque bias than the other Cayennes in the stable. The Coupe GTS comes standard with the Sport Chrono Package that bestows launch control, a dash-mounted lap timer, and a steering wheel-mounted rotary drive selector with Normal, Sport, Sport Plus and Individual settings. Further, this tester raids the option list for more go-fast bits: the 48-volt active PDCC Sport anti-roll bars and torque vectoring ($4,090), and rear axle steering ($1,840).

It’s Porsche’s masterful blending of all this tech that gives the GTS its uncanny athleticism. Factor in the alert and tactile steering, tireless brakes, and that eight-speed automatic that works with nearly the brains and alacrity of Porsche’s excellent PDK twin-clutch unit, and you’ve got a family hauler that will have your kids and dog puking faster than you can say Nurburgring Nordschleife.

Okay, back to reality. Few will explore the Cayenne Coupe GTS’ outer limits and most will buy it for its rakish style. BMW invented the “SUV coupe” way back in 2008 with the X6, and lo and behold, the concept caught on. I will argue that Porsche, being the latest maker to jump on this exclusive bandwagon, currently offers the best looking one. The 2021 Cayenne Coupe comes across as handsome and cohesive — not the victim of some unfortunate surgery as some competitors are wont to do. Being a GTS, it gets blacked-out trim, and this new-for-2021 Cashmere Beige Metallic is lovely.

Inside we see optional seats trimmed in uber-cool houndstooth fabric. They are supremely comfortable and supportive, but adopting this retro vibe requires sacrificing seat ventilation. Consolation can be found in the truly spectacular $7,980 Burmester audio system whose rich, well balanced, and astoundingly clear sound nearly justifies the price tag.

Ah, the price. Didn’t I say earlier that Porsche’s GTS models were a value proposition? The 2021 Porsche Cayenne Coupe GTS starts at $126,500, putting it right between the V6-powered Cayenne S and ballistic Cayenne Turbo. However, this German-spec tester that is doing press duties here in Canada runs a heady $180,495 before freight and taxes. While that has us mere mortals up in arms, those who frequent Porsche dealers with real intent to buy apparently aren’t bothered by the fact they still have to shell out for heated seating, ambient lighting, adaptive cruise control, proximity key entry, lane change assist, auto-dimming mirrors, and so on. Not to mention the suspension upgrades that make this most driver-focused of Cayennes even more, err, driver focused.

Beside the eye-watering price, there’s not much to complain about here. Yes, the ride is pretty stiff-legged on the blighted Toronto roads even in Normal mode — the standard 21-inch wheels would probably help here — but get past that and this swoopy ute blends style, luxury, outstanding build quality, pace and pure driving pleasure like no other. And now that it belts out a V8 symphony, the Cayenne Coupe GTS backs up all that goodness with some spine-tingling emotion.",[]
92,torontosun,https://driving.ca/aston-martin/features/feature-story/motor-mouth-from-nostalgia-with-love/,Motor Mouth: From Nostalgia With Love,"['David Booth', 'Day Ago', 'Share Story', 'Handout', 'Aston Martin']",2020-07-10 10:00:58+00:00,"Take a look at the 40-second video that precedes this article. Done? OK, now I have an important question I have to ask you: how is this not the most desirable classic car of all time?

By “this,” I mean Aston Martin’s Continuation of the 1964 DB5, the car Sean Connery — James Bond himself — made famous in Goldfinger. Replete with machine guns (fake, of course), bulletproof rear shield (don’t count on it), and that rear sprayer thing (now shooting out water rather than oil, for obvious reasons), it is as faithful a replication of the “most famous car in the world” — the film producers’ label when the original two cars were shown at the 1964 New York World’s Fair — as legally allowed. It is, save perhaps for the outright lethality, as close as any non-fiction human will ever get to being “licenced to kill.”

Yet, when I offered up an update on the Continuation to our news editor — the first one just rolled out of Newport Pagnell — he dismissed the whole thing as unable to generate any online traction (that’s “clickbait” to you and I). My appeal to the grand poo-bah, Driving’s own managing editor, barely mustered a “meh.”

“Aston Martin is so yesterday,” said the man who pays the bills.

And he’s exactly right. Aston Martin — certainly this Aston Martin — is so yesterday. In fact, that’s why it’s so important to me and not him. The Q’d-out DB5 may have had a huge part in my yesterdays, but it was just bit player in his.

Nostalgia is hardly an exact science — as late as the 17th century, it was considered a mental disorder to be eradicated so soldiers wouldn’t yearn so much to return home — but the one thing on which everyone agrees is that sentimentality is a wistfulness germinated in youth. To paraphrase Aristotle, give me a child between 13 and 25, and I will show you his future remembrances.

Like music, it seems, the cars first aspired to in our youth leave the most lasting impressions. Whether it’s as Mark Joseph Stern, writing in Slate, says that “the more we like a song, the more we get treated to neurochemical bliss,” or the fact that James Bond got Pussy Galore, that with which we make a committed memory trace in our youth is likely to rule the reminisces of our future.

I worship motorcycles much more than cars and, seemingly proof in the pudding, I am stuck in the narrowest of nostalgic eras, the past with which I seemingly long to reconnect stretching from just 1981 to 1983. I don’t know if it’s because by that time, I was almost on the cusp of affording the superbikes of that era and so I could at least pretend to own one, or whether while studying for my B.Eng., their technology appealed to my burgeoning engineering ambitions.

Whatever the case, I own a 1982 Honda CB1100RC, long for the 1981 Laverda RGS1000 I so stupidly sold and, quite literally last night, bought a 1983 CX650 Turbo — or at least I clicked on the “Buy Now” button — on a whim I still don’t quite understand. Everything I covet comes from that seemingly incongruously narrow window — thank God there wasn’t a 1983 Kawasaki GPZ1100 on sale last night, or else there’d be bikes in my bedroom — motorcycles of any other generation, even those but a year older or newer, hold no special place in my commemoration of the past. Nostalgia, despite its seemingly nebulous origins, can be pinpoint precise in its historic demarcation.

And even though I don’t get nearly as dewy-eyed about cars, I can remember precisely where I was when I saw Goldfinger for the first time. My northern Quebec hometown had no English theatre, and English TV programming consisted of The Friendly Giant, Don Messer’s Jubilee, and Hockey Night in Canada, so I didn’t see 007 take on Oddjob until I went to university. But since I was only 15 — and still very much impressionable — Sean Connery’s conquest of Jill Masterson didn’t fall on deaf ears. Being a devotee of all things internally combusted — and, again, barely 15 years old — I assumed it was all because of the DB5. That our managing and news editors don’t worship at the altar of the DB5 — and guys, just so you know, the Corgi toy replica of the Silver Birch Aston was the best-selling toy of 1964 — has less to do with an absence of nostalgia than simply different car, different girl.

If one talks to men of a certain vintage, James Bond — the Sean Connery version, at least — represents whom we, as boys, wanted to be when we grew up. That, as adolescents, some of us mistook the car and not the man as the reason he was so cool — and by cool we meant he got, say it after me because it’s a proper name, Pussy Galore — remains irrelevant, even though we are now (hopefully) smart enough to realize there’s more to life than a double-overhead cam straight-six engine and twin machine guns.

Actually, we’re not. As pathetic as it may seem, pretty much every owner of a classic car has a self-image of himself behind the wheel of the classic he covets. That this perception does not jive with bald, paunchy reality matters not a whit. Such images were, says the science of nostalgia, burned into our synapses a long time since, and the pitiful amount of self-realization the typical male possesses is powerless to shut it down. Get behind the wheel of a Goldfinger DB5 and you are James Bond, machine guns, bulletproof shield and all.",[]
93,torontosun,https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/indie-pot-store-owner-says-red-tape-blocking-her-efforts,Indie pot store owner says red tape blocking her efforts,"['Kevin Connormore Kevin Connor', 'More Kevin Connor', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'News', 'Toronto', 'Gta']",2020-07-11 21:29:17+00:00,"A Toronto woman is frustrated with the red tape she says she has faced while attempting to open a pot store.

Vivianne Wilson, who is working to set up her store called GreenPort at 686 College St., says the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario’s cannabis retail licencing process is out of whack.

She says there is no transparency and the ordeal to open her store has so far taken 253 days.

“As a small business owner, carrying the costs of a business for 253 days without generating income is

crippling. The pandemic further confirmed this fact,” said Wilson, the first and only female Black independent owner and operator of a Canadian cannabis retail business.

“My aim is to provide diversity and representation which is presently absent from the Canadian cannabis industry. I am extremely proud to have independently founded a cannabis company that was awarded a federal cannabis sales licence in 2019,” Wilson added.

She also applied on January 9, 2020, to the province for a cannabis retail licence with the AGCO and was approved on March 26.

On March 31, Wilson says she applied for the Cannabis Retail Sore Authorization, the second part of the application process, but she says that process has stalled.

Wilson says the AGCO says it will be late September before she will get the second-stage approval.

“I am in the process of establishing the first Canadian cannabis retail business that is independently owned, operated, and funded by a woman of colour, but the AGCO’s process is making this nearly impossible,” she said.

Wilson says 61 of the 100 cannabis stores authorized to open by the AGCO are owned by 15 companies and 35 of the stores authorized to open are owned by five companies.

“I asked the AGCO for any support that they could offer a small business owner such as myself and I was

met with a response of it’s a fair process for all applicants and we wouldn’t prioritize one over another.

Many other applicants are dealing with the same type of situation and are dealing with it as there is

nothing else that needs to be done,” Wilson said.

Wilson’s file has been placed in the queue for approval and will “tentatively” be approved for Sept. 28, said AGCO spokesperson Ray Kahnet.

“The AGCO has a team of Compliance and Licensing officers working on multiple files. All applications are processed efficiently and equitably. Generally speaking, delays may occur based on the complexity of the file and if the AGCO requests additional disclosure information and must wait for a response,” Kahnet said.

“The AGCO is committed to its mandate of ensuring the safe and responsible sale of recreational cannabis in licensed retail stores.”

A total of eight U.S. states – Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin – also reached records for single-day infections.

In Texas, another hot zone, Governor Greg Abbott warned on Friday he may have to impose new clampdowns if the state cannot stem its record-setting caseloads and hospitalizations through masks and social distancing.

“If we don’t adopt this best practice it could lead to a shutdown of business,” the Republican governor told local KLBK-TV in Lubbock, adding it was the last thing he wanted.

California announced on Friday the state will release up to 8,000 inmates early from prisons to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the facilities. At San Quentin State Prison, outside San Francisco, half of the facility’s roughly 3,300 prisoners have tested positive for the virus. The Walt Disney Co. said the theme parks in Orlando would open on Saturday to a limited number of guests who along with employees would be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The park also canceled parades, firework displays and events that typically draw crowds.

Disney’s chief medical officer said earlier this week she believed the rules would allow guests to visit the park safely.

Roughly 19,000 people, including some theme park workers, have signed a petition asking Disney to delay the reopening. The union representing 750 Walt Disney World performers has filed a grievance against the company, claiming retaliation against members over a union demand that they be tested for COVID-19.

Other theme parks opened in Orlando in June, including Comcast Corp’s Universal Studios Orlando and SeaWorld Entertainment Inc’s SeaWorld.

Florida remains one of the worst hotspots for the virus in the nation and is among a handful of states where deaths are rising, based on a Reuters analysis of fatalities in the last two weeks, compared with the prior two weeks.

On Thursday, the state reported a record 120 deaths and added another 92 on Friday. It recorded 11,433 new coronavirus cases on Friday, just short of the state’s record, and nearly 7,000 hospitalizations.

More than four dozen hospitals in Florida have reported their intensive care units were full.

This month, Florida has repeatedly reported more new daily coronavirus cases than any European country had at the height of their outbreaks. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, angered some residents and medical experts by calling the spike a “blip.”

On Friday, DeSantis said that the state would receive more than 17,000 vials of the antiviral drug remdesivir from the U.S. government, adding: “That’ll be something that will hopefully help to improve patient outcomes.”

Scott Burkee, a 43-year-old former Disney employee from Davenport, Florida, said DeSantis “has shown zero effort to control the spread, he only becomes concerned when Trump does. The virus is clearly out of control.”

Trump, a Republican, traveled to Florida on Friday for an event at the U.S. military’s Southern Command and a campaign fundraiser.

The president has sparred with state and local officials and teachers unions over the reopening of schools and said on Friday the Treasury Department would re-examine the tax-exempt status and funding of those that remain closed.

Trump previously vowed to cut federal funding to the schools and eject foreign students attending universities in the United States unless their schools offer in-person classes. Most education funds come from state and local coffers.

The number of confirmed U.S. infections is over 3 million, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed.

More than 133,000 Americans have died, a toll that experts warn will likely surge along with the rise in cases.

Overall, coronavirus cases are rising in 44 American states, based on a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.",[]

Metro Inc. was aware of Loblaw Companies Ltd.’s decision to stop its so-called pandemic pay program before it made a similar decision, chief executive Eric La Fleche told the House of Commons standing committee on industry, science and technology Friday.

La Fleche said that a Metro competitor’s move was one of several influencing factors in its decision-making process.

He joined the Loblaw president and Empire Co. Ltd. chief executive at a two-hour session about why they stopped paying a temporary wage bump to employees as of June 13.

“Let me be absolutely clear, we did not co-ordinate our decisions,” said Michael Medline, Empire CEO, in his opening statement before the committee. Medline, whose company owns the Sobeys and Safeway brands, was the first of the trio to give his opening remarks.

“The decision was our own.”

“The decision was our own.”

Loblaw president Sarah Davis echoed the sentiment, but noted she sent a “courtesy email” to both competitors, as well as Walmart and Save-On-Foods, on June 11. The latter two did not appear at the hearing.

The email notified competitors of Loblaw’s decision to end its pandemic pay program on June 13. The company had already informed its roughly 200,000 employees, she said, and recognized “the news would be public immediately.”

La Fleche said in later questioning that he was aware of the email when Metro made its decision to end its bonus pay program on the same day.

“We made our own decision based on the information we had, which included that last piece of information, yes,” he said.

He called it “one factor among others” contributing to its decision. Other factors included the broader economic reopening, other retailers starting to open their doors, lower business volumes and a gradual return to more normal conditions.

Empire had not received Davis’s email when the company made its decision to terminate the extra wages, said Medline, but had heard through the grapevine that Loblaw was considering doing so.

Davis received a reply to her June 11 email, and said she would provide copies of the original and all answers to the committee.

She also sent a courtesy email to competitors when Loblaw decided to begin its extra pay program. Davis said she doesn’t recall sending courtesy emails to competitors on other topics, including executive compensation.

In addition to receiving the email, La Fleche said he made several phone calls to competitors in May and June to ask whether they planned to extend their bonus pay programs or end them on previously announced dates.

“In perfect compliance with The Competition Act, I asked my counterparts their intentions regarding whether or not they would maintain the temporary bonus,” he said, in a translation from French, during his opening remarks.

In each case, competitors, including Medline from Empire and Davis from Loblaw, told him they had not yet decided.

“Whatever the case, those calls were made in a decisional process that was much larger and … did not inform our decisions.”

When asked why he made the phone calls, La Fleche answered he “wanted as much information as I could have in order to make a best decision for our company, our employees at the right time.”

He said he would “absolutely not” characterize those conversations as trying to obtain a tacit agreement on wages.

Those who sent emails and made phone calls said they consulted with company counsel before doing so and lawyers were present during at least one phone discussion.

The appearance was a chance for the executives to admit they were wrong to end the pay increases, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, a private sector union.

“What we got instead was highly paid grocery executives insisting they did not collude, and then going on to say — remarkably — virtually the same thing over and over again,” he said in a statement.

“The executives all admitted to exchanging ’courtesy emails’ and ’courtesy calls’ on pandemic pay, and yet insist there was no collusion. I look forward to the committee’s ruling on that.”

Unifor has been critical of retailers ending temporary wage increases while the pandemic continues and has called for the pay bump to be permanent.",[]

Trump’s decision to commute Stone’s sentence days before he was due to report to prison marked the Republican president’s most assertive intervention to protect an associate in a criminal case and his latest use of executive clemency to benefit an ally. Democrats condemned Trump’s action, announced on Friday evening, as an assault on the rule of law.

In his first remarks on his decision, Trump on Saturday painted Stone as a victim and lashed out against Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, with whom Biden served as vice president.

“Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals, including the fact that Biden and Obama illegally spied on my campaign – AND GOT CAUGHT!” the president tweeted.

The veteran Republican political operative’s friendship with Trump dates back decades. Stone, 67, was scheduled to report by Tuesday to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months.

Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, opted to give Stone a commutation, which does not erase a criminal conviction, rather than a full pardon.

Stone emerged from his Fort Lauderdale, Florida home on Friday night after the commutation of his sentence was announced wearing a mask with the words “Free Roger Stone.”

“This is a horrific, horrific nightmare when you realize that this investigation never had any legitimate or lawful beginning, it was a witch hunt,” Stone said using some of the same words Trump has hurled at prosecutors and Democrats who investigated Moscow’s role in the 2016 U.S. election.

Stone was among several Trump associates charged with crimes in former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that documented Russian interference to boost Trump’s 2016 candidacy.

The White House criticized Mueller’s investigation and the prosecutors in Stone’s case, saying the Left and its allies in the media attempted for years to undermine the Trump presidency.

Mueller’s investigation found extensive contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russians.

Republican reaction on Capitol Hill was largely muted, with a handful of Trump allies welcoming the action.

But Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump at his Senate impeachment trial, denounced the action on Twitter: “Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president.”

Congressional Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of undermining the rule of law by publicly complaining about criminal cases against associates including Stone, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

“Congress will take action to prevent this type of brazen wrongdoing,” U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Saturday. “Legislation is needed to ensure that no president can pardon or commute the sentence of an individual who is engaged in a cover-up campaign to shield that president from criminal prosecution.”

GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS

A Washington jury in November 2019 convicted Stone on all seven criminal counts of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress and tampering with a witness.

Trump repeatedly lashed out on Twitter about Stone’s case, accusing prosecutors of being corrupt, the juror forewoman of political bias and the judge of treating his friend unfairly.

Attorney General William Barr earlier intervened in the case to scale back the Justice Department’s sentencing recommendation, leading four career prosecutors to quit the proceedings.

One of them, Aaron Zelinsky, told lawmakers on June 24 that his supervisor in the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington was told to go easy on Stone for political reasons.

Stone was convicted for lying to the House Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.

The U.S. Constitution gives a president the “power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” Trump’s use of this executive clemency often has benefited allies and well-connected political figures.

He pardoned hardline former Arizona county sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Republican White House aide Lewis “Scooter” Libby, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and convicted “junk bond king” Michael Milken. He also commuted the prison sentence of Democratic former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been a contestant on Trump’s former reality TV show.

Stone has been a fixture in American partisan battles dating to the 1970s. A colorful figure known for his natty attire, he has labeled himself an “agent provocateur” and famously has the face of former President Richard Nixon tattooed on his back.",[]

Yep, turns out Finance Minister Bill Morneau has a couple of family connections to WE – his daughters.

The news comes the day after it was revealed Trudeau family members were paid more than $353,000 to speak at various WE Day events. At this point I’m getting the feeling it might be easier to ask which senior Liberals around the PM don’t have a connection to one of the many WE organizations.

Oh, and just like Trudeau, it seems Morneau didn’t think he should have recused himself from approving a nearly $1 billion sole sourced government contract for WE to run a student grant program.

Unlike the Trudeau family members – the PM’s mother, brother and wife – Morneau has a family member currently on the payroll and another who has been supported by WE in the past. His daughter Clare spoke at a WE Day in Ottawa but was reportedly not paid.

She was speaking about her book on the stories of African girls in a refugee camp, a book endorsed with a blurb on the cover by WE co-founder Marc Kielburger.

None of that should have made Bill Morneau step away from the cabinet table when it came time to vote, the job his daughter Grace holds is another matter. Grace has been working in the WE complex for a little while now, first at ME to WE and now at WE Charity.

Nothing against Grace or her job but her father should have known better.

That seems to be a running theme with this government, especially on this file, they should have known better.

How do you as prime minister or finance minister, vote on giving a contract, a nearly $1 billion sole sourced contract, to an organization your family has benefitted from financially?

When it comes to conflicts of interest, people like Morneau and Trudeau, not only need to avoid conflict of interest but also the appearance of one. There is no doubt there is an appearance of conflict and I would argue an actual conflict.

We will find out soon what the Ethics Commissioner thinks now that Mario Dion has announced he is launching an investigation. We will also hopefully find out the truth, as to who made these decisions, now that two Commons committees are investigating and the government has been ordered by MPs to turn over the contract along with emails, briefing notes and other documents by Aug. 8.

Will this end there?

Maybe not, the Conservatives asked for the police to be called in on Friday.

“It is clear that a criminal investigation is warranted,” Conservative MP Michael Barrett said.

Barrett has written to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki, appointed by Trudeau, asking her to conduct an investigation to see if sections 119 or 121 of the criminal code have been breached. Those sections deal with bribing officials and defrauding the government.

Barrett was asked if the governments moves were criminal or just stupid. The stupid part is obvious, this whole contract, this whole idea was stupid. As for criminal, that is up to the Mounties. But proving the PM acted in a criminal way will be difficult.

What is less difficult, is for voters to realize this is a government led by someone who has a great deal of difficulty in staying between the ethical lines. He’s already been found guilty of violating the Conflict of Interest Act twice. And I expect that to become three times in the near future.

“The George Floyd incident was a perfect storm — for the world to see and understand that these changes have to be made,” she said.

“Without George Floyd we wouldn’t have seen all the rest that’s happened over the past few months, or understood what’s at the root of parts of America.

“It’s an issue that’s touched the whole world, with protests everywhere, wherever there are people of colour.”

The elegant Commissiong did not experience overt racism herself until she entered the beauty pageant circuit. That all began as a way to publicize the fashion business she was going to open in Trinidad, where she’d just returned after living in the U.S. and studying at Manhattan’s Fashion Institute of Technology.

“I had just moved back to Trinidad, so I did it for promotion. I hadn’t been there for some years and wanted people to know who I was. I went into a local pageant without any expectations.”

And she won. From there her journey to the Miss Universe contest, held that year in the Dominican Republic, was underway.

“Only when we got there did I realize that I was really in a competition,” she said, laughing. “I’d never even been on a stage before. Seeing the competitive spirit around beauty was very interesting.”

International media attended, and every day the newspapers had a front page featuring one contestant or another.

“Except we never saw a black contestant on the cover,” remembers Commissiong. “We weren’t seeing ourselves in the papers at all. We figured we were there just to make up the numbers.

“I had never before in my life felt second place or second class, so that was all new to me.”

The whole notion of a beauty “industry” was new to her, too. There were plenty of hurdles in her year as Miss Universe.

“A person of colour was not a typical beauty,” she said. The main chaperone for the pageant winners was very unhappy that a black woman had won over a white Miss USA.

“One day she said to me, ‘Janelle, don’t think you’re the most beautiful girl in the world.’ I was quick on my feet, and responded, ‘The organization you work for told me I was!’”

Ironically, Commissiong’s reign ended when she passed the crown to Miss South Africa — at the height of apartheid.

She eventually did open her clothing business, but after her husband died, Commissiong took over his boat-building business. That was a huge hurdle, as the business was 100% male — all the craftsmen and all the customers — and nobody thought a “beauty queen” could handle it.

She did, though.

“It was a hostile industry, but over the years I think I earned their respect.”

Being the beauty queen has been a bit of a double-edged sword, says Commissiong, but she has always been proud of representing Trinidad.

She is an icon in her country. Her pageant win put Trinidad and Tobago on the map, and she’s been honoured by having her image on the nation’s postage stamps.

Recently, a main street in Port of Spain was renamed for her; Trinidad and Tobago won independence from Britain in the 1960s, so naming a street after someone local, says the modest Commissiong, “may help young people coming up have a sense of our history.”

She never had political aspirations?

“Not at all!” She laughs again. “Thank God I was too smart for that.”

Enter NDP leader Jagmeet Singh.

Last week, he claimed the incident on the grounds of Rideau Hall was an example of systemic racism in policing because the confrontation would have ended badly if the accused, Canadian soldier Corey Hurren, had not been white.

His argument was based on comparing the peaceful surrender of Hurren, now charged with multiple gun offences, to the fatal shooting of Ejaz Choudry by Peel Regional Police last month, who was armed with a knife and in mental distress when his family called police for help.

Choudhry’s death was a tragedy. It is now being investigated by Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit which probes cases where civilians are killed or severely injured in confrontations with police.

But for Singh to compare that to Hurren’s case and to imply the RCMP officers involved would have killed him had he not been white, is reckless and irresponsible.

Using Singh’s “logic”, one way the RCMP officers could have absolved themselves from his allegation would have been to fatally shoot Hurren.

Since Singh engaged in wild speculation, we will wildly speculate as well.

We speculate if the RCMP had shot Hurren to death, Singh would have said it was another example of police being trigger happy instead of de-escalating such confrontations, which also disproportionately impacts racial minorities because of systemic racism in policing.

See how easy this is to do? As the great American conservative thinker Thomas Sowell, who happens to be black, has observed: “The word ‘racism’ is like ketchup. It can be put on practically anything — and demanding evidence makes you a ‘racist’.”

The fact fatal police shootings of black and Indigenous Canadians in crisis occur disproportionately compared to whites is a serious issue requiring serious solutions.

The main reason for it was identified by former Supreme Court judge Frank Iacobucci in his exhaustive 2014 study of how Toronto police deal with people in crisis.

It’s the abject failure of Canada’s federal, provincial and municipal governments to provide adequate mental health services to Canadians, which disproportionately impacts racial minorities.

Someone should tell Jagmeet Singh.",[]

It also explains why Liberal voters continue to stand by him.

Scheer asked the PM whether he would waive “privileges and confidences” in the ethics commissioner’s investigation of the WE Charity scandal.

“Privileges and confidences” refers, mostly, to rules governing the confidentiality of cabinet discussions. What ministers say at cabinet and among themselves (and in many cases with senior civil servants) cannot be divulged to the public until decades later.

Like doctor-patient and lawyer-client privilege.

In response to Scheer’s question, Trudeau said of course he would cooperate with the commissioner’s investigation. He always cooperates with the officers of Parliament.

And here is the disconnect that causes most of Trudeau’s blunders.

I think he truly believes he does cooperate. Fully.

In his own sophomoric mind, he’s not conniving to suppress the truth (although by his actions that is exactly what he is doing). When he imagines himself (which in his narcissistic way must be several times a day), he sees himself, breastplate gleaming in the sun, as our most “transparent and accountable” prime minister, ever.

During Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion’s investigation into the prime minister’s involvement in last year’s SNC-Lavalin affair, Dion asked Trudeau to waive privilege for nine key witnesses. Trudeau refused.

The commissioner reminded the PM’s office and the Privy Council that he was prevented by the Ethics Act from divulging cabinet confidences in his public reports, even when privilege is waived. He just needed to talk to the nine for the sake of his report’s accuracy.

Trudeau still refused.

Still, Trudeau swore to Scheer this past Wednesday that he will cooperate fully with Dion’s current probe – because that is what he always does. I think he was being sincere. Delusional. But sincere.

When he says one day that the civil service alone arranged for WE to be given a sole-source contract to distribute nearly $1 billion in pandemic emergency grants to students who volunteer their time and then admits days later he pushed for and voted for the deal at cabinet, I’m convinced he hasn’t the intellectual perception to see those as contradictory.

One week he insists WE never paid any one in his family to speak at their events, the next we learn the charity and its affiliates paid assorted Trudeaus more than $300,000 over the years.

Still, to him, that’s not a lie. It’s simply an evolution of the narrative.

His government simply wanted to get money to struggling students as quickly as it could. Who can fault that?

Unfortunately, a lot of voters will gobble up that sugary slop.

Trudeau and core Liberal supporters always believe their party’s motives are so pure (not to mention enlightened, magnanimous and morally superior) that their methods should never be challenged.

They will defend his actions by saying the important thing is his heart was in the right place. The money needed to get out quickly to do maximum good. What does it matter how?

They’ll wonder aloud why it’s important the Trudeau family has a long-standing beneficial connection with the WE Charity and its co-founders Craig and Marc Kielburger?

To Liberals, particularly in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa, the WE scandal no more proves that Trudeau is corrupt than the Kokanee grope proves he is a sexist or his multiple blackface antics prove his is a bigot.

They’re sure he’s none of those things and there are enough of them to keep re-electing him.",[]

A one with twelve zeroes after it. A thousand billion dollars.

It’s where Canada’s federal debt is heading in the next half year.

We all knew the number was going to be jaw-dropping, but it turned out to be even worse than even the most pessimistic predictions.

On March 27, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated this year’s federal deficit would hit $112 billion. By April 30, that estimate had jumped to $252 billion.

But when Finance Minister Bill Morneau revealed his ‘fiscal snapshot’ this week, the deficit had ballooned to a whopping $343 billion. That means our existing $775 billion federal debt will now increase by over 40% in a single year. That will put it well over a trillion dollars for the first time.

By comparison, the last time the debt rose by $343 billion it took about 28 years.

We’re talking about this depressing trillion-dollar milestone right now because of the slew of emergency pandemic spending combined with a collapse in tax revenues due to the economic shutdown. It’s the haystack of spending that broke the camel’s back. But make no mistake, that poor dromedary’s spine was already strained.

Trudeau can’t be faulted for the worldwide health pandemic. It’s a global crisis that caught everyone less prepared than they should have been. But the Trudeau government is definitely responsible for the fiscal footing it put the country on when the crisis hit.

When the economy was growing and times were good, the Trudeau Liberals ran deficits and racked up nearly $100 billion in new debt. That would have been enough to pay for nearly half of all pandemic spending.

Simply put, Trudeau and Morneau spent the rainy day fund while the sun was shining.

It’s a grim rebuke to the don’t-worry-be-happy attitude that constantly preached that ever increasing debt is fine. It’s a vindication for the common sense principle that being prudent in the good times is a good way to prepare for the bad times when they inevitably come.

But coming back to this week’s fiscal update, even more troubling than their track record is the Liberals’ complete lack of a plan for the future.

There was no indication of how they would wind down expensive temporary spending, or even adjust programs such as the monthly emergency benefit which effectively penalizes people who are willing and able to get back to work.

There was no sign that they’ve begun to look at ways to reduce the cost of government, even as Canadians who have lost jobs and taken pay cuts watch idled government employees continue to get their full paychecks.

There was no hint of a plan to revive the economy they put into an induced coma, even as every day brings news of more businesses going bankrupt.

Morneau insists that it’s too hard to predict the future, but he’s obligated to try rather than simply leave Canadians in the dark about how the government plans to climb out of this cavernous hole.

There are tough times ahead, and the sooner Morneau grabs the bull by the horns and starts making hard choices, the better. But given that he wasn’t even able to keep spending in check when the deficit was one tenth the size, Canadians could be forgiven for worrying whether he has the steel to get us out of a much bigger mess.

The longer the COVID-19 pandemic goes on, the more families are being put in an untenable, lose-lose situation, where they are effectively being told they have to choose between the health of their children and the health of their parents.

There are three major parts of this problem:

1. Health risk from COVID-19.

2. Psychological damage risk from the COVID-19 response.

3. People, in general, are not very good at understanding risk.

The ways individuals treat the threat of COVID-19 are far more numerous than the ways health experts have talked to them about that threat.

This is always a problem with experts explaining things to non-experts, but it gets significantly worse because of how much conflicting information there is about COVID-19.

Many individuals are now making the assumption if anyone who is elderly or infirm gets COVID-19, it will be certain death.

Others believe this is the equivalent of a really bad flu season and that the medical and political establishment are grossly overreacting.

The more this happens, the more the facts about COVID-19 become irrelevant and fear, fatigue, or both, are in control.

The middle ground is being lost.

The psychological damage from the COVID-19 response is not helping.

With mental health issues being less commonly understood than physical diseases, the confusion caused by what experts are telling the public becomes even more problematic.

Some parents are being alarmed into believing their children are showing signs of long-term psychological damage and irreversible trauma from isolation.

Some are concerned their children may attempt to harm themselves, others that their kids have forgotten how to be happy.

There is a general fear of mass depression and post-traumatic stress disorder among children in some social circles.

You also have the other extreme, where some either believe or are being told this is all overblown, their children are just whining, and they need to “suck it up.”

Imagine you are a parent who believes there is a clear and present threat that COVID-19 will kill your parents if you go to large gatherings, but also believes your child will be permanently harmed if you do not go to large gatherings.

What do you choose? Risk killing your parents by going out, or risk letting your children waste away by not going out?

It doesn’t matter if one or both of these things are actually true. All that matters is if people believe them to be true.

For some, there is a fear of widening “their circle” at all, due to a lack of trust in anyone they could include in “their circle.”

Even if people do not trust advice from experts, they can, let’s hope, compare what they think of the risks posed by COVID-19 to other risks they accept every day.

Perhaps that will bring them some comfort.

For example, road injuries are the 9th to 11th leading cause of death every year. In 2017, approximately 1.24 million people were killed worldwide.

That is not going to stop most of us from driving to the grocery store, or from ever driving again.

Driving safely does not mean you are immune from becoming a statistic when it comes to road deaths.

But what it does do is lower your risk.

When it comes to COVID-19, consider what you need to do to lower your risk to an acceptable level for you and your family, and then find out the best ways to meet that goal or objective as safely as possible, without unnecessary hardship.

By contrast, the worst thing to do is to become so frustrated by public health warnings that you disregard all of them and do whatever you want, consequences be damned.
