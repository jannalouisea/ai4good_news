While much of the province will be in Stage 3 as of July 17, the Greater Toronto Area will be in a wait-and-see mode.

Dine-in restaurants and bars can get back in business with limits on capacity and other public health measures in place such as mandatory seating of patrons when eating or drinking, government documents say.

Among the other enterprises that can reopen their doors with strict conditions include casinos, bingo halls, convention centres and meeting places, gyms, fitness centres, concerts and live shows, movie theatres, real estate open houses, sporting and race events, and tours.

Nightclubs will only be allowed to serve food and drinks to seated customers, with no dancing or congregating at the bar.

Under Stage 3, the maximum number of people allowed in a gathering is increasing to 50 inside and 100 outside, although the two-metre rule remains in place for people who don’t normally share a social bubble.

Wrestling and other prolonged contact sports are still out under Stage 3 unless modified to avoid participants from deliberate physical contact, the government says.

Amateur and recreational sports leagues can get back at it provided the same no-prolonged-touching rules apply.

Sporting event spectators will be subject to gathering and physical limits.

On the advice of public health officials, the government continues to prohibit amusement and water parks, dancing at restaurants and bars except in very limited circumstances, buffet-style food services, overnight stays at kids’ camps, private karaoke rooms, sports involving prolonged or deliberate contact, saunas, bath houses, steam rooms, oxygen bars and table games at gambling venues.

Scheduled to enter Stage 3 on July 17 are all parts of the province with the exception of Durham Region, Haldiman-Norfolk, Halton Region, Hamilton, Lambton, Niagara Region, Peel Region, Toronto, Windsor-Essex and York Region.

“Additional time is required to assess and monitor any impacts and readiness to move into Stage 3,” government documents say.

Taking to the water under the name Hornblower, two Canadian vessels that usually each operate at a 700-passenger capacity, have since July 2 only carried six paying passengers at a time — roughly 0.8% of the total customer load — with four crew members.

Mory DiMaurizio, general manager of Hornblower Niagara Cruises, said the main reason for the difference in passenger loads is the province put the boat business in a category of operations that limited it to a maximum of 10 people on board.

“The order in council that was issued by the province — the language was not as clear as it could be — it didn’t classify us as an attraction,” DiMaurizio said Monday.

“The funny thing is the province has recognized us as an attraction on many occasions. We were lumped in with ‘tour or guide services.’ So it really threw us for a loop.”

DiMaurizio said July 1 was the only day the company operated as an “attraction” and while there are no capacity limits under that category, the Hornblower self-imposed a restriction of 100 to 200 people, or a 30% capacity.

Towards the end of the day, DiMaurizio was informed by bylaw officers they were not complying with rules set out in their category and shut operations down. Since then, the business has complied with the six-passenger rule.

The Maid of the Mist, which tours Niagara Falls from the U.S. side, have been up and running since June 26 and are operating at 50% capacity — or 230 passengers per trip, according to the business’ website. A spokesperson for that company couldn’t be reached.

However, some on social media used contrasting photos to highlight how the two countries are faring with coronavirus numbers. On Monday, there were over 3.4 million cases in the U.S. compared to roughly 107,000 cases in Canada.

“Here’s the photo that captures the difference in the pandemic response between U.S.A. and Canada,” tweeted one person. “Maid of the Mist (U.S.A., blue ponchos) packed with tourists, Hornblower (Canada, red ponchos) only six passengers legally allowed. Fifty meters away and a chasm of difference.”

Maid of the Mist also encourages passengers to practice physical distancing and requires people to wear a face mask as a condition of admission. There are also health screeners, stations equipped with hand sanitizer, and enhanced cleaning measures.

The Hornblower similarly requires all passengers to don a face mask, buy advance timed tickets online, practice physical distancing, and sanitize their hands before coming onto the boat.

Over Canada Day, people filmed large crowds gathering at the Canadian side of Niagara Falls or groups strolling the Clifton Hill tourist strip.

Janice Thomson, of Niagara Falls Tourism, said visitors to the area are “still well below” a traditional summer level.

“A lifting of the restrictions on attractions such as Hornblower and waterparks will allow more families to spend time in the destination, knowing that many health precautions have been implemented,” she said.

The surprise apology marked a sharp about-face for the prime minister after weeks of trying to defend the controversial, sole-sourced contract with WE, and follows revelations his wife, brother and mother had been paid a combined $300,000 for appearing at WE events over the years.

“I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions given our family’s history and I’m sincerely sorry for not having done that,” Trudeau said during a news conference outside his Ottawa home on Monday.

“When it came to this organization and this program, the involvement that I had in the past and that my family has should have had me remove myself from these discussions. And I’m sorry that I didn’t.”

Trudeau said he was particularly sorry that the delay in the program caused by WE’s eventual decision to withdraw from administering the Canada Student Services Grant would harm students looking for ways to help in the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Young people who are facing a difficult time right now getting summer jobs, contributing to their communities, are going to have to wait a little longer before getting those opportunities to serve, and that’s frustrating.”

Trudeau announced general plans for the program in April and then details of the Canadian Student Services Grant followed June 25. The government said tens of thousands of students having a hard time finding summer work due to COVID-19 could volunteer up to 500 hours to earn the maximum $5,000 toward their post-secondary costs.

But the program came under immediate scrutiny after it was discovered that WE had been chosen to administer it. Trudeau said federal public servants had recommended the organization and that it was considered the only one capable of delivering the program.

Trudeau nonetheless faced accusations of cronyism and allegations of a conflict of interest over his past connections with WE. Those allegations only grew after revelations last week about the payments to his wife, brother and mother.

The prime minister and Finance Minister Bill Morneau both confirmed they did not recuse themselves from the cabinet vote that approved giving the contract to WE. One of Morneau’s daughters has spoken at WE events while another does contract work for the organization.

Morneau’s office on Sunday denied any link between his daughters’ involvement with WE and the contract to administer the student grant program, which Trudeau acknowledged would have paid the organization around $20 million.

WE has said, including in a full-page newspaper advertisement Monday, that money would only have covered its costs.

The government and WE terminated the deal on July 3. The federal Employment and Social Development Department has since taken over the program, though officials have acknowledged the change will result in delays in its roll out.

Trudeau sidestepped questions about whether he knew his family had received money from WE when cabinet was deciding whether to approve the contract, saying that he knew of their involvement with the organization but not the details.

Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is currently investigating Trudeau over a potential conflict of interest in relation to the deal with WE. The Conservatives and NDP have asked the watchdog to also look into a potential conflict of interest by Morneau.

The Conservatives have also said they want Trudeau to appear before the House of Commons’ finance committee to answer questions about how the arrangement with WE came to be.

Trudeau was noncommittal about doing so, saying he would look at any invitations and discuss them with his leadership team.

The opposition parties are also seeking an investigation by the Commons ethics committee, and Conservative Sen. Don Plett has written to the speaker of the Senate, calling for that body to be recalled this summer to begin a probe of its own.

The Globe and Mail reported on Monday that Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan and Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, previously helped WE raise money before the Liberals formed government in 2015.",[]

California Governor Gavin Newsom shut bars and banned indoor restaurant dining statewide, while closing churches, gyms and hair salons in the hardest-hit counties.

Newsom acted as COVID-19 cases strained hospitals in several rural counties and as infections mounted in Los Angeles and parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.

Los Angeles is the second-largest school district in the United States and with San Diego has a combined 706,000 students and 88,000 employees.

President Donald Trump, seeking re-election in November, has demanded schools reopen nationwide for in-person learning in the autumn. His campaign views reopening schools as necessary for economic recovery, especially for working parents with young children.

Trump trails his presumptive Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, in opinion polls both nationwide and in swing states that decide elections.

Florida along with Arizona, California and Texas have emerged as the new U.S. epicenters of the pandemic. Infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 states over the last two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.

Despite nearly 28,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last two days, Florida has announced no new measures such as a statewide mask mandate, and Disney World in Orlando remains open for business.

‘PEOPLE AREN’T LISTENING’

Linda Stuart, 70, a lifelong resident of Orlando, Florida, said she and her family were staying at home except to go to the grocery and were “painfully aware” how quickly cases are rising.

“But sadly, too many people aren’t listening,” she said. “This should be terrifying them, but it isn’t. Not enough people are even wearing masks.”

The rise in Florida cases emerged hours after Trump took swipes at health experts in his government leading the U.S. response to the pandemic and his relationship further frayed with infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.

On Sunday, Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new cases of COVID-19 in 24 hours. If Florida were a country, that would rank it fourth in the world for the most new cases in a day, behind the United States, Brazil and India, according to a Reuters analysis.

Florida’s Disney World welcomed the public on Saturday for the first time since March with guests required to wear masks, undergo temperature checks and keep physically apart.

Walt Disney Co faces a starkly different response in Hong Kong where the government has ordered the Disneyland theme park to close due to rising coronavirus cases.

Hong Kong recorded 52 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, bringing total cases to 1,522. In Florida’s Orange County, home to Disney World, cases rose by 623 to a total of 18,624, the fifth highest outbreak in the state’s counties.

With over 7.5 million residents, Hong Kong has more than five times the population of Orange County.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has called the state’s rise in cases “a blip” and told residents not to be alarmed.

Florida recorded more than 500 deaths this past week, compared with over 300 the prior week. It is one of about two dozen states where deaths have risen in the last seven days compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis.

The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Florida is quickly rising, with over 500 new patients in the past 24 hours raising to 8,000 the number in hospitals, according to a state agency.",[]

“Let me be blunt, too many countries are headed in the wrong direction, the virus remains public enemy number one,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva.

“If basics are not followed, the only way this pandemic is going to go – it is going to get worse and worse and worse.”

Global infections stand at 13 million, according to a Reuters tally, with more than half a million deaths.

Tedros, whose leadership has been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump, said that of 230,000 new cases on Sunday, 80% were from 10 nations, and 50% from just two countries.

The United States and Brazil have been worst hit.

WHO emergencies head Mike Ryan said some places in the Americas may need “limited or geographically focused lockdowns that suppress transmission in specific areas where transmission is frankly out of control.”

He urged countries not to make schools into a political football, saying schools could safely reopen once the virus had been suppressed.

Tedros said the WHO had still not received formal notification of the U.S. pullout announced by Trump. The U.S. president says the WHO pandered to China, where the COVID-19 disease was first detected, at the start of the crisis.

The RCMP said 62-year-old Andre Audet of Boucherville, Que., will appear in court south of Montreal today to face charges of intimidating a justice system participant and advocating genocide.

Cpl. Charles Poirier says the justice system participant Audet is accused of intimidating is the prime minister.

The RCMP says the investigation that began last year found about 100 online posts containing hate, threats or incitement to violence, allegedly made under various pseudonyms, against Muslims and the prime minister.

Audet was originally charged in December with incitement of hatred and wilful promotion of hatred.

Police say a full analysis of the evidence since then led them to add the two new charges, adding it’s the first time someone in Quebec has been charged with advocating genocide following an RCMP investigation.",[]

“She was loaded into the car, and the car disappeared. We cannot find her, she’s not made it to the hospital.”

Hopkinson said it isn’t clear if her appearance was caused by a medical condition or an overdose, and that police have “significant concerns” for the woman’s safety. Officers from neighbouring downtown divisions are actively searching for her, he said.

The car, described as a blue Kia Rio hatchback with a rear-mounted bicycle rack carrying two bikes, was found shortly after 1 p.m. but the woman has still not been located.

Descriptions of both the woman and the suspect were not immediately available.

The expletive-filled encounter went viral pitting a customer and a maskless manager, who was in breach of the state’s health and safety protocol.

Brandon Trotta had his children in the car when he found himself embroiled in the kerfuffle with the DQ staffer who refused to put on a facemask while serving customers.

Statements posted on social media from corporate headquarters confirmed the staffer has been “demoted” and “is being provided additional training.”

According to Storyful, Trotta pulled up to the window to collect the Blizzards he ordered when he spotted an employee working without a mask.

It has been mandated in the state of New York that all restaurant workers during their shift must wear a facemask.

The employee, who was a manager to boot, refused.

“You want me to be a Karen?” the manager, named Deb, asks in the video in referring to the pejorative slang term for an angry, entitled, oft-times racist white woman. “Because I’ll be a Karen, OK?”

Trotta then asked for his money back, prompting Deb to order an employee to give him “his f—ing money.” “Get the f— out of here” and “don’t come back,” she said in slamming the drive-through window shut.

“Put your mask on before you get your employees sick,” he said before pulling away.

The manager can be seen giving him the middle finger through the glass.

Trotta recorded the incident on his smartphone and shared it on Facebook, while tagging Dairy Queen in the post.",[]

ST-APOLLINAIRE — The Sûreté du Québec continued their intensive search Monday for the father of two young girls whose bodies were found Saturday in a small town southwest of Quebec City.

The bodies of Norah and Romy Carpentier, aged 11 and 6, were located in a wooded area in St-Apollinaire, but Martin Carpentier, who is suspected of abducting the girls, remains missing.

The SQ said the focus of their manhunt was an area near where the girls’ bodies were found on the weekend and where police found “pertinent elements” on Sunday.

“The elements that we possess lead us to think Martin Carpentier could still be around the area, or at least be in transit in that area,” said Sgt. Ann Mathieu, an SQ spokesperson.

Police did not specify what the items were, but as the search entered a fifth day, police raised the possibility Carpentier could be unconscious or dead, given the weather conditions and the potential he was injured from a car crash right before his disappearance.

“We can’t rule out the fact that he could be dead,” Mathieu said. “But also, he’s a suspect in our case, so it’s important for us to find Martin Carpentier, because the key to this event is Martin Carpentier.”

Police deployed a helicopter, a drone and police dogs as needed in the search.

The girls were last seen Wednesday and became the subject of an Amber Alert the next day. Police have said the girls and their father are believed to have been in a serious traffic accident on Highway 20 in St-Apollinaire on Wednesday about 9:30 p.m.

Investigators said the car was heading east when it skidded into the median, flipped over and landed on the shoulder on the opposite side of the highway. But police did not find any occupants inside the car when they arrived.

On Sunday, the manhunt for the 44-year-old Carpentier had authorities tightening the search in a thickly wooded area near where the young sisters from Lévis were found.

Residents had helped with the searches until Saturday, but police asked people to stay away from the area Sunday to let officers work.

The case has gripped the attention of the province, especially in the town of just over 6,000 people where it’s playing out and in the family’s hometown of Lévis, across the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital.

The oldest of the sisters, Norah, was a member of a local chapter of the Association de Scouts du Canada — which primarily serves the French-speaking scouting community across the country.

Dominique Moncalis, a spokeswoman for the association, said Martin Carpentier had been a leader with the 128th Groupe Scout de Charny since last September.

It was a brief role, cut short when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of all activities in mid-March.

She said two leaders from the group have established a makeshift memorial inside a small gazebo in an area park, holding a vigil for Romy and Norah on Saturday night and again Sunday morning.

Stuffed animals, flowers and notes of condolence have filled the gazebo, Moncalis said.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault began a Montreal news conference on Monday by offering condolences to the family of the young victims.

“I’m shocked, and I believe all Quebecers are shocked like me,” Legault said adding police will do everything they can to find the father.

Legault also urged anyone who sees family members in difficulty or distress to get help, giving out a number for a parent help line.

“If you have trouble, if you don’t feel (in) control or if you see somebody close to you not being in control, having difficulties, you don’t need to be shy,” he said.

“You have to do something when you see that you’re in trouble before doing something terrible.”",[]

Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. district court in Washington ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to delay four executions the department had scheduled for July and August until further order of the court.

Efforts to resume capital punishment at the federal level were underway within a few months of President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, ending a de facto moratorium that began under his predecessor, Barack Obama, while long-running legal challenges to lethal injections played out in federal courts.

Judge Chutkan has been overseeing cases brought by inmates on death row who argue that the Justice Department’s new one-drug protocol breaks various administrative and drug-control laws and is unconstitutional.

The Justice Department had planned to execute Daniel Lewis Lee on Monday in Terre Haute, Indiana, using lethal injection of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, for his role in the murders of three members of an Arkansas family, including an 8-year-old child, in 1996.

Some relatives of Lee’s victims opposed him receiving the death sentence while his accomplice in the murders, Chevie Kehoe, was sentenced to life in prison.

The department had scheduled two more executions for later in the week and a fourth in August, of Wesley Purkey, Dustin Honken and Keith Nelson, all convicted of murdering children.

The coronavirus pandemic has prevented some of the lawyers of inmates on death row from visiting their clients. At least one employee involved in the executions tested positive for COVID-19, the Justice Department said over the weekend.

On Sunday, an appeals court rejected an argument by some relatives of Lee’s victims, who sued for a delay saying they feared that attending his execution could expose them to the coronavirus.

FEDERAL EXECUTIONS RARE

While Texas, Missouri and other states execute multiple condemned inmates each year, federal executions are rare: only three have occurred since 1963, all from 2001 to 2003, including the 2001 execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

There are currently 62 people on federal death row in Terre Haute.

Opposition to the death penalty has grown in the United States, although 54 percent of Americans said they supported it for people convicted of murder, according to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center.

In announcing the planned resumption of executions, Attorney General William Barr said last year: “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

A European Union ban on selling drugs for use in executions or torture has led to pharmaceutical companies refusing to sell such drugs to U.S. prison systems.

The Justice Department spent much of 2018 and 2019 building a secret supply chain of private companies to make and test its drug of choice, pentobarbital, which replaces the three-drug protocol used in previous executions. Some of the companies involved said they were not aware they were testing execution drugs, a Reuters investigation found last week.

As with Texas and other states, the Justice Department has commissioned a private pharmacy to make the drug.",[]

Mayor Park Won-soon was found dead on Friday; he left a note thanking and apologizing to “everyone.” Police did not give a cause of death but said there was no sign of foul play.

His death came days after a city official who served as Park’s secretary filed a complaint alleging the 64-year-old had sexually harassed her, prompting a police investigation.

A lawyer and rights activists who have helped the former secretary said on Monday that Park had repeatedly made unwanted physical contact with her and sent photos of himself in underwear and lurid text messages.

Reuters was unable to contact a representative of Park’s family. But the representative has issued a statement vowing legal action against those who spread “groundless statements,” without elaborating.

“Acts of forceful sexual harassment continued for four years even after she moved to a different position,” Lee Mi-kyoung, one of the activists, told a news conference. “This is a case that has a victim, and could not be covered up by his death.”

Lee also said the former secretary had reported her case to the city but officials had ignored it. A city spokesman said the report had not yet been verified and no inquiry is planned.

The funeral, hosted by the city government at the city hall and live broadcast online, was limited to around 100 people because of coronavirus concerns.

“Mourning doesn’t necessarily exclude soul-searching, but now is time to mourn,” said Paik Nak-chung, a literary critic who helped lead the funeral.

Hundreds of citizens gathered despite heavy rain near city hall and a park where Park’s body will be cremated, some weeping.

In front of city hall, one man sought to bring attention to the harassment allegations, drawing boos and complaints from supporters, local media footage showed.

Park’s remains will be buried in the southeastern county of Changnyeong, where he was born, city officials said.

As the longest-serving mayor of Seoul, a city of almost 10 million people, since 2011, Park was instrumental in its response to the coronavirus.

An outspoken advocate of women’s rights and gender equality, former activist and lawyer, he was seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in a 2022 election.

A petition filed with the presidential Blue House, urging the funeral to be cancelled over the sexual abuse allegations, gathered more than 560,000 signatures. But a court on Sunday rejected an activist group’s attempt to stop it.",[]

Certified music therapist Miya Adout has been busier than ever during the COVID epidemic, using music to combat the isolation and feelings of anxiety of seniors with dementia and Alzheimer’s.

In fact, two seniors residences in the GTA have continued music therapy with her team of 10 throughout, considering it essential, she told me this past week.

One, coincidentally, happens to be 147 Elder St., where my father is a resident.

Adout said one of her therapists — Carmen Lee — has played her guitar at the bedroom doorways of that facility’s residents, or in the lounge, delivering an individualized repertoire while masked.

“She’s been bringing them a lot of joy … our goal is to help them combat feelings of isolation and loneliness and depression,” said Adout, noting those feelings have “just been amplified” during the pandemic.

Adout, who opened her music therapy business five years ago, plays the guitar, piano and the drums and also sings.

She decided to work with seniors with dementia on the first day of her internship after a dementia patient started tapping her toes, moving her fingers and looking up while she played her music.

“She was completely disengaged prior, but I ended up holding her hand and singing with her,” she said. “I was just so touched that music therapy was able to bring her out in this way.”

She said that at 147 Elder, they really care for the residents’ safety, but they’re also concerned about their mental health and about safeguarding them from depression.

In fact, she said that often, as anxious as a resident may be, they “almost always” let the person with the guitar on their back perform at their rooms.

While a member of her team develops a treatment plan for every resident they work with, most of the time they are performing live music to residents.

“We are often making music with our clients … we’re singing we’re improvising,” she said. “Sometimes, we’re listening to recordings and discussing memories associated with music or reflections on the music. Other times, we’re even songwriting or composing with our clients.”

Their repertoire is always based on a client’s individual preferences, she adds.

“It’s more about what they enjoy listening to and what they remember from their youth,” she said.

For most facilities in lockdown, her team has either provided virtual therapy — such as it has done at Amica at Bronte Harbour — or are starting to do so again with group sessions.

She, or one of her therapists, appear on the senior home’s TV screen through Zoom or Google and get residents who participate to move in their seats or reflect on the music.

Adout says it’s “very common” for residents to get up and dance to the music, or if they’re confined to a wheelchair, tap their toes.

Many try to dance with other residents.

Others, classified as non-verbal and who may not even remember their own names, will begin singing, remembering the words of a particular song.

“Music therapy is very empowering and makes them feel very independent,” she said.

“Once the music begins, we find there’s so much they’re able to do, including speaking and singing.”

Many employees taking home the $2,000 monthly benefit have not been as eager to return to work. Some feel they wouldn’t make much more by returning to work while others are concerned about the health risks of leaving home.

In turn, many employers were left asking themselves: Now that we can reopen, where are our employees? Why won’t they return?

This week, Canada’s Finance Minister Bill Morneau released the nation’s fiscal and economic snapshot.

Despite its intention to the contrary, it contains a warning to all employees. If you are lucky enough to have a job, do not take it for granted and return to work. Continued dependence on the CERB may significantly weaken our job market. Employees feed our economy.

Regarding employment specifically, the fiscal snapshot contained some startling facts:

— A whopping 5.5 million Canadians (about 30% of the workforce) have been laid off, terminated or saw reduced hours because of COVID-19.

— Unemployment hit 13.7% in May; its highest level on record.

— Retail, trade, travel, entertainment, hospitality and tourism — some of which employ a greater proportion of low-wage workers, visible minorities and women — will continue to feel the impact acutely.

— Job postings remain at low levels across the nation compared to previous years.

— The working hours of mothers of young children fell proportionately more than for fathers or mothers of older children.

– Overall, more than 8 million Canadians applied for the CERB.

There are, however, some silver linings.

The report declared that Canada is doing a good job containing the pandemic. As of June 21, the seven-day incidence in daily new cases in Canada has declined by 80% from a staggering 1,730 new cases per day on April 26.

While the peak has passed Canadians, the government still warns the pandemic is far from over. To mitigate the risk, increased spending on testing, tracing and health-care capacity are priorities. This is good for workplaces.

Also, the government is planning to extend the employee wage subsidy program (CEWS) beyond August that was created to provide eligible employers with relief of up to 75% of employee compensation. While we don’t know how long the CEWS will run for, we do know the government is placing more control back into the hands of employers to create new jobs, support existing jobs and recall employees to work as soon as possible.

This fiscal snapshot is only a projection.

Forecasting is a challenge in a pandemic environment. The only sure thing is that this snapshot is a harbinger of things to come if employees don’t heed the call to action. The health of our economy is tied to employment. When employers and employees work together, only then will our job market improve.

On to your weekly COVID-19 workplace questions:

I work in Toronto and now my employer says I have to wear a mask when I didn’t have to before. Is my employer allowed to make me wear a mask?

The City of Toronto mandated the wearing of a mask or face coverings in an enclosed public space starting July 7. This includes:

– retail stores

– convenience stores

– malls, shopping plazas

– grocery stores, bakeries, farmer’s markets (enclosed areas)

– restaurants, bars (when permitted to open for indoor service)

– indoor recreational facilities, gyms, swimming pools (when permitted to open)

– libraries

– community centres

– community service agencies

– personal service settings

– churches, mosque, synagogue, temples and faith settings

– art galleries, museums, aquariums, zoos

– banquet halls, convention centres, arenas, stadiums, and other event spaces

– real estate facilities such as open houses, presentation centres

– common areas in hotels, motels and short-term rentals (e.g. lobbies, elevators, meeting rooms)

– entertainment facilities, including concert venues, theatres, cinemas, casinos

– business offices open to the public

You may be exempt if you cannot wear a mask for medical reasons. Otherwise, if you fall into a category above, you will have to wear one for the time being and can remove it for practical reasons like eating, drinking, etc.

I have worked for the same company for 36 years. Some weeks ago, the owner laid me off for “lack of work.” I applied for EI and was switched over to CERB. I found out last week that my employer has sold the company, did not tell anyone she was doing this and after 36 years I walk out the door with nothing. How do I claim severance?

If the shares of the company were sold, you would continue to be employed by the new owner. If only the assets were sold, you may already be terminated. Contact your employer right away to determine if you have a job to return to. If you hear nothing, I would suggest getting a lawyer involved to help you. Time is of the essence.

Is Mother Nature mad at us? Is COVID-19 clearing the way for animals to take over?

No. Appearances (and bears in Markham) notwithstanding, animal behaviour has not changed much. According to the University of Waterloo’s Dr. Michael Drescher, what’s changed is us.

Drescher says anyone lucky enough to be living near green space during the pandemic is likely paying a lot more attention to the natural world around them than in the past.

“When there is less traffic and less industrial activity, animals are fairly quick to respond to these opportunities and right now they have the chance to explore other habitats,” he said.

But no, there aren’t more wild animals turning up in urban areas.

“It’s really just that people are looking more,” Drescher said.

That’s a good thing. A new survey conducted in early June by Pollara Strategic Insights (for the International Boreal Conservation Campaign and the Indigenous Leadership Initiative) shows a majority of Canadians consider protecting nature and wildlife a priority for the government.

They also see conservation as part of building a better economy.

More than 3,000 adult Canadians were included in the poll and most said they had spent more time interacting with nature since the pandemic began.

Interacting with nature is Drescher’s work, so he knows all about that. His area of expertise includes animal behaviour and forest ecology and he investigates how things are slowly altered by climate change.

Like what?

The insect world offers some interesting examples, said Drescher.

So, never mind about tigers in Tillsonburg — turns out ticks are way scarier. They carry Lyme Disease.

“People do now have to worry about getting a tick bite,” he said. “A few decades ago, it was unheard of.”

Deer are likely involved.

“Ticks have a variety of hosts,” said Drescher. “The hypothesis is that with less-harsh winters, deer survive better and their populations increase and they can move further north. The ticks also can survive in this environment.”

Ticks can transmit Babesia, a parasite that can cause malaria-like symptoms and much worse; they can also transmit the rare viral disorder Colorado Tick Fever and the bacterial Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Untreated, Lyme itself is an insidious disease that can attack the organs and the joints.

Drescher actually had two tick-bite encounters while he did the field work for his Ph.D. in South Africa.

“So you learn to take it seriously,” he said.

He cautions people not to pull out a tick that’s securely attached. Don’t try the old lighted match trick, either, in an attempt to get the insect to withdraw. That can backfire, potentially putting even more pathogens into your body. Use tweezers or see a doctor.

Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants (tucked into your socks) if you’re going to be walking in ravines or forests. And check your body afterward for ticks.

If you have a pet that goes outside, your vet has probably spoken to you about ticks in southern Ontario. If not, you need a new vet.

Many worrying diseases are insect born, Drescher reminds us — Zika and West Nile Virus, for example. In the spirit of telling scary nature stories, he also describes Chagas disease, which involves blood-sucking bugs and their feces. Gross!

Wild tales aside, human engagement with the natural world involves a simple but crucial reciprocity, said Drescher.

“We affect the environment,” he added. “And the environment affects us.”",[]

Compared to late-April’s benchmark lows, system ridership has increased 45%, said TTC CEO Richard Leary in his monthly report to commissioners.

“The TTC has an important role to play in the economic restart and recovery from COVID-19,” wrote Leary in his report, on the agenda for Tuesday’s board meeting.

“Since the city has started to reopen, we’ve seen ridership increase — primarily in our bus ridership to this point.”

Indeed, weekday bus boardings the past week surpassed subways by 225,000, with the report showing 550,000 passengers riding buses compared to just 330,000 underground.

“While the subway remains the backbone of the system, our bus fleet has shown during this pandemic what we’ve always known to be true — that it’s the real workhorse in the TTC network,” he wrote.

As the city transitioned into its second stage of pandemic recovery, the TTC relaxed its COVID-19 protection measures on July 2 — again allowing riders to board buses via the front door, and resumed collection of cash, ticket and token fares, as well as paper transfers.

While more people were riding buses, the subway system saw the steepest growth compared to surface routes — up 58% from the April 26 to May 6, 2020 baseline.

The comparatively robust bus ridership increased 39% across the same time period, and streetcar boardings increased by 36%.

Buses have been top-of-mind by both those at TTC headquarters and city hall.

Last week, Mayor John Tory unveiled the first leg of a five-part plan to roll out bus priority lanes across some of the city’s most congested surface routes.

Starting with an 8.5-kilometre stretch along Eglinton Ave. E., Kingston Rd. and Morningside Ave., in Scarborough, the lanes will maintain increasing ridership numbers across fewer vehicles.

Between May 3 and May 30, the TTC served 6,529,000 riders — an average of 1.6-million per week.

That’s nearly 34-million below the 2020 budget of 40.5-million rides for the same time period, and 33-million below last year.

Year-to-date, ridership trails far behind budget — 130-million rides so far in 2020 compared to an expected 217-million, and 85-million fewer than 2019.

Reduced monthly pass and child travel equated to about six million lost rides, the report reads.

In May, TTC CFO Josie La Vita said COVID-19 related revenue losses and cost overruns are causing a $92-million per month shortfall — with the service standing to lose up to $520 million between then and Labour Day.

“Ridership is expected to rise, but marginally as the city remains in a state of emergency,” the report reads. “Even after the emergency measures are lifted, it is expected that ridership will take time to recover to its pre-COVID-19 levels.”

TTC staff assaults, threats on the rise

Offences against TTC operators and staff members increased in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year.

Between Jan. 1 and March 31, offences against transit workers increased 20% compared to Q4 2019, and is up 27% from the same period last year.

According to the CEO’s report set to be presented before Tuesday’s TTC board meeting, there were 203 offences against staff in Q1 2020, or 5.38 offences per 100 employees.

The increase, said the report, was seen across all crime types — with threats and assaults seeing the biggest jump.",[]

There were two separate incidents of gunfire, including one at 10:45 p.m. that left two victims with wounds in the Islington Ave.-Lakeshore Blvd. area.

“Multiple shots were heard and the injuries are serious,” police spokesperson Edward Parks said Sunday.

Police say three suspects fled the scene in a black four-door sedan.

In another shooting at Lansdowne Ave. and Bloor St., two men suffered wounds around 4 a.m. on Sunday.

“This was a drive-by shooting and six to eight shots were fired,” Parks said.

Paramedics transported the men to hospital in serious condition.

There is no suspect or vehicle information.

It has been a violent weekend in the city.

Two children, ages one and four, were rushed to hospital after a stabbing in the city’s west end on Saturday.

Paramedics responded to the stabbing call in an apartment at a building near Finch Ave. and Weston Rd. around 10:15 a.m.

Their mother was taken into custody

Five people were injured in a brazen drive-by shooting Friday night in the city’s west end Friday evening.

Police say the gunfire erupted near Jane St. and Woolner Ave., north of St. Clair Ave., around 10:20 p.m.

It’s believed two people opened fire from a grey sedan.

“They were just indiscriminately shooting at individuals in this area,” Insp. Norm Proctor told reporters at the scene. “It’s completely reckless.”

A man was seriously injured by gunfire at the Scarborough Town Centre Friday afternoon.

Police received multiple calls just after 2 p.m. regarding the shooting outside the mall southwest of McCowan Rd. and Hwy. 401.

One man was killed and another injured by gunfire in Hamilton Friday night

Hamilton Police say the murder happened in the southbound lanes of Red Hill Valley Pkwy., near King St., around 10 p.m.

With the pandemic’s sudden arrival, scores of people found themselves abruptly out of work. In an expensive city like Toronto, those already on the edge and barely scraping by were hit the hardest.

In the heavy days following the emergency declaration — when the reality of what was before us was only just beginning to sink in — the emails didn’t stop coming.

In these “unprecedented times,” banks, cell phone providers, car companies, even utility companies were coming out of the woodwork to declare their solidarity and support by adjusting rates, waiving late-payment fees and offering deferral options. It’s not an exaggeration to say that fear and uncertainty were everywhere, even for those of us with secure jobs and savings to sustain us.

All levels of government were scrambling to figure out how to cushion the blow.

For those living paycheck-to-paycheck while employed in fields and industries effectively shuttered until further notice, the shutdown was disastrous.

On March 26 when asked what he would say to Ontarians worrying about how they’d make rent in a few days, Premier Doug Ford said this: “If you have a choice between putting food on your table or paying rent, you’re putting food on your table. The government of Ontario will make sure that no one gets evicted. We stand by that and we’re gonna make sure we take care of those people.”

And with that came a provincial moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent. Problem solved?

Well, no. Not if you’re an out-of-work tenant, grateful for the temporary relief but wondering how on earth you will be able to pay rent without income, let alone begin to face the months of accrued back-rent once the moratorium is lifted.

Certainly not if you’re a landlord being asked to work in good faith with your tenants to land on a payment plan, while simultaneously having to wonder if the tenant in question is truly unable to pay or simply feels they shouldn’t have to. After all, your overhead and operating expenses remain the same.

An impending crisis was plainly identified, but in the months that followed a true solution never materialized. As government stimulus money flowed and the Canada’s Emergency Relief Benefit cheques rolled out, presumably the thinking was that besieged tenants could now keep up but that presupposes that everyone qualified, and that there weren’t other expenses — food, medicine, family needing emergency assistance — that took precedence.

An important additional layer to all of this is the fact that the data shows that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Toronto’s low-income Black communities in the northwest corner of the city, many of the very same communities already historically overrepresented in the eviction applications presented to the Landlord Tenant Board. Particularly in light of the current societal reckoning drawing our awareness to the insidious nature of institutionalized racism, this connection cannot be ignored.

So, what now?

Well, for starters, Bill 134, the “Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act,” already in the works prior to the pandemic, is on the verge of coming into effect and that could well be the match that lights this powder keg.

Purportedly designed to address the significant backlog at the Landlord Tenant Board by streamlining and expediting the hearing process, tenants’ rights advocates are ringing the alarm that things are about to get even worse for the already vulnerable.

Among a number of changes intended to introduce efficiencies, most relevant is that any tenant who defaults on a payment arrangement could face immediate eviction without a hearing. So, in practical terms, what that means is that the tenant who fell behind in April but promised to catch up in June — when we all assumed life would have surely returned to some form of normalcy — has no mechanism available to them to facilitate revisiting that payment arrangement. If they fail to honour it by even a few dollars, they can be out on the street.

On the flip side, landlords are not all faceless corporate entities — just as many are smaller-scale investors who might own a few condos as long-term investments which they lease out to offset the carrying costs. They are likely already feeling the impacts of the “COVID recession” and not receiving that rent could be equally damaging.

Recognizing that the stakes are incredibly high, with homelessness already a crisis in our city, it is critical that the same government who identified the moral imperative to freeze evictions and protect its citizens from the economic fallout of a global pandemic now sees it through.

Hitting pause wasn’t enough. We need a solution.

As we all brace for the distinct possibility of a second wave come fall, it seems obvious that if the solution is to stay safe and stay home, doing all we can to keep people in their homes is paramount.

So Toronto family law firm Shulman & Partners LLP, which has experienced a 40% rise in people seeking to split from their spouses since pre-COVID-19, are recommending out-of-court settlements through arbitration and mediation.

“For me as a lawyer, court is always the last resort,” says Diana Isaac, a partner at Shulman & Partners LLP, and a 10-year veteran of practising family law.

“We always try to settle matters and negotiate them because it’s more cost-effective, it’s less emotionally draining for people, and it’s lot more expedient. So talking about mediation, arbitration, as we call it, an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, works really well for people who a) want this done quickly and b) with you may not be very far apart in your positions. So if we want to maintain the matter and we want to have good faith discussions and some sort of resolution, mediation is a great option. And a lot of people are gravitating towards this because it’s also private. It’s not in the public realm where your information is put into a court system.”

Isaac says Shulman & Partners’s top-five pieces of advice to resolving a divorce or separation outside of court are:

— Remember the pandemic: “These are unprecedented times. We appreciate that changes in the parenting schedule or the financial situation will be temporary and they may be short-lived.”

— Be flexible: “I think in order to keep conflict down and to avoid increased legal costs we have to come up with a solution that makes sense for both parties. So if someone has lost their job during the pandemic, it may make sense to have some sort of temporary arrangement in the interim rather than going to court and saying, ‘I insist that the status quo be maintained.”

— Choose your lawyer wisely: “Having a good fit with that individual is important. Someone that matches and is able to understand what’s important to you. What are your goals and what are your expectations? I think that makes a real difference.”

— Keeping an open mind: “No matter what the situation but especially during a pandemic. And that sometimes coming up with a solution and avoiding court may be a win-win situation. Sometimes in court there’s a winner and a loser but at that point, people are emotionally drained, people have expended significant funds.”

— Talk to each other: “Communication is so pivotal in cases. And I think more and more it’s important. Yes, we are physical distancing, but I think the communication with your partner is very important at this time. Keep each other apprised as to child-related issues is very important and doing it in a way that is respected, that is civil, and in cases involving children, are child-oriented, is very important. Not adding adult conflict and being civil will take you a long way in these times.”",[]

Unfortunately, this requires naming the involved songs — Tears Are Not Enough; We Are The World — so get ready for weeks of ear-worm.

One or both tunes will now play non-stop in your head for a month.

Sorry.

Those songs and the resultant albums, music videos and documentaries ensured that for all of 1985 these charitable supergroups hogged the headlines.

The Americans went first, recording We Are The World in January of 1985.

The gathering of top recording artists, calling themselves USA for Africa, was an initiative to raise money for famine relief; included were Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Ray Charles, Bill Joel, Willie Nelson and dozens of others.

We Are The World was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian.

Also at the U.S. recording session was Bob Geldof, who had spearheaded the British gathering that got the ball rolling. In late 1984, Geldof corralled a who’s who of U.K. artists to do a benefit recording for famine relief in Ethiopia.

The large group, which called itself Band Aid, included the usual suspects: Bono, Sting, Boy George, various Duran Duran, Boomtown Rats and Spandau Ballet members, George Michael, Phil Collins, etc.

Other big names — David Bowie and Paul McCartney, for example — couldn’t attend the recording session but added messages later.

Geldof and Midge Ure wrote Do They Know It’s Christmas, got it recorded and released it in December 1984. The song made millions for famine relief.

Harry Belafonte then got a similar project started in the U.S. and it eventually became USA for Africa and We Are The World.

What it was like to wrangle all those superstars at once in an all-night session? Quincy Jones uses the phrase, “Like running through hell with gasoline drawers on,” in an excellent recent Rolling Stone story about the events of 35 years ago.

About two weeks after the American session, the Canadians had their turn.

It was a less fraught undertaking — politeness is our national identity — held at Toronto’s Manta Sound on Sunday, Feb. 10.

Produced by David (“I’ve been an a**hole a lot,”) Foster, the single was written by Foster and Bryan Adams and about 50 well-known Canadian artists got together to sing it.

The wildest part about looking at the recording session now is seeing how young everyone is — Gordon Lightfoot, Anne Murray, Burton Cummings, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Hawkins. Corey Hart looks like a baby.

(Having been at that session, one memory that stands out is Anne Murray singing her solo line. She was note-perfect on the first take and people were impressed.

Everyone: Wow!l

Anne Murray: Oh, pshaw.)

The musicians seem to have been grouped, inadvertently or otherwise, according to a fame pecking order that to them must have felt a lot like being back in high school.

Gordon Lightfoot had the honour of singing the first line. If they were making this thing today, that probably wouldn’t change.

The passage of time has altered other reputations, though, and mostly in the burnishing; Joni Mitchell and Neil Young were already big stars, for example, but neither had achieved sainthood yet.

Context? Drake and Justin Bieber weren’t born yet. Neither was Taylor Swift. NWA was three years away from releasing a first album. The Tragically Hip was four years away from their first album. Beyonce was a toddler. There was no internet. Home computers were rare. A few people had car phones but otherwise there were no cell phones. Imagine getting all those famous folk to show up using land lines.

It was an amazing bit of cooperation and coming together for charity. As Geddy Lee said at the time, “It’s 50 lead singers pretending they’re a chorus.”

The end result was a lot of money for charity.

Could such a collegial event ever happen today?

The news was predictably grim.

According to forecasts, all provinces will run large deficits this year. And Ontario’s deficit this year (relative to the size of the provincial economy) will be larger than at any point in the last 25 years.

When the COVID public health and economic crisis ends, the Ford government will face an even worse fiscal situation than when they took office. How bad is Ontario’s fiscal outlook?

The Ford government published its budget in mid-March, forecasting a $20.5-billion deficit, the largest nominal deficit in provincial history. Unfortunately, that was overly optimistic. Now, according to new forecasts, the government will collect about $5 billion less.

The government’s fiscal plan, however, included substantial contingencies (an accounting buffer), which would partially offset lower-than-forecasted revenues. Subsequently, RBC Economics now estimates Ontario’s deficit could exceed $21 billion this year.

With its buffer gone, any further bad news on the revenue side — or additional unplanned spending — will cause Ontario’s deficit to grow even larger. But the bad news just keeps coming.

In addition to a larger deficit, Ontario potentially faces a steep recession. According to recent forecasts, Ontario’s economy will shrink 4.2% this year. These two factors combined — a large deficit and a recession — mean Ontario’s long-standing fiscal mess will quickly get much worse.

Consider this: Ontario’s debt-to-GDP ratio (the best measure of debt sustainability) is forecasted to grow from 40% to 46%, the highest level in provincial history.

These problems can’t be solved overnight, especially during a pandemic and recession. The Ford government’s top priority should be helping the province weather the COVID public health and economic crises. However, once these have passed, Ontario’s government must exercise fiscal discipline — for a long time — to repair the damage.

Which raises the key question: Will the Ford government actually do the hard work to reduce Ontario’s debt burden when the recession ends? Only time will tell. But if it does, Ontarians will see a marked change from the policies of this government’s predecessors.

In the years following the 2008-09 recession, when Ontario’s deficit ballooned, the McGuinty and Wynne governments allowed large deficits to persist, which caused government debt to accumulate quickly. In the wake of today’s recession, to not repeat recent history, the Ford government must take active steps to reform and reduce government spending.

If, however, the Ford government — like its predecessors — continues to steadily increase nominal spending while hoping for larger revenue gains to shrink the deficit, it will likely produce similar results, namely more red ink.

The Ford government is not responsible for the current recession nor its effects on provincial finances. Still, once the recession is over, it will be the Ford government’s responsibility to clean up the mess. Doing this — quickly — will help the province prosper in the long-run and will reduce the size of the debt burden to be passed along to future generations of Ontarians.

If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s latest legislation against assault weapons really is the first salvo in a campaign to take away every last gun, then you’re on your own.

When Toronto Mayor John Tory and his Calgary counterpart, Nahead Nenshi, ban shooting ranges, it’s your fight.

It wasn’t always this way.

If I am to be labeled a “liberal,” then I was one of the rare ones willing to stand by you. I live in possibly the greatest concentration of left leaners in the country.

I am a bike riding, Chardonnay swilling, Toronto downtowner. I have also spent the last 20 years of my career writing and radio broadcasting and I have always defended the rights of gun owners. No more.

I’m done with your hectoring and condescension. I’m through with your paranoia.

I don’t need to be lectured on a constitutional amendment from another country. The fact that I don’t own a gun is immaterial. That I live in an urban setting doesn’t mean I don’t understand a farmer’s need for a firearm for pest control.

I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don't know why anyone needs automatic weapons. — John Moore (@MooreintheAM) May 1, 2020

I also don’t need the patronizing reminders about how it’s not “a weapon.”

This new indifference stems from a tweet I posted on May 1 that read: “I support gun rights for hunters and target shooters. I don’t know why anyone needs automatic weapons.”

A pretty rare endorsement from a guy who lives in the most liberal North American city outside of San Francisco.

But this brought on such a torrent of abusive tweets my Twitter feed started to look like one of the screens from the Matrix.

Many dwelled on my use of the word “automatic” with tart dispositions about the intricacies of different guns. Ok, I get it. I should have said “assault.”

I don’t have a PhD in guns but you likely don’t have a degree in economics and yet I’m sure you have views on the federal budget.

NO small number of people said “automatic” guns are already banned in Canada. In which case, why the outrage? If Trudeau and Blair are banning something that is already banned, let’s all go back to bed.

I’ll set aside those who called me a “libtard.”

I may not be an expert in guns but I have fired one. I have a policy of trying pretty well everything and if I was going to talk about guns on my radio show (which is in a city where the mayor wants to ban ALL guns), then I thought I should go to a gun range.

My friend, Becky Coles, and her father, John, took me to an indoor range. They taught me to load the magazine of a CZ 75 Compact.

John instructed me on aiming, trigger pressure and recoil. I fired maybe 100 shots. Like most first-timers, I had some good luck. I get that the skill and the thrill are in replicating the good shots.

It was not an experience I care to repeat. I’m just not a gun person. Becky and John have no interest in my hobbies of cycling and golfing.

But that’s the difference. I understand that target shooting is a hobby not a personality disorder. I support hunting (so long as you eat what you kill). I’m not one of those urban snobs who calls gun owners “nutters” or wants to ban ranges or compel people to store their weapons at the range (like many, John and Becky go to different ones).

I do want sensible gun laws. As a matter of fact, even an overwhelming majority of gun owners have few issues with gun storage and transportation laws. They know they reduce the incidence of suicide, accidents and guns falling into criminal hands.

Perhaps, the cohort of angry gun owners is small. I can’t tell. But I don’t need their stress-inducing insults and tirades.

Gun owners, you had an ally but you’re on your own now.

So please, bring on the recession… Sorry if that hurts people but it’s either root for a recession or you lose your democracy… I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.”

MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace said: “There is something both tragic, and pathetic, and ironic about the fact that it took a, you know, colour-blind, gender-blind, you know, state-line-blind virus to sort of have all of the president’s sins from his first three years catch up with him. You can’t stand there and lie… And I wonder what you think about whether or not there’s some silver lining there, that some of the things that, that we’ve been talking about for three years may be finally catching up with him?”

“Silver lining”?

The anti-Trump narrative, of course, is that he botched the handling of this crisis, and that but for his inattentiveness, America would not have over 1 million coronavirus cases. This means the worse things get, the greater the chance of Trump’s defeat in November.

This perhaps explains the math of Wallace’s MSNBC colleague, Rachel Maddow. Maddow, on April 21, said: “These are the top five largest outbreaks on Earth. Number five is Germany, with just under 150,000 cases as of today. Number four is France, just under 160,000 cases. Number three is Italy. Number two is Spain with just over 200,000 cases. And then there’s us — USA. USA, biggest outbreak in the world, with over 800,000 cases now. We have more coronavirus cases than all of the other top five countries combined.”

First, does anyone really believe the number is coming out of China, a nation of nearly 1.5 billion and where the outbreak started? The Chinese government lied repeatedly about the origin of the virus, about its transmissibility and, no doubt, about its number of cases.

Second, as of April 21, 2020, the total of the next five countries exceeded our number. The number of confirmed cases, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, was as follows: Spain 200,210; Italy 181,228; France 155,383; Germany 146,653; and the United Kingdom 124,743. That comes to 808,217, versus the USA at 786,566.

Third, how about a little perspective? Spain had 207,634 cases, versus our 931,698 cases. But its population is 47 million. Ours is 330 million, or seven times bigger. Multiply Spain’s number times seven, and that would be over 1.4 million, making Spain’s numbers, when adjusted for population, far worse than America’s. Likewise, Italy’s population is 60 million, making the U.S. population 5.5 times bigger. Multiply Italy’s 181,228 coronavirus cases by 5.5, and that comes to almost 1 million cases, making Italy worse than we were.

What about deaths? As of that date, the total deaths of the five most stricken countries outside the U.S. comes to 86,446, versus our 42,201.

What is it with Democrats, the left-wing media and arithmetic? Joe Biden once talked about President Barack Obama’s “three-letter” program, “Jobs. J.O.B.S.” During one of the Democratic debates, Biden said: “150 million people have been killed since 2007, when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.”

“150 million”? That’s nearly half the population of America.

And consider MSNBC’s Brian Williams’ analysis of Mike Bloomberg giving every American $1 million, rather than spending $500 million to get elected president. Williams, with a New York Times reporter nodding at his side, said: “When I read (this tweet) tonight on social media, it kind of all became clear. ‘Bloomberg spent $500 million on ads. U.S. population, 327 million.’ Don’t tell us if you’re ahead of us on the math. ‘He could have given each American $1 million and have had lunch money left over.’ It’s an incredible way of putting it.” Actually, Bloomberg’s $500 million, at $1 million per American, would have gifted exactly 500 of us.

The country is facing a pandemic that has, so far, killed about 60,000 Americans, with many experts expecting a vaccine a year to 18 months from now, if then. But rest assured, say the Trump-haters, the sacrifice the sick and the dead have made were not in vain. There is a “silver lining.” Trump may go down in November.

So, raise a glass.

Much more than a statistic, that total represents mothers, fathers, grandparents and children.

Every single one of those lives has a story to tell and hopefully, someone left behind to tell it for them.

Yet in battling this deadly pandemic, statistics are important and having the right information is key to stopping future fatalities and ultimately stopping the spread of the virus until we have a vaccine.

So, do we have the right data?

The real answer is that we have the best data available to us, but it is far from complete and far from uniform.

Each province has determined its own way to count COVID-19 deaths and even within provinces –such as Ontario with 34 individual health units — what information is provided is not always complete.

My decision to look into this came after a revealing tweet from Toronto Public Health. From the beginning of the pandemic, I’ve heard claims that COVID death counts include people who died with the coronavirus in their system but not necessarily from COVID-19.

“Individuals who have died with COVID-19, but not as a result of COVID-19 are included in the case counts for COVID-19 deaths in Toronto,” TPH tweeted in reply to a question on the issue.

To me that sounds like we may be inflating our COVID-19 death count. Was this the case across Ontario? Was this the case across Canada?

I reached out to local public health units across Ontario and found out that was the case; someone who was infected when they died was considered a COVID death even if they may have died of another cause.

“A death that occurs in an active case of COVID-19 is counted as a COVID-19 death. COVID-19 cases marked as fatal are included in the public health reporting databases whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death,” said Public Health Ontario.

What about other provinces?

In addition to those in Ontario, I reached out to officials in Quebec — the province hardest hit –Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.

All but Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan got back to me with the rationale for their individual provincial decisions. With 63 deaths, Nova Scotia has the highest death count in Atlantic Canada, Saskatchewan suffered a total of 15 deaths.

The actions of provinces and territories with the lowest death counts would be negligible in looking into this matter. Newfoundland and Labrador recorded just three deaths, New Brunswick two and Prince Edward Island and the territories have none.

In the other provinces that responded, every single one will record a death if the person died while still infected with COVID-19. Quebec’s health ministry went so far as to say health officials in that province would count a COVID death on someone who had not been tested.

A spokesperson for the Quebec health ministry told be via email that a COVID death was possible if, “the person had clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 before his death without having had a test to confirm COVID-19.”

Each province may vary slightly in how they word their policy but it boils down to the same end result: COVID-19 doesn’t need to be present for a COVID death to be added to the count. Outside of trauma or some other unnatural cause, the infected person is marked as dying from the virus.

Only Alberta, home to 160 COVID deaths as of this weekend, told me that they have and will remove deaths if a different cause is found.

“If there is any question, we count the case as a COVID-19 death and then have the death certificate and file reviewed,” an Alberta health official told me.

So far Alberta has removed five deaths from their COVID count after review.

Are we counting people who should not be counted as having died from COVID-19?

That may be happening but as one Ontario health official told me, the province wanted to be as forthcoming as possible when reporting public numbers. Deaths that occur due to natural causes at a person’s home or even a nursing home are not reviewed by the coroner’s office.

Determining exactly which illness resulted in the death would be difficult and Ontario, like the other provinces, decided it would rather be accused of over-reporting after the fact than accused of downplaying the number of deaths from a very serious virus.

So what percentage of COVID-19 deaths could possibly be due to a different factor?

According to an Ontario study of all cases between January 15 and May 15, 36.8% of all COVID-19 deaths in the province had at least one comorbidity or underlying condition. The most common of which was cardiovascular disease at 19.5%.

People skeptical of any government numbers surrounding the coronavirus will be quick to jump up and say, “See, they died of a heart attack, not this fake virus!”

Not so fast.

Someone with a heart condition may have had a heart attack but health officials stress that COVID-19 puts enormous stress on the system of someone already dealing with cardiovascular issues. At that point, the virus did contribute to the death by bringing on the heart attack.

“We are never going to be precise in the COVID death toll, but the inability to monitor death by cause in real time in Canada has emerged as an important gap in our public health information systems,” said Dr. Fisman, an epidemiologist with the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto.

Fisman believes that we may be missing COVID deaths due to a lack of testing.

“Misclassification likely still represents an undercount due to people dying with or from COVID without testing,” Dr. Fisman said.

One of the metrics that he and other scientists are turning to is excess mortality, looking at how many more people died this year compared to past years.

“Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta all recorded some degree of excess mortality in the weeks since March 11, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic,” Statistics Canada said on June 19.

The study looked at deaths up until May 2 but did not include any data from Ontario because it was not available at the time.

Bottom line, we won’t know the exact death count from COVID-19, knowing those who died with it versus those who died from it, due to a lack of data. The idea, though, that health officials are falsely boosting the numbers in Canada isn’t borne out.

Determining exactly why someone with one or more underlying conditions died while infected with COVID-19 is a difficult task, made more difficult by how the virus adds stress to an already ill person. What we have is the best information available to us at the time.

Perhaps we could improve our data collection for the future, but that is another discussion completely.

How the provinces define a COVID-19 death

Quebec

In Quebec, COVID deaths are compiled for anyone who dies when they are considered infected with COVID, regardless of whether that person may have preexisting conditions.

Two types of “COVID deaths” are possible: The deceased had received a positive result from COVID-19 before his death; or the person had clinical manifestations compatible with COVID-19 before his death without having had a test to confirm COVID-19

Ontario

A death that occurs in an active case of COVID-19 is counted as a COVID-19 death. COVID-19 cases marked as fatal are included in public health reporting databases whether or not COVID-19 was determined to be a contributing or underlying cause of death.

Manitoba

A COVID death is counted if it results from a clinically compatible illness, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to the virus (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from COVID-19 between illness and death.

Alberta

Alberta counts a COVID death when a person is diagnosed with COVID-19 or if COVID-19 is considered as a contributing cause of death. If there is any question, health officials count the case as a COVID-19 death and then have the death certificate and file reviewed (this is why we sometimes remove announced deaths after the fact).

British Columbia

British Columbia counts COVID deaths in individuals who have been diagnosed with the virus and die during the course of their illness.

Deaths that are unnatural or sudden and unexpected must be reported to a coroner in B.C., but this does not typically include deaths from known disease or natural occurrences.

That said, if the cause of death cannot be reasonably established through examination of the body, scene and history, additional post-mortem investigations will be undertaken.

How Canada compares to other countries

The 8,773 deaths Canada has suffered puts us at the 14th highest death count in the world, just slightly behind 13th placed Germany (9,070 deaths), but well ahead of 15th placed Chile (6,818 deaths). When looked at as deaths per 100,000 of population, Canada falls to 17th place (23.79 deaths per 100,000). That compares to tiny San Marino in first place (124.3 deaths per 100,00), while Britain captured fourth spot (67.5 deaths per 100,000) and the United States came in ninth (41.2 deaths per 100,000).

The Ontario government has already banned dancing and singing on patios, and a source said it’s still undecided on whether dance club-style bars will be allowed to reopen with most other businesses in Stage 3 of the economic recovery plan.

At this point, it’s expected that bars that also offer food service will be part of Stage 3, a phase Premier Doug Ford hinted could come shortly.

But even if the province green lights a return to pubs or clubs, local municipal public health officials could still say no.

Dr. Vinita Dubey, Toronto’s Associate Medical Officer of Health, said the city has helped restaurants and bars expand their outdoor spaces where possible, as COVID-19 is known to spread more easily indoors for reasons such as difficulty maintaining physical distancing, less ventilation and higher risk of contamination on surfaces.

“While COVID-19 case numbers have decreased in Toronto, new infections are still being reported each day,” Dr. Dubey said in an email. “We are seeing more younger adults getting COVID-19 compared to earlier in the outbreak when there were many residents in long-term care homes who were getting COVID-19. This means we still need to be careful. This point is made very clear in the experiences of other jurisdictions.”

Yes, very clear.

Quebec allowed its bars to reopen in late June, but this week imposed new restrictions and threatened to close them again after dozens of COVID-19 cases were linked to watering holes.

As of Friday, Quebec imposed new restrictions on bars — no dancing, no drinking standing up and a midnight last call which is three hours earlier than normal.

Nightclubs and bars across the United States reopened to the public only to be told to shutter their doors as COVID-19 cases soared.

Emily Hogeveen, a spokesperson for Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips, said in an email that venues for large public gatherings such as night clubs continue to be restricted under Stage 2 of the ‘Framework for Reopening Our Province.’

Restaurants and bars were allowed to operate outdoor patios as part of the current Stage 2 provided they follow guidelines such as mandatory reservations and spacing between tables, she said.

“Based on public health advice and the best practices and lessons learned from Stage 2, Stage 3 will focus on reopening the remaining workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually lifting restrictions,” Hogeveen said. “Public health measures and workplace safety guidance will remain in place and available.”

The Ontario government has yet to say definitively what will reopen in Stage 3, and the reclosing or tightening up of bars in other jurisdictions is likely to give province public health officials pause.

“We just want to be cautious,” Ford said Friday. “But eventually we have to open up the bars. We have to open up restaurants inside. We have to get people back to work.”

Tony Elenis, president and CEO of the Ontario Restaurant Hotel and Motel Association (ORHMA), said the hospitality industry believes it’s ready for a return of customers.

The sector expects there will be special restrictions on bars — customers won’t be allowed to drink standing up or congregate around the bar.

When patios were reopened, live music wasn’t allowed because of the possibility of airborne droplets from the singing but also due to the tendency of patrons to get closer to each other to talk, he said.

Bars should have their own set of safety rules, but operators are capable of implementing them, he said.

For instance, large bars typically have security guards at the door, he said.

Restaurants, hotels and bars have taken a large financial hit, he said.

“Looking around, it is the last hospitality concept along with large concerts that seems to open,” Elenis said. “All we’re saying is that the industry is ready to open, and it’s ready to open with safety in mind.

“The frightening thing, and the worrisome thing, is that as the crisis stabilizes, and the economy stabilizes and starts to show growth, the hospitality industry is not — the restaurants are not, the bars are not — and that’s the issue,” he said.

Halton Regional Police say gunfire erupted in a plaza at 484 Plains Rd. E., west of King Rd., just after 1 p.m.

Officers arrived at the scene and located one man dead and a second victim injured.

The injured person, whose identity has not been released, was taken to the hospital for treatment.

The dead man has been identified by police as Pasquale “Pat” Musitano, 52, of Hamilton.

A longtime fixture of Ontario’s crime underworld, Pat Musitano was nearly killed on April 25, 2019, when he was shot four times — including once in the head — as he left his lawyer’s office in Mississauga around 7 a.m.

He spent nearly two weeks in hospital recovering from critical injuries.

But months before that shooting, journalist and longtime Mafia observer James Dubro told the Toronto Sun he believed Pat Musitano’s days were numbered.

“His career has been very violent and undiplomatic, even for a Mafia boss,” Dubro said. “He’s been a marked man and has been finished as an effective ‘Ndrangheta cell leader in Hamilton and the GTA for some time.”

Pat Musitano’s vehicle was torched in the driveway of his home in 2015.

In may 2017 his younger brother Angelo Musitano was gunned down in his pick-up truck as he pulled into the driveway of his Waterdown in broad daylight.

Pat Musitano’s house was sprayed by bullets two weeks later.

The Musitano brothers were behind the 1997 gangland hit on mob kingpin Johnny “Pops” Papalia and his underboss Carmen Barillaro.

They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in Barillaro’s death while the charges for Papalia’s death were withdrawn. Pat and Angelo were sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2006 but they were released in 2006.

In the wake of Pat Musitano’s killing, Halton cops say one male was seen fleeing the scene west on Plains Rd. E. in a grey, four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50, with a sunroof.

“This vehicle will have fresh damage to the driver’s side in the area of the doors,” police said.

No suspect description was immediately released.

Anyone with information regarding this double shooting, the whereabouts of the suspect vehicle, or who has dashcam that may help investigators, is urged to call police at 905-825-4777 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

And when we issued the call for help in the fight against COVID-19, they answered.

Through our Ontario Together web portal, we received thousands of submissions from companies eager to retool their operations and supply Ontario’s front lines with much-needed equipment and supplies.

As a result, more than 18,000 emergency supply leads have been converted into $658 million in purchases of critical supplies and equipment to support staff on the front lines, including more than 26 million gowns, more than 175 million gloves, and over 123 million masks.

Our manufacturing sector stood up for the people of Ontario, and now it’s time that we stand up for them.

A recent poll found that 73% of Ontarians already wanted to buy Canadian-made products and more than half said they would increase their efforts to find local goods more often due to COVID-19. With the hardworking men and women of our province manufacturing everything from baby wipes to barbecues, cosmetic products to cars, supporting made-at-home products will be essential for building a strong, self-sufficient province.

The desire to support Ontario businesses is there — people just need the right information to do it. That’s why our government is proud to support the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters to launch “Ontario Made,” to make it easier than ever before to buy Ontario products.

Consumers will soon be able to find the “Ontario Made” logo on goods sold across the province. A new website, SupportOntarioMade.ca, will directly connect consumers and supply-chain partners to Ontario manufacturers. You’ll see more about Ontario Made on social media.

In times of crisis, it’s the Ontario Spirit, our commitment to look out for one another, that will always carry us through. Supporting our manufacturing sector here at home will not only boost our recovery and create jobs, it will also ensure that we have the factories, plants and assembly lines we need to respond when called upon again.

As we have every step of the way, we are once again asking the people of Ontario to do their part — look for the Ontario Made logo, and support Ontario manufacturing. We hope you’ll be a part of it.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said both situations present a significant risk of COVID-19 spread.

The province’s public health measures team is looking at sporting and concert venues and whether any measures such as masking can protect against exposure, he said.

“As you imagine, at a concert or at a sports venue with people yelling and cheering, there is a lot of droplets spread … so they are certainly high-risk settings especially because you can’t tell who’s actually going to buy the ticket and seat next to you,” Williams said. “So we’d have to be persuaded there’s some way you could do it with separation.”

However, creating enough space between members of the audience might be physically impossible in some venues or too unprofitable, he said.

Public health officials are open to any suggestions, but remain convinced these types of events are high risk, Williams said.

The chief medical officer preached similar caution around reopening of the border to non-essential travel, calling the escalating number of cases in the U.S. “very concerning.”

U.S. congress members with the Northern Border Caucus are pushing both countries to develop a framework for a phased reopening.

While the border is a federal responsibility, Premier Doug Ford has opposed any move to date to reopen the border.

“I get a sense from overall, there’s not a lot of eagerness to open up, because that’s really what got us into trouble back in March,” Williams said, referring to travel-related COVID-19 cases. “If we’re going to do any more travel allowance, we’re going to have to have a very rigorous screening and monitoring process in place because you saw some problems already just recently in P.E.I. and Nova Scotia that was related to that.

“So it’s a wakeup call to say, you can’t be too careful on this matter,” he added.

Ontario reported a spike in of 170 new cases Thursday, with 36,348 confirmed cases in total.

Health Minister Christine Elliott said 86 of the new cases were discovered through targeted testing of temporary farm workers in Windsor-Essex.

Outside of the sequestered farm outbreaks, the province had less than 100 new cases — a positive sign, Williams said.

“The numbers in the hospitals are coming down,” Williams said. “So again, metrics improving there.”

Three more deaths brought the number of lives lost to the pandemic to 2,703.

Williams pointed out the province was down to 25 COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes Thursday with 289 now considered resolved.

The percentage of new cases in Ontarians aged 60 years and up is on a notable decline, and young and middle-aged adults have become a larger percentage of COVID-19 cases over the past week, Williams said.

The ban, introduced in March, has been extended several times and is due to expire on July 21. The measure does not include trade.

Infections have risen rapidly in about 40 of the 50 U.S. states over the last two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis, and the premiers of major Canadian provinces say the frontier must remain shut.

Although some U.S. politicians in northern states are pressing for the measures to be relaxed, the Ottawa sources said the extension was virtually inevitable given the seriousness of the crisis in the United States.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier told reporters talks between the two nations on the ban were continuing and said “We will have more to say later this week, I’m sure.”

Doug Ford, premier of Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, on Monday said the situation in Florida was “staggering” and “scary.”

The chief medical officer in the Pacific province of British Columbia said last week there was no chance of non-essential travel with the United States this summer, given how widespread the virus was south of the border.

Trudeau said on July 8 that Canada had handled the outbreak better than the United States, in a rare public comment on the faltering U.S. effort.

The United States – which has a population almost nine times larger than Canada’s – has recorded more than 135,000 deaths compared to 8,783 in Canada.

Trudeau also said he had talked to U.S. President Donald Trump earlier on Monday and reiterated his opposition to the possible imposition of tariffs on Canadian aluminum exports.",[]

But a look under the headline figures showed consumers were spending more on items that don’t weigh as much in the consumer price index, which tracks inflation.

And they were spending less on things that weigh more in the calculation, such as gasoline.

In a numbers experiment to better reflect pandemic spending, Statistics Canada found the annualized inflation figures for April and May would have been 0.0 and -0.1 per cent.

“Trudeau’s approach to China has been an abject failure,” O’Toole’s just released policy paper on China reads.

“After revealing how much he admired the regime’s dictatorship, he spent his first years in office in a futile bid for a free trade deal at the expense of Indo Pacific partners, and an extradition treaty at the expense of Canadians, particularly Chinese Canadians.”

That’s all well and good to criticize Trudeau, and on China that is easy to do. The real question is what would O’Toole, or any Conservative leader do differently.

Specifically, what would they do to secure the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, now held for 582 days in Chinese jails.

O’Toole says he’d give the Chinese government an ultimatum to release Kovrig and Spavor or face economic and Magnitsky Act type sanctions.

“If they are not released within 30 days, key leaders starting with the President, Premier of the State council, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Party Congress and the President of the Supreme People’s Court would be subject to Canadian and global sanctions,” O’Toole’s policy document states.

China, and Canada’s policies toward the country, have become a hot topic in the Conservative leadership race. Peter MacKay, Leslyn Lewis and Derek Sloan have all put out policies or statements.

None believe the current Trudeau policy is serving the country well and want to see a change.

MacKay, like the others, has called for Huawei to be banned from Canada’s 5G network.

“If Huawei was to build our 5G network, they would build a back door that the Chinese government could open at any time to invade the privacy of Canadian individuals and businesses,” MacKay says on his website.

“We need to fundamentally recalibrate our relations with China,” Lewis states in her policy. She also calls for putting Canada’s interests first.

As for Sloan, he says he would crack down on pressure tactics and spying by agents of China’s communist party here in Canada.

Bottom line, with any of the Conservative Party leadership hopefuls in charge, Canada will see a major reset in relations with China. After the incidents of the past few years, the country is ready for that change.

It goes beyond the kidnapping of Kovrig and Spavor. China has engaged in economic warfare with Canada, targeting our soy, canola, pork and beef producers, among others. They have long used agents here to spy on Canadian companies in order to steal trade secrets.

American news giant Bloomberg recently published a long story about the role China’s economic espionage played in the downfall of Nortel.

These are all serious problems that need to be addressed and the current government is failing us.

O’Toole’s policy paper on China shows that he understands these issues and more. He even calls for dealing with Chinese funding of schools in Canada, an issue that has flown under the radar of most.

So far, O’Toole has the most detailed and well-thought-out plan for dealing with these pressing issues.

In a statement, Quebec said residents must now complete online registration forms to be able to travel through Atlantic Canada to reach the Quebec islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Quebec said the request came at the behest of New Brunswick and P.E.I. and that the registration procedures apply to all travellers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The two provinces have made this request to apply the same requirements or formalities to everyone wishing to travel in their territories,” the statement said.

Some Quebec politicians were angered last month when New Brunswick said Quebecers could not stay overnight on their way to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine.

Quebecers travelling to the islands by car need to go through New Brunswick to catch a ferry from Souris, P.E.I., a drive of at least 500 kilometres from the Quebec border.

“Considering the pandemic, the Quebec government and the two provinces concerned agreed on access to the ferry to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine and the requisite safe health-related measures,” the statement read.

Quebec also said residents must continue to meet other requirements to travel over land to the Iles-de-la-Madeleine during the pandemic.

Quebecers must fill out and carry a Quebec self-declaration card outlining their trip, the government said, as well as other documents, including a return ferry ticket, proof of address in the Iles-de-la-Madeleine, or a tourist accommodation reservation.

New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador launched an Atlantic bubble on July 3, allowing residents to travel in the region without needing to self-isolate.

But travel restrictions remain in place for most people from outside the Atlantic provinces to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19.

Quebec has been Canada’s COVID-19 epicentre, recording more than half of all cases and deaths in the country to date.

The province has gradually reopened as the number of daily cases and deaths decreased, however.

Quebec reported 114 new COVID-19 infections on Sunday for a total of 56,521 since the pandemic began, as well as seven more deaths for a total of 5,627.",[]

“Migraine sufferers walk a tight line when it comes to managing their symptoms, and COVID-19 has been an impetus in derailing many otherwise well-controlled patients,” says Dr. Ian Finkelstein, medical director of the Toronto Headache and Pain Clinic.

Increased physical and mental stressors, increased anxiety, and changes in daily routine, including working from home, have triggered worsening symptoms for many people, says Finkelstein.

Plus, limited access to their headache specialists has made it tough for patients to manage their condition.

Migraines are one of the most severe and debilitating types of headaches, and impact close to three million Canadians, 80% of them women. Symptoms include throbbing head pain, nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity to light and sounds.

Patients with chronic migraine — 15 or more days of severe headaches in a month — are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and chronic pain conditions.

The World Health Organization ranks migraines as one of the top 20 most disabling diseases and notes that “a day lived with a severe migraine can be more disabling than blindness, paraplegia or angina.”

Finkelstein urges those suffering from a worsening of their migraines to document their episodes in a ‘headache diary’ using the app Canadian Migraine Tracker at migrainetracker.ca.

People should record the frequency and severity of headaches, triggers and the types of medication they are using, and share that information with a doctor or headache specialist.

Finkelstein also recommends taking up relaxation exercises or meditation and engaging in some type of physical exercise.

Migraine sufferers also need to make a concentrated effort to stick to a regular schedule when it comes to diet, hydration and sleep.

If headaches are impacting your quality of life, and/or your reliance on medication use is increasing, find a headache specialist using your postal code via mychronicmigraine.ca. The tool also offers information, self-assessment, triggers and treatment options.

Finkelstein adds that use of headache relieving medications should be limited to less than 10 days per month to avoid rebound headaches.

In addition, Health Canada-approved preventative migraine treatment options — such as Botox or CGRP antibodies — can be effective. Speak to a medical professional about these options.",[]

The Republican president, seeking re-election in November, has been increasingly critical of government health officials and their guidance as a steady rise in infections threatens the easing of shutdown restrictions across the country.

Trump retweeted to his 83 million followers the accusations of a former game show host that “everyone is lying,” including the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

“The most outrageous lies are the ones about Covid 19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, Media, Democrats, our Doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust,” Chuck Woolery wrote Sunday night without citing evidence.

Well I guess I really stirred the pot yesterday. Why? I don't believe Fauci, the CDC and most of the so called experts on Covid 19 including the Media. What do you think? — Chuck Woolery (@chuckwoolery) July 13, 2020

Last week, Trump said he thought CDC guidelines for schools reopening were too tough, impractical and expensive.

On Monday, Trump also retweeted an April post from Woolery’s podcast co-host that Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wants to require “an ID card to go shopping.” As the spread of the coronavirus accelerated months ago, Fauci said it was possible the United States could in the future issue a certification of immunity.

The White House did not respond to questions on whether the president believed the CDC was lying.

Trump told reporters later at the White House: “I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.”

“I find him to be a very nice person. I don’t always agree with him,” Trump said.

Fauci on Monday ascribed the surge in coronavirus cases to the country’s failure to shut down completely, then a rush to reopen too soon, and urged a commitment to guidelines to rub out the disease.

“All you needed to do was look at the films on TV of people in some states who went from shutdown to complete throwing caution to the wind – bars that were crowded, people without masks,” Fauci said during a Stanford University event.

Fauci said he was confident the United States would get a handle on the virus “if we step back. You don’t necessarily need to shut down again, but pull back a bit, and then proceed in a very prudent way of observing the guidelines, of going from step to step.”

TENSIONS FLARE

Tensions with Fauci have risen with the decline of Trump’s popularity in the polls over the president’s handling of the outbreak. Fauci said in a Financial Times interview last week he had not briefed Trump in two months.

Fauci’s emphasis on protections including physical distancing, wearing masks, avoiding crowds and washing hands have put him at odds with a president eager to get people back to work to boost the economy.

The White House over the weekend distributed a list of statements Fauci made early in the pandemic that turned out to be wrong as understanding of the disease developed, according to media reports. But the White House said that it only sent responses to dozens of questions it had received from the Washington Post.

Health officials and the CDC have pleaded with the public to wear masks to limit the spread of the virus, but the issue has become a politically divisive issue in the United States unlike in many other countries which have seen far lower rates of infection and death.

Trump wore a mask for the first time in public when he visited a Washington D.C.-area military medical center on Saturday. He had previously refused to wear a mask in public or ask Americans to wear face coverings, saying it was a personal choice.",[]

The Reuters global tally, which is based on government reports, shows the disease is accelerating the fastest in Latin America. The Americas account for more than half the world’s infections and half the deaths.

Parts of the world, especially the United States with more than 3.3 million confirmed cases, are seeing huge increases in a first wave of COVID-19 infections while others “flatten the curve” and ease lockdowns.

Other places, such as the Australian city of Melbourne and Leicester in England, are implementing a second round of shutdowns. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, albeit with a low 1,522 cases, is to tighten social distancing measures again amid growing worries about a third wave.

The United States reported a daily global record of 69,070 new infections on July 10. In Brazil, 1.86 million people have tested positive, including President Jair Bolsonaro, and more than 72,000 people have died.

The U.S. state of Florida reported a record increase of more than 15,000 new cases in 24 hours on Sunday, more than South Korea’s total since the disease was first identified at the end of last year.

Coronavirus infections were rising in about 40 U.S. states, according to a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.

Yet U.S. President Donald Trump and White House officials have repeatedly said the disease is under control and that schools must reopen in the autumn.

“The president and his administration are messing with the health of our children,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

“We all want our children to go back to school, parents do and children do. But they must go back safely.”

STAY AT HOME

Hungary has imposed new restrictions on cross-border travel as of next Wednesday in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after a surge in new cases in several countries, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff said on Sunday.

The leader of the Spanish region of Catalonia called on residents of an area that has seen a surge in coronavirus cases to stay at home despite a ruling by a judge who threw out a mandatory lockdown order for the district of 160,000 people.

Spain, which has been one of the European countries worst hit by the coronavirus, lifted nationwide confinement last month, when the pandemic seemed to have come under control.

The first case was reported in China in early January and it took three months to reach one million cases. It has taken just five days to climb to 13 million cases from 12 million recorded on July 8.

The number of cases is around triple that of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organization.

There have been more than 568,500 deaths linked to the coronavirus so far, within the same range as the number of yearly influenza deaths reported worldwide. The first death was reported on Jan. 10 in Wuhan, China, before infections and fatalities surged in Asia, Europe and later in the United States.

India, the country with the third-highest number of infections, has been contending with an average of 23,000 new infections each day since the beginning of July.

In countries with limited testing capacity, case numbers reflect only a proportion of total infections. Experts say official data likely under-represents both infections and deaths.",[]

The new cases in New South Wales come after neighbouring Victoria state last week forced about 5 million people back into lockdown after a surge of new coronavirus cases.

Australia has avoided the high COVID-19 casualty numbers of other nations with swift and strict measures, recording fewer than 10,000 coronavirus cases in total, or about a sixth of the daily cases seen in the United States in recent days.

However, authorities are worried about rising cases of community transmission.

This accounted for 8 of the 14 new cases in New South Wales in the last 24 hours, while the rest were people who have returned from overseas and are already in hotel quarantine or have returned from Victoria.

The bulk of these community transmission cases were people who recently visited a pub in southwest Sydney, the Crossroads Hotel, taking the cluster to 13 in all.

“The concern is that this hotel is used by freight drivers who are transporting essential supplies across the country,” Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

“They are not being tested.”

In a bid to curtail the spread, authorities urged anyone who attended the pub to isolate for two weeks and get tested.

On Monday, long lines of cars were waiting more than three hours to attend a drive-through test clinic at the venue.

The virus, however, has already spread to at least one more high traffic venue, with a patron at Sydney’s Star casino on July 4 testing positive for COVID-19, the Star Entertainment Group Ltd said.

In Victoria state, authorities on Monday reported 177 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, the eighth consecutive day of triple digit rises in COVID-19 cases, but down from 273 cases the previous day.

“It may not be our peak yet,” Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne. “I would like to see a week of decreasing numbers.”

Australia’s Minister for Health Greg Hunt said 1,000 military personnel had been dispatched to help state officials curtail the spread of the coronavirus.

Scientists, meanwhile, have begun trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed at the University of Queensland.

Volunteers were due to receive the first vaccine dose on Monday morning. Preliminary results of the trial are expected to be released by the end of September, the university said.",[]

Hamilton Police say the deadly shooting happened in the southbound lanes of Red Hill Valley Pkwy., near King St., around 10 p.m.

The dead man has been identified as 27-year-old Matar Abouchere.

“Hamilton Police are investigating a double shooting on the Southbound Red Hill Valley Parkway in (Hamilton) between King and Greenhill,” police said on Twitter on Friday night.

“One male is deceased and the other is in hospital with serious injuries. Roads are closed in both directions as police investigate.”

The motive for the shooting is unclear and it was not immediately known if it was connected in any way to Pat Musitano’s killing.

Musitano, who narrowly survived a shooting just over a year ago, was fatally shot in the parking lot of a plaza on Plains Rd. E. around 1 p.m.

Two other men, one of whom was reportedly Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, were also wounded in the Burlington shooting.

Mallory, 72, a former TV station owner, had an insatiable appetite for vile child pornography.

At his 2013 sentencing, the judge described him as “probably the most prolific collector of child pornography in the entire world.”

In December 2012, he was found guilty of a staggering 60 counts of sexual exploitation of children, tampering with evidence and invasion of privacy.

Detectives found 26,000 files on his computers containing child pornography. The wealthy collector had an infinite number of images and videos showing “children being raped, tortured and sexually exploited.”

Game. Set. Match. Right? Wrong.

On May 27, he was paroled after the parole board decided the twisted man deserved to be released because, you know, “performance incentive credits.”

The prosecutor said he was “powerless” to stop it.

Mallory brought to mind Canada’s very own Blair Evans.

Now 70 years old, the one-time scientist at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa has been in and out of jail on child pornography charges since he was first arrested in 1996.

Every day, he dutifully clocked in at DND, then proceeded to spend every minute of his working day seeking out and downloading nauseating child pornography. Tens of thousands of images.

At the time, he was a married father of two living a quiet suburban existence. But beneath his nebbishy exterior was a dark heart consumed by demons.

“I remember standing on his doorstep, telling his wife what was going on. She was like, ‘No, he would never do something like that,’” said former Ottawa Police sex crimes investigator Keith Daniels. “Of course, he did.”

Evans was found guilty, served eight months in jail, and resumed his near religious devotion to his hobby.

In 2002, he was pinched again, this time in Toronto, for stashing a heartbreaking 200,000 images on his computer while he was on probation.

“These 200,000 images of children … represents tens of thousands of individual children as young as six months old being abused in the most horrendous ways,” Toronto Police Staff-Insp. Gary Ellis told The Toronto Sun at the time.

He was found guilty again, then in 2004 he was spotted accessing child pornography at the library and an internet cafe. Cops called the images “horrific.”

Again, he pleaded guilty. Total custody this time was just under four years. In 2009, he was dinged for breaching his probation.

Evans is now in the wind.

According to Sun files he hasn’t been in trouble since, but we are not privy to every single crime committed in this country. He may have gone straight, but I doubt it.

Suckers at the National Parole Board likely fell for whatever nonsensical tale Evans served up.

Rehabilitation was something the Georgia District Attorney Herb Cranford wasn’t buying.

“In the current digital age, no amount of supervision can stop a compulsive sexual deviant like Mallory from seeking out the most heinous images and videos of small children being sexually abused,” Cranford wrote in a desperate last ditch effort to keep the pedophile behind bars.

No such luck.

DOUBLE MURDER AT SKI LODGE

For 42 years, detectives have hit nothing but brick walls in a double murder at a New York state ski lodge that saw the killers get away with $18,000 from a hidden safe.

The cold-blooded murders of Wing Hollow Ski Corporation employees Michael R. Forness, 29, and Stephen C. Bender, 30, occurred on Feb. 6, 1978. It has remained unsolved.

Cops say that for the victims, they were in the wrong place at the wrong time on the icy cold morning in Allegheny, NY. Both were ski hill groomers working the overnight shift at the resort outside Olean.

Sometime between midnight and 1 a.m. the two men took a break and went to the chalet to get warm and do some chores. They walked into a burglary where the thugs were roving the cash-laden safe from a floor in the manager’s office.

Forness and Bender were each shot three times with the finishing touch a bullet to the back of their heads. A janitor found the bodies at 3 a.m.

Over the years, investigators have said the murders and heist were committed by “professionals” with the killers knowing about the hidden safe.

MISSING

Kenneth James Schmit

411: Lawyer Kenneth James Schmit vanished on Sept. 22, 1966, from St. Walburg, Saskatchewan. At the time of his mysterious disappearance he was 33, stood 5-foot-8 and weighed 155 pounds. He was last seen at 10:30 p.m. leaving a local residence when he went to see about a new car and go fishing with pal Horace Green. Cops say the two men went to the home of a Mr. Romphf where an argument ensued about the car and Schmit — in good health and enjoying a happy home life — vanished forever.

Despite a massive search, he has never been found.

Still, it just took the grim reaper 23 years to collect the rotund gangster’s staggering karmic debt.

For the hitmen hunting the Hamilton mob boss, the third time turned out to be the charm.

In April 2019, Musitano narrowly missed getting toe-tagged when he was shot four times outside his Mississauga lawyer’s office.

On Friday, he didn’t budge from the broiling parking lot where he was cut down just after 1 p.m.

Musitano, 52, was taken off the board in a daring daytime hit at a Burlington plaza, likely bringing an end to three years of bloody gangland tit-for-tat that has left at least a dozen people dead.

According to The Hamilton Spectator, Musitano’s longtime bodyguard, John Clary, was also wounded in the shooting along with a third unidentified man.

The gangster’s violent death marked the end of more than 70 years of criminal activity in southern Ontario for the Musitano family.

Longtime mob observer James Dubro told The Toronto Sun the power vacuum left by the the mob scion’s death is small and there will likely be no recriminations.

It isn’t known whether a double shooting hours later that left one man dead on Hamilton’s Red Hill Pkwy. is connected to the Musitano hit. No matter.

“The Musitanos are finished. Period. It’s the end of that vendetta,” Dubro said, adding that Pat’s old crew would have trouble gathering enough guys for a hand of briscola.

He suspects the contract to ice Musitano was likely taken out by the Luppino or Violi families or young Turks from the newer N’drangheta cells that have emerged over the last decade.

Dubro has been predicting the violent demise of Pat Musitano for three years. He turned out to be correct.

The man known as “Fat Pat” was born into underworld royalty.

The crime family was founded in the early 1940s by Anthony Musitano, who fled to Canada after murdering his sister in an honour killing when she became pregnant out of wedlock.

In southern Ontario, the fugitive began building his extortion and gambling rackets to become a criminal powerhouse.

In 1965, his nephew, Dominic Musitano — Fat Pat’s father — took over and shared the spoils fairly peaceably with the Papalia and Luppino families. Oh, there were periodic business disputes that ended in the morgue, but the era was largely peaceful and profitable.

Pat Musitano and his younger brother Angelo “Ang” Musitano, followed their father and uncles into the underworld. Cops have estimated that by 1992 the crime family was earning $14 million a year, mostly through illegal gambling.

When Dominic Musitano left this mortal coil from a heart attack on Aug. 13, 1995, his eldest son took over. The brothers owed Johnny Papalia $250,000 and they had no intention of paying it.

In quick succession, The Enforcer was rubbed out on Railway St. in the city’s north end and just weeks later, his top lieutenant, Carmen Barillaro was clipped at his Niagara Falls home.

Triggerman Kenneth Murdock pointed the finger at the Musitano brothers as the architects of death. Murdock chirped that the brothers were sick of kicking back tribute to Buffalo (Papalia) and feared a deathly tabling of accounts from Barillaro.

Pat and Angelo Musitano were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for the Barillaro hit. The Papalia charges were withdrawn.

But the Sicilian saying “revenge is a dish best served cold” hovered over the brothers and “Ang” checked out on May 2, 2017, when he was shot dead in his truck in the driveway of his Waterdown home.

Sources said he had recently found God.

At least 10 more underworld-connected figures would die by the gun over the next three years.

Dubro said with the implosion of his allies, the Rizzuto crime family in the Montreal, Pat Musitano’s doomsday clock went into overdrive.

The mobster was considered by other underworld figures as too brash, too impetuous, and graceless. And it caught up to him.

“Pat deserved his fate more than any psychotic killing gangster since (New York mob chief) Carmine “The Cigar” Galante,” Dubro said.

“Pat threatened me through my colleague Gord Martineau in 1991 when he came up in his Caddy with his boys as Gord and I were filming for a CITY special mob series near his auto body shop in downtown Hamilton. He told Martineau that I ‘belonged in Hamilton Harbour.’”

Dubro added: “There was too much piss and vinegar and nastiness in Pat. He had to go.”

Cops say one male was seen fleeing the scene west on Plains Rd. E. in a grey, four-door sedan, similar to an Infiniti Q50, with a sunroof. No suspect description was immediately released.

Anyone with information regarding this double shooting, the whereabouts of the suspect vehicle, or who has dashcam that may help investigators, is urged to call police at 905-825-4777 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

Const. Robert Konashewych, 36, faces two charges of fraud over $5,000, as well as counts of breach of trust and obstructing justice.

The cop, who lives in Niagara Region, has been with the Toronto force since 2008 and has appeared on the province’s Sunshine List for employees making more than $100,000 since 2014.

The 52 Division officer has been suspended with pay.

Toronto Police say that Konashewych claimed he was the beneficiary of a person who died while under the care of the province’s Public Guardian and Trustee.

They allege a client representative with the provincial office worked on the file and facilitated the fraud.

Adellene Karla Balgobin, 35, of Toronto, faces two counts of fraud over $5,000 and one count of breach of trust.

Both are scheduled to appear at Old City Hall on Aug. 6 at 11 a.m.

Toronto Police Association president Mike McCormack said he couldn’t comment on the case as it’s before the courts.

You might as well be naked while on the lam from the cops.

This past Monday, Grand Rapids, Mich., resident Joshua Rupp pleaded no contest to multiple felony charges in connection to numerous home break-ins last year while fleeing naked from authorities.

According to the Holland Sentinel, Rupp was arrested on July 31, 2019 after breaking into a pair of homes in Polkton Township “in an unclothed state” according to police.

During one of home invasion, Rupp sexually assaulted one of the homeowners and punched another in the face. While he drove away from the second home, Rupp’s vehicle sideswiped another car driven by a woman, who had a child in her vehicle.

The sans-clothed Rupp later fled on foot but was eventually found by the cops. Resisting arrest, police had to use a Taser to subdue him.

According to police reports, Rupp asked an officer if he had killed anyone during his naked home invasion spree, stating he “wanted to kill someone.”

Rupp’s lawyer noted his client couldn’t remember the incidents because he was intoxicated.

The man pleaded no contest to charges of assault and resisting and obstructing a police officer, the Sentinel reported. Rupp faces up to 20 years in prison and will be sentenced on Aug. 3.

MAN ALLEGEDLY SCAMMED LOWE’S TO BUILD HOME … FROM JAIL

A master scammer allegedly tried to build his Lake Placid, Fla., home by ripping off hardware supplies store Lowe’s from his jail cell.

According to The Daily Beast, Jared Murray regularly had construction materials from Lowe’s sent to the construction site of his home. Couriers delivered the material by rented U-Haul trucks at odd hours with Murray reportedly telling contractors his uncle worked at the store and received a 50% discount.

And all the work was handled reportedly by someone identifying themself as the man’s aunt.

Contractors noted that things were shady because they had never met Murray in person, with relatives telling them the man was on the road for business. But according to the FBI, Murray was actually in prison, where he hatched a plan to defraud Lowe’s out of more than $1 million in inventory.

FBI documents obtained by the Daily Beast noted that Murray has been behind bars for the past 10 years, serving a 25-year sentence for an armed robbery allegedly organized by his mother.

The FBI alleges Murray — who hasn’t been charged yet — had used smuggled cellphones to steal identities of local contractors with open lines of credit at Lowe’s. Murray would then allegedly order supplies and charge them to the contractors’ accounts.

Murray’s unfinished three-bedroom home is up for sale for $185,000 US, The Daily Beast noted. If the fraud scheme had worked, the sale of his home would have been pure profit.

According to the FBI, the home and land are in the process of being seized by the federal government.

THIS CRAPPY JOB PAYS $10,000 FOR THE SUMMER

An aptly named bidet company called Tushy is offering a three-month consulting position this summer for anyone looking to relieve their bowel movements.

TMZ reported that Tushy is offering $10,000 to anyone who is willing to spend the summer pooping, analyzing said fecal matter and sharing those findings on social media while testing the company’s product against others.

“This will be a three-month, fart-time, $10,000-contract role requiring about 30-60 minutes per day (depending on how many times you poop!) and document your experience,” the Tushy job posting stated.

The poop-ular gig even comes with a nifty title — Vice-president of Fecal Matter. There’s only one requirement — besides regular bowel movement — for the position: You must be aged 21 or over. Unfortunately, the July 10 deadline to apply for the position has just passed.

MAN BATTLES DEADLY SNAKE WHILE DRIVING A 27-year-old Australian man didn’t expect to battle for his life while driving his pickup truck down a highway one day. According to Queensland Police on Tuesday, the man identified as Jimmy was driving down the Dawson Highway on June 15 at 100 km/h when he noticed an unwanted passenger in the form of an Eastern Brown Snake, a highly venomous reptile that’s responsible for a majority of snakebites in the country. “The more I moved my legs … it just started to wrap around me. Its head just started striking at the (driver’s seat) chair, between my legs,” Jimmy said, according to a media release. Queensland cops say Jimmy used a knife and a seat belt to battle the slithery serpent as he tried to stop the car. During the tussle, Jimmy feared he had been bitten as Eastern Browns are known for their fast and fatal bites.

When bitten, the snake’s venom can cause paralysis and bleeding in the brain.

Jimmy eventually killed the snake and hightailed it to the nearest hospital. An officer pulled Jimmy over after seeing him drive 123 km/h down the highway.

The speeding man told the officer about the dead snake in the back of his truck and how he thought it had bitten him. That’s when the officer called for help.

Paramedics examined Jimmy and said the man wasn’t bitten but had suffered from shock.",[]

Officials told reporters near the Okavango Delta on Thursday that they had now verified 281 carcasses and that the deaths were concentrated in an area of 8,000 square km that is home to about 18,000 elephants.

Flying over the area in a helicopter, a Reuters reporter saw one carcass splattered in droppings from vultures, which had eaten some of the flesh, and red paint from officials marking verified carcasses. Hundreds of live elephants wandered nearby.

“We are not dealing with a common thing, it looks like it’s a rare cause,” said Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, adding the death rate in the affected area was below 2%.

“We cannot rule out anything at this stage, it could be a virus, vegetation, overnutrition after last year’s drought … We have asked the community not to interact with the carcasses.”

He said officials were expecting to receive test results this week on samples sent to South Africa and Canada.

Some campaign groups have criticized the government for acting too slowly to solve the mystery of the dying elephants, an accusation Reuben has denied.

Although the number of deaths so far represents a fraction of the estimated 130,000 elephants in Botswana, there are fears more could die if authorities cannot establish the cause soon.

Wave Kashweka, a senior veterinary officer in Botswana’s North-West district, said officials had found elephants which appeared to have died recently, adding aerial surveys would try to find more carcasses.

In their initial inquiries, authorities ruled out poaching and anthrax among possible causes.

Cyril Taolo, acting director of the wildlife department, said the government had contacted neighbors Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Zambia but they had not seen similar elephant deaths.

Africa’s overall elephant population is declining due to poaching, but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent’s elephants, has seen numbers grow from 80,000 in the late 1990s.",[]

And this time, he’s not just mopping down floors — he’s peddling masks.

Offer Shlomi, otherwise known as Vince Offer, the official spokesperson for the infomercial absorbent towel, said the same material is now being marketed as cloth masks to offer a level of protection during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“And disposable masks? You’re wasting money like you’re a billionaire in a nightclub!” he said in the commercial.

Offer claims the ShamWow masks are breathable, machine-washable and equipped with a cotton inner layer for comfort and made in the U.S. and Germany with the same material used to make surgical masks. In a Canadian version of the ad, it says the masks are “crafted” in Canada with a backdrop of the Canadian flag.

He claims that the ShamWow mask is infused “with real zinc to fight and stop bacteria and other microbes.”

Offer contends that other cloth masks are made with woven fibres that allow “viruses to get through easily.”

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said Wednesday the claim that zinc will protect people from the coronavirus “is garbage.”

“We know that we should be putting on a mask when going into an indoor environment,” Bogoch said.

“The primary role of these masks is to prevent people who have this infection from transmitting it to other people. If you cover your nose and mouth, you reduce the risk of spreading this virus. Regardless is of what’s in the mask (they claim) will help reduce the spread of infection. On one hand, if this gets people to put on a mask, great. On the other hand, I don’t think people can come away thinking that certain masks have certain properties that will provide them with certain benefits.”

Offer, who also peddled a kitchen device called the Slap Chop, is no stranger to controversy.

In 1998, he filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox and Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the co-directors of There’s Something About Mary, claiming that 14 scenes in that movie were lifted from his film, The Underground Comedy Movie. The case was dismissed in 2000.

In 2004, Offer sent out a press release announcing his intentions to sue the Church of Scientology over what he claimed was a large-scale smear campaign against him and The Underground Comedy Movie.

On Feb. 7, 2009, Offer and a 26-year-old sex worker were arrested in Miami Beach, Fla. after he allegedly beat her up. Prosecutors later declined to file formal charges against either person.

The ShamWow masks also repeatedly state they are not manufactured in China.

“Those other masks you see on TV are made in China. I love Chinese people, too, but come on!” he said.

Each mask is priced at $29.99 US.

Towards the end of the minute-long TV spot, Offer holds up a potted plant.

“And you save the environment,” he says before throwing the plant behind him.

“Forget the environment, save yourself.”

A person commented on the video uploaded to YouTube: “When the world needed him most, he didn’t vanish. He returned.”

The Department of National Defence has put out a tender for goats and sheep to graze on part of the base at 4 Wing Cold Lake.

“We did this in (CFB) Comox a few years ago and I have a feeling the idea kind of kicked off from that experience,” said Captain Mat Strong, public affairs officer for 1 Canadian Air Division based in Winnipeg.

“The reason we’re using goats is because the areas that need to be trimmed are in precarious locations such … where drainage ditches exist.”

The tender, which has now closed, said the base has areas that are difficult to maintain due to the degree of slope and accessibility.

“To get people in there with trimmers and stuff takes days, because they do it by hand. But you can just dump a bunch of goats in there and they can take care of it in no time,” Strong said.

The contract calls for a herd of 250 animals: 70% goats and 30% sheep.

Strong said it’s not something planned for other bases across the country.

Using goats for weed control isn’t new. It’s been around in Europe for centuries and the critters have been employed in Kamloops, B.C., and Regina to deal with invasive weeds.

The City of Calgary started to use goats to wipe out noxious weeds — most notably the Canada thistle — in a more environmentally friendly way at an urban park in 2016.

“We’ve got three different goat herds operating in the city right now. I would say it has been a success,” said Chris Manderson, who handles urban conservation for Calgary Parks.

Manderson said the newest area to get a goat herd next week is a steep bluff north of the Bow River downtown.

“Goats are a lot better at negotiating that hillside than people would be. A conventional approach would be guys out there with backpack sprayers.”

Strong said removing vegetation is a good way to keep down unwanted wildlife at the base where bears, moose and deer have wandered onto the runway.

The new recruits will only be used as needed, he said.

“It’s kind of like a snow removal or lawn care service you’d have for your house,” Strong said.

“They basically use them for a defined period of time. And if they’re not needed again for a week or two, they go away and then they come back.”",[]

United,"['Steve Bufferymore Steve Buffery', 'More Steve Buffery', 'Emilee Chinn', 'Getty Images', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports']",2020-07-13 17:42:22+00:00,"Walt Disney World likes to say that “magic happens” at their resorts.

That was on display on Monday morning as a depleted D.C. United side magically came back from a 2-0 deficit late to tie Toronto FC 2-2 at the MLS is Back tournament.

It’s stunning how TFC continues to “magically” — and brutally — give up late goals and blow what appears to be sure victories. TFC was in control for the vast majority of the match against D.C. United but – as Reds fans have witnessed far too often last season — the Toronto side broke down defensively, resulting in three points turning into one.

“I’m not sure I’d call that a tendency,” said TFC captain Michael Bradley, when asked about his club’s tendency” to give up late goals. “It’s a little bit too easy of a conclusion to come to. We’re angry without ourselves, we’re frustrated. For a team that wants to be as good as we do, and for a team that holds ourselves to the standards that we do, there’s no way you should let a team like that back into the game. But I’m not going to sit here and draw all sorts of crazy conclusions based on the first game back in a really long time under these circumstances.”

The draw ruined what had been a glorious performance by TFC youngster Ayo Akinola, who hadn’t played a game for TFC’s first team in over a year. The 20-year-old scored both of Toronto goals — the first match for both teams at the MLS is Back event, held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida.

D.C. United was forced to play with only 10 men in the second half after Junior Moreno picked up a second yellow card late in the first resulting in the final 45 minutes being played at a crawl. The heat and humidity were also factors. However, a defensive breakdown by the Reds allowed D.C. United to get to within one goal when Federico Higuain scored in the 84th minute on a breakaway when he chipped a shot over Toronto keeper Quentin Westberg. Frederic Brillant scored in the 91st minute with a header to put the dagger in TFC’s heart. Akinola almost scored the winner via a looping header in the final few seconds of the game, but was robbed by D.C. United goalkeeper Bill Hamid with a fine left-handed save.

With TFC ahead 2-0, Vanney replaced his two starting centre backs — Chris Mavinga and Omar Gonzalez – in the 64th minute — with Laurent Ciman and Eriq Zavaleta — changes the coach said he was forced to make.

“At halftime (defender) Justin (Morrow) had some Achilles tendonitis issues, he’s pretty sore at half,” said the coach. “And then 10 minutes into the second half, Omar’s cramping up, he can’t take a step. And before their water break, Chris is cramping up. This is the first game in extreme temperatures. So the question then becomes how much do you really push guys in the first game of a tournament, the first game in months? And so we went with the changes and I thought that really disrupted our ability to start attacks and keep possession of the ball. And also we struggled in some of the transition defending. At that point, we started to lose a bit of the momentum and a bit of the possession. (And) we need to continue to try to attack and look for the third goal and not just pass the ball around.”

The match ended with some unpleasantness on the pitch as players pushed and shouted at each other.

“Part of it is just football. Part of is that you have on a hot, humid day, you have one team down 2-0, with one man less, and is able to come back and get a point. They’re obviously excited, we’re obviously disappointed. That’s normal,” said Bradley. “The other part is, over the last few days, from their side, we’ve got a real sense that they’re all pissed off and angry with the fact that we showed up late, almost feeling like we’re trying to cheat the system and get a leg up on everybody. That obviously couldn’t be further from the truth.

“We’re in the middle of a pandemic. We’re trying to look after ourselves and look after each other and, in turn, look out for any of the teams we play against,” Bradley added.

TFC and D.C. United were originally supposed to play on Friday, but that match was postponed because the Reds were late travelling to Orlando after a member of the team’s travel party came down with symptoms, though tests proved negative. The match was changed to Sunday, but that was also postponed when a D.C. United player tested positive and a TFC player had a test that was “inconclusive”. Both players, who have not been identified, later tested negative, and the match was moved to Monday morning. The Reds’ second group stage match against the Montreal Impact was subsequently moved to Thurs., July 16 at 8:00 p.m. and if the TFC player, whose first test in Orlando was inconclusive, tests negative a second time, he can play in that game.

The Reds were without veteran forward Jozy Altidore for Monday’s match. Altidore missed training time with his teammates in Toronto as he spent much of the down time during the COVID-19 pandemic at his home in Florida before joining TFC in late June. Upon returning to Toronto, he had to go into quarantine for two weeks and, as a result, wasn’t ready to play. Vanney was also without the services of rookie sensation Ifunanyachi Achara, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in training earlier this month and is out for the season – -prompting the coach to put Brampton native Akinola in the starting XI.

The tie gives TFC a win and two draws in three games of the interrupted Major League Soccer season. Prior to the suspension of the MLS regular season because of the pandemic, the Reds opened with a 2-2 draw in San Jose on Feb.29- another match that saw TFC blow a two-goal lead in the second half — and then defeated New York City FC 1-0 in the TFC home opener on March 7, the lone goal scored by Achara.

Akinola, who last played for the first team on June 29, 2019, opened the scoring in the 12th minute on Monday with a terrific right-foot shot into the left corner — the second of his young MLS career. He then scored in the 44th minute after some great work by Alejandro Pozuelo again, who found Akinola at the side of the goal and the young Toronto forward easily left-footed it home past Hamid. It was Akinola’s third career start with TFC. In added time in the first half, Westberg made a sensational right-handed save on Ola Kamara header to preserve the two-goal lead.

Bradley played the whole match, despite suffering an injury to his ankle in the MLS Cup final on November 10 in Seattle and underwent surgery in January. He missed the first two TFC games of the 2020 season before MLS ceased playing. Bradley didn’t appear to suffer from the layoff on Monday as he was a commanding presence in midfield — playing the full match despite the heat and humidity and length of time between games. New designated Player Pablo Piatti also missed the two opening games of the season after suffering a strained hamstring at pre-season at the University of California Irvine and was in the starting XI on Monday, playing 70 solid minutes in his Reds debut. Veteran midfielder Jonathan Osorio did not dress after suffering a quad injury a few weeks ago. Vanney is hoping he’ll be available in Toronto’s third game of the tournament.

But the Grammy winner is also using his platform to speak out on social issues, including the Black Lives Matter movement and the case of Breonna Taylor, an ER technician who was killed when police officers raided her apartment on a drug bust in Kentucky earlier this year.

On his Instagram page, Bieber has been posting calls for the police who were involved in the shooting to be arrested and late Sunday night, he shared a photo with Taylor’s name and captioned the image with a stirring call to action.

“WTF is going on?” he wrote. “I need updates. How are these police officers not arrested? She was innocently shot and killed in her own home by police. I’m not going to forget.”

While many fans supported his message, one follower going by the name Jeremy Slovacek took issue with Bieber’s plea, writing, “How about you worry about Canada and your mental issues. We got this down here in America! How about naming all the babies slaughtered at Planned Parenthood, the innocent black girl gunned down in Illinois this weekend, how about all those black in black shooting deaths in Chicago? When are we gonna talk about that? Hey Justin, you got money, start an organization instead of word salads.”

The comment caught Bieber’s eye, with the Intentions star replying, “(Are you) saying that because I’m Canadian I shouldn’t worry about my fellow man? There’s an issue and I’m speaking about it because not only is it my right but my honour to stand by my fellow man.”

Bieber continued, adding, “There are many issues I can speak on but right now, I’m speaking on Breonna Taylor, who was murdered in her own home.”

In a separate message, Bieber continued writing, “I will never stop fighting for my brothers and sisters. BLACK LIVES MATTER.”

Last month, in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests sparked by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis in May, Bieber admitted his career had been influenced greatly by Black culture.

“I am inspired by Black culture. I have benefited off of Black culture,” he wrote. “My style, how I sing, dance, perform and my fashion have all been influenced and inspired by Black culture.”

In the message to his 141 million followers, Bieber continued: “I am committed to using my platform from this day forward to learn, to speak up about racial injustice and systemic oppression, and to identify ways to be part of a much-needed change.”

Since the coronavirus pandemic closed the border between Canada and the U.S., Bieber and his wife Hailey have been staying at their mansion on Puslinch Lake near Cambridge, Ont.

Bieber bought the 9,000-square-foot mansion in 2018 for $5 million.

According to People, the couple decided to self-isolate in Canada because “their home is very secluded and they are able to be out in nature still.”",[]

While the COVID-19 pandemic has shuttered the game, we still yearn for the slap of the puck on the ice.

Hockey is in our lifeblood. It boosts our morale; it fuels our economy. The Stanley Cup is our holy grail.

That’s why we – cautiously – welcome the plan to create two NHL hubs in Edmonton and Toronto as the league gradually reopens.

This is a vote of confidence by the NHL in the way this country has dealt with the pandemic. It’s a payoff, if you will, for the long days of lockdown and a slow and careful reopening. No doubt the league would prefer the hubs to be in the U.S. as Las Vegas was the favoured venue.

Given the swath the virus has hacked through the southern U.S., Canada has become the preferred choice for the NHL to continue its truncated season, starting Aug. 1.

Of course, we can’t be complacent about the threat of virus flare-ups in those hubs, especially since there will be no mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for players and their retinues.

But, we trust the teams and officials to enforce the restrictions and stay in their bubbles. They’ll be confined to their hotel rooms, hotel restaurants and to team outings. There’s too much for them to lose if they ignore those limits. Quite apart from the setback another outbreak would cause in the host cities, it would be devastating for the teams. This virus is crippling to the body. Any athlete who’s infected risks losing his life and his career. There will be daily testing of the players and their entourages, plus referees and linesmen.

This country has so far managed fairly well through the pandemic, but we can’t stay shut down forever. Yes, there was a setback recently with MLS when a recent Toronto FC game was postponed over virus fears. But we can’t keep looking in the rearview mirror. For our economy to recover, to restore hope, we must start opening key businesses sensibly using social distancing measures.

Let’s stop ragging the puck – and get back on the ice!",[]

Foodbenders, a Bloordale health food eatery, enraged the Jewish community by using its Instagram to praise terrorists, equate Zionists with Nazis, allege that a Canadian Jewish group “control(s) your media and elected officials,” and even announce “#zionistsnotwelcome.”

After an unprecedented mobilization of grassroots Jewish community activists, Foodbenders was dropped by food industry giants like Uber Eats, Ritual and DoorDash, then abandoned by many of its former clients, including Pusateri’s Fine Foods and Ambrosia Natural Foods.

In a particularly bizarre twist, one overzealous community member even spray-painted a Star of David onto the storefront, before it was swiftly erased. While vandalism and vigilantism are always unacceptable, the bottom line is that this was a story with legs, which indeed captivated Jewish news outlets throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and Israel. Even Quds News Network — an appendage of the Hamas terrorist group — got in on the act, but in order to defend the antisemitic Instagram posts, of course.

Meanwhile, crickets were heard from Canadian media. Aside from a series of intrepid reports by the Sun’s own Sue-Ann Levy, and a passing mention in a Toronto Star column, non-Jewish Canadians would have had no idea that any of this was occurring.

This abject silence is all the more jarring given that, during the same period, dozens of stories featuring all manner of racism and discrimination were covered by Canadian outlets. One prominent Toronto publication maintains a staff of journalists assigned to beats such as “Social Justice” and “Identity and Inequality” — but they said nothing, reported nothing as a Toronto eatery stirred up anti-Jewish hate online, then paid the predictable price.

Just as all this was happening, footage emerged of an anti-Israel rally last Saturday in Mississauga where participants chanted: “Palestine is our land, and the Jews are our dogs!” Anti-Semitism is nothing new on the Canadian pro-Palestinian scene, especially in Mississauga, but what made this disgrace unique was the fact that the rally organizers and many of the anti-Jewish chanters were mere high school students.

Again, aside from a fine column by the Sun’s Tarek Fatah and one report by Global News, Canadian media was quiet as a mouse, while Jews were dehumanized by a mob of teenagers, in broad daylight, at a public square in one of Canada’s most diverse and fastest-growing cities.

This self-imposed silence on anti-Semitism is especially unforgivable in light of the statistics. In 2019, according to the Toronto Police Service, Jews were the most targeted demographic for hate crimes, despite amounting to just 1.1% of the total population according to the 2016 Census.

The numbers out of Peel Region, which includes Mississauga, were even more hair-raising; Jews were the most targeted religious group in 2019, while constituting a miniscule 0.1% of the population as of the 2016 census.

These numbers accord with B’nai Brith’s own Annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents, which recorded 2,207 incidents in 2019 — a grim new record, amounting to six acts of anti-Jewish hate per day on average. As explained in our Eight-Point Plan to Tackle Antisemitism, there is work to be done on this score by all three levels of government: Federal, provincial and municipal.

But Canadian media have a part to play in this process as well. News sources in democratic societies have always acted in part out of a need to hold systems of authority to account, and to ensure that they do better.

Why, Canadian Jews are asking, do the same media outlets that help to pursue justice for Indigenous Canadians, Afro-Canadians, LGBTQ Canadians and others turn a blind eye to the issues affecting the community most affected by hate crimes in many of our cities?

How can we truly build a fairer and more equal society when anti-Semitism, the world’s oldest and most pervasive hatred, all too often goes unreported?

An owner of an Airbnb property should likely expect the occasional mess or minor damage, but not having a property transformed into a drug drop-off.

That was the case for at least two properties in Greenville County, S.C. when entrepreneurial criminal types booked the properties overnight through Airbnb and then had weed delivered to the waiting “guests”, according to the Greenville County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit (DEU).

But the police were on alert, having learned earlier about a weed shipment to a number of sites in the county. They staked out two rental properties and intercepted 22 pounds of cannabis from California that were contained in two separate parcels. Twelve pounds of weed was intercepted at one property and 10 pounds at the other, combining for a street value of an estimated US$90,000.

“The owners of the rental homes had no idea their residences were being used as a drug drop location,” said Bart McEntire, commander of Greenville County Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit, according to WMBF News. “It is not an uncommon tactic of the drug world to take advantage of unsuspecting home owners to conceal their illicit activity,” McEntire noted.

Police believe the two people receiving the cannabis had accepted prior weed shipments.

Kelby Joshua Darnell McKinney, 26, and Ana Lashae LeGrand, 25, were arrested, WMBF News reports.

Greenville is a popular spot for importing cannabis, McEntire told the TV station, explaining that pipelines of illegal distribution have opened up in line with decriminalization of weed in western portions of the U.S.

And California seems to be a popular source of the cannabis. “Marijuana shipments from California to Greenville have exploded,” Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis suggested to WMBF News.

Of particular concern are THC-infused products that look like candy, Lewis reportedly said, citing a recent shipment of gummy bears that bore the name of a well-recognized gummy brand.

You dutifully wear it the to the grocery story, the coffee shop, indeed whenever you’re in a public building — that’s now the law in Ottawa.

But what do you do with it at the end of the day?

Ottawa Public Health lists the dos and don’ts of mask wearing on its website, including instructions on how to clean and reuse your cloth mask.

First of all, the mask offers little protection — it can even increase your risk of infection — if you’re constantly fiddling with it or adjusting the fit. So rule No. 1 is, “Hands off.”

When it does come time to remove your mask, wash your hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer, then pull the loops away from your ears. If it has a removable, non-reusable filter, pull that out and dispose of it in the garbage before washing your mask.

The mask can be tossed in with your regular laundry, using the hot water cycle.

If it’s not going into the laundry straight away, place it in a disposable bag that you can throw out later.

After handling your mask, be sure to wash your hands again.

You can hand wash your mask, too. Use laundry soap and the hottest water you can stand, then be sure to dry it thoroughly.

You can reuse your cloth mask throughout the day so long as it doesn’t get damaged or soiled. Ottawa Public Health says to fold the mask in half, with the outer surface facing inward, and store it in clean, sealable bag until it’s needed again.

A disposable mask can’t be cleaned or reused and should be thrown out safely, which doesn’t mean tossing it on the ground or leaving it in a shopping cart.

None of them ever had to guide their teams through this kind of season, halted for four months by a global pandemic, restarted with a daring mid-summer 24-team tournament with COVID-19 still not eliminated and last week’s new CBA changing the big picture.

On the eve of Monday’s opening of Maple Leafs training camp for Return To Play, the 34-year-old Dubas discussed with Toronto media the challenges facing himself and his club. Here’s a Q&A from the conference call.

Q: What pressure does the flat cap in the CBA put on you to win this tournament while you can keep this roster together?

A: “I don’t look at the situation and say this is our only chance. If we didn’t have our core guys locked up for this year and next, I would maybe feel a little bit differently. We have the 2019-20 contracts to finish and the ‘20-21s.

“I know that seems to be the narrative about the team. But I don’t feel that this season there should be any added pressure. I think the players have an expectation and we have an expectation that we’re going to be competitive and of course try to contend to win the Stanley Cup.

“If we were facing a decision of our core players, we’d have to make a major move. We’re going to have some space to take care of our RFAs and potentially look at some of our own UFAs. We have time.

“(But) with the cap flat, our development system will be paramount.”

Q: When did the last players arrive in Toronto, do you anticipate any Leafs will opt out of RTP by Monday’s 5 p.m. deadline and what do you think of players who have already done so?

“I don’t think it looks right now that any of the players we have invited will be opting out, I don’t have any inkling of that. The players have mostly all been here for quite a while now, at least a week off the top of my head.

“I think (opting out) was a great thing for the League and the PA to do. If any of our players were to opt out for any reason, we’d be fully understanding. This is such a difficult time in the world and whether it’s for reasons of underlying health or just general family reasons or whether you’re just not comfortable. I certainly respect any of our players who would feel that way and any player in the league or staff member that would feel that way.”

Q: What might your final roster look like in terms of numbers?

A: “We want to make sure that every roster player has a role. We didn’t want to have two or three extra guys at the bottom that didn’t really feel that they were close to playing. So maybe up to 28 or 29 players (15 to 16 forwards, nine to 10 defencemen, three goaltenders).

“What I would say to all those players (competing on the fringe) is they’ve got the chance to make an impact. That’s one of the great things about this next two weeks. We’re going to have some time to evaluate everybody. If Nick (Robertson), Kenny Agostino or Adam Brooks step up and are beating down the door throughout training camp, we’re going to give them opportunity.”

“(Forward) Nic Petan was deemed fit to play by our medical staff (Sunday). He had been a full participant in Phase 2, so he will be added to the roster and (Marlies defenceman) Mac Hollowell will be removed.”

Q: What will determine if Robertson makes the team?

A: “The way that he performs in practises and scrimmages. We’re going to give him every shot. We’re not going to look at his age (18). If he can make an impact playing with older, stronger players, we’ll roll from there.

“The latter half of this week we’ll start to replicate game experiences. It’s not a normal camp with 70 guys. There’s no ability (for Robertson) to get lost.

“We have to make cuts as we go along to be bubble compliant.”

Q: Are there any advantages to being at Scotiabank Arena with 11 other teams?

A: “There is a bit of familiarity. But there’s not going to be any fans, no game operations. I think there’s also a challenge of the fact that your family is 10 minutes away and on July 26 when we move in (the hotel), we’re all going to be sealed in away from them.

“We know the rink, but we’re going to be abiding by such strict protocols and entry and exit and we’re not getting any preferred treatment in terms of hotel or facilities. I think the League has done a pretty good job of keeping that very fair. The only advantage is we don’t have a flight to get here.”

Q: What will the calibre of hockey be like in RTP?

A: “I have no idea. We’re going to find out soon, though. There’s no experience that anyone has had – you could maybe look at some of the World Cups and Canada Cups that have come off long layoffs – but even then, those are August tournaments coming off a May, June, April finish, depending on where you were in the standings.

This is an August resumption after a March ending, so almost a five-month layoff with really one exhibition game.”

Q: Who else will be living in the bubble besides you and (team president) Brendan Shanahan?

A: “We’ll have the six-person coaching staff (Sheldon Keefe, assistants Paul McFarland and Dave Hakstol, goalie coach Steve Briere and video coaches Andrew Brewer and Jordan Bean). And then every other staff member are people we’d deem that directly benefit the player’s performance (medical, trainers, etc.).”

Q: What do you think of the RTP format?

A: “The NHL has done a great job of adapting to find a way to certainly recognize that playoff races weren’t over and to have teams that were in the race kept alive.

“Despite the fact if the season had just ended on March 10 we would have in the playoffs and scheduled to play Tampa, I don’t think that it’s unfair that we have to play a qualifying round whatsoever because we were still supposed to have 12 games left to try to either make up some ground or secure our space.

“I think it’s very fairly set up even though we’re one of those teams that’s gone from playoffs into a qualifying round like a number of others that are seeded five through eight.

“None of us have ever been in a series where seven of the teams are staying in the same hotel. It’s like minor hockey where if the game in front of you runs a little bit long, you’re kind of waiting for that game to end in overtime or what have you.”

Q: What will this be like for Keefe?

A: “When we made the coaching change (Mike Babcock being fired in late November) Sheldon had one morning skate to get the team up and running for a game that night. Now he’s had essentially a full build up with the coaching staff. And we’ll have a two-week camp to get the players up and rolling, so I think there’s some good fortune for us on that end as well.

“We’re excited to see that, not only for the short run, but I think it’s a great experience for Sheldon and will help us and help him. And we’re largely past some of the injuries that had plagued us at the end of the season. We’re certainly excited to see (a fully healthy blueline).”

Q: What’s Auston Matthews’ status? (the Leafs’ leading scorer contracted Covid during the spring at his summer residence in Scottsdale, Ariz.)

A: “He’s fit to play”

Q: The team goes against Columbus without a lot of recent playoff success.

A: “I’m optimistic. This is our fourth series. We do have experience; guys know ebbs and flows now. Guys on the team that have been in the American League and with the Marlies have played in a lot of series and most of them have played in best of five as well. I think all of that is great to handle and to certainly go back on for experience as we kind of work our way through it.

“With regards to our chances, I think like every team now, we’re largely past some of the injuries that had plagued us at the end of the season and those players are due back (Jake Muzzin, Ilya Mikheyev).

“(The Blue Jackets) have a very specific organizational culture and ethos about them. They’re extremely hard-working. They’re a group that handles resiliency extremely well. They’re obviously a very tight-knit group”.

Q: You want to move on from talk you could win the draft lottery, but that could happen if you lose in the first round.

A: “That’s not where we’re thinking. If you don’t win that lottery, then it’s still a disappointing season. It’s so far away from where our franchise is at and what we’re trying to do.

“You lose, you get a 12.5% chance of winning the first pick and all of those eight teams get the same chance. To me the probability of losing and then winning the pick is still so low that we don’t really look at it that way.

“Our whole focus is on doing everything we can to try to win 19 games.”

Q: You’ve come through some injuries as mentioned. And what’s the outlook for Andreas Johnsson’s knee injury?

A: “I don’t look at the injuries necessarily as a negative thing because they allowed us to see (defencemen) Rasmus Sandin, Timothy Liljegren and Justin Holl in a role that we thought he might be capable of. He grabbed the wheel with both hands and showed he’s able and certainly capable of playing big minutes in the NHL.

“(Injuries) allowed us to learn about our prospects on defence that will help us as we go into this stage in terms of depth and certainly in the future. I think that the injuries that we had throughout the year were more of a blessing. They forced us to put guys in a higher spot in the lineup like Travis Dermott when Muzzin went out of the lineup.

“Andreas was a six-month timeline. He would be somebody that we could expect to see, if all goes well with the end of his rehab, perhaps beginning at the second round of the actual playoffs to be safe. He’s done well with his rehab, in Gothenburg (Sweden).”

Q: How has the team handled Phase 2, the smaller group practices, and all the restrictions as you enter Phase 3?

A: “I’ve been extremely impressed by the way that all of our players have handled this, which is a voluntary phase; how hard they’ve worked, what they’ve requested from our staff to help them with and their commitment throughout. I know in the long term that will pay off and we’re certainly hopeful that, in the short term here as we get back, that has a great impact on where we’re going as a program.”

Q: Is the team ready for the isolation, the bubble environment and all that goes into the lengthy RTP protocols?

A: “It’s easier for us to see the finish line from Toronto, because of the job (three levels of government) have done to handle the virus. I don’t know what it would feel like to be in a spot where the virus is running rampant.”

Life in quarantine isn’t exactly ideal, regardless of one’s occupation or the size of one’s paycheque.

Feds paved the way for the Blue Jays to set up shop at Rogers Centre for the club’s summer camp, putting in place strict guidelines for players and coaches to follow.

It’s all in anticipation of the team’s 60-game sprint of a season, which is scheduled to begin July 24 in St. Petersburg, Fla., against the Tampa Bay Rays.

In essence, Shaw aired his frustration in a public forum, knowing there’s a chance the Jays may be back in Toronto to play the home portion of their season.

Naturally, his words became a story.

He set the record straight Sunday and from this day moving forward the Shaw Twitter storm is no longer worth discussing, at least it shouldn’t be unless another player goes public.

“It came out a little bit differently than what I probably should have said it,” began Shaw when the inevitable question was raised. “I should have worded it a little bit differently. I was a little bit tone deaf given the situation everybody is in right now. My first tweet, honestly, was relaying information (retweeting a journalist’s report on what the penalties for breaking quarantine could be). When we came up here (Toronto) we thought it would be for two weeks. We weren’t aware it could possibly be the entire summer.

“And the second tweet (“All summer isn’t gonna happen. Not an option”) was out of frustration when I read into it a little bit more. I definitely should have left that one out. Like I said earlier, I was a little tone deaf to the situation. And I apologize for that. At no point was I saying I’m going to break the rules, we’re going to break the rules. We know as a team that that’s not an option. To get through the season everybody is going to have to buy in and everybody is going to have to adhere to the protocols that were set. Honestly, if other teams don’t follow similar protocols, and I know the rules aren’t going to be as strict in the United States as they are up here.

“If other teams don’t follow strict guidelines and police themselves, we’re not going to get through a season anyway. I know everyone is on board with that in the locker room. Me, personally, I was frustrated. I have a place literally a block away from Rogers Centre, which I was hoping to live in this year. It doesn’t look like that’s going to be the case. The rules have kind of changed a little bit from when we first got up here.

“It was kind of the first time I had heard about it that we’d be here all summer. It’s not ideal to live in a hotel for three months. I don’t think anyone would want to be stuck in a hotel room for three months. I personally like to go on walks, get away from work. Nice days like today (Sunday) in Toronto just to walk by the water, but we can’t do that this year. The Canadian government has made that pretty strict and we’re going to have to follow that. I personally will follow that. I know there are strict penalties (a $750,000 fine and potential jail time if seen outside the ball park, which are maximum punishments in the Quarantine Act). Once again I was a little bit tone deaf to the situation … I apologize for that. I take full responsibility and I do not want this to become a distraction, don’t want this to become a story.”

Shaw wanted to quash it and move on, which his Sunday words clearly allows him to do.

In the absence of real games and this COVID cloud hovering over baseball with many inside the game fearing the season won’t have a conclusion, non-baseball items become fodder.

The focus isn’t how Shaw can concentrate on playing third base, now that the decision to switch Vladimir Guerrero Jr. to first base has been made.

It’s not about the rotation or bullpen.

Instead, one is left with issues ranging from where the Jays will play their home games, when a player may decide to opt out, when a positive test gets reported.

Shaw added how sit-down meetings involving players and management were held Saturday to clear the air.

“I definitely feel I’m more informed now than, say, a week ago,’’ he said. “I kind of know what the deal is going forward. I know that they (Blue Jays) are still working with the government to get clearance for the regular season, but coming up here I don’t think anyone thought that we could possibly be here for three months. Everything is kind of happening on the fly right now and we’re going to have to adjust accordingly … Public health, public safety is priority No. 1, team health, team safety is priority No. 2. We have to keep everyone in that locker room safe. You can’t be selfish. I’m definitely more informed now than I was couple days ago.”

The Jays find themselves in a bind, because there aren’t many viable options staring at them.

“I don’t think anyone wants to play in Dunedin (the team’s spring training home). That could be a competitive disadvantage just because of the heat, the weather and the COVID outbreak that’s going on in Florida right now. Options are pretty limited right now. Personally, I like playing in the Rogers Centre. I always have my whole career. It’s looking like as long as we get clearance we can play here. And we’ll just go from there.”

Being in a three-month-long bubble, assuming the Jays play their home games in Toronto, will demand sacrifices and adhering to strict guidelines, which suits Shaw just fine.

“It is a short time. It’s only three months. I think we can get through it.”",[]

For the first time since a win over Rudy Gobert and the Utah Jazz on March 9, the Raptors took the court as a team for a practice in Orlando in advance of the NBA’s season resuming with scrimmages later this month. By all accounts, despite an expected bit of rust, the team looked pretty good.

“It felt good, it’s been awhile,” said starting guard Fred VanVleet. “I think you saw some rust, some excitement, and that first day of school type of thing for everybody, coaches and players,” he said.

“We’ve got to flush some things out these next couple of weeks and get ready to play, but kind of take a marathon approach still, we’ve still got a long way to go.”

VanVleet said he hadn’t yet seen much of the NBA’s setup because the team had just gotten out of quarantine Saturday morning after arriving from their previous training location elsewhere in Florida (where they could only do individual work).

“I think we’ll have more things to do, we’ll kind of walk around and more controlled. When we were in Naples, we couldn’t control everybody else, I think everybody inside of this bubble is under the same guidelines, so that’s probably the biggest difference,” VanVleet said of what life will be like for the team.

On the court, head coach Nick Nurse said he pushed them a little harder than he initially anticipated and there are plenty of things to work on, but, “from a starting point it seems like a really good jumping off point today for us,” Nurse said.

“I started heavier than normal and just told the guys to please self-monitor and let’s not get carried away, we got a long way to go here today.”

Still, Nurse saw what he always does, a smart, savvy, professional group.

“We’ll find a way, we’ll manage a way to do some experimenting as well as we put the pieces of the puzzle back together (during this second training camp),” Nurse said.

“I think that’s going to go fast, I sensed a lot of guys grasping all our set calls and all our defensive coverages, it was pretty good.”

If everything goes smoothly, Toronto will scrimmage against the Houston Rockets on July 24 in the team’s first quasi game action.

Way back in October the Raptors and Rockets opened the pre-season with a pair of games in Japan.

“I never really looked at it that way,” Nurse said.

“That does seem like a long, long time ago, that we were in Tokyo. And we always like to see the Rockets, so we’ll look forward to that first scrimmage.”

But first, there’s quite a bit of work to be done.

NOT EASING IN

Every though it was the first day of practice in months, the competitive juices were immediately flowing for the Raptors.

“It’s good that we’re back here. We just wanna play,” said all-star forward Pascal Siakam.

“Everyone is excited about playing. That’s what you wanna see. It gets a little intense every time you get on the floor. It doesn’t matter how long you were off. Once you get on that floor, the competitive spirit comes out and everyone wants to win, and that’s what you wanna see from a team.”

For one of the only times in 2019-20, the full roster is intact at the moment. Just about every key player, save for OG Anunoby, missed substantial time due to injury.

“We haven’t really had a full team all year, so it will be interesting to see what that looks like for a long stretch of time,” VanVleet said.

The guard added Nurse mixed up the lineups, not playing the expected starting five together on Monday.

WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART

Kyle Lowry was originally slated to address the media on Saturday, but the new plan is a Monday media session, with Marc Gasol going Sunday. Despite being the team’s leaders, most decorated and most experienced veterans, neither has talked since the season shut down months ago, which has forced some teammates like VanVleet, Norman Powell and Siakam to be quite busy fulfilling media obligations.

On another note, Siakam declined to disclose what the back of his jersey would say (the NBA is allowing players to have social justice messages on their jerseys in light of the movements taking place around the world), but said there have been many discussions as a team.

“I’m definitely not the spokesperson for it. I think we have a lot of plans,” Siakam said. “Together as a team we have a whole committee working on it. I think once it’s time, you guys are gonna see what we have. I think everyone is mindful of it from management, ownership, everyone is really involved into it. We just want to do everything we can to make a change. We’re just gonna have to see … You’ll see soon.”

THE PROCESS

The Raptors arrived in Orlando on Thursday and immediately went for testing. They were tested again on Friday night and Nurse said they “got the all-clear around 10:30 or 11 (Saturday) morning.”

He said there was a bit of anxiety and was very thankful everyone was OK.

As for another two days of quarantining? Siakam said it was no big deal.

“I didn’t get out for like three months or two months, so I’m used to it,” he said.

“Two days is nothing. It went by quick, found things to do, like video games, anything I can do to let time fly. And just being ready mentally and being excited about being back together as a team. We just wanna play, man. I miss playing basketball. It definitely felt like a basketball atmosphere (on Saturday), and that’s all I really care about.”

Home being their own bubble of teammates and staff, their hotel rooms, the practice gym and the odd trip to the cafeteria for meals.

Certainly head coach Nick Nurse and rookie Terence Davis, the two Raptors made available to the media Sunday following practice have no immediate desire to see the sights just now.

“Getting out on campus, it’s not really ideal right now,” Davis said. “I’m just trying to get the hang of things and how things are going, like breakfast is sometimes in my room and sometimes it’s in the meal room. So, just really getting the hang of things right now. Maybe I’ll venture out but right now it’s really about business.”

Nurse is taking a similar cautious approach.

“I have not been out to look around, I did take the outside path down to the meal room last night, but that was just right along the same hallway, that was as far as I ventured outside, I’m not planning on doing much looking around, to be honest with you,” Nurse said. “I’m good with working and getting back to the room, to be honest with you.”

These are early days in the bubble and you can’t blame the Raptors for being careful. Unlike a lot of teams coming into the bubble, they did so fully healthy without a single positive case for coronavirus among them.

The plan is to keep it that way so it only makes sense to keep their distance early on until the testing ferrets out any potential unhealthy bubble dwellers.

EASING INTO ACTION

The Raptors on the court are also taking an early cautious approach easing into activity after the extended, for them unnatural, break from strenuous physical activity.

Nurse is taking things nice and slowly for his returning players and letting them tell him when they’ve had enough.

“I’ve asked the guys to really self-monitor themselves, especially the veteran guys and ease into things here a little bit,” the Raptors head coach said. “I’ve tried to get to kind of the majority of the action early in practice to avoid fatigue and get to the main part, I think they need to play.

“Marc (Gasol) went for a good stretch of practice, the main bits and just like I suggested, took himself out to kind of ease into it. I think OG (Anunoby) did later on in the practice as well. Just again, I’m really leaving it to them, they know their bodies best and how they’re feeling.”

Nurse remains very happy with what he has seen from his team.

“Intensity was super high, I thought, especially for this early in the morning and it was a good one, a good effort and again just getting a lot of things in,” he said. “Pretty happy, just looking at some of our foundational stuff, I see it already appearing so it’s a good start for two days.”

SETTING THE BAR

Not only do the Raptors have their championship pedigree to sell to would-be free agents, but their reputation as a franchise that goes the extra mile for its staff and players is getting plenty of attention these days.

The buses the team used to roll up from Naples to Orlando were one of those things. Painted up with ‘Black Lives Matter’ on both sides of their transport from Naples, the buses caught the attention of Sixers guard Matisse Thybulle, who is doing a podcast from inside the bubble.

Thybulle is on the phone with a teammate who asks him “You seen the bus for the Toronto Raptors, man?”

Thybulle responds “Yeah, amazing, amazing.”

His teammate then says “Our team has to do something man.”

The Raptors burnished their own well-thought-of reputations within their own team as well when the staff had framed photographs of each team member and his family waiting for them in their hotel rooms when they checked in.

“They had pictures set up, one of me and my son and then one of all my family members at a college game,” Davis said. “It meant a lot, man. It felt like they really care. Just seeing the pictures, it was heart-warming. Obviously I miss my son every day, just being without him, but one day he’ll understand what daddy does for a living.”

Small things, but things players take notice of and remember when making that all important decision about where they might like to play should they ever get to that level.",[]

The current New York Mets player took to Twitter to tear into ex-Blue Jays teammate Randal Grichuk after Grichuk supported an accusation made by Aubrey Huff that Stroman once treated minor league players poorly.

According to Huff, during 2019 spring training, Stroman asked the Jays’ strength coach to kick out 30 minor league players from the weight room in order to have it to himself to jump rope.

Grichuk liked Huff’s tweet, adding that was a known story “around players in the Jays team/system.”

You’ve done nothing but talk about me behind my back. Consistently. I’ve always kept my mouth shut and let it slide. Ask YOUR teammates and Canada who they rather have on their team…you or me. I already know the answer. Continue to under achieve and talk shit about teammates! — Marcus Stroman (@STR0) July 11, 2020

Stroman then went on the attack, stating that Grichuk has “done nothing but talk about me behind my back” consistently.

“I’ve always kept my mouth shut and let it slide,” said Stroman. “Ask YOUR teammates and Canada who they rather have on their team … you or me. I already know the answer. Continue to under achieve and talk s— about teammates!”

Grichuk is no stranger when it comes to Twitter beefs with fellow MLB players. He and Stroman continued to trade barbs.

“Haha keep thinking that’s true,” he said. “Don’t be mad at me because I liked a tweet that was the truth. Have a good day my man.”

Stroman managed to get the last word.

“My day is beyond great. Good luck playing for a nation that now knows your true colours. Have a splendid day my G!” said Stroman.

Stroman played for the Blue Jays for five seasons before being traded to the Mets in 2019. As a Jay, Stroman posted a 3.76 ERA.

Day has low score theory,"['Jon Mccarthymore Jon Mccarthy', 'More Jon Mccarthy', 'Joseph Maiorana', 'Usa Today Sports', 'Published', 'July', 'Updated', 'Pm Edt Filed Under', 'Toronto Sun', 'Sports']",2020-07-13 02:40:31+00:00,"The PGA Tour restart has been thrilling, but the Workday Charity Open took the excitement to a new level Sunday — even without fans, and even with the leaders teeing off at 9 a.m. to avoid an ominous afternoon weather forecast.

As storm clouds finally rolled into Muirfield Village in Ohio shortly before 3 p.m., 23-year-old Collin Morikawa prevailed on the third playoff hole over Justin Thomas to win for the second time of his young career.

“It was crazy,” Morikawa said just after his round. “I got off to a really good start, and thinking back, 75 holes is a lot more than 72 for sure, especially the last three in sudden death. I just knew I had to go low. Justin wasn’t going to give it to me.”

It was a day full of numerous lead changes, but the pair headed to extra holes deadlocked at 19-under par after world No. 5 Thomas blew a three-shot lead, including a missed birdie putt on the 72nd green.

Playing the 18th hole for the second time of the day, the 27-year-old Thomas looked to have redeemed himself, draining perhaps the loudest putt ever on an empty golf course with a 50-foot birdie bomb on the first playoff hole. The 12-time tour winner screamed, “C’MON!” and the pressure switched to Morikawa who followed it up with a 25-foot birdie putt of his own to stay alive.

Playing the 18th for the third time of the day, Thomas had a nine-foot birdie putt to win on playoff hole No. 2, but missed, sending the duo to the 10th tee for another extra hole.

Thomas showed little control over his tee shots late in the round and it finally stung him when his drive finished directly behind a tree, while Morikawa found the fairway. Thomas was forced to punch out with his second shot, and Morikawa — whose iron play is among the best on tour — hit another wonderful approach that finished just nine feet from the hole.

A day full of drama ended quietly when Thomas missed his par putt, leaving Morikawa to two-putt from nine feet for the victory.

“It’s completely unacceptable to give up a three-shot lead with three to go,” Thomas said. “I’m upset, I’m disappointed in myself, but at the end of the day it’s over with now, and I just need to take some time this afternoon and tonight to build on it and figure out what I can do better going into next week.”

Morikawa becomes the first to two wins of the superstar-in-the-making class of youngsters that includes Viktor Hovland and Matthew Wolff. The Los Angeles native, who starred at the University of California, began his career by making an incredible 22 cuts in a row before finally missing one at the Travelers Championship two weeks ago. It’s safe to say Morikawa made amends and he now has more PGA tour wins (2) than missed cuts (1).

With majors around the corner, it’s also safe to say the kids have arrived.

“This is a huge kind of stepping-stone,” Morikawa said. “We got No. 1 out of the way, we got No. 2, let the gates just open and let’s just keep going.”

The playoff almost wasn’t to be when Morikawa nearly lipped-out a two-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. It brought back memories of the Charles Schwab Challenge that kicked off the tour’s restart where Morikawa missed a three-foot putt to lose in a playoff against Daniel Berger.

Hovland finished alone in third at 15-under par. Chase Seiffert finished one shot further back at 14 under. Gary Woodland and Ian Poulter rounded out the top five at 12 under.

The Workday Charity Open was a one-off event to replace the cancelled John Deere Classic, and the PGA Tour will stay at Muirfield Village another week as Jack Nicklaus’ Memorial Tournament begins Thursday. It will be the same golf course but a different tournament as organizers promise to bring faster greens and longer rough — not to mention Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.

OH, CANADA

The week began with great promise for Canadians at the tournament with Adam Hadwin and Nick Taylor sitting in second and third place, respectively, after the opening round. In fact, all six Canucks in the field were in red numbers after Thursday’s round.

The weekend wasn’t great, though, as none of them broke 70 on moving day Saturday, with only Roger Sloan under par for the third round. Both Hadwin and Taylor shot 4-over 76s on Saturday to shoot themselves off the leaderboard.

Sloan was the top Canadian for the week, finishing at 7 under and in a tie for 27th. Hadwin was the low Canuck on Sunday with a 4-under 68 to finish at 5 under for the week and in a tie for 35th. Corey Conners finished the week at 4 under, while Taylor and Mackenzie Hughes finished at 3-under par. David Hearn missed the cut.

Hadwin, Taylor, Conners and Hughes are in the field at this week’s Memorial Tournament.

TIGER TEASING

Thomas was feeling good enough about his game on the weekend at Muirfield to take a few shots at his pal Tiger.

Woods is making his PGA Tour restart debut this week at the Memorial, a tournament he has won five times.

Thomas said he hasn’t seen the 15-time major winner since he was an on-course analyst for the Woods-Mickelson/Brady-Manning match in May.

“I’m glad that he’s finally coming back out,” Thomas said. “I think he was starting to get a little sassy, I was telling him he’s scared to come out and play against all of us when he’s sitting at home just trying to give him a hard time. But yeah, we’re excited to have him out.”

Woods hasn’t played a tournament since the Genesis Invitational five months ago, having skipped the WGC Mexico Championship, the Honda Classic, the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship with a sore back.

DAY’S LOW-SCORE THEORY

Jason Day has an idea about why scores have been so low during the PGA Tour restart. The former World No. 1 thinks that many players are playing with an unusual calm because the tour has stated that nobody will lose their tour playing status at the end of this strange COVID-19 interrupted season. He also thinks the lack of fans makes it easier for young players.

“That’s why you see a lot of names that usually probably aren’t there that are up there playing well,” Day said. “They have a free year in regards to they don’t have to worry about keeping their card because they’ve got a card through to the end of next season. There’s no fans out here. I think the fans add a lot more pressure to the actual event. So I’m missing the fans. There’s guys out here that are just kind of free-wheeling it because of those two factors.”

After missing three of four cuts during the restart, the 33-year-old Day shot a 5-under 67 on Sunday to finish at 11 under and in a tie for seventh giving him some optimism heading into this week’s event. Day managed to to finish inside the top 10 despite hitting seven balls in the water over the week.",[]

Fortunately for all concerned, there were no major injuries.

In the final race of the afternoon, the three-year-old bay filly Society’s Story got out of the gate from the No. 3 position in good shape. But not long into the race, she suddenly veered to her left sharply and crashed into the rail, dislodging her jockey Darryll Holland in the process.

Thankfully, both the horse and rider escaped serious injury.

“He’s OK, just bruised up,” said Mike Luider, Holland’s agent. “He went home under his own steam.”

Society’s Story is owned by Joey Gee Thoroughbreds, trained by Terry Brooker and had posted a pair of second-place showings at Woodbine this season.

Holland joined the Woodbine jockey colony full time this season and has two wins, has placed second five times and has been third five times in 54 starts heading into Sunday’s races.

The English rider has ridden some great horses in his career, most notably Falbrav, who won the Queen Elizabeth (G1), Eclipse (G1) and International Stakes (G1), all in 2003.

The 47-year-old jock brought his tack to Woodbine this season after competing all over the world. Holland has been one of Europe’s top jockeys for the past two decades and has won Group 1 races in more than a dozen nations. He was Great Britain’s top apprentice in 1991.

The circus that is the MLS is Back tournament.

Since Major League Soccer kick-started the continuation of its season last Wednesday with a World Cup-style tournament at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, the event has been plagued by coronavirus-related nightmares — with Toronto FC caught in the middle of this unfunny clown show.

Early Sunday morning, the scheduled match between TFC and D.C. United was postponed. Under the league’s health and safety protocols, clubs are tested the day before each match. The results of Saturday’s tests for D.C. United and Toronto FC produced an initial unconfirmed positive COVID-19 case for a D.C. United player and an inconclusive test for a Toronto player, resulting in the postponement of Sunday’s game.

Both teams participated in another round of testing Sunday and the players from the two clubs tested negative. The TFC-D.C. United game will now be played Monday morning at 9 a.m.

The D.C. United player who tested positive and the Toronto player whose test was inconclusive will undergo additional testing and will not play in Monday’s match.

The Reds’ second group stage match against the Montreal Impact has been moved to Thursday at 8 p.m. and, if the TFC player tests negative a second time, he can play in that game. The match against Montreal was originally scheduled for Wednesday.

TFC GM Ali Curtis did not disclose the name of the Toronto player whose first test was inconclusive. That player will not play in Monday’s game and is currently in isolation.

“These days, nothing’s really normal. If anything, the normal is uncertainty,” Curtis said on a Zoom call Sunday night. “You just have to adapt.

“I think the (TFC) staff and the players have done a good job of that,” he added. “We’re excited to play and to compete and we’ve got a group that have been through a lot of different moments in different times. But they love football, they love to play and so we’re excited about (Monday) and look forward to the challenge.”

Curtis said the club learned of the Toronto player’s inconclusive (or presumptive positive) test around midnight on Saturday, adding that the player in question was not experiencing any symptoms.

“I think we’re all trying to wrap our heads around this and get prepared for the game,” said Curtis, who added that his confidence level with the safety protocols at the MLS is Back tournament is “very high” and that the team is comfortable in their own little hotel bubble.

“It’s an important competition. A lot of people put a lot of work and effort into preparing for (the tournament) it so it’s important that we represent the club and our city as best as we can.”

Still, one has to question the sanity of continuing the MLS is Back tournament in Florida. FC Dallas and Nashville SC withdrew after several of their players tested positive for COVID-19 just before their first matches, forcing cancellations of games.

A number of MLS players — including five from the Vancouver Whitecaps — have opted out of the tournament because of anxiety over COVID-19 or for personal reasons and other players have tested positive.

To top it off, the state of Florida on Sunday reported a record 15,300 new COVID-19 cases, the most by any state in a single day since the pandemic reached the United States. Yet MLS continues to take the Animal House “All is well” approach to the event.

“We believe the tournament can still be conducted safely,” MLS deputy commissioner Mark Abbott insisted. “And if at the point we determine it can’t, obviously we would make a decision then.”

TFC and D.C. United were originally supposed to play last Friday night, but the match was postponed to Sunday morning after Toronto arrived in Florida late after a member of the “travel party” came down with “symptoms”.

TFC coach Greg Vanney has expressed some real concerns about being in Florida – even though the clubs are in the so-called “bubble” at the ESPN complex. Neither Vanney nor his players are impressed with the 9 a.m. starts of some of their scheduled games.

The tournament is being held behind closed doors from July 8 to August 11 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The tournament features a group stage, which will count toward the 2020 MLS regular-season standings, followed by knockout rounds. The tournament champion will qualify for the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League and the 2020 season is scheduled to resume upon completion of the tournament.",[]
83,torontosun,https://driving.ca/column/lorraine/lorraine-explains-hate-speed-cameras-just-dont-speed/,Lorraine Explains: Hate speed cameras? Just don't speed,"['Lorraine Sommerfeld', 'Hours Ago', 'Share Story', 'Jack Boland']",2020-07-13 10:23:05+00:00,"Speed cameras are money traps. Same with red-light cameras, hidden radar traps, or getting a ticket when you’re in a no-parking zone even though you had your four-way flashers on. Waaah. Shut up.

Effective at the end of last year, Ontario made it legal for all municipalities to install speed cameras in school zones and designated community safety zones if they wanted to. Most are. I certainly hope they’re smart enough to recognize that seniors bear the brunt of our pedestrian fatalities, and that they decide they should protect them, too.

While a global pandemic that would drain government coffers was just a twinkle in our eye back when the bill was passed, there’s no arguing speed cameras are an easy way to start to replenish them, even a little. The proof will be in where they show up, and if they are indeed being used to protect the most vulnerable.

While the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in some interesting changes on our roadways – speeders way, way up, but pedestrian fatalities way, way down – most came about due, no doubt, to the rapid, extensive reduction of vehicles actually on the road.

The speed camera discussions that were paused are now back in full force. Major cities everywhere struggle with the fact it’s seemingly impossible to get those piloting cars and SUVs to slow down and stop killing pedestrians and cyclists. Lowered speed limits, traffic calming zones, and campaigns like Vision Zero are really a bunch of carrots. Cameras that indiscriminately record those breaking the law and send out a ticket? There’s the stick you need.

Five years ago I wrote that instigating 30 km/h speed limits was a noble but futile exercise unless you were going to enforce it. Constantly. Roads are engineered for certain speeds, and artificially dropping that speed makes little sense to our caveman brains. You don’t do 60 km/h in a parking lot, because your brain tells you you can’t. But a broad boulevard? We need a reason other than “because we said so” to gain consistent, predictable responses. Threat of a ticket for going even one kilometre over the limit is the reason.

The new fines in Ontario will be $5 per km/h over, from one to 19 km/h over; $7.50 per for 20 to 29 km/h over; $12 each click for 30 to 49 km/h over; and if you hit 50 kilometres over, see ya in court. Tickets will be mailed out to the registered owner of the car. Because of that, no demerits will apply, and your insurance won’t be impacted. This will trigger some interesting dinner conversations for those who let others drive their cars.

The fact it can take 23 days for the ticket to land in your mailbox is the world’s worst pregnant pause. If you hide a ticket from the registered owner (if I’m a kid, you better believe I’m considering that) know that come sticker renewal time, unpaid fines will stop the process.

There is no better reason to launch speed cameras than the fact we need to better protect our most vulnerable road users. People do slow down when they know they will face financial consequences otherwise.

Lowered speed limits and traffic calming zones are really a bunch of carrots—cameras that record law-breakers and send out a ticket? There’s the stick you need

They are never a popular political decision, though a four-year British study by the Royal Automobile Club Foundation found two things: the cameras reduce fatalities; and decommissioning the cameras can raise them again. Their findings were consistent with 17 similar studies. Shorter version: if people know the cameras are there, they adjust their behaviour accordingly. When they know they’re not, they revert to form.

Many of us say in a perfect policing world, there would be no bias in who gets pulled over, who gets a warning, who gets nailed for the whole thing.

Cameras don’t give a toot who is behind the wheel, making this option a seemingly perfect solution to busting speeders. But we have to flip it over and look on the other side. With no demerits or insurance implications, it favours those who can buy their way out of the situation. I worked for a rich guy once who considered his (insane) speeding simply the cost of doing business. There goes your egalitarian compromise out the sunroof.

Alberta is revamping their speed camera operations at this time, making sure the focus is on safety and avoiding the look of a cash grab. Or trying to. There are those who will forever see cameras – including red light and speed ones – as only that.

My own thinking has evolved over the past twenty years as I realize manufacturers are making vehicles that allow us to walk away from crashes that once would have been fatal; we persist in finding ways to kill each other anyway. Cameras are being installed in designated community safety and school zones; there are signs pointing them out to you; word goes out when they’re going to move them. If this is a “gotcha,” I was taught the wrong meaning of the word.

Will I be writing in this space soon that I’ve received a speeding ticket caught on camera? Maybe. It’s not hard to go a few kilometres over the limit. But our streets need to be made safer, and because we believe we need cars to be travelling in the same spaces as unprotected road users, we brought this on ourselves.",[]

We’ve delved into each of the five models available in today’s so-called ‘half-ton’ class, choosing specs designed to help customers get the job done, not impress the neighbours. Where possible, the trucks in this list will have four-wheel-drive and an eight-foot bed.

Why? The former is needed to claw oneself out of places like the muddy land around Firebag in northern Alberta; while the latter remains a standard for getting work done.

In what might be a world-first for a post about trucks, we’re gonna quote RuPaul: you better work.

Note: The MSRPs listed here are lifted straight from manufacturer build-and-price sites for 2020 models, exclusive of freight, taxes, and available rebates.

Ford F-150 XL 4×4 — $37,639

It’s not a stretch to estimate the Ford F-150 is available in tens of millions of configurations, at least when one counts individual options and paint choices. The new 2021 F-150 was recently revealed to much fanfare, complete with gee-whiz features and more luxury than ever.

Fortunately for the use-’em-for-work crowd, it’s still available as a regular-cab pickup with an eight-foot box. And, yes, we’re well aware the image shown here is of a Crew Cab; it’s the most basic exterior image the Blue Oval has released of the 2021 model. Check the regular-cab XL interior below.

What we do know is Ford has promised even the most basic work trucks will come equipped with a 4-inch productivity screen in the instrument cluster; and an 8-inch center stack touchscreen. We look forward to seeing this for ourselves. This pairs well with selectable drive modes, SYNC 4 infotainment, and a wireless phone connection. Powertrains for the new truck seem to be similar to 2020, save for the new hybrid, so we’ll look to that model year for guidance.

If choosing XL 4×4 trim and the base 290-hp 3.3L V6 engine, be sure to select the 3.73 electronic-locking rear axle. At just $500, it adds well over a ton of towing capacity, maxing out at 7,400 lbs. The $235 BoxLink cargo management system and its locking cleats aren’t a bad idea, either.

Ram 1500 Classic ST 4×4 — $44,615

At Ram, the naming conventions are slightly murky and require a bit of explaining. The company is currently in the throes of making two completely separate 1500-series pickup trucks: one that was new last year; and one that still uses a body style introduced in 2009. Only the latter is available for 2020 in a regular cab with an eight-foot box. The base engine here is a 3.6L 295-hp V6 mated to an eight-speed automatic.

Ram doesn’t seem to offer different rear axle ratios in this spec of truck but does list an anti-spin diff as a $525 option. For $700, Ram will upgrade the ST to a Tradesman which includes a towing hitch and boxliner. Annoyingly, cloth seats are an extra-charge option, bringing floor carpet with them. Good thing the latter can be deleted separately.

They also have the good taste to place a broad colour palette on the base ST, though the unlovely black plastic ‘face’ only blends well with black or grey paint. This is true for all entry-level trucks from the Detroit Three, however.

Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra WT 4×4 — $35,498/$36,698

The twins from General Motors are virtually identical in terms of their mechanicals, though the styling choices are quite different. Both of them are equipped with a 4.3L 285-hp V6 engine as standard Work Truck equipment, paired with a six-speed automatic and active fuel management technology that can shut down a bank of cylinders to save on go-juice.

The beds of the Chevy and GMC trucks are peppered with a dozen tie-downs and boast a wider maximum width on its load floor than Ford or Ram. A single rear axle ratio is offered, meaning all Silverado/Sierra pickups of this configuration can tow 7,700 lbs. Cloth seats show up at no extra charge, while the grand sum of $450 imbues the thing with a factory tow hitch and guidance lines in the rear-view camera display.

An optional Work Truck Package including tough skid plates and a more robust air filter (offered on its own for $40) is advertised at $230 but requires the selection of different tires. If one does check this box, go for the more aggressive LT-rated all-terrain tires for maximum traction. An automatic-locking Eaton-branded rear diff is available as a standalone option for $450.

Toyota Tundra Double Cab 4×4 — $46,420

The crew at Toyota doesn’t offer the four-wheel drive Tundra as a regular cab truck anymore, forcing the selection of a Double Cab model with a 6.5-ft bed. This also brings a 5.7L 381-hp V8 engine, helping to explain the price differential between this rig and the rest of the pickups on this list. Unlike those workhorses, few individual powertrain options are provided, leaving us to talk about dealer-installed accessories such as a $600 performance air intake system.

For the sake of $290, spec the SX package, which does little for its work ethic but adds fog lamps and colour-keyed addenda. It does, however, add 18-inch tires. Do note that if four-wheel-drive is not an absolute necessity (a no-go area for most, we know) then the Tundra is available in 2020 as a Double Cab with an eight-foot box. This unicorn will likely be a special order truck and is priced a hefty $6,000 south of the 4×4 Double Cab.

Nissan Titan Crew Cab S 4×4 — $50,498

Like the Toyota, this built-in-Mississippi Titan is no longer available as a regular cab long box pickup. Its entry-level model is called the S and has the brand’s 5.6L 400-hp V8 stuffed under its hood. Note that accessing all those horses requires premium fuel. A new nine-speed automatic takes care of shifting duties.

There are no optional packages on the base S, let alone any that improve the truck in meaningful work-related ways. This is thanks to the company streamlining its models for ease of choice (and production), meaning all Titans can tow around 9,000 lbs or bear a payload of 1,580 lbs. Nissan’s comprehensive warranty is longest in terms of distance when compared to other half-ton pickups, stretching to 160,000 km.",[]

This is the basis of my theory that most of shoppers buy their vehicle first, and then find out some time later how well its headlights perform — or don’t.

Headlight performance is a vital part of safety and driver comfort, but most never actually try them out before buying. Good headlights can make all the difference, especially if you’re frequently out and about after dark. On a long, nighttime drive, the performance of your car’s lighting system can play a major role in safety, alertness, eye fatigue, and your overall well being.

My dad is a thrifty guy, but as a kid, he taught me there are three things you don’t cheap out on: winter boots, tires, and headlight bulbs. This is probably why for years, I’ve been fascinated by headlight performance and tech. When I was a kid, it was halogen bulbs in everything — they create light by running current through a wire to heat it up, so it glows bright white and hot. Halogen lighting is cheap and useful, but also has to be replaced relatively often since they burn out.

Next came high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, which worked by creating an electric arc in a capsule of gas — creating lighting in a bottle, literally. This tech was the foundation of the majority of high-end automotive lighting systems for a very long time.

Today, the light-emitting diode (LED) is an increasingly common means of lighting the road ahead. They’re made of special materials that emit plenty of light when even just a little bit of current is applied. Also, LEDs last a very long time, don’t get hot, and are highly energy efficient. Best of all, they pack a highly illuminating punch for their size, meaning you can get more light from a physically smaller system that fits into a tighter space. This expands the possibilities for styling and shaping the front end of your ride.

LED lighting is common nowadays, and most systems are very good. Awestruck, I first encountered LED headlights in an Audi R8 quite some years ago, but today, they’re standard kit in a very wide range of vehicles you and I can afford. See, cars like the R8 serve as a technological gene pool from which future products will draw. Once the stuff of big-dollar premium machinery, the LED headlight is basically everywhere today.

And that’s good news for you, if you’re buying a new (or recent used) car. First, it was the Acura ILX. Then, the Mazda CX-9 and Ford Mustang. One by one, month by month, I started to notice really good headlights becoming more common at lower price points, and across more and more of the 50-ish vehicles I review each year.

A 2017 Toyota Corolla really drove the point home: on one evening drive, I remember thinking the LED headlamps in this $25,000 Corolla were performing in the same ballpark as what I’d observed in a nearly six-figure Mercedes just a few days earlier. More recently, the Nissan Kicks (about $23,000) impressed with a very powerful-for-the-price LED lighting system. Ditto the new Chevrolet Silverado and Hyundai Sonata, and especially the Jeep Wrangler.

A $995 option on my tester, the Wrangler’s optional LED lighting package parks drivers behind the same sort of clean, vivid, thick white light I expect from a twice-the-price BMW. Sure, they’re not exactly giving away Wranglers — but the point is that you used to have to pay six figures for lighting this good, and today, you can find it for under $30,000 all day long.

So, by putting better lighting than ever at lower price points than ever, you get added confidence on after-dark drives, improved safety, and better return on your investment. Better lighting helps sell cars, too — even indirectly. Nowadays, earning certain coveted safety ratings requires a strong performance from a vehicle’s safety and structural systems, as well as its headlights.

Not all lighting systems are equal, though, LED or otherwise. Numerous variables affect how the lighting system in your car performs, but you know it when you see it. Personally, I look for three things.

First is how much light I get into culverts and treelines beside the highway, and how far it reaches into my peripheral vision. That’s vital for early warning of wildlife that could be planning to sprint in front of you, which is a big deal in northern Ontario, where I’m from.

Second, the colour. Great lights give off a clean, pure, white light that’s as clean and bright as a welding flash. Where some lighting systems give off dull orange or yellow hues, a great lighting system’s pure white light helps fend off eye fatigue and improve alertness, as you’ll be straining less to see details far up the road.

Third? Reach. How far ahead can I see? How far ahead are reflective signs engaged, and how strongly? Does turning on the high beams affect the lighting directly in front of the car? Am I being flashed for dazzling other drivers? A headlight system with a strong reach that doesn’t irritate other drivers is a beautiful thing.

One final note: online owner forums or Facebook communities can be a great place to post questions about a model you’re considering buying. If you like, you could join one such group and ask the owners what they think of the night-time drive of the model you’re considering.

I’ll leave you with a partial gallery of the best lighting systems I’ve encountered on recent test-drives. This list is based solely on test drives made in the past two to three years, and includes models with standard or optionally-installed LED lighting provisions.",[]
86,torontosun,https://driving.ca/volkswagen/features/feature-story/pitch-perfect-volkswagens-best-ads-through-history/,Pitch Perfect: Volkswagen’s best ads through history,"['Coleman Molnar', 'Day Ago', 'Share Story']",2020-07-12 11:06:27+00:00,"Much can and has been written about Volkswagen’s history in advertising. Whole books exist on the topic, in fact.

The brand’s advertising story begins in earnest in the late ’50s and early ’60s, with the Volkswagen North America ads created by Manhattan advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernback (DDB). With a nominal budget, DDB adopted a clever, minimalist approach that resulted in fresh ads that cut through the clutter with a tone bordering on self-deprecation.

Since then, the VW-DBB romance (which still burns today) has churned out dozens of witty, funny or otherwise evocative advertising content in print and video around the world.

Here’s a look back at some of the automotive giant’s most memorable and impactful advertising across all mediums throughout the years. Don’t see your favourite Volkswagen commercial on the list? Drop a link in the comments!

Think Small

1959, print

This is it, the ad that changed it all. And not just for the Beetle, which was trying to shake its reputation as a car made in Nazi Germany; or for Volkswagen; or for DDB, but for the entire advertising industry. The simple, barren ad concept that utilized nearly a full page of white space flew in the face of typical print ads of the time, which were inundated with details, information and fantastical proposals.

Lemon

1959, print

Another product of the brilliant DDB team lead by creative director Bill Bernbach, and released at the same time as the “Think Small” ad, the “Lemon” print run positions the Beetle as a premium product by owning up to the rigorous final inspection process which combed back one in 50 cars, the “lemons,” for adjustment.

Dustin Hoffman

1966, television

Here’s a fun fact: Before Dustin Hoffman was an Academy Award winner, he was a commercial actor for Volkswagen. At the age of 29, with a few off-Broadway gigs and nominal TV appearances under his belt, the 5’6” actor was used to demonstrate the roominess of the Volkswagen Fastback Sedan.

Wilt Chamberlain

1966, television and print

VW also leaned on some celebrities from the sporting world for its ’60s television campaigns. This ad shows Wilt Chamberlain attempting and failing to shoehorn his 7-foot frame into the driver’s seat of the Beetle.

“When 7’1” Wilt Chamberlain tried to get into a Volkswagen, people said it couldn’t be done. It couldn’t,” ran the copy. But then Bill Cunningham hops in the driver’s seat, showing there is enough room for an average 6’6” person.

Changes

1987, television

To launch the second generation of the Golf, Volkswagen hired model Paula Hamilton to play the part of a distraught wife in the midst of a possession cleanse. She discards her wedding ring, tosses her pearl necklace and brooch, gives the cat the stink eye, and is about to throw her car keys down a storm drain when she hesitates. The video ends with her driving away, smiling and the line “If only everything in life was as reliable as a Volkswagen.”

David Kramer South Africa

1990, television

In something of a departure from the brand’s other hit ads, VW South Africa wrote a fun little diddy, hired South African comedian David Kramer, and filmed this ridiculous ballad to the 4X4 Volkswagen Bus Syncro. Is it clever? Not particularly. Will you watch it twice in a row and then send it to your buddy who owns a Vanagon? Definitely.

Un-pimp Your Ride

2006, television

Fast-forward to the arrival of the 21st century and Volkswagen’s ads remain in tandem step with pop culture. For the “Unpimp Your Auto” series, heavily accented actor Peter Stormare spoofs on a popular TV show at the time, Pimp My Ride, by destroying some early 2000s-bro-stereotypes’ flashy aftermarket specials and presenting them with some proper German engineering. Here’s the whole series in one YouTube cut.

Old Lady

2011, television

DDB Amsterdam hit a home run by playing off another stereotype: the old lady driver. The ad suggests the young man shopping with his father is about to get the deal of the decade by scooping up a gently used Golf, but then we flash back and see the car’s usage wasn’t all that “gentle” at all. The Dutch phrase at the end translates to “Not every old lady is as reliable as the Golf.”

Fast Just Got Faster

2016, print

When the three-door, no-longer-for-North-America Scirocco got beefed up in 2016, DDB Germany conveyed the message with the captivating and kind of unsettling visual of an ostrich wearing a hoodie made from cheetah fur. You just can’t unsee this.

Lemons to Lemonade

2019, print and video

After Dieselgate rocked VW down to its ethos in 2015, the brand took some time to take space before owning up to it in its advertising. But when it did, the self awareness felt very on-brand indeed. “Our biggest mistake has led to the biggest transformation in the company’s history,” Jim Zabel, VW of America’s senior VP of marketing, said in an interview about the campaign’s message and the company’s movement toward electric power.

The print version made the best of the bad situation by updating the iconic “Lemon” Beetle ad with a “Lemonade” tag for the I.D. Buzz. It was supplemented by an even more sombre video component.",[]

That’s it, that’s the whole article.

But seriously, Elon Musk is no stranger to completely wacky Tweets. Recently, he Tweeted about a new product that Tesla was selling, and you might expect that it would be something related to the vehicles that the company sells, such as an over-the-air update, a new feature, or perhaps even a new game for the giant touchscreen.

Nope.

It’s a pair of short shorts with “S3XY” written across the rear, those letters of course chosen for the four models of vehicles that Tesla sells, the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y.

He actually made the price $69.420, which is admittedly hilarious, but it doesn’t even make sense.

It’s not the dumbest product Elon has ever put on sale either, a few years ago he sold a flame thrower branded with the logo from his Boring Company. There’s nothing boring about a flame thrower, even if it really was just a glorified barbecue starter.

However, it sure isn’t the dumbest thing he’s ever Tweeted. He has made countless nerdy posts, meme posts, and some over the top WTF posts, but some of his Tweets have actually caused real damage to his image and his companies’.

Elon even said himself in an interview with his biographer: “You can either say things that are not controversial at all, and then you’re boring, and nobody cares. Some of the things I say, I would like to retract them. It’s not like I stand by all the tweets I’ve ever done. Some of them were definitely extremely dumb.”

So as per Elon’s review of his own page, we’ve decided to do a deep dive, and find some of those tweets that were “extremely dumb”.

Here are five of Elon Musk’s dumbest Tweets.

“Tesla stock price is too high imo”

Tesla stock price is too high imo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

They say opinions are like buttholes, everybody has one. We’re guessing that a lot of people thought that Elon Musk was a pretty big opinion when he Tweeted that the value of Tesla stock was too high, causing it to drop drastically.

This just seems like a terrible thing to say about your own company. While it might be the opinion of some investors or stock experts, we would guess that it’s generally bad business practice to tell everybody that has a stake in your company that it’s worth too much.

Mere minutes after this Tweet was sent out, the stock price dropped by $15, and then by $30.

Whether or not Musk actually meant for the price to go down as a result of this tweet, this is a shining example of the power of social media.

“Will own no house.”

I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2020

Following some kind of incoherent string of Tweets starting with the previous one on this list, Elon continued to say stranger and stranger things until he reached this doozy, saying that he would be selling almost all of his stuff.

We don’t want to jump to conclusions, but Elon Musk is no stranger to the bud. This is definitely the kind of rambling that we would expect after somebody took a drag from a left handed cigarette, or possibly enjoyed a special brownie.

This was Tweeted right after he had his fifth(?) child, the first with his girlfriend Grimes. In a separate Tweet following this one, he said that his girlfriend is mad at him for the post, and rightly so. How would you feel if right after you had a child with somebody, they told you that they were going to sell all of their possessions and own no house? Mad enough to name your kid after an airplane, I guess.

“The coronavirus panic is dumb”

The coronavirus panic is dumb — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 6, 2020

We understand that most Americans are sick of this horrible global pandemic that we’re all having to deal with, but unfortunately being tired of something isn’t a good enough reason to ignore safety rules and potentially cause it to be prolonged. When has the United States ever listened to common sense though?

Elon Musk’s fans can only be described as fanatic, and will hang on every word that he says, whether it’s good or bad. So for him to publicly downplay a worldwide deadly illness, it’s damaging to the overall efforts that are going to preventing its spread.

Hopefully nobody read this tweet and thought, “Yeah, you’re right Elon!” And if you did think that, go ahead and stuff your head in a dustbin for the remainder of the pandemic, at least you won’t transfer any germs.

“Pedo guy”

In 2018, a group of children in Thailand were trapped in a cave after the water level rose too high. A rescue effort was started to use divers to bring the children out one by one.

After making a bunch of empty promises to help the stuck children, Elon decided instead to just publicly dump on everybody involved in the rescue on Twitter. Great strategy, billionaire.

This tweet was so stupid that Elon deleted it, but luckily once something has been put on the internet, it can never truly be deleted. A screenshot was taken of the Tweet, where Elon calls a life-saving diver a “pedo guy”, which has to be in the hall of fame for one of the dumbest statements ever, let alone tweets.

This tweet was so dumb that it actually got Musk sued for defamation of character, and honestly, we think he deserved it.

Sex tape Autopilot

Turns out there’s more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2019

While self-driving technology is very impressive, it’s certainly not something that can be totally relied on. Tesla has been the driving factor in autonomous driving tech, but when you’re the first, there’s bound to be some problems. As Tesla owners have found, there are a lot of problems with the system, it can get confused easily, and has not yet reached the level of full self driving.

So despite all of this, some folks on the internet decided that they would make an… ahem, video, of themselves driving a Tesla with Autopilot engaged, while they had no way to intervene with the system if there was an issue.

Elon saw the video and decided to comment on it, but instead of scolding the video makers for using the technology in a completely unsafe (and frankly gross) way, he decided to make a joke about it.",[]

Kennedy, Malcolm X dismissed the murder as a case of “the chickens coming home to roost.”

In Spike Lee’s biographical drama, “Malcolm X,” a white teenage girl approaches the angry activist and says: “Excuse me, Mr. X. Hi. I’ve read some of your speeches, and I honestly believe that a lot of what you have to say is true. And I’m a good person, in spite of what my ancestors did, and I just — I wanted to ask you, what can a white person like myself who isn’t prejudiced, what can I do to help you … further your cause?” He stares sternly, and replies, “Nothing.” She leaves in tears.

But Malcolm X changed. He visited Mecca, where he saw people of all colours worshipping together. It changed the way he thought. He repudiated his anger toward whites after discovering that people were more similar than they were different. He renounced the racist ideology of the Nation of Islam, and in doing so knowingly signed his own death warrant. He was assassinated by members of the Nation of Islam.

Alabama Gov. George Wallace, in 1963, proclaimed, “Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,” at his inauguration, and later stood in a doorway at the University of Alabama to bar blacks from entering. Nine years later, Wallace took a would-be assassin’s bullet, leaving him paralyzed. Older, wiser and chastened by the attempt on his life, Wallace changed. Wallace, one day and without invitation, went to a black church where 300 black clergymen were holding a conference. He asked to speak. Wallace asked for forgiveness. He said to the church leaders, “I never had hate in my heart for any person. But I regret my support of segregation and the pain it caused the black people of our state and nation. … I’ve learned what pain is, and I’m sorry if I’ve caused anybody else pain. Segregation was wrong — and I am sorry.”

The voters in Alabama returned the former governor to office, but this time, he received Black support and made several Black appointments. The damage Wallace did through his actions and rhetoric was profound, and despite the assassination attempt, he lived long enough to undo some of it.

Even a Confederate general can change.

Confederate Gen. William Mahone, one of General Robert E. Lee’s most able commanders, owned slaves before the Civil War. But after the war, he led an interracial political movement. He organized and became the leader of the Readjuster Party, the most successful interracial political alliance in the post-emancipation South. In 1881, Mahone was elected to the U.S. Senate, at the time split 37-37 between Republicans and Democrats. But Mahone aligned with the Republicans, the party founded two decades earlier by Northerners trying to stop the expansion of slavery.

From 1879 through 1883, Mahone’s Readjuster Party dominated Virginia, with a governor in the statehouse, two Readjusters in the U.S. Senate and Readjusters representing six of the state’s 10 congressional districts. Under Mahone’s leadership, his coalition also controlled the state legislature, the courts and many of the state’s coveted federal offices.

The Readjusters established what became Virginia State University, the first state-supported college to train black teachers. Democrats described the hated Readjusters and Republicans as advocates of “black domination.”

What about Lt. Gen. James Longstreet? One of Lee’s favourite generals, Longstreet not only became a Republican after the war and served in Republican administrations but also fought against the racist White League in New Orleans.

After the Civil War, Longstreet moved to New Orleans, where he urged Southerners to support the Republican Party and endorsed their candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, for president in 1868. He commanded blacks in the New Orleans Metropolitan Police Force against the anti-Reconstruction White League (a paramilitary arm of the Democratic Party) at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. He was shot and held captive for several days. He accepted political appointments from Republicans, and even dared criticize Gen. Lee. For this “betrayal,” white Southerners pronounced Longstreet a “scalawag” and “leper of the community.”

Where does this viewing of history through the prism of modern-day feelings end? Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once gave advice to a gay young man that today would be heresy. King suggested he battle his feelings, strongly implying that the young man needed therapy and sexual reorientation. Today, that kind of advice gets one branded a Neanderthal. President John F. Kennedy, frustrated with a high-profile Democrat who hadn’t supported his election, threatened to banish him by giving him an obscure ambassadorship to one of the, as Kennedy put it, “boogie republics” in Africa. Tell that to Black Lives Matter.

History is complicated. And history requires perspective and understanding, something sadly lacking in those who seek to erase history by imposing today’s standards of right and wrong.

While he supported one political party, the union he belonged to routinely endorsed a different party. And each election the union would take some of the union dues my dad paid, as well as funds from thousands of other teachers, and give them to a political party that my dad, and likely many other teachers, opposed.

Years later, the unfairness of the situation really struck me.

Why should unions be able to force their members to pay union dues only to turn around and donate some of those funds to political parties and causes that many members did not support? Why not leave the money in each worker’s pocket and let each worker decide for themselves which causes to support?

A bill before the Alberta legislature proposes to put workers back in charge. In fact, public opinion research commissioned by SecondStreet.org shows Canadians support such a change.

Bill 32, the Restoring Balance in Alberta’s Workplaces Act, would let each union member decide if they want to fund their union’s political campaigns and other initiatives that are unrelated to the workplace.

If a union member supports their union’s plan to, say, run political attack ads, he or she would pay their regular union dues plus a top up charge to pay for the attack ads.

And if a union member opposed their union’s attack ads, he or she would only pay the portion of union dues that cover activities that are related to the workplace (bargaining with the employer, settling grievances, etc.)

A recent poll commissioned by SecondStreet.org (conducted by Leger) found that 70% of Canadians do not think union dues should be used for political activities and non-work initiatives. In fact, a slightly higher percentage of unionized workers and former unionized workers oppose such expenditures by unions (72%).

One can see how the Alberta bill could be a hit with many unionized workers right across Canada.

Consider that CUPE Ontario signed on to supporting the Leap Manifesto – a radical environmental agenda that seeks to, among other things, create a society where public transit replaces the need for “more cars.” It’s not hard to imagine a member of CUPE Ontario being married to an autoworker in that province who might take exception to that idea.

Similarly, the union that represents Canada Post employees has supported “peace” flotillas to Gaza in the past. It’s certainly a headscratcher to understand why postal workers in Canada should be forced to fund advocacy activities related to the age-long conflict in the Middle East.

Back in Alberta, the province’s teachers’ union flew in anti-oil speakers David Suzuki and Tzeporah Berman to speak at their events in 2018. Spending union dues on such speakers probably wasn’t too popular a move in households where an Alberta teacher had family members whose livelihood is dependent on a prosperous oil and gas sector.

We developed a great friendship. I recently invited another girl, “Trina,” into our friend group. Trina does not work with us, but we have other common interests.

Recently, though, Marilee and Trina seem to have bonded and are gradually excluding me from things — tubing, brunches, beach trips, etc.

I am feeling left out and hurt by this. The only time they do want to hang out with me now is to take part in my photography hobby, which involves using my expensive equipment. I feel like they are taking advantage and don’t actually want to hang out with me. I don’t know what I did wrong.

They’re not trying to hide it from me, either, as I see — almost daily — posts on social media of them together.

At the risk of alienating myself more, I have not confronted them.

Are they trying to be hurtful or are they genuinely oblivious to how their actions could be perceived?

Left Out in Lancaster, PA

Dear Left Out: “The rule of three” refers to the symmetry inherent in a trio. This surfaces in art, music, design – and even comedy (listen to a classic “rim shot” – it’s a three!). The triangle conveys a sort of pleasing and complex balance – and this balance seems to work — except for when it comes to human relationships. That’s when an equilateral triangle becomes an isosceles, often with one person isolated at the farthest point.

This challenging “odd man out” human dynamic happens at every stage of life — from childhood to old age.

I very much doubt that you have done anything wrong. You should accept that these two women seem to have formed an exclusionary friendship.

It doesn’t matter whether they are trying to be hurtful; they are being hurtful. Even if they aren’t being deliberately malicious, at the very least – they simply don’t care how you feel.

Your choices are to swallow your own honest reaction and accept your new status as the equipment provider, or to be honest regarding how this makes you feel. It is brave to admit your own vulnerability, and I think you should, understanding that you cannot change them or urge them away from their friendship with each other.

You say, “I understand that you two have developed a good friendship, but I have to be honest with you – I feel really left out, lately.”

Dear Amy: I am very concerned about your answer to “Anxious,” who was worried about encountering people in stores who were not wearing masks properly.

You wrote: “No, I don’t think you should call out another customer for wearing a mask incorrectly (because this involves them and their body).”

That is not true! The way other people wear their masks affects all of us!

Upset and Concerned

Dear Upset: Absolutely. Many readers contacted me to correct my statement. I concur: Wearing a mask protects others. Absolutely. Although a mask does seem to offer some protection to the person wearing it, I wear my mask for you, and you wear your mask for me.

My point in framing my answer the way I did was to discourage confrontations between people regarding mask-wearing. People who either don’t wear masks at all or who wear masks improperly seem to take the issue very personally, because the mask is (or isn’t) attached to their own face.

I’m not sure what is so frightening about wearing a thin piece of cloth across your nose and mouth in order to help protect others (and yourself) from a potentially dangerous virus, but I believe it is wisest in the moment to give these people a wide berth – yes, to avoid confrontation, and also – importantly — to avoid transmission.

However, if you patronize a business where employees aren’t wearing masks properly, this is an issue that should definitely be brought to the manager’s attention.

Dear Amy: “Caught Couple” described themselves as doctors who treated COVID patients. They were on the fence about whether to attend a large family wedding in another state.

Thank you for responding the way you did! As doctors – they should know that they – and others – are at substantial risk. As you noted, if doctors are unsure about this, what are the rest of us supposed to do?!

She is a compulsive shopper and was shopping almost every day when she was driving. Last year she had a minor car accident that totaled her car, so she does not drive anymore and depends on me to take her for groceries, errands, doctor appointments, etc.

I had to clean out her car, which was so full of stuff that it took me five hours to clean it out. I filled five large garbage bags of trash and 12 boxes of stuff.

I have had to “clean up her mess” many times over the years, sometimes at my insistence, and sometimes because she needs to let someone into her apartment and they can’t get in because of the mess. Clothes are piled on the bed, groceries on the counters, and boxes on the floor.

My daughter, who has helped me clean in the past, has very good organizational skills and works quickly. She has agreed to help me this weekend. (I have a sister who lives locally but isn’t very helpful.)

In the past, Mom has told me that my cleaning makes her anxious.

Should I insist she let us do this? Mom’s apartment makes me sick and I feel so overwhelmed when I am there because it is so bad. I have trouble sleeping because it bothers me so much.

I have tried to get her counselling help in the past, but she only went to a few sessions.

If I clean now, it would be on my terms, but if I don’t force it now and something comes up with her apartment or health, I would be forced to clean it immediately.

She procrastinates until things become urgent with her; then she makes me deal with this urgency.

I want to honour my mother and also be the responsible daughter. Any advice?

Loving Daughter

Dear Daughter: At the age of 90, your mother is probably not going to make dramatic steps to change. She might not be physically and emotionally able to deal with her hoarding disorder in any truly substantial way. (Hoarding seems to be related to anxiety, and — longer-term — you should ask her primary care physician about appropriate anti-anxiety medication that might help.)

Because you seem to be her primary caretaker, I suggest that you take this on – on your terms.

Ask your sister if she can take your mother on errands/outings for the day. Tell your mom that you and her granddaughter are going to handle this for her, and reassure her that when she returns, her home will be much easier for her to navigate. If your mother isn’t in the space and is instead distracted during the day, she might feel less anxious.

Dear Amy: In the past two years, I have given monetary gifts for graduations, birthdays, a bridal shower and a wedding.

I have not received any acknowledgment or thanks for any of these gifts.

At this point, I would settle for two words in a text message: “thank you.”

Do young people feel so entitled that acknowledging a gift is not necessary?

One of the recipients is now pregnant and her mother-in-law is throwing a baby shower.

Of course, I’ll be invited. I don’t want to go.

Friends have told me that I am being petty. Am I?

Petty in Maryland

Dear Petty: You don’t seem petty, as much as worn out. And I don’t blame you. A natural consequence of this lack of appreciation is that you will be less inspired to keep giving.

My only caution here is that baby showers are intended as celebrations centred on a new baby, who is obviously innocent.

I think it is also time to contact the recipients of these gifts to tell them, “I believe I’ve been generous to you, and I’ve always been happy to celebrate your milestones with gifts. But you have never acknowledged or thanked me for a gift. I’m not sure why this is, but it is quite discouraging.”

Dear Amy: “Tom, in Los Angeles” expressed extreme distress in where this country is headed. I have to say, I was shocked (pleasantly) by your response. Your first line got me: “I think you should celebrate the freedom we each have to either launch an insurrection, or go to the movies.”

A few years back I started an online friendship with another woman. We’ve emailed back and forth, and I really enjoyed our correspondence over the years. She’s had a much more exciting life than I’ve had, but I found our shared knowledge and experiences made for an online relationship that’s better than anything I’ve had with my wife.

I knew we’d never meet in person. I never attempted a face-to-face meeting with her and was perfectly happy with that. Then, two years ago, her writings to me became less frequent and much more politically tinged.

She attributed this to an injury she suffered, and the subsequent recovery from it.

Her correspondence to me has since dropped down to nothing, I miss it and feel truly hurt by this. My wife knows nothing of this, and I find that my wife and I have less and less in common anymore.

Should I continue to correspond with her and hope things will go back to normal, or should I just end things altogether and try to move on?

Hurt Online

Dear Hurt: When I comment on the insidious effect (and often damage) that secret “friendships” have on a marriage, people often respond: “But married people can — and should — have friends!”

YES, committed partners can (and should!) conduct their own friendships, but when the friendship is a secret, over time the secrecy amplifies a feeling of intimacy between the friends, leaving the primary partner out.

Your situation is a perfect example of this phenomenon. As your online friendship grew, your in-person relationship shrank. And now – unfortunately, both relationships have dwindled.

Maybe you pursued your online friendship in the first place because you believed that something important was missing in your marriage. But – if you aren’t at least going to try to be a full partner to your spouse, then you should own the consequence.

You should respect your online friend’s choice to maintain some distance from you. You could express concern about her but then you should respect the choices she is making.

Then – you could take the extra relationship energy and recommit to trying to reconnect with your wife. You might start by sending her a warmly written email.

Dear Amy: My granddaughter is barely scraping along. She is divorced from her vindictive and nasty husband. They have three teenagers for whom she is mainly responsible.

She had a good job when she divorced, so the court-ordered child support was low. She has a part-time job now, but with no benefits, and she has had some serious health issues. I help her out by sending her about $1,800 a month.

My husband and I are retired and are comfortably well-off. There is nothing that we need or want that we can’t get for ourselves.

However, our granddaughter sends us gift cards for things that we don’t want or would not get for ourselves.

To me, that is akin to robbing Peter to pay Paul.

The last time she sent me something, I wrote to her and asked her not to send us anything of monetary value. A card or a Zoom call would be more than enough to make us happy.

We are also very old and try to go out as little as possible until there is a vaccine for the virus.

Well, she has just sent my husband a Father’s Day card for $25 to spend at Starbucks. He doesn’t want it.

I have sent it back to her and asked her again not to send us such gifts.

I am sure that I am hurting her feelings and I don’t know what to do about it.

Do you have any suggestions about how better to handle this?

Grands

Dear Grands: You are so generous – and your granddaughter obviously appreciates it very much. She is trying, in her way, to thank you and reciprocate.

I realize this is frustrating for you, but after your second admonition and correction, I think it’s time to let it go. You might be able to re-gift or donate any gift cards to someone who might use them.

Dear Amy: “Too Nice” described being so nice that people always take advantage of her.

That used to be me! Thank you for telling her that people will react poorly when she attempts to establish boundaries. This is just their way of struggling to adjust.

ECMO works by pumping blood outside of the body, oxygenating it and then sending it back in. Calls were still coming in daily from doctors in the Toronto region hurrying to rescue people in “advanced respiratory failure.” Sixty people were transferred to the General; 32 went on ECMO.

“That’s gone away in the last few weeks,” says Dr. Niall Ferguson, head of critical care medicine at Toronto’s University Health Network, who practises at Toronto General. “We’ve seen a dramatic drop off in the number of severe cases in the Toronto region.”

See More +

It’s a similar story across the country. As new infections tear across the southern and western United States, setting new daily records for deaths that epidemiologists say were utterly predictable and disastrous, the virus is largely under control in Canada.

Nearly 8,800 lives have been lost, but the daily number of reported case and deaths, the daily numbers of people hospitalized and ICU admissions, have been steadily declining since the peak of the epidemic in April, federal modelling data released this week shows. Transmission rates are tumbling steeply among the oldest, and most vulnerable, with a slower decline among 20- to 39-year-olds. There are hot spots, outbreaks in long-term care homes and among migrant workers, and too many unnerving cases where the source of exposure is a mystery. But otherwise the news is “good,” Canada’s Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Howard Njoo told a media briefing. But relax too much, too soon, he warned, and the epidemic “will most likely rebound with explosive growth as a distinct possibility.”

A second wave is mathematically inevitable, says University of Ottawa epidemiologist Raywat Deonandan. Researchers have only started to get a grip on just how many of us have been exposed, but the majority are still vulnerable. As long as the virus exists in the environment, “it’s going to find purchase and attempt to reassert itself,” Deonandan says. “That’s the way these things work.”

And so comes the quiet anxiety of waiting for the next surge, and wondering, what are our chances of getting seriously sick? How can the SARS-Cov-2 virus cause lethal blood clotting, sudden cardiac collapse or multi-organ failure in some people and not a whisper of a symptom in so many others? How deadly is this really?

It’s too soon to know. The true case fatality rate won’t be known until the end of the pandemic, Deonandan says.

“This infection messes with me,” Toronto infectious disease physician Dr. Jeff Powis tweeted in late June after having called his 700th patient diagnosed with COVID-19. “Those I expect to do worse do well and those without traditional risk factors get admitted to ICU.”

What increases the risk of death and other bad outcomes?

According to a study of more than 17 million people in England published this week in Nature, advanced age, and being male. Diabetes, severe asthma, obesity, chronic heart or liver disease, dementia, reduced kidney function and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus or psoriasis — were also associated with a higher risk of death based on an analysis of the anonymized health records of 17,278,392 adults, slightly less than 11,000 of whom died with COVID-19.

Black and South Asian people were nearly two times more likely to suffer a COVID-related death than white people, for reasons that aren’t fully clear. The most socio-economically deprived were 1.8 times more likely to die than the least deprived, and as Powis noted, health inequities means that, like most infectious diseases, COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting the vulnerable — people living in racialized populations and in poverty, in multigenerational families living in cramped housing, and those with low-paying essential-service jobs and no paid sick leave.

In Canada, people over age 60 make up 96 per cent of deaths. While age and underlying health problems have been identified as risk factors, there are other things at play. The only drug that has so far been shown to keep people from dying from COVID-19 is dexamethasone, a steroid that keeps the body’s immune response from going haywire in response to the virus that causes it.

According to preliminary findings published by British researchers in June, the steroid cut deaths in people on ventilators by one-third. “That really points to the fact that it’s our body’s own immune response to the virus that may have a worse effect than the viral infection itself,” says Dr. Mark Downing, an infectious diseases physician at St. Joseph’s Health Centre in Toronto.

Different underlying medical problems might put people at higher risk of a hyper inflammatory immune response, but there’s no test that can predict, “this is someone who is going to have a runaway immune response his body won’t be able to rein in,” he says.

However, more people in Canada are surviving an ICU admission for COVID-19.

In a study of 117 people admitted to one of six ICU’s in Vancouver, 61 per cent survived to be sent home alive at the time study was published. From the original reports out of China, “they were reporting crazy things, like 90 per cent morality for people on ventilators,” Ferguson says. The experience here suggests the prognosis for those who do get critically sick may not be as bleak as the early reports made it out to be. That’s partly because the system was better prepared. Canada’s ICU’s weren’t saturated and stressed to the breaking point. “We were able to rescue patients with ECMO when we needed to,” Ferguson says. Doctors didn’t have to make wrenching decisions over which patients to route to ICU and who to leave behind. Unlike Italy, obstetricians and ear-nose-and-throat specialists weren’t called in to care for the dying in besieged ICUs.

A greater proportion of cases in Canada are now occurring in younger people, and a smaller in older people. “In some ways that’s unsurprising, because many older people know that they are especially vulnerable and so they’re taking extra precautions,” says Irfan Dhalla, a general internist and a vice-president at Unity Health in Toronto. After a disastrous start, we’re now taking greater precautions with seniors living in long-term care and retirement homes.

But it would be a mistake to think young people are invulnerable from COVID-19. They obviously can get sick and die: Hamilton-born, Tony-nominated Broadway star Nick Cordero died last Sunday at the age of 41. He had been hospitalized for three moths and had a leg amputated. “Just because the fatality rate is incredibly high in people who are in their 80s or 90s does not mean the fatality rate is zero in their 40s, 50s and 60s,” Dhalla said.

So what is the true mortality rate? It’s hard to nail down. In March, the World Health Organization pegged the case fatality rate — the fraction of known cases that die — at 3.6 per cent globally. The case fatality rate is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the virus and the number of confirmed cases, not the actual number of cases or infected people that are floating out around there.

A recent paper in the Canadian Medical Association Journal estimates that, if the reporting rate is less than 50 per cent in Canada, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is likely to be around 1.6 per cent.

Even then a case fatality rate isn’t constant. It varies with how much we test, with the fragility of the population, and the robustness of our health-care system, Deonandan adds.

The true measure of lethality, he says, is the infection fatality rate — of all the people who get it, whether or not they show symptoms or are even tested, how many will die?

Nature reports that a growing number of studies from different regions is pegging the infection fatality rate at between 0.5 and one per cent, meaning five to 10 people will die for every 1,000 infected.

For seasonal flu, it’s 0.1 to 0.2. Not only is COVID deadlier, it’s profoundly more infectious. More people are going to get it. And although some doctors are reporting that the nose swabs being taken now are different from the swabs at the beginning of the pandemic — there seems to be less viral load — to Deonandan that just means we’re testing fewer symptomatic people. Lower the thresholds for who gets tested, and you’re going to get people who are less sick.

“That should not be confused with having a less severe disease present in the community,” Deonandan says.

A pandemic has a way of revealing the nature of a society, he says. “It either exacerbates the disparities or it highlights the strengths.” Canadians, more so than our neighbours to the south, “have embraced this ethic of communal responsibility,” says Deonandan. “For the most part, people are onboard with protecting other people, with wearing masks, with doing what’s right for the community. That’s not a message you see coming out of the USA.”

Other positive signs: Transmission by fomites (contaminated surfaces and objects) doesn’t seem to be as serious as once thought.

According to a commentary published last week in the Lancet, most studies used large amounts of virus, higher than what would happen under real-life scenarios. “In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze,” within one to two hours, writes Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics at Rutgers University.

Cleaning surfaces is still important, Deonandan says, but perhaps we don’t have to be obsessed with it. The WHO this week acknowledged airborne transmission is a thing, but it’ s not the primary way people get COVID-19. It’s by droplets, and masks diminish droplet transmission, Deonadan says. “It tells me we have the tools to contain this well.”

Dhalla believes so, too. “The overall story I see is that Canada has the resources and expertise to both contain COVID-19 and re-open schools and workplaces at the same time.” That’s provided we keep outbreaks from spinning out of control with well-resourced strategies to test, trace, isolate, support and mask, and hotel rooms for the homeless, or somewhere they could be supported and physically distanced.

Still, it bothers him when people want him to say that COVID-19 isn’t that serious. “I have a hard time with numbers, everybody has a hard time with numbers. It’s hard to get your head around concepts like 0.5 per cent or exponential growth at 1.1 — what do these things mean?

“Ninety-nine-point-five per cent sounds pretty safe. But really, would you take a one-in-200 chance of dying? I woudn’t. It’s very clear now, four months into the pandemic, that this is a serous illness that has resulted in great loss of life.",[]

“Migraine sufferers walk a tight line when it comes to managing their symptoms, and COVID-19 has been an impetus in derailing many otherwise well-controlled patients,” says Dr. Ian Finkelstein, medical director of the Toronto Headache and Pain Clinic.

Increased physical and mental stressors, increased anxiety, and changes in daily routine, including working from home, have triggered worsening symptoms for many people, says Finkelstein.

Plus, limited access to their headache specialists has made it tough for patients to manage their condition.

Migraines are one of the most severe and debilitating types of headaches, and impact close to three million Canadians, 80% of them women. Symptoms include throbbing head pain, nausea, vomiting and hypersensitivity to light and sounds.

Patients with chronic migraine — 15 or more days of severe headaches in a month — are more likely to have depression, anxiety, and chronic pain conditions.

The World Health Organization ranks migraines as one of the top 20 most disabling diseases and notes that “a day lived with a severe migraine can be more disabling than blindness, paraplegia or angina.”

Finkelstein urges those suffering from a worsening of their migraines to document their episodes in a ‘headache diary’ using the app Canadian Migraine Tracker at migrainetracker.ca.

People should record the frequency and severity of headaches, triggers and the types of medication they are using, and share that information with a doctor or headache specialist.

Finkelstein also recommends taking up relaxation exercises or meditation and engaging in some type of physical exercise.

Migraine sufferers also need to make a concentrated effort to stick to a regular schedule when it comes to diet, hydration and sleep.

If headaches are impacting your quality of life, and/or your reliance on medication use is increasing, find a headache specialist using your postal code via mychronicmigraine.ca. The tool also offers information, self-assessment, triggers and treatment options.

Finkelstein adds that use of headache relieving medications should be limited to less than 10 days per month to avoid rebound headaches.

In addition, Health Canada-approved preventative migraine treatment options — such as Botox or CGRP antibodies — can be effective. Speak to a medical professional about these options.",[]

Canada has had almost 9,000 deaths from COVID-19 so far, with the vast majority (97 per cent) occurring in those over age 60.

Canada also holds the unenviable record among developed nations for the highest percentage of COVID-19 deaths occurring in long-term care facilities: 81 per cent compared to just 28 per cent in Australia or 31 per cent in the United States, for example.

Many who died from COVID-19 were living with frailty.

Frailty is a state of vulnerability when an individual is more susceptible to major and minor health events, including infections, illness and chronic disease, and may experience a decline across many body systems.

Frailty directly affects quality and quantity of life and can be used as a measure to predict functional impairment, falls, loneliness, depression, institutionalization and death.

Over one and a half million Canadians are estimated to live with frailty — affecting another 3.75 million Canadians who act as family caregivers. The prevalence of frailty in Indigenous populations is double the national average, where 50 per cent of those over age 65 are living with frailty.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the pitfalls of how we approach ageing in our society. Currently we use a reactive, problem-based approach to ageing instead of a preventive, holistic approach.

Preventing or delaying frailty won’t prevent COVID-19, but it will help make Canadian seniors more resilient generally, it will add quality of life to remaining years, and reduce the stress on our health and social services and on family caregivers. And it will help us prepare for the next pandemic and/or looming social care crisis.

So, what can be done?

At the individual level, we can AVOID frailty by:

• Activity: Regular exercise, particularly strength training, balancing exercises and activities that get your heart rate up daily.

• Vaccination: Keep your vaccinations and boosters up to date, including for flu, shingles and pneumonia.

• Optimizing medication: Have your health provider review your medications annually, including prescriptions and over-the-counter drugs, vitamins and supplements so you are only taking essential medications.

• Interacting: Social isolation can lead to frailty and advanced aging, is linked to high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

• Diet and nutrition: As we age, we need more vitamin D, calcium and protein found in meat, fish, eggs and beans to keep our muscles and bones strong.

We also need governments to create programs and policies that promote an active and healthy lifestyle.

Governments at all levels need to fund programs that promote independence and physical function, focused on daily living activities that would allow seniors to stay in their own homes for as long as possible. Nursing homes should be the last option, not the only option, for seniors that need assistance with daily living.

Governments also need to combat social isolation and fund programs to reduce social vulnerability in seniors, including innovative online programming during the pandemic.

We also need governments to support policies to encourage healthy food options and better nutrition for seniors, with specific attention to the needs of older adults living with frailty, including establishing nutrition standards for care facilities, acute care and programs like Meals on Wheels.

Importantly, governments need to address poverty amongst seniors by funding and implementing a national pharmacare program, a housing strategy specific to seniors and providing adequate income supports for seniors to enable financial security and healthy retirement.

Finally, together, we need to combat ageism. It is not acceptable that so many of our older adults have died during COVID-19. They are not expendable. Older adults can have quality lives if we give them the safeguards and the supports they need — to live through the pandemic and well beyond it.

The surge of new postings, which multiple Alberta physicians described as highly unusual, came over the past two weeks as tensions between the province and doctors continue to escalate over a months-long row that began when the government terminated its master agreement with physicians and imposed changes to their pay formula.

Earlier this week, the Alberta Medical Association released a survey of its members revealing that 42 per cent were considering leaving the province due to the dispute with the government. Edmonton-based psychiatrist Dr. Christine Froelich said the job postings are akin to the government bringing in scab workers. Rather than convince the doctors who are looking to leave, or have already left, to stay, it’s attempting to replace them with international doctors who aren’t familiar with the challenges their colleagues are facing.

“That’s exactly what it is,” Froelich said about scab work. “We’re doctors and we don’t have a union but that’s as close as it gets to that. They want replacement workers. It’s ‘if you don’t agree with us, this worker will replace you.’ ”

Dr. Jillian Ratti, who specializes in family medicine in Calgary, made similar comments on Twitter in a series of posts about the job postings. She accused the Alberta Health Services and Health Minister Tyler Shandro of “searching abroad for unknowing-scabs to replace the docs who poured their hearts and souls into their communities.”

We’re doctors and we don’t have a union but that’s as close as it gets to that

In a statement emailed to the National Post, a spokesperson for Alberta Health Services, which is responsible for job searches and hiring, said the province has “long relied on many foreign-trained physicians to provide care in many areas across the province.” The positions, she said, are also listed on Alberta Health Services’ website and are often reposted on local and national job boards as well.

Dr. Ed Aasman, president of rural medicine with the Alberta Medical Association, doesn’t believe there’s an agenda behind the postings made for positions in rural communities, at least. “They’re legitimate,” he said, and correspond to long-term needs that those communities have.

Aasman couldn’t speak to the volume of postings and how that’s compared to past hiring surges. Froelich, however, said the number of job postings was unusual.

While there are dozens of rural postings, more than 50 of the new positions are Edmonton based while nearly an additional 30 are split between Lethbridge, Alta., and Calgary.

The rural positions don’t set off any red flags for Aasman. That would change, for example, if the international doctors brought in no longer had to do the customary three to six months of training under another physician in Alberta before starting the jobs they were brought in for. Another red flag, Aasman said, is if the positions came with lower salaries than those offered to doctors who are currently working in the province.

Although Aasman hasn’t seen any doctors leave the province yet — that might take some time, he admits, because of the complications of moving during a global pandemic — he has already seen the effects of the confrontation between the United Conservative Party and the province’s doctors. Aasman knows of three doctors working in rural communities who retired early because of the changes made by the government.

NDP MLA and health critic David Shepherd is also concerned about physicians in rural communities leaving for greener pastures. The job postings, he said, make it clear that there isn’t sufficient back-up to cover a potential exodus. Incoming international doctors may also not fully understand the situation they’re stepping into, he said.

Shepherd also shares the concerns of some doctors, such as Froelich and Ratti, that the UCP is edging closer to privatizing health care.

Bill 30, the Health Statutes Amendment Act, which the UCP introduced last week, gave corporations the ability to bill the government as if they were physicians, Shepherd said.

“This is the first step to breaking down the legal barriers to prevent full privatization of health care in Alberta,” Shepherd said. “We’re beyond this being a question of incompetence. This is no longer a mistake.

“This shows the incredible damage (the UCP) has done in only a few short months with health care and doctors in the midst of a global pandemic.”",[]

But a new Statistics Canada survey reveals that only 52 per cent of Quebecers say they would wear a mask in public when physical distancing is difficult, compared to 78 per cent of people living in Ontario.

Four months after the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, why do so many Quebecers still refuse to wear a mask when they leave the house?

“I think there are some obvious reasons,” said McGill psychology professor Ross Otto. “It’s uncomfortable and it looks weird, but I believe social pressure could work. I think once we hit a point where enough people are doing it, it will start to feel funny not wearing one.”

Another factor, according to Otto, may be the lack of tangible cause and effect to wearing a mask.

“The psychology of it is interesting,” he said. “If you put on sunscreen, or if you don’t, within a couple of hours you will have either avoided getting burned or gotten burned. Masks are not really to protect yourself, but to protect others, so you wouldn’t see the effects of wearing one versus not wearing one. It’s too diffuse, abstract and slow.”

Ultimately, Otto muses, Quebecers’ resistance might come down to our long-standing status as a distinct society, and how that affects people’s feelings about following the crowd.

“I’m not from here,” he noted, “but I would say that outside Quebec, there’s a stronger adherence to rules and community norms.”

Dr. Nima Machouf was part of a group of health-care professionals that in June called on the province to make masks mandatory in closed public spaces as well as open areas where physical distancing is difficult. Yet the epidemiologist doesn’t believe Quebecers have an inherent problem wearing masks.

“For anything, people resist measures,” she said, “but when there’s a measure and they have to, people do it. I don’t like seatbelts, but I wear one; before, people didn’t because it wasn’t against the law. If there’s no rule, people think it’s not necessary.”

Machouf has seen encouraging changes in Quebecers’ attitudes regarding masks over the past few months.

“Now you see a lot of people wearing them,” she said. “In stores and other closed areas, maybe half of people are doing it. Now that people will be obliged to wear them, everyone will be protected.”

Her only complaint is that the new regulations could have come sooner.

“I find it late,” Machouf said. “If they had imposed masks earlier, it could have shortened the confinement period. Now, with deconfinement, masks are even more important, to avoid a second wave.”

McGill law professor Daniel Weinstock also thinks the Quebec government has a share of the blame in Quebecers’ slow adoption of masks.

“At the beginning of the pandemic, Dr. Arruda was quite adamant, saying there was no need to wear a mask if you didn’t have symptoms,” Weinstock said. “For weeks and weeks, it was repeated. It’s hard to undo that messaging overnight.”

Weinstock also wondered if an ongoing political discourse of a different kind in the province may be having a subconscious effect on people’s aversion to wearing masks.

“This is purely speculative, and would need empirical research,” he said, “but Quebec has spent the last (several) years with three different governments — the Liberals, the PQ and the CAQ — talking about the value of giving and receiving services with an uncovered face.

“This was obviously in a very specific context, (but) is that playing into this?”

Whatever the reasoning, Weinstock thinks the new regulations are a good thing, and that Quebecers will come around to wearing masks.

“It is, after all, just a thing over your face,” he said. “If the benefits are as great as a lot of epidemiologists say it is … it seems like a no-brainer.”

If you own U.S. real estate, whether for personal use or for investment purposes, now may be a good time to ensure that you’re fully compliant with your Canadian tax filing obligations, as it appears that the Canada Revenue Agency may soon be doing some mass sleuthing of publicly-available U.S. property records.

In a Request for Information (RFI) posted online on June 25 entitled “Bulk United States (U.S.) Real Property Data (re Canadian residents),” the CRA announced that it is looking for a provider to supply the Agency with U.S. real property data. In the RFI, the government stated that it is specifically looking for “U.S. real estate and real property data where a Canadian resident is the owner or party to the purchase, sale, or transfer. Real estate and property data is required in bulk form in order to identify current and historical records, mortgage transactions, property taxes, real property records, and deeds.”",[]

Employment expenses

During the years under appeal, the taxpayer was employed by the City of Toronto as a case worker. She was required to supervise various outreach activities for the benefit of priority neighbourhoods and faith-based organizations. She also oversaw programs for the city. During the 2014 taxation year, she deducted $6,660 as employment expenses on account of gas, parking, car insurance and a home office.

She was unable to produce a signed CRA Form T2200 — Declaration of Conditions of Employment, as her employer “failed to complete the form when asked,” and the taxpayer “did not aggressively pursue this.” She was also unable to produce any travel log, voucher or expense receipts to validate her employment expenses. The judge denied these expenses outright.

Donations

The taxpayer, who was described by the judge as “a generous charitable giver” based on her history of significant charitable gifts, had some charitable donations that were allowed by the CRA while others were disallowed. The disallowances fell into four categories: mathematical errors (including addition errors and double-counting of some donations), faulty carry-forwards of donations previously claimed, the absence of charitable receipts, and no charitable intent or the existence of a “reciprocal benefit.”

The latter category was the largest, and related to the children’s private schooling. In certain years, the taxpayer felt that a portion of the tuition amounts she paid should be deductible as charitable donations. She believed that “certain amounts given to the schools exceeded the educational benefit derived from the paid tuition.” The judge disagreed and disallowed the amounts as “they were clearly tuition.”

‘Statute barred’

In court, the taxpayer attempted to argue that, notwithstanding the errors she made in claiming donations and employment expenses, it was nevertheless too late for the CRA to reassess her 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns as they should be considered “statute barred.” The CRA is generally prohibited from reassessing an individual taxpayer more than three years after the original reassessment unless it can be shown that the taxpayer made “a false statement attributable to misrepresentation arising from carelessness, neglect or wilful default.”

In 2014, the taxpayer admitted there were no carry forward donations available to be claimed, yet she claimed some anyway. Furthermore, she had no receipts for the employment expenses which she claimed. The judge felt that “the degree of care in reviewing the returns, given the size of the donations claimed, should have revealed the double counting, mathematical errors and absence of carry forward amounts.” The taxpayer, “through her … errors and her own inattentive review, was careless in her inclusions, calculations and documentation review. On these bases, the first three appeal years (i.e. 2012 through 2014) are to be opened beyond the normal reassessment period.”

Gross negligence penalties

Finally, the judge turned to the appropriateness of the gross negligence penalties. The CRA felt that the taxpayer’s “lack of careful review of the return,” her failure to disclose unjustified carry forwards of donation expenses, the double counting of one large charitable receipt, and the inclusion of the employment expense deduction where no receipts existed and where no T2200 was obtained, amounted to her being “willfully blind.” Prior jurisprudence has found that being “willfully blind” amounts to gross negligence.

As the CRA asserted, “This is wilful blindness to a degree that rises to gross negligence or is a cavalier disregard to complying with obligations under the Act to verify the accuracy of the returns.”

With respect to the gross negligence penalties levied on the donations, the judge wrote that “while these sums were large, (the taxpayer) clearly believed, however naively, that an excess portion of the tuition amounts was deductible…. She was wrong as to the law, but unlike many taxpayers, she attempted to learn the law and comply. She was negligent and perhaps careless regarding the previous unclaimed charitable donations, but she was not insouciant or indifferent to complying. Moreover, she had been a sustained and deliberate charitable giver over the years. Accordingly, the Court is not of the view that her errors rose to a level of wilful blindness or a knowing misstatement.”

Similarly, with regards to the gross negligence penalties assessed by the CRA for the disallowed employment expenses, the judge also felt that the penalties levied were not justified. As he wrote, “(her) lack of receipts was “not sufficient in this case to elevate her omissions to wilful (blindness). She filed her returns believing she was entitled to deduct these expenses, even if estimated. The amounts were not extraordinary, they simply remained unprovable and therefore misstated. Such action did not rise to the level of wilful blindness supporting a finding of gross negligence.”

While the judge disallowed the taxpayer’s donations and employment expenses, he was willing to cancel the gross negligence penalties assessed by the CRA for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 tax years.

To request a waiver of the penalty tax, an affected taxpayer needs to forward a detailed written request to the TFSA Processing Unit in Sudbury or Winnipeg with all relevant information, explaining “why it would be fair to cancel or waive all or part of the tax.” But just because you ask for relief, doesn’t mean the CRA will grant it.

If the CRA refuses your request for relief, you can take your case to Federal Court, asking a judge to review whether the CRA’s decision to deny relief was reasonable. That’s what happened in a recent case involving a B.C. taxpayer and overcontribution tax assessed by the CRA for the 2017 and 2018 taxation years. The case was heard earlier this month, via teleconference, by a Federal Court judge, sitting in Ottawa.

The taxpayer’s troubles began in 2016, when he contributed a total of $81,000 to his TFSA. Unfortunately, his TFSA contribution room for 2016 was only $44,592, resulting in an excess contribution amount as at Dec. 31, 2016. Consequently, the taxpayer had no available contribution room for 2017. Notwithstanding this, in March 2017, the taxpayer deposited $10,000 to his TFSA. In April 2017, he withdrew the entire balance from his TFSA.

On June 1, 2017, the CRA sent him a letter informing him of his excess 2016 TFSA contributions. The letter indicated, in part, that if he continued to make excess contributions “in the future,” he could be subject to a one per cent tax for each month the excess remained in the TFSA.

In September 2017, the taxpayer contributed a further $35,000 to his TFSA, resulting in an excess contribution amount of $35,000 as at Dec. 31, 2017. This excess contribution remained in his TFSA until August 2018, when he withdrew the excess amount.

The CRA issued TFSA tax assessments for the 2017 and 2018 taxation years, each of which set out the excess TFSA amount in the account by month, and the calculation of the tax, interest and penalties imposed on the TFSA excess amounts.

In April 2019, the taxpayer wrote to the CRA requesting a waiver of the overcontribution tax, interest and penalties, arguing that he should not be charged the overcontribution tax for months prior to July 2017 since the June 2017 CRA letter stated that if he continued to make excess TFSA contributions, he could be liable for overcontribution tax “in the future.” Indeed, the taxpayer accepted “full responsibility” for the overcontribution tax related to his overcontributions after June 2017 and admitted that he incorrectly deposited $35,000 to his TFSA in September 2017 because he was unaware that he was required to wait until 2018 to make any further TFSA contributions.

On July 15, 2019, the CRA refused the taxpayer’s first relief request, based on the fact that the taxpayer made another overcontribution in September 2017, despite having received a warning letter from the CRA in June 2017.

A week later, the taxpayer sent a second relief request to the CRA, emphasizing that he had removed all of the funds in his TFSA (in April 2017) and that between then and August 2017, the balance in his TFSA was, actually, zero. He acknowledged his September 2017 TFSA contribution of $35,000, but felt that the CRA should “nonetheless exercise the discretion contemplated by the (Act) to cancel all of the (overcontribution) tax reflected in the 2017 and 2018 TFSA assessments.” The taxpayer also noted that the dispute with the CRA was “causing stress that was unfortunate in light of his ill health.”

Having reviewed the information submitted and the facts of the case, the CRA concluded that the taxpayer “continued to make contributions to his TFSA in 2017, after he was notified of his excess 2016 contributions by the CRA’s June 2017 Letter.” The CRA went on to say “that there were no circumstances that would support the cancellation of the tax levied on the excess TFSA amounts for 2017 and 2018, and that the CRA’s initial assessment was correct.”

The sole issue before the Federal Court judge was not whether the overcontribution tax was correctly charged or calculated; rather, it was whether the CRA’s decision not to waive the overcontribution tax was reasonable. As the judge explained, “My role is not to substitute my own decision for that of the (CRA’s), nor am I to review the (CRA’s) Decision against a standard of perfection.”

The judge found that the reasons given by the CRA for denying relief “contain fundamental gaps.” While the CRA isn’t required to “draft lengthy reasons … it does require an analysis, which may be brief, of the applicable legal framework, significant evidence, and submissions in the record that permits the reader to understand the (CRA’s) rationale for the outcome of the case.”

The judge felt the CRA’s letter denying the taxpayer’s relief did not adequately explain the CRA’s reasoning for denying relief. Specifically, the CRA seems to have viewed the taxpayer’s September 2017 overcontribution “as colouring all of his actions, pre- and post-letter, placing him in the category of repeat over-contributor.”

In ordering the matter to be returned to the CRA for reconsideration by another officer, the judge concluded that the CRA’s decision “does not reflect a coherent assessment of the relevant law and significant facts and submissions from the record and that the (CRA’s) refusal to exercise their discretion was not intelligible or justified.”

Will the CRA show mercy upon a third review? Stay tuned.

First, Paul Tagliabue, who ran the NFL for 17 years, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020 in Canton, Ohio. It took 10 years and a one-time only expanded class for the NFL’s 100th-year celebration to get across the goaline. Tim Finchem didn’t have to sweat out “golf’s highest honor.” He was a first-ballot guy as a finalist, just like his fellow Class of 2021 inductee, Tiger Woods.

“To be included in that group is very powerful,” Finchem said in a press conference on Monday of being elected in the “contributor category” to join the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida. “I want to certainly thank those that thought that I was deserving of it. I kind of in many ways don’t feel like I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long. It was absolutely captivating for me year after year after year.”

Finchem isn’t the only one who doesn’t think he’s deserving. Social media was not kind when the announcement was made this morning.

it’s ridiculous. he happened to be sitting there when Tiger arrived and just got swept up in the hurricane. A rubber tree plant could’ve done that. — Rick Reilly (@ReillyRick) April 20, 2020

And why should they be? Just days ago, my colleague Beth Ann Nichols and others applauded the World Golf Hall of Fame for finally electing Marion Hollins also through the contributor category. (Quick aside: If the Hall is going to continue with this category, please at least limit it to a max of one per induction.) Hollins was a trailblazer and while her inclusion won’t send people turning off I-95 at International Golf Parkway in droves, hopefully some of those visitors who spring for a ticket to go and see the locker for Tiger Woods will learn her story too.

But the World Golf Hall of Fame needed another plaque of an administrator about as much as it needed one for Augusta National chairman Billy Payne two years ago. This isn’t so much a knock on Finchem as much as a wider complaint that we’re honoring the wrong people. The Hall of Fame should be for the greats of the game, the players who achieved the moments etched in our memory. There is still one more inductee to be named later this week, but all of the other players who will be left on the outside looking in are far more deserving of recognition in the Hall of Fame than Finchem.

He led the PGA Tour through very prosperous times during his 22-year tenure that began in 1994 after Deane Beman passed him the baton, but Finchem’s been richly rewarded for it. According to the Tour’s 2017 Form 990, he earned $12 million and another $6 million in reportable compensation from related organizations.

“Deane’s left him a Mercedes with the tank a quarter full, and all Tim has to do is keep putting gas in it,” Tour pro Peter Jacobsen once said.

That is an oversimplification, of course, but best I can tell Finchem wisely followed the Deane Beman playbook and had the good fortune of having Tiger, the world’s most famous athlete, come along and lift the sport to new heights during his tenure. As Beman used to say during his good years, “we’re not selling here, we’re enrolling.” (Last side note: Beman, Michael Bonallack of the R&A, and former USGA president Bill Campbell, who are all previously inducted, could have earned this distinction for their amateur record alone.) I’m not saying Finchem had an easy job, but it would have been hard to fail at the job with Tiger and an ever-expanding TV contract.

Former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will be inducted into the Golf Hall of Fame next year with Tiger. Fitting that he rides on Tiger’s coattails one last time. — Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) April 20, 2020

Even Finchem conceded as much when he told the following story about Tiger.

“There was some magazine that ranked me in the top 10 or 20 powerful people in sports one year. Obviously a lousy magazine. But people called me to say, what do you think?” Finchem recounted. “Well, I’m not — you know, the person that’s the most powerful person in sports is Tiger Woods, and they said, what do you mean by that. I said, well, I’ll give you an example. If I wanted to convey something, we’re building a tournament in Tokyo or something, I wanted to convey some information, I’d have to spend a week getting people charged up figuring out some communications, who are the people we have to go to to get this message across, this, that and the other. Tiger Woods doesn’t have to do any of that. Tiger Woods, all he has to do is issue a little statement, and his name is on it, Tiger Woods, everybody in the world knows about it. And to me, that’s real power. That is real power.”

And when asked about how much more difficult a job it would have been without Tiger, Finchem channeled his inner Captain Obvious and said, “It would have been a much more difficult job.”

You don’t say? Give Finchem a gold watch on the way out the door for a job well done and I’m OK if you want to let him continue as a board member of The First Tee. But membership in the World Golf Hall of Fame should be sacred. His election further validates claims that it is merely a popularity contest and charges of cronyism. (PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, who was Finchem’s handpicked successor, and other leaders in the game whose chances of being honored in the future probably also improved with Finchem’s election are among the voters. It all adds up to too much potential conflict of interest.) Interestingly, Finchem was a semi-finalist in 2019 and didn’t even make it to the list of finalists. It makes you wonder what changed in the last two years during his retirement. But his election is just another reason why the number of members returning for the ceremony is often low and why Hall of Famers continue to give their best mementos elsewhere. The last thing it needed was to enshrine another administrator, even if Finchem says he has a great letter from Arnold Palmer that he will donate to his exhibit along with some photographs of the greats that he bumped elbows with – from Gene Sarazen to Tiger.

When asked if he felt administrators should be honored at the Hall of Fame, Finchem demurred. “I’m not going to comment on that now, but when I speak at the induction, I will comment on it. I’m not trying to be cagey, but I’d just prefer to do it that way.”

I’ll save his speech writer some time. He’s going to say that it’s an honor to be recognized but the players are the real heroes and that he and his fellow administrators just support them. And people will clap politely and then we’ll move on to the induction of Tiger and the next time some guest says they want to see Finchem’s plaque will be the first time, but he’ll be housed there all the same between Nick Faldo and Raymond Floyd.

But as long as the Finchem’s of the industry continue to be enshrined, “golf’s highest honor” will remain just what it is – another empty slogan.",[]

First, Paul Tagliabue, who ran the NFL for 17 years, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020 in Canton, Ohio. It took 10 years and a one-time only expanded class for the NFL’s 100th-year celebration to get across the goaline. Tim Finchem didn’t have to sweat out “golf’s highest honor.” He was a first-ballot guy as a finalist, just like his fellow Class of 2021 inductee, Tiger Woods.

“To be included in that group is very powerful,” Finchem said in a press conference on Monday of being elected in the “contributor category” to join the World Golf Hall of Fame in St. Augustine, Florida. “I want to certainly thank those that thought that I was deserving of it. I kind of in many ways don’t feel like I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long. It was absolutely captivating for me year after year after year.”

Finchem isn’t the only one who doesn’t think he’s deserving. Social media was not kind when the announcement was made this morning.

it’s ridiculous. he happened to be sitting there when Tiger arrived and just got swept up in the hurricane. A rubber tree plant could’ve done that. — Rick Reilly (@ReillyRick) April 20, 2020

And why should they be? Just days ago, my colleague Beth Ann Nichols and others applauded the World Golf Hall of Fame for finally electing Marion Hollins also through the contributor category. (Quick aside: If the Hall is going to continue with this category, please at least limit it to a max of one per induction.) Hollins was a trailblazer and while her inclusion won’t send people turning off I-95 at International Golf Parkway in droves, hopefully some of those visitors who spring for a ticket to go and see the locker for Tiger Woods will learn her story too.

But the World Golf Hall of Fame needed another plaque of an administrator about as much as it needed one for Augusta National chairman Billy Payne two years ago. This isn’t so much a knock on Finchem as much as a wider complaint that we’re honoring the wrong people. The Hall of Fame should be for the greats of the game, the players who achieved the moments etched in our memory. There is still one more inductee to be named later this week, but all of the other players who will be left on the outside looking in are far more deserving of recognition in the Hall of Fame than Finchem.

He led the PGA Tour through very prosperous times during his 22-year tenure that began in 1994 after Deane Beman passed him the baton, but Finchem’s been richly rewarded for it. According to the Tour’s 2017 Form 990, he earned $12 million and another $6 million in reportable compensation from related organizations.

“Deane’s left him a Mercedes with the tank a quarter full, and all Tim has to do is keep putting gas in it,” Tour pro Peter Jacobsen once said.

That is an oversimplification, of course, but best I can tell Finchem wisely followed the Deane Beman playbook and had the good fortune of having Tiger, the world’s most famous athlete, come along and lift the sport to new heights during his tenure. As Beman used to say during his good years, “we’re not selling here, we’re enrolling.” (Last side note: Beman, Michael Bonallack of the R&A, and former USGA president Bill Campbell, who are all previously inducted, could have earned this distinction for their amateur record alone.) I’m not saying Finchem had an easy job, but it would have been hard to fail at the job with Tiger and an ever-expanding TV contract.

Former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will be inducted into the Golf Hall of Fame next year with Tiger. Fitting that he rides on Tiger’s coattails one last time. — Robert Lusetich (@RobertLusetich) April 20, 2020

Even Finchem conceded as much when he told the following story about Tiger.

“There was some magazine that ranked me in the top 10 or 20 powerful people in sports one year. Obviously a lousy magazine. But people called me to say, what do you think?” Finchem recounted. “Well, I’m not — you know, the person that’s the most powerful person in sports is Tiger Woods, and they said, what do you mean by that. I said, well, I’ll give you an example. If I wanted to convey something, we’re building a tournament in Tokyo or something, I wanted to convey some information, I’d have to spend a week getting people charged up figuring out some communications, who are the people we have to go to to get this message across, this, that and the other. Tiger Woods doesn’t have to do any of that. Tiger Woods, all he has to do is issue a little statement, and his name is on it, Tiger Woods, everybody in the world knows about it. And to me, that’s real power. That is real power.”

And when asked about how much more difficult a job it would have been without Tiger, Finchem channeled his inner Captain Obvious and said, “It would have been a much more difficult job.”

You don’t say? Give Finchem a gold watch on the way out the door for a job well done and I’m OK if you want to let him continue as a board member of The First Tee.

That much was evident with the news that former PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will join Tiger Woods and Marion Hollins in the next class to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The announcement was greeted with griping that was as predictable as it is tedious, an exercise in collective eye-rolling intended to suggest not only that Finchem is undeserving but that his inclusion dilutes the Hall’s credibility.

That argument is familiar and has been leveled against more deserving targets who got a call to the Hall, like George H.W. Bush, Bing Crosby or Bob Hope. But there’s no sound basis for raising it against Finchem.

There is a sentiment that says lockers in St. Augustine ought to be earned for exploits on the field of play, and the only field of play that matters is a golf course. Not a boardroom or a factory or a production trailer or a media center. It’s an absolutist position that would disqualify plenty of current Hall of Famers.

Like C.B. Macdonald or Pete Dye, who only designed those fields of play,

Like Karsten Solheim, who innovated the instruments used on those fields.

Like Dan Jenkins or Herb Graffis, whose only mastery was of a typewriter on the sidelines.

The reality is that most sports halls of fame are intended to acknowledge not just quantifiable achievement but immeasurable impact. Charlie Sifford wasn’t inducted for his two PGA Tour victories but for what his presence, courage and determination symbolized in golf’s ugliest era. Frank Chirkinian wasn’t given a locker to store his Emmy awards, but because the legendary CBS producer’s influence far exceeded that of most players he put on living room TVs.

It’s why the football and tennis Halls have “contributor” categories to enshrine non-players, and it’s why the golf Hall is welcoming Finchem, just as it did his predecessor Deane Beman, Augusta National’s Billy Payne and the European Tour’s Ken Schofield before him.

This is hardly to say Finchem is beyond criticism. He forged a colorless culture at Tour HQ and enforced a level of secrecy around disciplinary proceedings and drug testing that would have been envied in Pyongyang. But it can’t be argued that he didn’t leave the Tour in a considerably better place than he found it.

When he took over as commissioner in 1994, total prize money on Tour was $56.4 million. Toss in the Champions and then-Web.com Tours and the fund was just over $90 million. This season the Tour’s prize money is nearing $400 million, before bonuses at least until COVID-19 upended things. He created the oft-maligned World Golf Championship events, which if nothing else helped temper Greg Norman’s plans for world domination, and the FedEx Cup playoff system 13 years ago.

It’s a popular though specious suggestion that Finchem owes his success to coat-tailing on Tiger Woods. Sure, he was dealt a strong hand, but he played it well for what was demanded of him. If subsisting on crumbs from Tiger’s table was sufficient to earn a spot in the Hall, then Mark Steinberg would have his own wing.

Arguing over Hall of Fame inductees is a staple of most every sport, moreso during a quarantine when we’re happy for any meat to chew on, no matter how lacking in nutrition it is. And golf’s Hall has richly deserved much of the criticism it has received over the years. The last class inducted Peggy Kirk Bell. The famed teacher was eminently worthy, but she was deserving of the honor when she was alive. She lived for 95 years, but the Hall only saw fit to induct her three years after her death. That kind of standard can’t be encouraging to others who deserve a spot and have been thus far denied, like Tom Weiskopf or Butch Harmon.

There are obvious shortcomings surrounding golf’s Hall of Fame. There are those who deserve the honor who have been overlooked and those who’ve been given a spot they didn’t merit. But whatever his failings, Tim Finchem doesn’t belong on either list.",[]

That triggered a Special Weather Statement from Environment Canada, warning of heavy rains and the possibility of flooding.

The advisory was soon upgraded to a Severe Thunderstorm Warning, as the storm unleashed torrents of rain, strong winds and frequent lighting.

As the storm neared Lake Ontario, localized rotation prompted Environment Canada to also issue a Tornado Watch, which was rescinded about 10 minutes later as the rotation weakened.

Wind gusts approaching 100 km/h were possible along the storm’s western fringes, Environment Canada said.

Videos and images shared to social media showed flooded streets and parking garages, trees knocked down and downpours reducing visibility to near zero.

As of 4 p.m., sporadic power outages were spread across the city’s western regions, according to Toronto Hydro.

“Crews are making progress with restoring power across the city,” Toronto Hydro tweeted at around 6 p.m. “Crews are focused on safety emergencies first including downed wires and trees on wires.”

And boy is it ever going to pour in Toronto this weekend.

A major rain storm on “steroids” will start overnight Friday and could leave up to 50 mm of the wet stuff by the time it’s all over Sunday night.

“A real whopper of a system,” Environment Canada’s senior climatologist David Phillips said Friday, describing the storm as “a significant event.”

“Every single conceivable weather warning and condition is part of this massive system. It’s a powerful storehouse of weather even for January,” he said. ” It’s got subtropical moisture from the gulf of Mexico just loaded with moisture and it is coming northward.”

“The question (for Toronto) is when will it turn to freezing rain? And most of the indications right now are that it will be the evening on Saturday,” Phillips added.

Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for Toronto calling it “a soaker” with “very strong southwest winds Sunday.”

The temperature, meanwhile, is expected to get up to a balmy 11C on Saturday (the record high for Jan. 11 of 11. 7C was set in 1975) before plunging to a high of 2C (still above normal) on Sunday.

The rain is expected to be continuous and heavy at times all day Saturday and into Sunday morning.

“The average we get of rain in Toronto in January would be around 25 mm,” said Phillips. “So what we’re going to get in one day, in one 24-hour period, is going to exceed what we normally get in 31 days.”

Strong southwest winds are also expected Sunday morning, especially along the Lake Ontario shoreline, with gusts up to 90 km/h.

The Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) also issued a statement Thursday saying “a flood outlook” was in effect until Sunday and “all shorelines, rivers and streams within the GTA should be considered hazardous,” and “any children or pets should be kept away from any slippery or unstable banks.”

Meanwhile, the City of Toronto sent out a press release Friday saying “Toronto Water’s storm readiness plan is in place,” and crews are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to answer flooding calls at 311.

Otherwise, residents are being asked to clear catch basins on their streets to avoid potential street and basement flooding and “move valuables from basement to shelves or upper floors, and take cleaners, paint or chemicals off the floor as not to further contaminate potential floodwater.”

They’re also being told to keep eavestroughs and downspouts clear and shovel any snow or ice away from their foundation and onto their lawn not the road.
